That is spelled t-y-r-a-n-n-y,\" said Bill Davis, one of more than two dozen opponents who spoke at the Waynesville town meeting Tuesday. \"Mandates and edicts are issued by kings and dictators.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The emergency powers indeed give the mayor sweeping, unchecked authority to impose controls on the populace, but Waynesville's state of emergency powers are no different than those of any other government entity, town officials asserted.</p><p>\"We are not doing anything out of line or out of the ordinary,\" said Alderman Chuck Dickson. \"We are adopting the identical ordinance that Haywood County adopted four years ago.\"</p><p>The town board voted 4-to-1 to pass the new emergency powers, with only Alderman Jon Feichter dissenting.</p><p>\"I think probably one of the worst times to update a state of emergency ordinance is in times like we find ourselves in now,\" Feichter said. \"My belief is let's take a breath. This isn't urgent. We need to do it, but we don't have to do it tonight.\"</p><p>The other four board members chose to forge ahead and put the issue to rest, however.</p><p>Town officials claim the old emergency powers were outdated. They focused primarily on riots and weather-related disasters \u2014 leaving out things like public health emergencies, cyber attacks, power outages or hazardous material spills.</p><p>Some speakers questioned the sweeping definition of what constitutes an emergency, however. It's one thing to enact a state of emergency when facing finite threats like storms, floods, a raging forest fire, or a dam break.</p><p>\"Those are things where you are basically running for your life,\" said Sharron Robles. \"We're told COVID has been an emergency all year long. Where's the end of this?\"</p><p>The vast majority of the crowd who turned out for the meeting don't believe the pandemic is real and fear that the government is using it as an excuse to wield unconstitutional powers over the citizenry.</p><p>\"We won't allow you to pull this power play where you give yourself a blank check because of an emergency. We reject the notion of the emergency,\" Melanie Williams said.</p><p>Other opponents questioned the notion of placing unilateral power in a single person's hands.</p><p>\"The mayor may be a trustworthy individual, but no one person should ever be able to close our businesses, mandate stricter laws concerning masks and enact curfews,\" said Joseph Thomas. \"Please reconsider and table this and do not change the language to give only the mayor all the power to shut down our town by any emergency they deem.\"</p><p>Why the rewrite?</p><p>Town officials claim the rewrite was necessary as a procedural move to square up the town's emergency powers with state statutes. The town's old emergency powers reference a state statute that has since changed and is now null.</p><p>\"What we are merely doing is aligning our own ordinance with the new state statute,\" Dickson said.</p><p>Technically, when the town declared a state of emergency last year \u2014 by imposing a curfew during a power outage in a snowstorm \u2014 it had lacked the legal authority to do so. That's because the town's emergency powers cited the now-defunct state statute.</p><p>\"Our old ordinance was adopted under a state statute that's been repealed,\" Town Manager Rob Hites said.</p><p>The town didn't realize it until recently, however. Town Attorney Bill Cannon inadvertently discovered it after the town board asked him to craft a local mask mandate using the town's emergency powers.</p><p>While the local mask mandate was dropped following public outcry, the issue over the emergency powers still lingered.</p><p>Until it was fixed, the town technically had no authority to issue a state of emergency, which could be a problem heading into winter.</p><p>Done deal</p><p>Feichter, the lone board member to vote against the new powers, said the town has operated for years under defunct state of emergency powers and could go a little longer in order to digest the public input made during the meeting.</p><p>\"I understand the need to update the ordinance in order to bring it in line with the state statute, however, I believe there are changes we could make to the proposed ordinance that would allay some of the concerns of those who have spoken here tonight.\"</p><p>\"If you would like to suggest some changes, I would be glad to consider those,\" Dickson replied.</p><p>Feichter said he didn't have suggestions on the spot but it was worth taking a look at to see if there were any caveats that could be inserted.</p><p>As the board called for a vote, those in the audience began shouting in protest.</p><p>\"We had a time for public comment, and any other comments from the audience are out of line,\" Dickson said.</p><p>The crowd continued to speak out as Mayor Gary Caldwell called for a vote, however.</p><p>\"Shame on you and you and you and you,\" said Williams, pointing her finger at each of the four town board members who voted for it. \"You guys are ridiculous. It is going to be something your families are ashamed of for generations.\"</p><p>Those in attendance said they wouldn't recognize the authority of the town should it choose to exercise emergency powers.</p><p>\"If we chose to leave fearlessly, that's our choice. You cannot infringe your will upon us,\" said Stephinie Parsons.</p><p>___ (c)2020 The Mountaineer (Waynesville, N.C.)

This article highlights events from July to December. The first installment appeared in the Dec. 29 issue.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><br/>The second half of 2021 was off to a sad start when an elementary school was destroyed by fire, and there were still COVID-19-related challenges to be faced in the St. John Valley. However, there was plenty of good news to report throughout the year. As always seems to be the way of northern Maine residents, people stepped up time and time again to help one another and make positive things happen in their communities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><br/>July</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><br/>Makayla Martin of St. Francis was in a snowmobile crash in January that may have just saved her life. The crash left her with a concussion and neck pain so doctor's at Northern Maine Medical Center ran additional tests to determine the extent of her injuries and found a cancerous mass on her thyroid.</p><p><br/>Wallagrass held its annual \u00c2\u00a0Pondfest\u00c2\u00a0this year and saw a large turnout raising $6,000 toward the construction of a local veterans monument. Pondfest took place annually for six years each summer through 2019. The popular Pondfest celebration returned July 3 after a hiatus last summer due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p><br/>Musicians across Aroostook County came together in a memorial concert\u00c2\u00a0held for Madawaska music legend Jesse Waltman Jr. who died in April 2020 after a three-year battle with lung cancer.</p><p><br/>After more than three decades of law enforcement service, Fort Kent Police Chief Tom Pelletier \u00c2\u00a0retired from the profession. Pelletier cited state and federal efforts to rescind qualified immunity for police officers and proposals to decriminalize all drugs as factors in his decision.</p><p><br/>Celebrated farmer Al Cyr passed away this year in the very senior living center he had built.\u00c2\u00a0Cyr served on the Aroostook County Farm Bureau, Credit Farm Services and the Agricultural Bargaining Council. Cyr left the potato farming industry in the early 1970s and began a new venture -- building, renovating and administering nursing homes.</p><p><br/>Concerned about the rise in local crime and drug use, more than 60 residents of two small St. John Valley towns met in a gymnasium to talk with law enforcement about the recent rise of criminal activity\u00c2\u00a0in the area.</p><p><br/>Reynold Hebert retired\u00c2\u00a0from the Fort Kent Public Works Department after 43 years of service. Public works vehicles paraded through town in honor of Hebert, and surprised him by traveling past his South Perley Brook Road home.</p><p><br/>Residents of Frenchville mourned the loss of Dr. Levesque Elementary School as it became engulfed in flames. The school, built in 1951, caught fire just before 7a.m. on July 25, which devastated one of its two wings. The fire was likely electrical and had started between the wall of the nurse's office and gymnasium.</p><p><br/>Fern Desjardins was elected to the board of directors of the National Association of State Boards of Education in 2019 where she currently serves as chair of the Public Education Positions Committee and has recently been named chair of the Maine State Board of Education.</p><p><br/>August</p><p><br/>Turnover\u00c2\u00a0in Van Buren had Recreation director Tosha Martin and library director Justin Martin stepping down from their positions this August. At the same time, Presque Isle firefighter and paramedic Kaitlyn Beil stepped up to take over the ambulance department directorship.</p><p><br/>In response to the Dr. Levesque Elementary School fire, more than 3,000 people followed the school's Facebook page where Amazon wish lists\u00c2\u00a0had been created by educators. People from all over the country funded the lists, and included personal donations of everything from money to classroom supplies and outdoor winter clothing for students to wear during recess.</p><p><br/>A waste water treatment facility that serves two St. John Valley towns received much needed repairs thanks to a $758,000 Northern Border Regional Commission grant. Surface discharge of untreated sewage due to an overflow revealed a need for a costly project to replace a section of sewer force main piping. The current piping is 4 inches in diameter, and the new piping will be 6 inches in diameter to better accommodate waste water flows.</p><p><br/>A forest fire was quickly extinguished in St. Francis on Monday, Aug. 9. Firefighters from St. Francis Fire Department, Fort Kent Fire Department and Maine Forest Service thwarted the fire that began at around 8 p.m. and burned more than an acre of land on the back settlement in town.</p><p><br/>Madawaska acquired a new ambulance\u00c2\u00a0replacing a 2010 unit that was becoming unusable after years of wear and tear, and damage from road salt. The ambulance department bought the truck on a three-year lease-to-own program using money from the ambulance reserve account, which is funded by the department's revenues.</p><p><br/>Valley Unified schools offered vaccine clinics\u00c2\u00a0for staff and students ahead of the new school year. The first round of vaccine clinics took place Aug. 23 and 24, with additional clinics on Sept. 13 and 14.</p><p><br/>Van Buren held an emergency meeting\u00c2\u00a0where a mask mandate for the schools was unanimously voted in. Van Buren was not set up for hybrid learning so the school board was concerned that more families would pull their children out of schools due to the mandate.</p><p><br/>At a town meeting in Fort Kent, council members unanimously voted for former Fort Kent Police Department Officer Michael DeLena\u00c2\u00a0to replace former Chief Tom Pelletier, who retired from law enforcement earlier in the month.</p><p><br/>The town of Frenchville received a $51,716.03 Assistance to Firefighters Grant\u00c2\u00a0from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The grant money will be used to purchase new protective equipment such as boots, turnout gear and helmets for the firefighters. Remaining funds will be spent to replace all fire truck hoses.</p><p><br/>September</p><p><br/>A Fort Kent man bought his childhood home to save it from demolition\u00c2\u00a0as part of University of Maine at Fort Kent's plan to build a new welcome center. The home has been relocated to the lot adjacent to the man's current residence.</p><p><br/>Local man, Dennis Kennedy, was making his way to his former home in South Carolina when he ran into a high-speed chase on I-295. The suspect got his vehicle stuck on a grassy shoulder and began to flee. Kennedy and another bystander put their lives in danger to come to the aid of the trooper attempting the arrest. Kennedy has since earned an MSP honor\u00c2\u00a0for his role in the suspect's takedown.</p><p><br/>St. Mary's Church in Eagle Lake has never had a steeple, but at one time did have a cross atop the building that was eventually lost to rot from leaking rain water. Former Grand Knight with the Knights of Columbus Council 8729 out of Eagle Lake, Rosaire Daigle, helped raise $9,000 to put a steeple atop the sacred building.</p><p><br/>Night work began on the new international bridge between Edmunston, New Brunswick, and Madawaska. The $97 million project is a collaboration between the U.S. contractors Reed &amp; Reed and New Brunswick-based subcontractors Greenfield Construction. The Maine Department of Transportation and New Brunswick Department of Transportation and Infrastructure are also collaborating on the project.</p><p><br/>The St. Francis Historical Society was presented with the 2020 Spirit of America Award from the Spirit of America Foundation. The award honors excellent volunteerism and values organizations that give back to their communities. \u00c2\u00a0</p><p><br/>University of Maine at Fort Kent \u00c2\u00a0Enrollment and Advancement Center\u00c2\u00a0was unveiled to the public at a ribbon-cutting ceremony. Located on the east side of Pleasant Street, the welcome center is the main face of the university and unites two sections of campus buildings located on either side of the street.</p><p><br/>As with many police agencies throughout the state and country, Fort Kent Police Department has struggled to attract and retain officers in recent years. Now, FKPD is near full staff for officers with new hires and the advancement of one officer.</p><p><br/>One of the last chances for Madawaska residents to gather together outside before winter forces everyone indoors for the season, the beautification committee put together Fall Fest\u00c2\u00a0which was massively embraced by the community. The empty Kmart parking lot hadn't seen this much activity in years with approximately 29 vendors, live music, and a bake-sale fundraiser for the Madawaska High School Senior Class.</p><p><br/>October</p><p><br/>On a Sunday afternoon in 1966, Ubald Theriault\u00c2\u00a0went missing from his Lille residence, never to be seen again. The 79-year-old man's disappearance captured the attention of St. John Valley residents who enjoyed a virtually crime free existence in 1966. More than half a century after Theriault went missing, some who never even met him still wonder about his fate.\u00c2\u00a0</p><p><br/>The SAD 27 school board was the first in Aroostook County to consider\u00c2\u00a0whether district employees should be paid incentive money to get vaccinated against COVID-19.</p><p><br/>Young skier \u00e2\u20ac\u2039\u00e2\u20ac\u2039Clyde Overton, then 4 years old, received national recognition\u00c2\u00a0as a video of him skiing at Lonesome Pine Trails was featured on the long-running ABC television program America's Funniest Home Videos.</p><p><br/>National Honor Society students from Wisdom Middle/High School participated in a community service\u00c2\u00a0project to help a Frenchville couple prepare for the winter months by hauling wood into their cellar. The helpful students moved four cords of wood, including a half-cord they brought to the couple's elderly neighbor.</p><p><br/>Hudson Labbe of Eagle Lake, a Fort Kent Community High School honor student and member of Boy Scout Troop 189 achieved the rank\u00c2\u00a0of Eagle Scout. Labbe painted interactive gameboards on the Fort Kent Elementary School pavement so that young students could maintain social distancing while still engaging in interactive play during school recess times.</p><p><br/>November</p><p><br/>More than two dozen members of the public, many of them parents of district students, attended a meeting\u00c2\u00a0of the SAD 27 Board of Directors to encourage overturning a district-wide face mask mandate for staff and students. The attempt failed.</p><p><br/>A St. John Vianney Wreath Remembrance Project provided people an opportunity\u00c2\u00a0to honor their deceased loved ones while also raising funds for the parish churches.</p><p><br/>Fort Kent Police Department received\u00c2\u00a0three federal grants to increase traffic safety and enforcement. Maine Bureau of Highway Safety and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration approved the grant money for three traffic safety campaigns focused on impaired, distracted and unrestrained driving.</p><p><br/>Volunteer firefighters with Van Buren Fire Department responded\u00c2\u00a0to a call at a home that was damaged when a portable electric space heater ignited some nearby combustible materials in a bedroom. The Red Cross was called to assist the resident of the home as the dwelling was rendered uninhabitable.</p><p><br/>Northern Maine Medical Center announced\u00c2\u00a0that due to an increase in demand for COVID-19 testing, the hospital's swab clinic would suspend such testing for people needing it for travel purposes. The hospital continued to test symptomatic patients or those who had been identified as close contacts of people through contact tracing.</p><p><br/>The Fort Kent Town Council recognized\u00c2\u00a0nine volunteer firefighters who donated their time and skills to improve the fire station, saving taxpayers thousands of dollars in the process. The firefighters performed upgrades to the station heating system replacing the original system with heat pumps and upgraded to a heat pump-style hot water heater.</p><p><br/>More than 30 volunteers cooked\u00c2\u00a0up 300 pounds of turkey, 200 pounds of potatoes and 375 bread rolls which they distributed for free to people on Thanksgiving. All Things Become New of Eagle Lake spearheaded the event, which served 350 people.</p><p><br/>December</p><p><br/>Dean Gendreau was named director\u00c2\u00a0of the Van Buren Parks and Recreation Department. He previously served as recreation director in Madawaska, Easton and Old Saybrook, Connecticut.</p><p><br/>The St. John Valley saw a dramatic rise\u00c2\u00a0in COVID-19 cases. The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention designated Fort Kent Elementary School to be in outbreak status and Van Buren District School moved to remote learning because of staff members infected or in quarantine.</p><p><br/>A holiday tree lighting ceremony\u00c2\u00a0at Crosswinds Residential Care in Fort Kent proved a happy and hopeful occasion for residents who last year could only greet loved ones through windows due to COVID-19.</p><p><br/>Acadians in the St. John Valley kept traditions\u00c2\u00a0alive with a Grosses T\u00c3\u00aates (big heads) class in Madawaska. The heads are a staple on the streets of Madawaska during the Acadian Festival's Tintamarre, a noisy parade involving improvised instruments and noise makers.</p><p><br/>For the third time in four months, SAD 27 board members voted\u00c2\u00a0to approve a district-wide face mask mandate as residents, and the board members themselves, remained staunchly divided on the issue.</p><p><br/>Firefighters from Van Buren and Grand Isle saved\u00c2\u00a0a Van Buren resident from the roof of their burning home. Responders rescued the person from the porch roof of the home upon arrival, as flames engulfed the second floor.</p><p><br/>A Madawaska woman brought\u00c2\u00a0Hot Mess Express, a national volunteer-based group that helps parents who struggle with daily tasks, to Aroostook County. Group members nominate families in need and provide cleaning products, advice on organization, motivational support and even assist those families in completing household chores such as laundry, vacuuming or dishes.</p><p><br/>Fort Kent Elementary School students were accompanied by police and firefighters to shop for loved ones\u00c2\u00a0during the first Fort Kent Shop With a First Responder event.

There are 113 days left in the year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today\u2019s Highlight in History:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Sept. 9, 1776, the second Continental Congress made the term \u201cUnited States\u201d official, replacing \u201cUnited Colonies.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On this date:</p><p>In 1543, Mary Stuart was crowned Queen of Scots at Stirling Castle, nine months after she was born.</p><p>In 1850, California became the 31st state of the union.</p><p>In 1942, during World War II, a Japanese plane launched from a submarine off the Oregon coast dropped a pair of incendiary bombs in a failed attempt at igniting a massive forest fire; it was the first aerial bombing of the U.S. mainland by a foreign power.</p><p>In 1948, the People\u2019s Democratic Republic of Korea (North Korea) was declared.</p><p>In 1956, Elvis Presley made the first of three appearances on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show.\u201d</p><p>In 1971, prisoners seized control of the maximum-security Attica Correctional Facility near Buffalo, New York, beginning a siege that ended up claiming 43 lives.</p><p>In 1986, Frank Reed, director of a private school in Lebanon, was taken hostage; he was released 44 months later.</p><p>In 1991, boxer Mike Tyson was indicted in Indianapolis on a charge of raping Desiree Washington, a beauty pageant contestant. (Tyson was convicted and ended up serving three years of a six-year prison sentence.)</p><p>In 2005, Federal Emergency Management Agency Director Michael Brown, the principal target of harsh criticism of the Bush administration\u2019s response to Hurricane Katrina, was relieved of his onsite command.</p><p>In 2013, four days of vehicular gridlock began near the George Washington Bridge when two of three approach lanes from Fort Lee, New Jersey, were blocked off; the traffic jam was later blamed on loyalists to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie over the refusal of Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich (SAHK\u2019-oh-lich) to endorse Christie for re-election. (Two political insiders were convicted for their roles in the closure; a unanimous Supreme Court later threw out the convictions. Christie denied any prior knowledge of the lane closures, but the episode helped derail his 2016 presidential bid.)</p><p>In 2014, Apple unveiled its long-anticipated smartwatch as well as the next generation of its iPhone.</p><p>In 2016, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, speaking at an LGBT fundraiser in New York City, described half of Republican Donald Trump\u2019s supporters as \u201ca basket of deplorables,\u201d a characterization for which she would end up expressing regret.</p><p>Ten years ago: A natural gas pipeline explosion killed eight people and destroyed dozens of homes in the San Francisco suburb of San Bruno, California. Iran said it would free Sarah Shourd, one of three American hikers held for more than 13 months on spying accusations, as an act of clemency to mark the end of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. (Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal were sentenced in August 2011 to eight years in prison, but were released the following month.)</p><p>Five years ago: Queen Elizabeth II became the longest reigning monarch in British history, serving as sovereign for 23,226 days (about 63 years and 7 months), according to Buckingham Palace, surpassing Queen Victoria, her great-great-grandmother. New York became the first U.S. city to require salt warnings on chain-restaurant menus.</p><p>One year ago: Coast Guard rescuers pulled four trapped South Korean crew members alive from a cargo ship, more than a day after the ship overturned as it left a port in Brunswick, Georgia. President Donald Trump said peace talks with the Taliban were now \u201cdead,\u201d two days after he abruptly canceled a secret meeting he had arranged with Taliban and Afghan leaders. The acting chief scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the agency had likely violated its scientific integrity rules by publicly chastising a weather office that had contradicted Trump concerning a hurricane threat to Alabama.</p><p>Today\u2019s Birthdays: Actor Topol is 85.

Chris Christie over the refusal of Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich (SAHK\u2019-oh-lich) to endorse Christie for re-election. (Two political insiders were convicted for their roles in the closure; a unanimous Supreme Court later threw out the convictions. Christie denied any prior knowledge of the lane closures, but the episode helped derail his 2016 presidential bid.)</p><p>In 2014, Apple unveiled its long-anticipated smartwatch as well as the next generation of its iPhone.</p><p>In 2016, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, speaking at an LGBT fundraiser in New York City, described half of Republican Donald Trump\u2019s supporters as \u201ca basket of deplorables,\u201d a characterization for which she would end up expressing regret.</p><p>Ten years ago: A natural gas pipeline explosion killed eight people and destroyed dozens of homes in the San Francisco suburb of San Bruno, California. Iran said it would free Sarah Shourd, one of three American hikers held for more than 13 months on spying accusations, as an act of clemency to mark the end of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. (Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal were sentenced in August 2011 to eight years in prison, but were released the following month.)</p><p>Five years ago: Queen Elizabeth II became the longest reigning monarch in British history, serving as sovereign for 23,226 days (about 63 years and 7 months), according to Buckingham Palace, surpassing Queen Victoria, her great-great-grandmother. New York became the first U.S. city to require salt warnings on chain-restaurant menus.</p><p>One year ago: Coast Guard rescuers pulled four trapped South Korean crew members alive from a cargo ship, more than a day after the ship overturned as it left a port in Brunswick, Georgia. President Donald Trump said peace talks with the Taliban were now \u201cdead,\u201d two days after he abruptly canceled a secret meeting he had arranged with Taliban and Afghan leaders. The acting chief scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the agency had likely violated its scientific integrity rules by publicly chastising a weather office that had contradicted Trump concerning a hurricane threat to Alabama.</p><p>Today\u2019s Birthdays: Actor Topol is 85.

Focus on the first wave that is still with us, says Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and policy at University of Minnesota and regent's professor of public health.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Featured updates: COVID-19</p><p>Track the evolving situation with the AMA's library of the most up-to-date resources from JAMA, CDC and WHO.</p><p>Read the Latest</p><p>There may never be a second wave, just a continuous stream of infection wherever individuals let down their guard. The first wave is complicated and confusing and not overand may not end until a vaccine is successfully distributed, Dr. Osterholm told JAMA editor-in-chief Howard Bauchner, MD, on the \"Conversations with Dr. Bauchner\" video podcast.</p><p>The future of this pandemic is hard to predict, and even the present is still murky, he said amid major surges in COVID-19 case counts in California, Texas, Arizona, Florida and many other states south of the Mason-Dixon line.</p><p>\"I know less about this virus today then I did six weeks ago. The more we learn, the more humble we need to be about what it means,\" Dr. Osterholm said.</p><p>Dr. Osterholm and his colleagues began studying the path of the COVID-19 virus in December 2019, before it left China and at the time proposed three scenarios of its evolutionnone of which turned out to be correct. They had suggested the virus could be a \"slow steady burn,\" of regular courses of infection, \"hills and valleys\" of on and off infection, or the \"influenza pandemic\" model which comes in waves.</p><p>Related Coverage</p><p>What physicians can do to boost COVID-19 contact-tracing efforts</p><p>While the influenza pandemic scenario was the most popular with some researchers, Dr. Osterholm said recent history has dismissed it.</p><p>\"It's more like hills and valleys\" around the country, with areas growing and others shrinking, he said. \"I liken it more to a forest fire, wherever there is wood to burn, i.e. susceptible humans, it will find them.\"</p><p>Stay up to speed on the fast-moving pandemic with the AMA's COVID-19 resource center, which offers a library of the most up-to-date resources from JAMA Networka\u201ecents, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health Organization. Also check out the JAMA Network COVID-19 resource center.</p><p>Leaky bucket virus</p><p>But no one is sure about the future. \"If you wonder what's going to happen, just wait two weeks and I will tell you how it is going to be different than what I thought today,\" he said. \"This virus is what I call a 'leaky bucket virus.' If there is a micro leak, it is going to get out. And it is going to continue transmitting.\"</p><p>Or \"in the end it will be like one river of virus flowing down stream,\" he said.</p><p>A vaccine would dam the river, but how effective can a vaccine be and how durable will the immunity be that it provides?</p><p>\"Immunity with coronavirus is a very complicated issue. But my big concern is that we are still not ready to deliver the vaccine in a meaningful way. Everyone is going to want it,\" he said.</p><p>However, pending new research on treatments and vaccines, there isn't much new that public health officials can do to continue to shrink the number of cases around the United States, Dr. Osterholm argued. And not every protective technique works as well as experts hope. Physical distancing and face coverings are still helpful but must be used properly.</p><p>Related Coverage</p><p>As COVID-19 cases rise, no time to let guard down on prevention</p><p>\"Distancing, distancing, distancing is really the only focus we have,\" he said. Masks are also still a valuable tool in protecting individuals from infection, but the value of masks vary. \"An N95 mask, a surgical mask and a cloth face covering are not all the same in the protection they provide.\"</p><p>And cloth face coverings only help if used properly. His recent review of media photography indicates that in 25% of images, masks are not worn properly, leaving the nose uncovered, creating gaps where the virus can exist and enter.</p><p>\"It's like fixing three of your five screen doors on your submarine,\" he said.</p><p>Subscribe to the \"Conversations with Dr. Bauchner\" podcast. Each week, he interviews leading researchers and thinkers in health care about their recent JAMA articles.

Stars are rather patient. They can live for billions of years, and they typically make slow transitions sometimes over many millions of years between the different stages of their lives. </p><p>So when a previously typical star's behavior rapidly changes in a few decades, astronomers take note and get to work. Such is the case with a star known as SAO 244567, which lies at the center of Hen 3-1357, commonly known as the Stingray Nebula. The Stingray Nebula is a planetary nebula[1] an expanse of material sloughed off from a star as it enters a new phase of old age and then heated by that same star into colorful displays that can last for up to a million years. The tiny Stingray Nebula unexpectedly appeared in the 1980s and scientists first imaged it in the 1990s using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope[2]. When astronomers analyzed a more recent image of the nebula which Hubble took in 2016, they found the unexpected change. If dimming continues at current rates, in 20 or 30 years the Stingray Nebula will be barely perceptible, and was likely already fading when Hubble obtained the first clear images of it in 1996, says Bruce Balick, an emeritus professor of astronomy at the University of Washington and lead author of the paper, which will appear in the Astrophysical Journal. 'This is an unprecedented departure from typical behavior for a planetary nebula,' Balick says. 'Over time, we would expect it to imperceptibly brighten and expand, which could easily go unnoticed in a century or more. But here we're seeing the Stingray Nebula fade significantly in an incredibly compressed time frame of just 20 years. Moreover, its brightest inner structure has contracted not expanded as the nebula fades.'Stingray Nebula does a speedy fadePlanetary nebulae form after most stars, including stars like our own sun, swell into red giants as they exhaust hydrogen fuel. At the end of the red giant phase, the star then expels large amounts of its outer material as it gradually over the course of a million years transforms into a small, compact white dwarf. The sloughed-off material expands outward for several thousand years while the star heats the material, which eventually becomes ionized and glows. Balick and his coauthors, Martn Guerrero at the Institute of Astrophysics of Andalusia in Spain and Gerardo Ramos-Larios at the University of Guadalajara in Mexico, compared Hubble images of the Stingray Nebula taken in 1996 and 2016. Hen 3-1357 changed shape markedly over 20 years, losing the sharp, sloping edges that gave the Stingray Nebula its name. Its colors have faded overall and once-prominent blue expanses of gas near its center are largely gone. 'Even so, we were amazed when the Hubble images revealed how quickly the nebula was fading. It took a month of work to believe it.' 'In a planetary nebula, the star is really the center of all the activity,' Balick says. 'The material around it is directly responsive to the energy from its parent star.' The team analyzed light spectra from Hen 3-1357 emitted by chemical elements in the nebula. Emission levels of hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen all dropped between 1996 and 2016, particularly oxygen[3], which dropped by a factor of 900. The resulting fade in color and the nebula's change in shape are likely connected to the cooling of its parent star from a peak of about 107,500 degrees Fahrenheit in 2002 to just under 90,000 degrees Fahrenheit in 2015 which means it is giving off less ultraviolet ionizing radiation that heats the expelled gas and makes it glow. 'Like a doused forest fire, the smoke wanes more slowly than the flames that created it,' Balick says. 'Even so, we were amazed when the Hubble images revealed how quickly the nebula was fading. It took a month of work to believe it.'Running out of timeAstronomers have yet to understand why SAO 244567 made the Stingray Nebula light up and then fade almost as quickly. One theory, posited by a team led by Nicole Reindl at the University of Potsdam, is that the star underwent a brief burst of fresh helium fusion around its core, which stirred up its outer layers and caused its surface to both shrink and heat. If so, then as its outer layers settle back down, the star may return to a more typical transition from red giant to white dwarf.[4] Only future observations of the star and its nebula can confirm this. 'Unfortunately, the best tool to follow future changes in the Stingray Nebula, the Hubble Space Telescope[5], is near the end of its life as well,' Balick says. 'We can hope, but the odds aren't good for Hubble's survival as its three remaining gyroscopes start to fail. It's a good race to the finish.' The Hubble Space Telescope is an international partnership between NASA and the European Space Agency, or ESA, and managed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. The Space Telescope Science Institute is responsible for Hubble science operations. Funding for the research also came from the European Union and the National Council of Science and Technology in Mexico.

Though the statewide prohibition on residential brush burning ended in May, Mr. Seggos said \"fire danger still exists.\"</p><p>\"The last widespread rainfall we saw was more than a full week ago and over the last month, some parts of the state are 90 percent below normal rainfall levels,\" he said on June 23, adding that dry weather and warming temperatures have elevated the risk of fires statewide.</p><p>In the last 30 days, according to the DEC, precipitation in eastern New York and western New England has ranged from 0.5 to 3.5 inches, 15 to 90 percent below normal levels across hundreds of ZIP codes.</p><p>The DEC reports two top causes of wildfires in New York are debris burning and unsafe campfires.</p><p>During summer months, the DEC updates its statewide fire danger map weekly on its website. From Tuesday through Friday this week, the St. Lawrence and Adirondack Fire Danger Rating Areas are listed as moderate. Those areas cover St. Lawrence, Franklin, Clinton, Essex and parts of Lewis County, as well as counties farther south.</p><p>The Lake Ontario Plains area, which encompasses Watertown and Lowville at its eastern edge, and the Long Island area are currently listed at the low level.</p><p>Five ratings exist on the FDRA scale: low, moderate, high, very high and extreme. A red flag warning, a temporary warning based on the presence of a combination of temperature, wind, relative humidity, fuel or drought conditions, can be issued at any fire danger level.</p><p>On Friday, just before the weekend's heavy precipitation, responders fought a brush fire from two directions in Croghan, Lewis County. The fire was estimated to have burned 1.25 acres of land, and a DEC inspector estimated the damage could have been much worse, considering the dry conditions and that brief downpours force water to run off dry soil rather than soaking in and saturating the ground.</p><p>To the north in Colton, St. Lawrence County, a June 21 fire near the Rainbow Falls Reservoir was believed to have been caused by a downed electric line after an electric transformer failed. The dry grassy edge of the forest, beneath the electric line off Raquette River Road, helped fuel a patchwork of ground fires that spread toward the trees, eventually engulfing one tree.</p><p>No injuries were reported from the fires in Croghan or Colton.</p><p>In Brasher, St. Lawrence County, June 20, forest rangers were called to assist Brasher-Winthrop and Helena fire departments to address a fire believed to have been caused by a private land bonfire that spread into the Brasher State Forest. The 1.3-acre fire was officially out June 22.</p><p>Forest rangers responded to a wildland fire in Norfolk, St. Lawrence County, on June 15, after a homeowner was burning brush June 14, and thought the fire was out. Forest rangers said the fire quickly burned 0.5 acres, aided by light winds, near-drought conditions and brush fuel. By June 16, rangers had put out the fire completely.</p><p>On June 22, forest rangers responded to a forest fire near Chub Lake in Fowler, St. Lawrence County. Rangers arrived at about 6 p.m. to find roughly 4.5 acres of active flames and a widespread ground fire. By the next day, the fire grew to 5 acres. Rangers said they constructed a fire line around area to prevent further growth and constructed a hose lay with lateral lines to suppress the fire. On June 24, more hot spots were suppressed. The fire remains on patrol status.</p><p>A St. Lawrence County-wide burn ban took effect Saturday and extends through 6 p.m. July 25.</p><p>DEC's guidelines on safely burning wood or brush are as follows:</p><p>Never burn on a windy day.</p><p>Check and obey all local laws and ordinances.</p><p>Burn early in the morning when humidity is high and winds are low.</p><p>Clear all flammable material for a distance of 10 to 15 feet around the fire.</p><p>Keep piles to be burned small, adding small quantities of material as burning progresses.</p><p>Always have a garden hose, shovel, water bucket or other means to extinguish the fire close at hand.</p><p>When done, drown the fire with water, making sure all materials, embers and coals are wet.</p><p>___ (c)2020 Watertown Daily Times (Watertown, N.Y.)

John Sedgwick said when urged to take cover from Confederate sharpshooters. \"They couldn't hit an elephant at this distance,\" he replied, and then fell dead from a rifle shot.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mike Pence is guilty of a similar miscalculation. Writing in The Wall Street Journal on June 16, he boasted of the administration's response to the coronavirus pandemic: \"We are winning the fight against the invisible enemy.\"</p><p>He spiked the football short of the goal line. On Thursday, the United States had 39,327 new cases of the virus, a record. The Wall Street Journal reported that 33 states \"had a seven-day average of new cases on Tuesday that was higher than their 14-day average\"   compared with 21 states at the beginning of June.</p><p>\"All 50 states have begun to reopen in a safe and responsible manner,\" Pence claimed. Not quite. Seven states   Arizona, Arkansas, California, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas   set new daily records for hospitalizations on Tuesday, according to The Washington Post.</p><p>Some of these states, notably Texas and Arizona, have been aggressive in reopening. But faced with this surge, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott announced he would roll back some of his reopening. It was as if the defenders of the Alamo had decided to pack up and flee.</p><p>The home of Walt Disney World   \"The Most Magical Place on Earth\"   is finding that magic doesn't kill the virus. Florida, which has been in a hurry to return to normal, set a record Wednesday with 5,508 new cases   only to report a staggering 8,942 Friday. But it is charging ahead with its reopening.</p><p>What has Donald Trump done lately? He said he was not worried about holding an indoor rally in Tulsa during the pandemic. \"It's dying out,\" he claimed. Thousands of supporters showed up, most without masks, even as Oklahoma was reporting record numbers of new cases. He said he told his aides to \"slow the testing down\" so the number of new cases would be lower.</p><p>He did another rally in Phoenix, where 3,000 attendees largely ignored the local mandate that they wear masks. \"It's going away,\" Trump assured them.</p><p>Not in Arizona, though. On Thursday, the state broke records for new cases, hospitalizations and use of ventilators. \"Arizona has lost control of the epidemic,\" reported PolicyLab at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.</p><p>Florida, PolicyLab had said earlier, \"has all the makings of the next large epicenter\" of the pandemic. Seeing a forest fire, Trump fetches a can of gasoline. The president insisted on moving the August Republican National Convention to Jacksonville so he can accept the nomination before cheering delegates packed into a big venue.</p><p>The administration is also ending federal funding of some community-based testing sites, a decision that even GOP Sens. Ted Cruz and John Cornyn of Texas criticized.</p><p>He spurned Charlotte, the original site, because of North Carolina's restrictions. \"We can't do social distancing,\" he informed Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel insists that in holding the convention, the party will \"put the safety of convention-goers first and foremost.\"</p><p>No, it won't. If that were the case, it would tell them to stay home rather than risk contracting a dangerous disease to satisfy the president's vanity.</p><p>History will record that under Trump's watch, the United States became the leader of the world   in COVID-19 infections. As of June 24, the U.S., which has 330 million people, has been averaging nearly eight times as many new cases as the European Union, whose population is 445 million.</p><p>Trump has always been on the side of governors who favor fewer restrictions rather than more. When armed protesters rallied in Lansing against Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's stay-at-home order, he sided with the protesters. She held firm, and since then, Michigan has seen a big drop in new cases.</p><p>But Trump and his followers have no patience with the inconveniences required to limit the pandemic. They are determined to move on and return to life as it used to be.</p><p>You can't blame anyone for yearning to escape all the aggravations and deprivations of our current predicament. But here's the thing about the virus: It doesn't sleep. It never runs out of patience. And it won't stop killing.</p><p>Steve Chapman blogs at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/chapman\">http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/chapman</url>.

On an adjusted basis, the company's first-quarter 2022 earnings were $924 million, or $2.91 per diluted share, compared to $900 million, or $2.95 per diluted share, in 2021.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"At Sempra, we understand the importance of energy security as a critical part of the transition to a lower-carbon future. That is why our investments\u00a0in North American\u00a0energy networks are designed to improve the safety and reliability of our services\u00a0for\u00a0the benefit of our customers\u00a0and the communities we serve,\" said Jeffrey W. Martin, chairman and chief executive officer of Sempra. \"Also, as first quarter\u00a0results demonstrate, our track record of operational excellence, commitment to safety and disciplined capital allocation creates\u00a0the opportunity to deliver another strong year of financial performance.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The reported financial results reflect certain significant items as described on an after-tax basis in the following table of GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America) earnings, reconciled to adjusted earnings, for the first quarter of 2022 and 2021.</p><p>Sempra California</p><p>During the quarter, San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. (SDG&amp;E) and the U.S. Forest Service announced the completion of the Cleveland National Forest fire hardening and safety project, which is helping to reinforce the San Diego region's community fire safety and electric system hardening efforts. The $700 million project was part of a decade-long collaboration with local, state and federal agencies to improve the fire resistance of electric infrastructure throughout approximately 880 square miles of SDG&amp;E's service territory.</p><p>Last month, SDG&amp;E and Southern California Gas Co. (SoCalGas) filed their 2023 cost of capital applications to update their cost of capital for 2023 through 2025 and expect a decision later this year. Later this month, both utilities expect to file their general rate cases with the California Public Utilities Commission to update their authorized revenue requirements for 2024 through 2027.</p><p>Sempra Texas</p><p>In Texas, Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC (Oncor) is executing on its five-year capital plan by expanding and modernizing the transmission and distribution infrastructure within its service territory to support strong demographic growth. In the first quarter, Oncor recorded a 78% increase in new transmission point of interconnection requests compared to the prior year. Additionally, during the quarter, Oncor connected approximately 16,000 premises to the grid and upgraded approximately 380 miles of power lines as a result of continued growth in its service territory.</p><p>In 2021, the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) approved a request to extend Oncor's rate case filing deadline to June of 2022. Oncor plans to file its rate case with the PUCT\u00a0later this month.</p><p>Sempra Infrastructure\u00a0</p><p>Sempra Infrastructure is working to expand its North American infrastructure network through the development of its liquefied natural gas (LNG) portfolio that is uniquely positioned to serve customers in both the Pacific and Atlantic markets. The company also is continuing to support growing integration of North American energy markets through its U.S.-Mexico cross-border infrastructure business.</p><p>To support its growth, the company took steps to advance the development of its Cameron LNG Phase 2 expansion project with its partners at the Cameron LNG joint venture. These include a non-binding Heads of Agreement, which provides the commercial framework for the expansion of the facility by adding a fourth LNG train and also increasing the production capacity of the existing three trains through debottlenecking activities. Furthermore, the company and Cameron LNG entered into a project development agreement, which provides for the management and funding of the ongoing development work that is necessary to prepare for a final investment decision. Concurrent with these activities, Cameron LNG is also conducting a competitive Front-End Engineering Design process. This development work is targeted to be completed in the summer of 2023 and the company expects to be in a position to make a final investment decision thereafter.</p><p>In March, the company announced a non-binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) with TotalEnergies for the company's Vista Pac\u00edfico LNG project under development in Mexico. The referenced MOU for the Vista Pac\u00edfico project contemplates TotalEnergies contracting for approximately one-third of the long-term export production, as well as TotalEnergies' participation as a minority equity investor in the project.</p><p>Sempra expects to close the sale of a non-controlling 10% interest in Sempra Infrastructure Partners to a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) for $1.785 billion in cash in the second quarter, subject to customary closing adjustments and conditions. Upon closing, Sempra will own a 70% controlling interest in Sempra Infrastructure Partners.</p><p>Sustainable Business Practices</p><p>Sempra's focus on sustainability is central to its corporate strategy with an unwavering focus on safety, resilience, energy security and climate security. Sempra's newly published 2021 Corporate Sustainability Report highlights the company's commitment to sustainable business practices, including its proactive management of environmental, social and governance risks and opportunities across its three growth platforms. These practices include aligning the company's portfolio with long-term macroeconomic, market and policy trends, strengthening operational excellence by enhancing safety, climate resilience and affordability, and capturing new investments in infrastructure that support increasingly diversified and cleaner forms of energy.</p><p>Earnings Guidance</p><p>Sempra is updating its full-year 2022 GAAP earnings per common share (EPS) guidance range to $7.11 to $7.71, affirming its full-year 2022 adjusted EPS guidance range of $8.10 to $8.70, and affirming its full-year 2023 EPS guidance range of $8.60 to $9.20.</p><p>Non-GAAP Financial Measures</p><p>Non-GAAP financial measures include Sempra's adjusted earnings, adjusted EPS and adjusted EPS guidance range. See Table A for additional information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures.</p><p>Internet Broadcast</p><p>Sempra will broadcast a live discussion of its earnings results over the Internet today at 12 p.m. ET with senior management of the company.

Regilme, Jr.   </emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">    Abstract   </emphasis></p><p>The widespread use of private military and security companies (PMSCs) in United Nations peacebuilding missions often undermines the effectiveness of these missions. PMSCs tend to encourage, in unnecessary ways, what is called security risk management and promote the militarization of humanitarian efforts. They encourage humanitarian aid organizations to protect their personnel with barbed wire fences, security guards, armed convoys, and secure aid compounds, even if the security risks are relatively low. Consequently, these militarized humanitarian efforts heighten the perception of risks and intensify security measures, which create physical and psychological barriers between humanitarian aid personnel and the local communities in which they carry out their tasks. This situation undermines local ownership of peacebuilding efforts and makes them less responsive to the local communities involved in these efforts.

The key growth driver of the security as a service market are mandates to follow regulatory and data protection laws, increase in demand for cloud-based security solutions among SMEs, and high cost and risks in managing on-premises security solutions.</p><p>COVID-19 Impact on the Security as a Service Market</p><p>Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, various governments and regulatory authorities mandate both public and private organizations to embrace new practices for working remotely and maintaining social distancing. Since then, the digital ways of doing business became the new Business Continuity Plan (BCP) for various organizations.</p><p>Companies that are vying for large contracts and contracts in regulated and critical sectors are bound to have robust BCP and cyber resiliency practices in place. Organizations are also enacting various concepts such as bring your own device (BYOD) and work from home (WFH) to modernize their work cultures.</p><p>COVID-19 crisis has transformed the mentality of a company's management and board toward cybersecurity. Especially, SMBs, startups, and large enterprises, except the technology giants, were considering cybersecurity budgets as unavoidable Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) due to regulatory and compliance measures. Several digital agencies are yet to have a cybersecurity policy in place. This crisis has exposed companies to scenarios where their IPs are at the mercy and conduct of their employees, working remotely either on office laptops with zero firewall protection or personal laptops with/without free antivirus packages.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">    Security as a Service Market Dynamics   </emphasis></p><p>Driver: Increasing need for cloud-based security solutions among SMEs</p><p>Cloud implementation allows organizations to combine supplementary infrastructure technologies, such as software-defined perimeters to create robust and highly secure platforms. Governments in several countries issue special guidelines and regulations for cloud platform security, which drives the cyber security market growth across the globe. SMEs constantly seek to modernize their applications and infrastructures by moving to cloud-based platforms, such as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS). Most SMEs across verticals become a primary target for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities in their security model. Traditional appliance-based firewalls and security gateways are incapable of securing cloud-based applications from cyberattacks, such as malware, ransomware, phishing, and DNS data exfiltration.</p><p>With SMEs focusing on the adoption of cloud platforms, security administrators in these SMEs drive the need for cloud-based security as a service solutions to optimize performance and secure web and mobile applications and critical network infrastructures. Cloud-based security as a service solutions eliminates the need to install a stack of security equipment on-premises and can utilize cloud services to secure applications, data, users, and devices. The demand for cloud-based security as a service solutions is expected to increase, presenting growth opportunities in the market as SMEs plan to address data and information security concerns over the cloud.</p><p>Restraint: Organizations' doubts related to cloud-based security</p><p>Various organizations are skeptical about the overall level of adoption of cloud-based security solutions due to security reasons. According to Rights Cale's state of the cloud report 2019, security is one of the major concerns for enterprises across the globe. Despite the economic benefits of cloud-based security, organizations prefer their data and applications to be managed on-premises. IT experts who are comfortable interacting with on-premises security applications often experience more concerns while moving to cloud-based security, as they fear the loss of ownership and control.</p><p>In today's complex IT security environment, the frequency of cyberattacks is growing exponentially. There is also a belief that cloud-based standards are not yet mature to handle IT security demands. Though there is an increase in the adoption of cloud-based security solutions, the awareness of potential risks and threats associated with these solutions is low among organizations. The skepticism of organizations migrating to the cloud is restraining the growth of the security as a service market.</p><p>Opportunity: Rapid growth in Bring Your Own Device and Carry Your Own Device trends</p><p>Over the last five years, with the introduction of new platforms, BYOD policies, CYOD trends, business applications, and other technologies, the IT infrastructure has become more complex and heterogeneous. The rapid advancements in mobile computing have led to the growing popularity of the BYOD and CYOD trends in corporate environments. These trends offer work flexibility and increased employee productivity, enabling employees to access the organizational data from anywhere, anytime, with their devices. Hence, it is necessary to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the organizational data by safeguarding it from potential risks.</p><p>The BYOD policy is gaining popularity among SMEs and large enterprises and changing how users access organizational data. As the technology related to BYOD is improving, organizations are mobilizing their workforce. With the adoption of the BYOD model, organizations are subscribing to security services to protect devices, such as smartphones, tablets, desktops, and laptops, from cyber threats. With the increasing use of BYOD, enterprises need to secure devices inside office premises and secure those who have remote access to the corporate network. This factor has significantly increased spending on security services, which is expected to drive the growth of the security as a service market.</p><p>Challenge: Designing and implementation difficulties in deploying security as a service solution</p><p>Deploying the security as a service model on a new or existing infrastructure has various design and implementation challenges. The model forces IT teams in enterprises to rethink their network security to transform from the network perimeter-based approach into a user-based and application-based security model. Redesigning and redeploying web-and mobile-based applications can become exhaustive and time-consuming. Most networks are not designed keeping cybersecurity in mind and upgrading to the cybersecurity model requires an in-depth network analysis of network hardware, services, and traffic. Re-modelling networks using the security as a service model requires an accurate and clear understanding of every user, device, application, and resource.</p><p>Security as a service solution is not completely full proof. They do not address all the issues, such as Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, human errors, and misconfigured devices. The complete implementation of security as a service solution requires IT teams to disengage applications' access from network access, thus replacing firewalls based on the network-centric approach with NGFWs to secure the entire network. However, most of the security as a service solution focus on role-based user access, micro perimeters, and user analytics while ignoring vulnerabilities of resources to various cyber risks.</p><p>he services segment is estimated to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period</p><p>The security as a service market is segmented by component (solution and service), application, organization size, vertical, and region. The market by solution includes business continuity and disaster recovery, continuous monitoring, Data Loss Prevention (DLP), encryption, Identity and Access Management (IAM), intrusion management, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), vulnerability scanning, and other solutions. The IAM segment in the security as a service solution market is expected to have the largest market size during the forecast period. The market for services segment is growing as individuals, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), and large enterprises are concerned about securing access to their network, endpoint, cloud, and applications.</p><p>The network security segment is estimated to constitute the largest market size during the forecast period</p><p>Network security is a proactive technique for securing a network from advanced threats by collecting and analyzing different types of network security event information. With the increasing threat landscape, the demand for cloud-based security solutions for network security is increasing as it protects the network by restricting the device management accessibility to terminals, authorized services, management ports, and protocols. Organizations adopt a series of policies and cybersecurity cloud services to prevent unauthorized access and misuse of networking resources.</p><p>The SME segment is expected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period</p><p>The SME segment is expected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period, owing to the increasing incidences of cyber-attacks. SMEs are small in terms of their size but cater to a large number of customers globally. Robust and comprehensive security solutions are not implemented in SMEs due to financial constraints in these organizations. However, the large enterprise segment accounts for the highest share of the security as a service market in 2021.</p><p>Security as a service solutions and services have been deployed across various industry verticals, including Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI); government and defense; retail; healthcare and life sciences; IT and telecom; energy and utilities; manufacturing; and others. The retail vertical is expected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period, while the BFSI vertical is estimated to have the largest market size in 2020.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">    Source: Market-Reports   </emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/security-as-a-service-market-132531603.html\">https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/security-as-a-service-market-132531603.html</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">    Leading Companies   </emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">    ADT Inc.

The revenue increase was driven primarily by a $53 million, or 5% increase in monitoring and related services revenue resulting from the Company's subscriber growth initiatives and an improvement in average pricing. Higher M&amp;S revenue was partially offset by lower installation revenue, reflecting the non-cash impact of equipment ownership model changes.</p><p>Net loss of $109 million improved from $113 million in the prior year, primarily due to strong M&amp;S revenue and lower interest expense, offset by higher radio conversion costs, which are also reflected in the $0.02 improvement in diluted net loss per share of common stock. Diluted net loss per share of Class B common stock was $(0.13) compared to $(0.07) a year ago.</p><p>Adjusted Diluted Net Loss per share (previously named diluted net loss per share before special items) improved compared to the prior year, reflecting improvements in Adjusted Net Loss (previously named net loss before special items) of $54 million compared to $58 million in the prior year.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA was $554 million, down from $564 million in the prior year, reflecting the non-cash impact of the ownership model changes and technology investments. These items were partially offset by strong monitoring and related services revenue performance, as well as improved Commercial results.</p><p>Year-to-date net cash provided by operating activities increased 16% year over year to $1,155 million primarily due to the impact of ownership model changes, the non-recurrence of a 2020 outflow related to the Defenders acquisition, and lower cash interest, partially offset by higher net payments for radio conversion costs. Year-to-date net cash used in investing activities increased versus the comparable period in 2020 reflecting higher customer acquisition costs and lower cash paid for business acquisitions. The change in year-to-date cash flows from financing activities was primarily due to the Company's issuance of Class B common stock in 2020.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://s22.q4cdn.com/631128414/files/doc_financials/2021/Q3/ADT-11-09-21-Ex.-99-1-(Q3-2021)-Final.pdf\">https://s22.q4cdn.com/631128414/files/doc_financials/2021/Q3/ADT-11-09-21-Ex.-99-1-(Q3-2021)-Final.pdf</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">    Allied Universal   </emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">    Trust Allied Universal   </emphasis></p><p>Allied Universal\u00ae, a leading security and facility services company with more than 200,000 employees and revenues exceeding $7 billion, provides unparalleled security services and solutions.

The year-over-year decrease in income from operations was driven primarily by unusually high profitability in the year-ago quarter, which was partially due to low cost of delivery on fixed-price programs and lower travel and medical expenses related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased due to lower income from operations, higher interest expense, and a higher tax rate, partially offset by a lower share count as a result of the $500 million accelerated share repurchase announced in March 2021. The decrease in cash from operations, excluding MARPA, was driven by a $21 million benefit from deferred payroll taxes under the CARES Act in the year-ago quarter and a $47 million repayment of deferred payroll taxes in the current quarter. Excluding the CARES Act impacts, both cash from operations and free cash flow would have increased when compared to Q2 FY21.</p><p>Second Quarter Contract Awards</p><p>Contract awards in Q2 FY22 totaled $2.0 billion, with approximately 70 percent for new business to CACI.

The benefits of our strategy, focused execution and timely response to Covid-19 are reflected in the Group's results with resilient revenue, earnings and cash flows reported for the first six months.</p><p>Underlying revenue   <sup>a</sup>   was \u00a33.35 billion (2019: \u00a33.40 billion), underlying EPS was 6.3p per share (2019: 6.3p per share) and underlying operating cash flow was \u00a3364 million (2019: \u00a3164 million). The Group's strategic focus and financial position were further strengthened by the sale of conventional cash businesses, now 76% complete, and financial leverage was significantly improved at 2.58x (2019: 2.90x). Further proceeds of approximately \u00a3135 million, from this disposal, are expected in the second half of this year.</p><p>Our investment in integrated, technology-enabled security solutions is providing our customers with valuable solutions to their security needs and this, together with the implementation of our productivity programme, has been instrumental in strengthening our competitive position and reinforcing the resilience of our Secure Solutions business. Our success in key markets and continued growth in technology-enabled revenues (up 5%) provides increasing confidence in the Group's performance and prospects.</p><p>The path of the Covid-19 pandemic and its economic impact remain uncertain. In these circumstances, and notwithstanding the resilient performance of the Group in the first half of this year, the board has decided to prioritise the financial strength of the company in the near term whilst recognising the importance of resuming dividend payments in the future. The board has therefore concluded that the company will not pay an interim dividend for 2020. The board intends to resume dividend payments once the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic has reduced to an acceptable level.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">    First half highlights (Underlying results    <sup>a</sup>    unless otherwise noted):   </emphasis></p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    Secure Solutions: Revenue \u00a33.1 billion (2019: \u00a33.1 billion); Adjusted PBITA \u00a3202 million (2019: \u00a3199 million), growth in Americas and Asia offset the impact of Covid-19 in our Europe &amp; Middle East markets and Adjusted PBITA margin rose +20bp to 6.5%   </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    Cash Solutions: Revenue \u00a30.22 billion (2019: \u00a30.27 billion); Adjusted PBITA \u00a316 million (2019: \u00a324 million) reflecting the impact of Covid-19 in the UK.

The \"unfav\" represents a change greater than 100% in a direction unfavorable to the company or a change from a positive amount in the prior period to negative amount in the current period.</p><p>(c) Constant currency represents 2021 Non-GAAP results at 2020 exchange rates.</p><p>Doug Pertz, president and chief executive officer, said: \"Our third-quarter non-GAAP results include double-digit growth in revenue and profits, demonstrating our continued recovery from the pandemic and our improved cost structure. Despite the pandemic's ongoing impact on organic growth, third-quarter revenue recovered to 98% of 2019 pre-Covid levels on a comparable local currency basis. While our results in the U.S. continue to be affected by labor shortages and inflationary wage pressures, we expect these conditions to improve as we approach year-end, and expect wage inflation to be fully offset by price increases as we enter next year. On a global basis, we see encouraging trends indicating that revenue is recovering to pre-pandemic levels, though the rate of the recovery may continue to be uneven.</p><p>\"Our full-year guidance remains unchanged, with revenue in a range between $4.1 billion and $4.2 billion, non-GAAP operating profit of approximately $465 million, and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $660 million. Our preliminary 2022 adjusted EBITDA target of $785 million to $825 million also remains unchanged. We anticipate revenue in 2022 will exceed the pre-Covid adjusted level of $4.55 billion. As a reference point, at 100% of adjusted pre-Covid revenue, we would expect 2022 adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $755 million with continued earnings leverage as revenue continues to grow.</p><p>\"Based on our currently projected earnings and cash flow for this year and 2022, we believe repurchasing shares is an excellent investment for our shareholders. Today we announced a planned $150 million accelerated share repurchase that would represent the repurchase of approximately 5% of the company's outstanding shares at the current share price.</p><p>\"We look forward to presenting our new three-year strategic plan, including detailed financial targets through 2024, in our Investor Day presentation on December 15.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://investors.brinks.com/static-files/032e4197-312f-46d0-acad-9a503767327c\">https://investors.brinks.com/static-files/032e4197-312f-46d0-acad-9a503767327c</url></p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Link to PDF</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30773_Global_Private_Physical_Security_23_Feb_22\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"28649\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ACQIST-30773</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ACQIST2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65B4-5N21-DYYM-R1CY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">475918</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-05-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"11885\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Acquisdata Inc.

Start with a good plot built on questions that devolve into a maze of half-answers, maintain the hint of imminent violence, add some long dark winter nights, then send the primary characters out to a cabin far from help for the climax, and you have all the elements of subarctic noir. It's a genre unto itself, and one that gets a solid boost with \"How Quickly She Disappears,\" the riveting debut novel by Raymond Fleischmann.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The story opens in the Interior village of Tanacross during the summer of 1941. Elisabeth Pfautz, the daughter of German immigrants, has been a resident for a few years since her husband John, who hails from the same stock, had taken the job of schoolteacher. There they live with their precocious daughter Margaret, one of two white families in a Native community.</p><p>Elisabeth, around whom the plot revolves, has ghosts in her past (this is noir, after all). Twenty years earlier at the age of 11, her twin sister Jacqueline had walked away from the home they shared with their widowed father, saying she would return soon. She never did. Her disappearance drove their father to an alcoholic death a few years later, and has haunted Elisabeth ever since.</p><p>Into Elisabeth's world comes Alfred Seidel, a German-born pilot and veteran of the wrong side's military in what was then still called the Great War. He arrives in town by air, piloting the mail plane, filling in for the man who usually performs the route. Claiming engine troubles, he asks Elisabeth if he can stay in the guest room at the schoolhouse where her family lives. With much hesitation, she allows him to, and from there he will consume her life.</p><p>As with any such story, it's dangerous to provide too many details in a review. Suffice to say that there is a murder and Alfred is taken into custody, having already confessed. He is flown to Fairbanks, and from there he writes to Elisabeth. He has knowledge of her missing twin, he says. He can reunite them, but first she must perform a series of tasks, each rewarded upon completion with hints that will guide her to Jacqueline.</p><p>From this Fleischmann builds his transfixing tale. Elisabeth, of course, complies, but with much hesitation and understandable fear. The story moves over time from Tanacross to Fairbanks, and from high summer to deep winter, as Elisabeth slowly carries out what is requested of her, fearfully wonders about her own safety and that of her family, and tries to gain the upper hand on a master manipulator. The hole she has fallen down shows no sign of a bottom. Her family unravels. She begins to go mad. The answer of what befell her sister, an answer that has eluded her for two decades, seems both closer and farther than ever. And Alfred Seidel remains an enigma, even as he seems to reveal himself.</p><p>Fleischmann achieves all of this with a striking sense of timing for a first-time novelist. He brings us into a family that seems reasonably happy from the outside, and gradually reveals the tensions that have been fraying it since well before the arrival of Alfred. Through flashbacks to Elisabeth's childhood in rural Pennsylvania, he slowly unveils the broader circumstances that surrounded Jacqueline's final weeks before she vanished. The meetings between Elisabeth and Alfred are rife with tension. Only in a few brief moments does violence erupt. Like the best thrillers, it's the fear of that violence, not its actual occurrence, that will keep readers hooked from the first page.</p><p>Fleischmann also, and for the most part, does an exceptional job of evoking Interior Alaska. The land, the flora, the climate. Winter, of course, is bound to play a role, and a record January blizzard arrives with the climax. A bit of a cliche, perhaps, but noir is built on nothing if not cliches. It's how those cliches get put to effective use that matters.</p><p>But while he perfectly conveys the oppressiveness of an Interior Alaska winter, with darkness on all sides, what he captures as well is the vastly different oppressiveness of the region's summer, when the light never fades, and exhaustion from lack of sleep brings its own mental challenges. Few novelists writing about Alaska take notice of this.</p><p>Curiously, the one thing he missed was the fall. The second of the three acts making up this book takes place in September, but in Fleischmann's handling it's an extension of summer. He's not an Alaskan, although he has roots here, and it can be forgiven. But longtime residents of the Interior know September to be the most transitional month of the year, when darkness encroaches on - and then overtakes - daylight, and temperatures vacillate between the final shots of warmth and the bone chilling cold to come. It's a minor complaint, perhaps, but a missed opportunity that could have enhanced the middle section and helped set the stage for the the finale to come.</p><p>He certainly captures the historic moment, however. As remote as Tanacross is, the war raging in Europe is touching on everyday life, and the shared German heritage of Elisabeth, her husband John, and Alfred, puts them in a decidedly tense position relative to others. By the third act the United States has entered the war, the military is moving throughout and suddenly developing Alaska, and fears of a Japanese invasion, which were quite pronounced at the time, are voiced. As historical fiction, this is very well researched.</p><p>\"How Quickly She Disappears\" kept me up way past a reasonable bedtime as its mysteries built and its characters tumbled. The ending suggests a sequel, although one likely to take the story Outside. But as subarctic noir, this one is quite masterful. Even if this storyline doesn't return to Alaska, one hopes Fleischmann will.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.adn.com/resizer/lU51TZundzp2vRLXAtw1-zCAnnI=/800x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-adn.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5E3MXRG34JDGREF2SZKFOZ64GE\">See image link</url><br/>New saplings are starting to reach the sky among the burned out trunks of trees from a past forest fire along the Parks Highway in interior Alaska on May 19, 2015.

Once that trial wraps, the company aims to move into trials in COVID-19 patients, ideally in about eight to nine months, Christensen said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RELATED:<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/gilead-kicks-off-clinical-trial-inhaled-remdesivir-for-less-severe-covid-19\">Gilead kicks off clinical trial of inhaled remdesivir for less-severe COVID-19</url></emphasis></p><p>Meanwhile, Union, which boasts six years of niclosamide experience in other treatment fields, <url normalizedValue=\"https://uniontherapeutics.com/news-events/news/union-therapeutics-a-s-enters-option-agreement-to-acquire-worldwide-exclusive-license-for-covid-19-technologies-developed-by-tff-pharmaceuticals-inc\">kicked off</url> its own clinical study ofan inhaled formulation earlier this year.

Developed by the Division of Molecular Pharmaceutics and Drug Delivery at the University of Texas, Austin, the rapid-freezing technology improves the absorption rate of poorly water-soluble drugs, translating into the development of dry powder drug formulations especially well-suited for inhalation. What's more, dry powder formulations created with the thin-film freezing platform have strong aerodynamic properties, allowing drug particles to reach as much as 75% of the deep lung\u2014an enticing target for diseases like COVID-19.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RELATED:</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/drugmakers-look-to-repurposed-meds-as-possible-therapies-for-covid-19-list\">Which old drugs are in trials for new COVID-19 use?

Plus, thin-film freezing can be used to make absorbableantibody formulations.</p><p>TFF has already forged three separate deals to expand its thin-film freezing tech across multiple treatment fields, including a partnership in the cannabinoid space, a tie-up with the University of Georgia for a broad-spectrum flu vaccine and a deal with the U.S. Army to develop two specific monoclonal antibodies as antiviral countermeasures, Mattes said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FRCPHR-471696</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FRCPHR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60P0-FCX1-DXM4-G0M8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408604</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"793\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>FiercePharma</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 25, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X01</classCode><className>DRUG DESIGN &amp; DISCOVERY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001031</classCode><className>LICENSING AGREEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000511</classCode><className>DISEASES &amp; DISORDERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001301</classCode><className>PATENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001506</classCode><className>ROYALTIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000072</classCode><className>ALLIANCES &amp; PARTNERSHIPS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>STX001911</classCode><className>PHARMACEUTICALS &amp; BIOTECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>N325412MM</classCode><className>PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MFG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X01</classCode><className>DRUG DESIGN &amp; DISCOVERY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001323</classCode><className>PHARMACEUTICALS INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001322</classCode><className>PHARMACEUTICALS PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N510000CC</classCode><className>MEDIA &amp; TELECOMMUNICATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001711</classCode><className>TEST MARKETING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GX590</classCode><className>AUSTIN, TX, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS159</classCode><className>TEXAS, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

To support journalism like this, please consider donating or become a subscriber.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Former Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt knows pandemics.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When he took over as the U.S. secretary of Health and Human Services in 2005, he said it was apparent the nation\u2019s preparedness for a disease outbreak was woefully inadequate. Leavitt spent most of the next year crafting a plan to respond to a potential flu pandemic, work that was done amid fears of the spread of avian flu.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So I talked to Leavitt to get his thoughts about the response so far to COVID-19. He warns that we are past the point of containment and likely have months of turmoil ahead of us before the virus burns out. He also offers some insight about what we can do to slow the spread, protect our loved ones and weather the building storm.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Note I\u2019ve adjusted the order of the questions and edited to condense the discussion to highlight Leavitt\u2019s main points.</p><p>Gehrke Has this [outbreak] played out about as they were warned that these pandemics might? Is there anything exceptional about it?</p><p>Leavitt It actually has. It started in China. We saw the Chinese experience. That experience is now being replicated in certain countries in Europe. Italy first, then France. And truthfully, if you go to the internet and ask for pandemic spread models, you\u2019ll see animated models that have been built and simulating the timeframes and the geographic pattern that is most likely to occur because of the way populations reside. And this one has followed basically that pattern\u2026</p><p>But what we see now is once it started to spread we started off in a mode of containment, and that\u2019s the pattern, you always start up trying to contain it. If you think of a pandemic like a forest fire, you have watchtowers and the minute you see smoke you send a team out to try and find what\u2019s creating the smoke and to put out any flame that\u2019s there, because if you can get there before it spreads, you can stop a forest fire. It\u2019s the same thing with containment of a pandemic disease.</p><p>So you're constantly monitoring and looking for those moments. And once you begin to see any sign of a pandemic virus, you deploy people there to start containing it, tracking \u201cWho have you had contact with?\u201d But once you cross the threshold to community spread viruses, then you change from that into a mitigation strategy \u2014 from containment to mitigation. And that's what's happened in the last 72 hours, candidly.</p><p>I don't think anyone threw the switch or raised the flag, but you can feel the country, if you know the plan, you can see the country has shifted from a containment strategy to a mitigation strategy.</p><p/><p>Gehrke So looking ahead then, the warning has come from [the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and the White House and others that this is going to get worse before it gets better. Where do you see this going and what should we do as citizens and the public to try to respond to that?</p><p>Leavitt Let\u2019s acknowledge that it won\u2019t happen the same way or at the same time in every community, it will happen differently based on the way it spreads and the timing of it. But once it begins to spread in the community, if it\u2019s left to its own course, it has about a six-week period when it will just multiply very rapidly and then peak and then about six weeks for it to burn out. That\u2019s 12 weeks. That\u2019s three months. And that\u2019s a painful period. Painful in the sense that it\u2019s economically devastating and painful in the sense that a lot of people can die.</p><p>So the objective now that we're in this period of mitigation is \u2014 and you've heard others speak of this \u2014 it is to separate people in this kind of thing we call social distancing. Now everybody's becoming an expert on pandemics, social distancing is all the things that are taught now Wash your hands, don't go to large groups and crowds, avoid this and so forth. The reason for that is because if we can slow down the spread by doing all of those things, it means it won't peak as fast. And by peaking slower, it allows the medical resources that we have to be used efficiently.</p><p>One of the most important things that are required during the most acute parts of a virus-borne illness are ventilators. In a person, if the virus goes to their lower respiratory system and it makes it difficult for them to breathe in order to survive, they require having ventilation and that's done with a machine. But if more people need those machines than we have machines then that's a very dangerous situation.</p><p>And the way this model's out, unless we can bend that spread curve, we'll go through periods where we have more demand than we have machines. And so the goal right now is to slow it down so that we can use the ventilators over and over again for people who have new needs.</p><p>Gehrke So even though it may prolong the spread of the illness in terms of duration, it lessens the intensity and medical [demands]. \u2026 The response to this, I mean, you\u2019ve been on the inside and seen how it\u2019s supposed to go. Have you been satisfied with the response both from the state and federal partners?</p><p>Leavitt I've actually been enormously impressed.</p><p>Now, you know, it hasn't been perfect. But what's impressed me is the responsiveness of people \u2014 the fact that professional sports canceled or suspended their season, the fact that schools have been able to close, universities, businesses. Hard things, things we would not choose to do, things that are not in the economic interest to do, but they're doing it because they believe it's the right thing for the community. And that is the inspiring result, in my view.</p><p>Each part of the government has a different role. Federal government has got some things that only the federal government can do. Vaccines, the federal government has to take charge of that. Being able to send money to state, local governments to help them do their job, that's a very useful thing when the federal government does that. Creating streams of information so that we can know what's going on. Only the federal government can do that.</p><p>But what it really boils down to, it's going to be local government and state government that supply most of the response. Anybody who thinks the federal government's going to ride to their rescue will be sadly mistaken.</p><p>Gehrke Are we headed to a situation like Italy is experiencing now \u2026 with lockdown and the overwhelming demand on the medical supplies, medical resources?</p><p>Leavitt Well, I hope not. But it\u2019s hard not to acknowledge that it\u2019s quite possible.</p><p>Gehrke So we should be prepared for considerably worse consequences?</p><p>Leavitt It will be what it\u2019s going to be. But we have control on how we react to it. I have people in my family I love and I know they are over 70 and they have health conditions and we\u2019re building the best version of a moat around them we can to make certain that they are protected, which probably means they need to stay in their house for an extended period. And it also means that it\u2019s not a good idea to have lots of their grandchildren who love going to see them, they may have to talk with them on the phone for a while. But that\u2019s what it takes. \u2026</p><p>I'm happy to have the conversation. I just think it's important that this not all be gloom and doom. You know, we're going to get through this and we do have the ability to control certain things. And so I encourage people to just control the things you can control and then be vigilant on the things that you can't.</p><p>Gehrke I don\u2019t want to get too political, because I don\u2019t really want to go that direction, but there have been some people who have said that the pandemic response was sort of weakened by the current administration, people who were let go under John Bolton and subsequent to that. I mean, you might know a little bit more about that. Has that compromised our ability to respond to this do you think?</p><p>Leavitt I have often said that the difficulty of dealing with pandemics is that anything you say before a pandemic happens seems alarmist.

Grant Beebe is now the assistant director of fire and aviation at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho. He had held the position on an acting basis since last March. Beebe is now the third permanent assistant director of the seven total assistant director's positions at BLM, with the other four serving on an acting basis -- a source of criticism as the bureau moves its headquarters out of Washington to Grand Junction, Colo.</p><p>Beebe replaced John Ruhs, who left to become director of BLM's Idaho state office last year. Beebe will remain based in Boise, BLM said. Beebe's responsibilities include \"policy, operational oversight, and working with partner agencies and other elements of the BLM to ensure the program is carried out effectively and most of all, safely,\" the bureau said in a press release. BLM, which manages about 245 million acres, handles most of the Interior Department's firefighting and \"hazardous fuel reduction efforts,\" the bureau said. \"Grant is a widely respected and highly experienced fire professional,\" said William Perry Pendley, BLM's acting chief, in a statement. \"He has deep knowledge of wildland fire management, as well as fire readiness and training, honed both in the United States and overseas,\" Pendley added. \"His leadership abilities, passion, and commitment will continue to be just what our fire program needs going forward.\" Beebe started as a smokejumper at the National Interagency Fire Center in 1990. He briefly left BLM in 1997 to work for the German government in Indonesia providing \"fire training and fire readiness expertise,\" according to a brief biography provided by the bureau. He returned to BLM in 1998 as the base manager for the smokejumper loft in Boise, BLM said. He's also worked in other areas of federal fire management, including planning, budget and evaluation in 2011, the bureau said. Beebe earned a bachelor's degree in English from the University of California, Davis, and a master's degree in forest fire management from Colorado State University, BLM said. Steve Ellis, a former BLM deputy director of operations, praised Beebe's appointment. So did Ed Shepard, president of the Public Lands Foundation, a BLM retirees organization. Shepard noted Beebe's extensive firefighting experience, including the months he spent as acting assistant director of fire and aviation. \"He's been acting as the AD for about a year, and reports are he's done a good job,\" he said. Wildfire management This past year was a relatively mild wildfire season. But in 2018, tens of millions of acres burned across the West. In California, a series of wildfires killed dozens of people, destroyed more than 11,000 homes and other structures, and burned tens of thousands of acres. The Trump administration has made it a top priority to remove overgrown vegetation on public lands that can increase the size and intensity of wildfires. President Trump in 2018 signed an executive order directing the Interior and Agriculture departments to work together on projects that reduce hazardous fuels, such as cutting down and removing dead trees killed by bark beetle infestations. BLM in November announced that the bureau's Fire and Aviation Program treated a record 846,000 acres \"using a variety of active management vegetation treatments including mechanical, biological, and chemical tools as well as prescribed fire.\" Trump's executive order called for all Interior bureaus to treat a total of 750,000 acres, BLM said. \"The BLM's Fire and Aviation Program does so much to protect our communities, wildlife habitat, natural landscapes and recreational areas,\" acting Interior Assistant Secretary Casey Hammond said in a statement in November. The National Interagency Fire Center has also coordinated recent efforts to send teams of firefighters from Interior and the Forest Service to help fight devastating bush fires in Australia.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YBC-24V1-JBSK-R004-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"676\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLC</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 3, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It`s 5:00 in New York. I`m sure that landed with a thud over at Fox News. Dominion`s case against Fox is the strongest one yet? That`s according to Lee Levine. He is a defamation lawyer, he has been for more than 40 years, and he simply examined the facts behind the lawsuit that Dominion voting systems filed against Fox News for spreading harmful lies about its machines immediately following the 2020 election.</p><p>Dominion`s fight to hold a TV network accountable for propagating lies is part of the large theme we`ll be covering this hour. Our elections and our democracy very much on the line in the midterms. The election technology company has sued Fox News to the tune of $1.6 billion. That lawsuit was filed in March of 2021. In it, Dominion alleges it has been irreparably damaged by Fox fanning the flames of the conspiracy that Dominion voting equipment was rigged against Donald Trump.</p><p>From their lawsuit -- quote -- \"Fox took a small flame and turned it into a forest fire. As the dominant media company among those viewers dissatisfied with the election results, Fox gave these fictions a prominence they otherwise would never have achieved.\"</p><p>Now, key to Dominion`s case is that Fox promoted the falsehoods and continuously invited guests on, people like Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani, who touted the lies even after Fox knew that the claims were not true.</p><p>Dominion`s CEO John Poulos in an interview with \"60 minutes\" last night spoke candidly about how his company repeatedly went to Fox and told them what they were airing were lies.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN POULOS, CEO, DOMINION: People have been put into danger. Their families have been put into danger. Their lives have been upended. And all because of lies. It was a very clear calculation, that they knew they were lies and they were repeating them and endorsing them.</p><p>COOPER (voice-over): Dominion began alerting Fox News and other networks of the false allegations they were broadcasting November 12th, four days after Sidney Powell first discussed Dominion with Maria Bartiromo. But Dominion says Fox News never retracted their reporting.</p><p>(On camera): You gave them a lot of chances to correct their statements.</p><p>POULOS: They still haven`t corrected them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: So far, we know many Fox News personalities, people like Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, Maria Bartiromo, have been deposed for questioning in the case. \"The New York Times\" also reported just last week that Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott is expected to be deposed very soon. The trial is expected to start in April. Neither side has shown any signs of reaching a settlement.</p><p>Dominion`s fight to reclaim the facts about the 2020 election and hold the disseminators of lies accountable is where we begin the hour with some of our favorite reporters and friends.</p><p>Former FBI counterintelligence agent Pete Strzok is here. Also joining us, Jeremy Peters, \"New York Times\" reporter and an MSNBC contributor. And our good friend John Heilemann is back, host and executive producer of Showtime`s \"The Circus,\" executive editor of \"The Recount,\" also an MSNBC national affairs analyst in his free time.</p><p>Jeremy Peters, you have a killer story on all of this from last week. Take us through it.</p><p>JEREMY PETERS, MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR, REPORTER FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES: So, you`re absolutely right, this is unlike any defamation case that we`ve seen against a major media company in a very long time and perhaps a generation, and that`s because usually, defamation cases are built around one single statement or even a clause in a newspaper article or something that was said on a single broadcast.</p><p>[17:04:47]</p><p>What Dominion has here is instance after instance, night after night, lie after lie on broadcast, and that`s what makes this case so strong, because not only has Fox refused to retract anything that its hosts and its guests said about a supposed conspiracy that everyone from Hugo Chavez to, you know, the German government was involved in supposedly stealing the election from Donald Trump, but you have just kind of a nonsensical narrative here about votes that were apparently transferred from voting machine to voting machine.</p><p>And it`s just so demonstrably false that the Dominion people over the last several months have been gathering evidence from emails, text messages of Fox News producers, executives, talent, and it`s gotten to the point right now where both sides are girding for a trial, and I think that a settlement is probably at this point far off because as far as I`ve understood, as my sources have told me, the only thing Dominion would accept is an apology and a bunch of money, and Fox is not at this point prepared to give up either of those.</p><p>WALLACE: So, we don`t have access to what has been produced by Fox News through the process of discovery, but we do have access to some of Sean Hannity`s emails from the January 6 Committee. Here`s what he sent to Mark Meadows on December 31st, 2020. Quote -- \"We can`t lose the entire White House Counsel`s Office. I do not see January 6th happening the way he`s being told. After the 6th, he should announce he will lead a nationwide effort to reform voting integrity, go to Florida, watch Joe mess up, stay engaged. When he speaks, people will listen.\"</p><p>Behind the scenes, Fox News personalities know that Trump had lost the election and that Joe Biden was going to be president. On their airwaves, Fox News broadcast election deniers and people that were touting lies that they knew were lies on the air. Let me show you some of that. These are the lies they were telling. This was the fact check Fox News was receiving in real time.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIDNEY POWELL, CONSPIRACY THEORIST: The Dominion voting systems, the Smartmatic technology software, and the software that goes in other computerized voting systems here as well, not just Dominion, were created in Venezuela at the direction of Hugo Chavez.</p><p>COOPER: Were you associated with the late Hugo Chavez?</p><p>POULOS: Absolutely not.</p><p>RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER NEW YORK MAYOR, FORMER TRUMP ATTORNEY: A very, very dangerous foreign company that did the votes in 27 states, a company that`s not American, a company that`s foreign, a company that has close, close ties with Venezuela and therefore China.</p><p>POULOS: I can cut all of this short. We were founded in Toronto, which is where my family was from, and there`s nothing to do with Venezuela.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have a company that`s very suspect. Its name is Dominion. With the turn of a dial or the change of a chip, you can press a button for Trump, and the vote goes to Biden.</p><p>COOPER: Can you flip votes in the computer system? Can you add votes that did not exist?</p><p>POULOS: Absolutely not.</p><p>TRUMP: We have to go to paper. Maybe it takes longer. But the only secure system is paper.</p><p>POULOS: We do have paper ballots. What the machines do is they count those paper ballots in a way that makes it very easy for people to verify after the fact through the means of audits and recounts.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Pete Strzok, this case is of interest, I think, to all of us because in some ways, companies have more recourses. I mean, the lives of Shaye Moss and Ruby Freeman were irreparably harmed and damaged by the very same lies. But oddly, in our system, a company can mount a lawsuit like this a little more easily than a person. What do you make of the evidence that`s public facing?</p><p>PETER STRZOK, FORMER FBI COUNTERINTELLIGENCE AGENT, AUTHOR: Well, I think it`s very compelling at the moment. I think you`re absolutely right. What Dominion brings to the table is, one, a significant amount of resources to have a very well-funded legal effort. And I think in terms of their motivation, you know, as was noted, it`s not to cut some sort of deal, it is to get an apology and a lot of money. And if that`s not forthcoming, to go to trial and do that.</p><p>I think it was very interesting to listen to the defamation expert on \"60 Minutes\" that you played because defamation gets thrown around a lot by a lot of people who don`t really understand the law. But it is a very challenging law to establish that, you know, somebody has defamed somebody certainly in a corporate setting.</p><p>It`s a standard of actual malice when you have a public figure, which is in itself a subjective definition, and it essentially means that either somebody knew something to be untrue and went ahead and public it anyway or that they were reckless in failing to pursue the truth.</p><p>[17:09:55]</p><p>And I think Dominion has a strong evidence that they sat there and they were providing the truth again and again and again to Fox, and it`s rare that you`re going to have some witness say, yeah, you know, I knew this was false and I told them to go ahead and do it or to demonstrate that sort of recklessness that would be required.</p><p>But what we`re seeing through discovery is certainly this sort of dual messaging. On the one hand, you have the Fox personalities allegedly saying things on air and bringing in witness or people to talk on their shows saying one thing, and then behind the scenes, they are saying something very, very different.</p><p>That difference is something that, you know, attorneys are going to look for. Those differences are something that can be used with a jury to say hey, look, this was intentional. No matter what they were saying on the air, no matter what they`re saying in court, behind the scenes, they knew exactly what they were doing, they knew that this information was false, and I think it brings and builds a very compelling narrative against Fox in this case.</p><p>WALLACE: So, John Heilemann, this is from Jeremy`s reporting on this. A judge has granted Dominion access to Suzanne Scott`s emails and text messages from the period after the 2020 election when Fox`s anchors and guests amplified some of the most outrageous falsehoods about Dominion and its supposed role in a plot to steal the collection.</p><p>So far, those messages contained at least one instance in which Ms. Scott expressed skepticism about the dubious claims of voter fraud that her network had been promoting, a recent court proceeding revealed. That kind of evidence is what Dominion hopes will ultimately convince a jury that Fox broadcast information it knew to be false, which would leave the company on the hook for significant damages.</p><p>What do you -- when you watch this process and attempt at accountability for the damage done by lies, you cannot help but think about Liz Cheney and Bennie Thompson`s impassioned pleas to protect our democracy with the same sort of legal framework. What do you make of this case and where it stands and how much it matters?</p><p>JOHN HEILEMANN, MSNBC NATIONAL AFFAIRS ANALYST, \"THE CIRCUS\" EXECUTIVE PRODUCER AND CO-HOST, THE RECOUNT EXECUTIVE EDITOR: Hi, Nicolle.</p><p>WALLACE: Hi.</p><p>HEILEMANN: It`s been a while since I`ve seen you. It`s great to be here. I wish I`d been able to get into the bureau there today. Apparently, I`ve been -- they said no, don`t come, keep your distance, so I`m in a secure location and contemplating what you`re talking about.</p><p>I mean, I think for journalists, the way the libel laws and defamation laws have been structured, are a really important part of our democratic system, right? And all of us who do our work under the blanket of them are glad that the standards are high.</p><p>Those standards, knowledge of falsity, reckless disregard for truth, that if you can`t be proved to have engaged in one of those two things, you`re protected under the First Amendment, we think those are important protections, to let the fourth estate do what it does aggressively and make mistakes, good faith mistakes. We make mistakes, and we have to be able to make good faith mistakes if we`re going to do our job in a democracy.</p><p>On the other hand, there is nothing that makes our -- that takes our credibility and makes -- and puts our freedoms more in jeopardy than when you see a company like Fox News do what it did in the case of Dominion. And so, this case, it`s really hard to win these cases, right?</p><p>But as Jeremy`s reporting points out and in what we know of this case, there is -- and again, we don`t have access to all the information, but on the basis of what we know, there seems to be a pretty good case here of meeting that high bar, knowledge of falsity, reckless disregard for the truth, one of the two of those things.</p><p>And I will say that I think, you know, Fox News and people who also pulled the blanket of the protections of the law, that those of us who tried to do our work in good faith and don`t impact knowledge of falsity and reckless disregard to the truth, it`s always been galling to those of us who need those protections to see people like Fox News become complacent and engage in random acts of propaganda.</p><p>And if not reckless disregard for truth and knowledge of falsity, something close to that on almost a daily basis. And to see them kind of take advantage of the protections that good faith journalists are working under all the time has been galling.</p><p>And so, although I never want to root for the press to be prosecuted when it`s trying to do its job, Fox News isn`t the press in this case and it wasn`t trying to do its job. It was trying to run a disinformation campaign to try to keep an illegitimate president in office.</p><p>And that is a thing that it would only be good for the country, for the press, and in some ways for reaffirming the importance of these protections for us when we are operating in good faith, which we do 95% of the time in the real press.</p><p>It would only be good for all of us to see someone who had gotten -- an organization that had gotten -- was taking advantage unfairly of those freedoms, to see them pay a price if it can be proven that that`s what they were doing, and it looks to me like there`s a pretty good sense of arguments that that will be the case.</p><p>WALLACE: Yeah. I mean, Jeremy, and again, this is what the Hannity text to Mark Meadows are a window into. This isn`t about what you can and can`t say on TV. And as John is talking about, that benefits all of us, having as much latitude to get ourselves in trouble as possible.</p><p>[17:15:00]</p><p>I don`t know what Twitter would do if we didn`t have all that latitude. But this is about what they knew and what they said. What they knew about the fact that there was no fraud and what they were saying on their broadcasts.</p><p>Now, the Fox News defense doesn`t even seem to address that. It seems to be that -- they`re still saying this -- quote -- \"There`s nothing more newsworthy than covering the then president of the United States and his lawyers` allegations.\" So even the defense seems to rest on the fact that we were just covering what he said. Is that what it boils down to?</p><p>PETERS: But that`s not what Fox did. They didn`t cover just what he said. You and I and other journalists covered what Trump and Giuliani and Sidney Powell were saying. Where Fox`s case falls apart and where Dominion believes it has the strongest evidence in proving this defamation is that people like Maria Bartiromo, Lou Dobbs, Jeanine Pirro were promoting this lie, they were endorsing it, they were saying that they had evidence, they had seen evidence themselves.</p><p>And that`s where this crosses over into uncharted territory as far as libel law is concerned against a huge media corporation like Fox and why frankly this case is such a huge deal because you have not seen anything like this in our lifetime.</p><p>I mean, you`d have to go back to like the CBS News versus General Westmoreland case in the 1980s in order to get anything along the magnitude of this. And that case was settled. And I don`t have any indication so far in my reporting that either side wants to settle this case. It`s that -- the stakes are that high and the evidence is that indicting.</p><p>I think, you know, the First amendment is a very high bar. Let`s be clear here. I don`t want to make it sound like, you know, that Fox is going to lose this because the First Amendment has these protections built into it that make these cases very, very difficult to win if you`re a company like Dominion.</p><p>But as far as I`ve seen, as far as the sources I`ve spoken to, the evidence that they have so far is going to make it very hard to convince a jury otherwise, which is why I think Dominion is eager to put this in front of a jury.</p><p>WALLACE: Let me show all of you what happened to Dominion, what the real- world consequences are, because the CEO made very clear that this is not in the past tense, that the threats of physical violence and murder are ongoing. This is the CEO, John Poulos, of Dominion.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>POULOS: Last Friday, we had an office on lockdown. Two days prior to that, I was on a phone call with one of our employees who`s a mother of two, very upset and crying. It`s hard to talk about.</p><p>COOPER: Had something been said to her personally?</p><p>POULOS: A very disgusting death threat in detail.</p><p>COOPER: Received?</p><p>POULOS: On her personal cell phone.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Just for the crime of working at Dominion about which many, many, many hundreds of lies have been told by Fox News anchors. Pete Strzok, I think the other thing that people are watching is there is a price to be paid for that anymore or is this the country we live in now?</p><p>STRZOK: Nicolle, it`s sad to see that this is absolutely the way a certain portion of the base of Trump supporters respond to anybody identified as an adversary, whether it`s somebody in government, whether it`s somebody working at a poll watching or a poll ballot place, whether it`s somebody at Dominion.</p><p>But the fact of the matter is prosecution -- criminal cases, civil cases exist for two reasons. One is to punish the offender. The other is to provide a deterrent effect to the community.</p><p>And whether the benefits regardless of where this ends up, whether it results in a settlement or whether this goes to trial, there has got to be an impact on all those people who it has been reported were deposed, Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, Jeanine Pirro, Lou dobbs, on and on and on up to the leadership of Fox, much like Alex Jones on these very large judgments against him for horrible statements about Sandy Hook.</p><p>At the end of the day, this litigation does serve a deterrent effect, I certainly hope it does, that before somebody particularly like Fox goes out and launches into another round of crazy conspiracy theories in the 2022 election or the 2024 election, they`re going to have had this experience in the back of their mind.</p><p>And it is a good, you know, corrective mechanism to bring these extraordinarily abusive behaviors on the part of these very large actors back into some semblance of control or at least I certainly hope it does, but the threat of a $1.6 billion judgment does a lot to focus your attention on the law and what is and isn`t appropriate behavior.</p><p>[17:20:01]</p><p>WALLACE: Jeremy Peters, thank you for your reporting on this. We`ll keep calling you back as we watch this trial shape up and thank you for starting us off. Pete and John, stick around.</p><p>When we come back, South Carolina Justice Clarence Thomas once again under scrutiny today for his ruling protecting Senator Lindsey Graham from having to testify before the Georgia grand jury investigating the attempt to overturn the 2020 election.</p><p>It`s a stunning ruling in the context of all the scrutiny that the Supreme Court is facing and especially considering that Justice Thomas`s wife, Ginni Thomas, played a key role in the effort to overturn President Joe Biden`s victory. We`ll talk about that story and bring you that reporting next.</p><p>Plus, there`s brand new reporting about how allies of the disgraced ex- president led by Michael Flynn are on a mission to gather intelligence in an effort to enact radical changes to the way Americans vote. One of the reporters who broke that story will be our guest.</p><p>And President Barack Obama tells a new generation of voters that they have the power to save us, to change the direction of our country, but they`ve got to vote. The former president`s message ahead of the midterms, we`ll show it to you later in the hour.</p><p>DEADLINE: WHITE HOUSE continues after a quick break. Don`t go anywhere.</p><p>WALLACE: This afternoon, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas gave Senator Lindsey Graham a lifeline, a temporary reprieve from a court order forcing Graham to testify in front of a Georgia grand jury about his efforts to interfere in the 2020 election in that state.</p><p>Last week, a unanimous three-judge panel, including two Trump appointees on the 11th Circuit, turned down an attempt by Graham to block a subpoena from Fulton County D.A. Fani Willis.</p><p>[17:25:05]</p><p>It comes amid growing concerns about Justice Thomas`s ability to be impartial in these cases, especially the ones involving the efforts to overturn the 2020 election in which we now know and his wife does not deny she played a key role. Prosecutors have until Thursday to respond.</p><p>We`re back with Pete and John. John Heilemann, these stories are so provocative, I guess, because John Roberts would have you believed he cares. He cares that in the Gallup poll, the Supreme Court has plunged over 20, 25 points in terms of what the public thinks of it and how much it trusts it.</p><p>And yet, today, Clarence Thomas, whose wife doesn`t lie about still believing that Donald Trump should be reinstated and should be the president and that Joe Biden stole the election, he`s deciding cases involving an investigation into just that.</p><p>HEILEMANN: Yeah. I mean, I think, Nicolle, that -- actually, I think John Roberts does care about it. I don`t know exactly what John Roberts can do about it in these cases. It`s not as though -- the chief justice does not have -- I`m the wrong person to have on to talk about what the powers of the chief justice are in toto. There are so few cases in which the chief justice has been called upon to use all of the powers the chief justice has. I don`t think there`s -- in some cases, there`s not much that he can do.</p><p>Now, there is some question obviously about whether Roberts could step outside the traditional role and decide to do things that no Supreme Court justice has ever done like try to call on Clarence Thomas to recuse himself from cases where he seems to have a conflict.</p><p>But I do think that one of the things that the poison fruit at the center of all this is that s we`ve learned more about Ginni Thomas and her role, we`ve never gone back really and had a full accounting of Clarence Thomas`s role on those cases that he has ruled on where he now seems to have been obviously conflicted.</p><p>We had -- there`s been so much news around all of this. We now have an understanding about her but no one at the time. One of the questions was, when we learned about her role at the outset, was whether Clarence Thomas should be forced to recuse himself from any related cases. This would not necessarily be one of them. Maybe it would be. Maybe it wouldn`t. I`m not sure what the standard even there would be.</p><p>But I don`t feel as though people think that`s a settled matter. I don`t feel that people are comfortable with what we know about her role and how little we know about how her role might have affected his decisions then and now.</p><p>WALLACE: Yeah. John, that`s a good point. He does have this -- I think there are three decisions. One, he`s the only one that dissents to the congressional probe receiving records and documents. And that`s how we learn, that`s how we see as a public Ginni Thomas`s text threads with Mark Meadows, which are provocative and disturbing and alarming.</p><p>There are two others. I think one, Gorsuch votes with him. But they`re all the election cases. And I don`t know either what Roberts can do, but they give a lot of speeches. They give a whole lot of public speeches, very public facing, designed to garner press about how sad they are about the integrity of the court.</p><p>It seems that if you care about an institution and there are only nine members of it, you all could have breakfast and decide that maybe the nine of us can go above and beyond and try to, I don`t know, salvage what the court looks like it`s doing. I guess we`re talking about everybody doing the extraordinary and maybe nobody cares enough to do that.</p><p>HEILEMANN: Well, I think -- look, there`s another additional problem to this. And I`m all with you, Nicolle. You`d think that -- there are a lot of things. Asking the court, asking John Roberts, asking anybody who`s a member of that court who ostensibly cares about its public reputation to go above and beyond at this moment in history when above and beyond is what we need to sort of save the country, to save the democracy, asking the chief justice to be just like the rest of us and go above and beyond is not an unreasonable request.</p><p>I think that one of the problems in all of this comes back to another element, which is the secrecy around the court.</p><p>WALLACE: Yeah.</p><p>HEILEMANN: And the reality is as we sit here today -- and I`m not trying to let John Roberts off the hook. I`m just trying to say, as you and I sit here today, we have no idea what he might or might not have done inside the court with the exception of one extraordinary leak of a draft opinion in the Dobbs case.</p><p>The Supreme Court operates largely in the shadows, and we don`t know what conversations have taken place. We have very good reporters covering it, but much of what goes on inside those chambers is still unknown to us in real time. We can`t actually have the definitive view about what Roberts has or hasn`t done.</p><p>WALLACE: And all of this, at its core, Pete Strzok, is about what Graham did either on his own because he thought it was a good idea or as part of Donald Trump`s conspiracy to overthrow the 2020 election that he lost. Here`s Raffensperger, former -- current Georgia secretary of state, describing what Graham said to him, and then I`m going to play right after that Graham denying doing said things.</p><p>[17:30:00]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRAD RAFFENSPERGER, GEORGIA SECRETRAY OF STATE: Senator Graham applied for us to audit the envelopes and then throw out the ballots for counties who had the highest frequency error of signatures. Just an implication that look hard and see how many ballots you can throw out.</p><p>UNKNOWN: Did you or did you not ask him to throw out votes?</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): No, that`s ridiculous. I talked to him about how you verify signatures.</p><p>UNKNOWN: Why is the senator from South Carolina calling the secretary of state in Georgia anyway?</p><p>GRAHAM: Because the future of the country hangs in the balance.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: So again, Pete Strzok, no denial that he was interfering in the results of the election and he did so at the same time that Donald Trump was on the phone asking Raffensperger to find 11,780 votes, just find them, find them. How important is Graham to the criminal investigation?</p><p>STRZOK: Well, Nicolle, it`s hard to say. I mean, I think, certainly, as far as it goes to a broader context of whether or not we should have elected senators and representatives involving themselves in voting fraud potentially activities like this, it`s very important. And so, you know what --there may be a legitimate question of law here. The issue is not whether or not the Supreme Court should take a look at it.</p><p>The question is whether or not Clarence Thomas, given the fact, let`s think back to, you know, Ginni Thomas, I think was in early November texting Mark Meadows that the Biden crime family and other ballot conspiracy theorists in the lamestream media and others are being arrested and put on -- literally said put on barges off the coast of Guantanamo, so that they can face tribunals for sedition.</p><p>This person married to a Supreme Court justice talking about the Biden crime family, that Supreme Court justice in a moment of a crisis of confidence about the Supreme Court should not be one who is the one person granting the stay. That easily is something that he could have and should have, in my opinion, recused from.</p><p>And again, when it comes to Senator Graham, I think it`s critically important to understand what the boundaries are and are not for elected federal representatives. How that matters in the big scheme of things of what Georgia is facing. I think there is a lot of compelling evidence across the board. So, if you don`t have Lindsey Graham, might there also be many other sources of very valuable evidence pointing to this fraud? Sure.</p><p>But I think it is important for the Supreme Court to salvage and maintain its credibility that this is absolutely something that, you know, Thomas should not have taken part in. And as John said, and you`ve noted, this is becoming a pattern of behavior.</p><p>WALLACE: Right.</p><p>STRZOK: This is not something where, oh, it popped up. This is something that now we`ve seen three times with the same person involved in the same matters that really causes, I think, appropriate arched eyebrows about what exactly is going on and what the justices are thinking.</p><p>WALLACE: That`s exactly it. And the perception is undeniable. So, if there`s no there, there, you know, pull back the curtains, as John said they never do. Pete Strzok, thank you so much for spending some time with us today. Heilemann sticks around even from afar. We need you for the whole hour, John.</p><p>When we come back, we`ll have brand new in-depth reporting on the shadowy effort by Mike Flynn to take his anti-democracy campaign state to state all across the country in a bid to radically change the way we vote. One of the reporters who broke that incredible story will be our guest after a quick break. Stay with us.</p><p>[17:35:00]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNKNOWN: Do you believe the violence on January 6th was justified morally?</p><p>UNKNOWN: I take the fifth.</p><p>UNKNOWN: Do you believe the violence on January 6th was justified legally?</p><p>UNKNOWN: Fifth.</p><p>UNKNOWN: General Flynn, do you believe in the peaceful transition of power in the United States of America?</p><p>UNKNOWN: The fifth.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Invoke the fifth amendment when asked if he believes in the peaceful transfer of power in America. That was Trump ally, Michael Flynn, the recipient of a pardon, displaying his contempt for democracy in front of the January 6th select committee.</p><p>Now, brand new reporting by Reuters delves deeper into Flynn`s crusade, and that`s what it is, to take his anti-Democratic efforts and ideology state by state by state via an organization he`s called the America Project.</p><p>Reuters writes this, quote, \"the America Project finances litigation seeking to overturn the 2020 election and public campaigns challenging the integrity of U.S. voting systems. It also donates heavily to groups backing pro-Trump election deniers who are campaigning for top state offices. It is also trying to change the very way that we vote in America.\"</p><p>The organization is sending so-called surveyors undercover to interview local elections officials as part of a, quote, \"national effort to gather intelligence for prominent allies of former U.S. President Donald Trump who promote stolen election conspiracy theories, that intelligence will be used primarily to campaign for radical changes in the U.S. voting system that elections officials overwhelmingly oppose.</p><p>As part of their work the surveyors misled election officials, again, from that Reuters reporting, quote, \"many surveyors working with the America Project told election officials that they were politically neutral and engaged in voter education. One surveyor told Reuters that the surveyors only pretended to be non-partisan. The real objective was to gather technical information on voting machines to help wage a campaign against them, he said.\" Mike Flynn did not respond to a request from Reuters for comment.</p><p>Let`s bring in Reuters political investigations editor, Jason Szep. He shares a byline on this reporting. John Heilemann`s still here. First of all, what a triumph of journalism and really specifically unpacking the assault on elections and democracy. Take me through the reporting.</p><p>JASON SZEP, REUTERS POLITICAL INVESTIGATIONS EDITOR: Nicolle, thank you. We, our political investigations team examines the America Project, as you mentioned, you know, this was co-founded by Mike Flynn, and as you`ve documented on your show many times, he was a prominent voice in the stop the steal movement to overturn the 2020 election.</p><p>We found that the America Project was involved in something akin to a covert intelligence-gathering operation in eight battleground states where they met with and interviewed more than 260 election officials. We spoke with 45 of those officials. In nearly every case they said they felt like they`d been deceived. The people who conducted the interviews never made clear that they were from the America Project.</p><p>[17:39:59]</p><p>They described themselves as non-partisan people, grassroots people who just wanted to learn more about how the elections are conducted. In reality, this was a survey by a group with a mission to get rid of voting machines and to make radical changes to the way that Americans vote.</p><p>We also found that there were some significant mistakes in the surveys that were published by the America Project. In at least 13 cases the group misrepresented what the election officials said. In one, for example, in Crawford County, Pennsylvania, the America Project said that they spoke with an official there who said, among other things, that the county uses surveillance cameras to monitor drop boxes.</p><p>We contacted the county elections office and we spoke with the chief clerk, and when we told her this she was baffled. She confirmed to us that the county actually didn`t participate in the survey at all and they don`t even use drop boxes.</p><p>The election officials we spoke with are concerned that this could add to a wave of misinformation that`s already undermining confidence in elections heading into the midterms.</p><p>WALLACE: Jason, I was going to read that exact example because it`s an easy way to understand the -- it`s sort of half, you know, incompetent intelligence protocols, but the greatest danger is the combination of intimidation of a fake surveyor and then catastrophic incompetence. And I have the same poll from the story. You know, we don`t have any drop boxes. That`s how we know that`s not true.</p><p>I`m not going to play this but I just want to read this to you. Frontline did a documentary on Michael Flynn. It aired last week. And Flynn says this, you don`t want to allow the enemy to choose the terrain to fight on. The terrain that I have chosen to fight on is the local battlefield, the local terrain, and I think that`s the terrain that will win the day.</p><p>Who`s the enemy do you think that Michael Flynn is talking about? Are we the enemy? Who`s the enemy?</p><p>SZEP: I mean, I think in many cases this gets down to something that`s a phenomenon that`s been going on for the past year. Steve Bannon called it on his War Room podcast in February `21, you know, a sort of a need to rebuild the Republican Party from the ground up, sort of county by county. Some people describe this as kind of a precinct strategy.</p><p>And it`s clear that there`s been this enormous pressure on local county officials, whether it`s county commissioners, whether it`s election officials, to kind of cave in to this pressure, this unrelenting sort of allegations that somehow the 2020 election was rigged or that there was fraud, you know, despite this being disproven on countless occasions by courts and proven to be false.</p><p>And so, this kind of unrelenting pressure is just -- is going on, on the county level, on the local level. And I think that`s what that comment gets to, the strategy to kind of put pressure on counties to change the way that they run elections to, in some cases, get rid of the machines altogether and go to hand counting, which experts say is actually more vulnerable to fraud, more vulnerable to errors, and more vulnerable to manipulation by bad actors.</p><p>WALLACE: And all the machines do is actually count the paper ballots. It is just remarkable. It`s such an important piece of reporting. I`m so happy to have you here to talk about it. Jason Szep, thank you.</p><p>SZEP: Nicolle, thank you.</p><p>WALLACE: Ahead for us, one of the Democratic Party`s biggest superstars is now playing a major role ahead of the midterms. President Barack Obama urging younger voters to get out and vote. A message only he can deliver. We`ll play it for you after a quick break.</p><p>[17:45:00]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: For those of you who are just turning 18, and were only 3 or 4 when I was elected, my name`s Barack Obama. I was the 44th President of the United States. And I have the best jump shot in White House history.</p><p>UNKNOWN: Oh. That`s what I do.</p><p>OBAMA: I`ve heard a lot recently about how voting doesn`t solve everything. And I can see how you might think that. It won`t make Outer Banks or Euphoria season 3 or Rihanna`s new album drop any faster. It won`t make sending gifs any less cool. Wait, gifs aren`t cool anymore? Anyway.</p><p>It won`t even help you understand the most complicated questions in the universe. Like, why do I know so much about Pete Davidson`s dating life? But here`s what voting does do. It allows you to make your voice heard on the big issues, and it reinforces the incredible work you`ve done between elections, holding your leaders accountable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: That was former President Barack Obama urging Gen-Z to get out and vote. It comes as the former president is about to hit the road and ramp up his midterm election efforts on behalf of candidates. Later in the week, he will travel to Atlanta, and Detroit, and Milwaukee, and Las Vegas, to do grassroots events to encourage early voting with the elections just two weeks away.</p><p>Joining us, Tim Miller, writer at large for the Bulwark, former Democratic Congresswoman Donna Edwards. John Heilemann is still here. Donna, he knows how to do this. And the thing about young voters is they don`t vote in very big numbers, but when they vote they have a big impact. You only need to plus them up a little bit. Very interesting targeted message to Gen Z. And I feel so old that they were 3 or 4 when he became president.</p><p>DONNA EDWARDS. MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR: I know. I feel really old. Look, I think it`s really clear, Barack Obama is still cool whether you`re Gen X, Y, or Z, or you`re one of the old folks. And so, this is the time of the season when Democrats really do need to bring out their big guns to turn those votes.</p><p>And this generation, again, as you say, it doesn`t take a lot of them, but all of these elections are going to be decided on the margins. And so, if Barack Obama in his coolness can get out the vote for a couple of extra percent of them, then Democrats stand a chance to do much better out there in the field.</p><p>WALLACE: John Heilemann, no one gave a more impassioned speech or warning about what would befall this country if Donald Trump won than former President Barack Obama at President Joe Biden`s convention. This was obviously a lighter message.</p><p>[17:49:58]</p><p>But in terms of, you know, cutting right through to the stakes of the election, I`m not sure anyone really makes that case more effectively than President Obama.</p><p>JOHN HEILEMANN, MSNBC NATIONAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: Yeah, I mean, look, they do have a very good creative team over there that can make a video like that. It has a little-bit of both the fierce urgency of now and a little- bit of mocking himself with a little-bit of dad humor.</p><p>I think the question, really, in the end here, though, is going to be somewhere about young voters, but really, to your point, Nicolle, it`s still the case -- I was talking to David Axelrod about this for the Hell or High Water podcast that comes out tomorrow, about what -- that Democratic turnout right now is so important in most of the states that Barack Obama is going to. And he`s going to place where -- often where there`s a senate race and a governor`s race that are very close. Wisconsin, Nevada, Michigan where there`s a governor`s race, but also Georgia.</p><p>You know, he`s trying to basically hit places where he could hit a governor the race and senate race sat the same time. And in a lot of case where the turnout of the Democratic base, in particular, black turnout is essential to winning some of these very close races.</p><p>And I think one of the things that David Axelrod saw that I also find is that although it`s true, and we see it in the polling, that the future of American democracy is in a place in our polling that we haven`t seen, really, ever, in our lifetimes covering politics.</p><p>There`s still a question of whether people are going to act on that or not. And whether they`re going to act on it, they say it, but will they act on it? Will it be salient to them? And especially members of the Democratic base, will they turn out because of that argument and will they turn out up and down the ticket and understand that it`s not just the senate race but also the secretary of state race. The attorney general race. All of those lower races.</p><p>That`s something that Obama -- you can hear him pulling a speech that I think we`re going to hear a lot in the last two weeks. A closing argument that tries to up the ante, raise the stakes, but also talk about how important it is to turn out not just the top of the ballot, but all the way down ballot because those races matter a lot. And some Democrats out there still don`t seem to totally get that.</p><p>WALLACE: Which is amazing. It`s amazing that after everything that`s happened. The other piece I think that people are hoping President Obama can, I think, put together more firmly is this idea that they`re not separate issues. It`s not, I care about democracy and inflation. I care about democracy, but inflation. It`s you do not have thriving economies in autocracies, and that is the cliff over which Republicans will take you, and everything is on the line.</p><p>Tim Miller, have you heard much of that, yet, effectively deliver in a way that connects on the campaign trail?</p><p>TIM MILLER, MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR: You know, I`ve heard some of it. I think the Democrats have some campaigns that are doing well, with Whitmer in Michigan, Tim Ryan in Ohio, just on top of my head, or folks that are carrying messages well. There are other places where they aren`t.</p><p>You know, I wrote about the Arizona governor`s race today for the Bulwark, and how Katie Hobbs is really struggling delivering that message. Democrats need more prominent messengers like Barack Obama. And, you know, they`re the victim of -- you know, their own good luck to have such this generational talent carrying a message for them for another decade. I guess when all of these kids were, you know, in the single digit age range, and now they need more folks that are able to do that.</p><p>For all of Joe Biden`s strengths, obviously, that really isn`t one of them. We haven`t seen much from the vice president during the midterm cycle, and so Obama`s kind of filling a gap right now for the campaigns in particular that could use it.</p><p>WALLACE: Donna, I guess the question that I insert here is, they always want more, right? Why didn`t he start sooner? What do you make of how he decides, you know, how much is the right amount?</p><p>EDWARDS: Well, I mean, I think you have to start where voters are. I mean, voters are really just honing in on this election, and you want them at the maximum attention. And so, you know, whether it`s two weeks before an election or a month before the election, I think it`s really important that you have a great messenger out there who`s trying to reach voters.</p><p>And as I`ve said, these elections are really going to be decided by the thinnest of margins. And so, if a voter turns out and they care about choice, you know, let`s go get them. If they care about immigration, if they care about the economy, and I think what -- and climate, and I think what President Obama is trying to do is to make sure that he has a message that can resonate with those voters who might otherwise decide to stay home and give them a reason to vote.</p><p>WALLACE: Heilemann, you`re out there, you and Tim, and you`ve all been out on the trail. What are you hearing?</p><p>HEILEMANN: Look, I think -- you mean broadly, Nicolle, on this question?</p><p>WALLACE: Broadly. You pick. Your choice.</p><p>HEILEMANN: Well, look, I think it`s broadly right. I think it`s overstated the notion that the tide has totally turned and now we`re looking at a giant Republican red wave.</p><p>[17:54:57]</p><p>I think that`s overstated. I think Democrats still have a pretty decent chance, although it`s going to be very tight. And we don`t know what`s going to happen in the last two weeks. I think Democrats still have pretty decent chance of holding on to the senate by the filmiest of margin.</p><p>I do think that the turn of the national narrative towards inflation. And the thing that Republicans have effectively driven -- maybe not fairly, maybe not on the merits, but effectively politically driven which is in the crime argument in a lot of places has made the house -- you know, it`s hard to see a way, Democrats.</p><p>Now, the best you thought maybe they had a about a 1 in 4 chance, I would say that most Democratic strategists will tell you they think the house is gone. It`s not probably going to be a 60 or 70 seat, the Republican red wave, but it`s going to be a pretty solid Republican night probably in the house.</p><p>But the senate races are so close, Nicolle, they`re so close. And, you know, the main thing everyone in the world is looking at in politics right now is this senate debate tomorrow night in Pennsylvania between Fetterman and Oz. It`s maybe the most important political debate of the cycle. Highest stakes, biggest audience, and could be determine and determines who wins that race, and that race could decide who controls the Unites States senate.</p><p>WALLACE: We`ll all be watching. Tim Miller, Donna Edwards, John Heilemann, never enough time with you guys. Thank you for spending some time with us. A quick break for us. We will be right back.</p><p>WALLACE: Thank you so much for letting us into your homes during these truly extraordinary times. We are grateful. \"THE BEAT WITH ARI MELBER\" starts right now. Hi, Ari. Happy Monday.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

Breaking tonight, we're following two major stories. Former Trump aide, Peter Navarro, responds to what he says was unnecessarily harsh treatment from federal agents and he's -- as he's taken away in handcuffs and leg irons over his defiance of a subpoena from the capital riot committee, according to him but first, some rare good news for President Biden about the U.S. economy.</p><p>Employers added 390,000 jobs in May and the unemployment rate remained at 3.6 percent. But it's another day of new record highs for gasoline. And supply chain issues obviously, still getting more headlines. White House correspondent Peter Doocy starts us off with a complete picture of the economy live from the North Lawn. Good evening, Peter.</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. And officials around here are saying two things that sound like they can't both be true at the same time. On the one hand, they say they think the president's economic plans are working. But on the other hand, they say they know that people are paying more than ever for essentials.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Fighting inflation is my top economic priority.</p><p>DOOCY (voiceover): And despite rising prices on just about everything, Biden officials are celebrating a stronger than expected 390,000 jobs created in May.</p><p>BIDEN: We aren't likely to see the kind of blockbuster job reports month after month like we had over this past year.</p><p>DOOCY: That's even though the economy remains 822,000 jobs short of pre- pandemic levels. Inflation has been an issue since last year before Russia invaded Ukraine but the president continues to blame.</p><p>BIDEN: Putin's war in Ukraine. Putin began amassing troops. This is a Putin price hike.</p><p>DOOCY: Biden's backdrop today, a convention center near his house in Rehoboth Beach, one of 20 weekends he's spent away just this year either in Delaware, Camp David, or overseas compared with just four at the White House. And a trip to visit Arab leaders may be coming soon.</p><p>BIDEN: Saudi Arabia be included in that if I did go.</p><p>DOOCY: That potential Saudi stop comes as gas prices at home hit another record high of $4.76 a gallon something OPEC says they are trying to address by hiking oil production.</p><p>BIDEN: I don't know enough to know whether it's enough but I know it's positive.</p><p>DOOCY: But a Saudi stop could also be a flip flop. Candidate Biden said this.</p><p>BIDEN: The pariah that they are. There's very little socially redeeming value of the president government in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>DOOCY: Two and a half years later.</p><p>BIDEN: Look, I'm not going to change my view on human rights but as the president of the United States, my job is to bring peace.</p><p>DOOCY: And oh peace with Elon Musk who says he has a \"super bad feeling about the economy\" per Reuters.</p><p>BIDEN: So you know, lots of luck on his trip to the moon.</p><p>DOOCY: Musk tweeted, thanks, Mr. President, with a link to a release about NASA hiring Musk's company for $2.89 billion to bring humans to the moon as part of the Artemis program the president recently boasted about.</p><p>BIDEN: I look forward to the first Japanese astronaut joining us in the mission to the lunar surface under the Artemis program.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOOCY: So the world's most powerful man and the world's richest man continue trading barbs, and this is the most direct if not playful jab the president has taken at Musk since Musk said he thinks the most powerful person here is whoever controls the president's teleprompter, Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Peter Doocy, live on the North Lawn. Peter, thank you. Increasing concerns about another Federal Reserve interest rate hike had Wall Street in the red today the DOW lost 349, the S&amp;P500 dropped 68, the NASDAQ fell 304. For the week, the DOW lost about a percentage point, the S&amp;P500 fell one and a fifth, the NASDAQ lost one.</p><p>There could however be some relief on the horizon in the baby formula crisis. One of the largest manufacturers in the country is set to restart production this weekend. But at stores, the emergency is only getting worse. Fox Business Correspondent Grady Trimble is at the Abbott Labs facility in Sturgis, Michigan tonight. Good evening, Grady.</p><p>GRADY TRIMBLE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. The reopening of this facility is, of course, a step in the right direction but it's not a quick fix to the baby formula shortage.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TRIMBLE (voiceover): Abbott says it'll start making EleCare formula here tomorrow and says some of that will be available to customers as early as June 20. That specialty brand was not part of the voluntary recall in mid- February though. The company hasn't told us when it'll start making the two brands that were recalled. But once it does, Abbott said it could take up to two months before the product hits store shelves.</p><p>While the plant has been closed, Abbott has been shipping in formula from its facility in Ireland as part of what President Biden is calling Operation Fly Formula his administration has arranged for millions of cans to be flown in with the help of companies in Australia and the United Kingdom.</p><p>WILL MCMAHON, CO-FOUNDER, KENDAMIL: Will be supplying 2 million cans, that's 54 million bottle feeds between June well, actually, between next week and November to American parents. A crisis like this in the biggest consumer economy in the world should never happen.</p><p>TRIMBLE: Still, in the past several weeks, the shortage in the U.S. has gotten worse. Across the country, the out-of-stock rate is almost 74 percent. The states in red on this map are getting hit even harder. In nine states, including California, Nevada, Tennessee, and Florida, baby formula is more than 90 percent out of stock. Georgia has it the worst with nearly 95 percent of formula wiped off of store shelves.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TRIMBLE: At the same time, the Department of Health and Human Services Inspector General has launched an investigation into the FDA. The office is looking into whether the agency followed protocols when inspecting this facility before its shut down as well as during the recall process. Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Grady Trimble, thank you. Tonight, one of the former President Trump's top advisors is dealing with reacting to a grand jury indictment on contempt charges after defying a subpoena from the House panel investigating the Capitol riot of January 6. Peter Navarro is the second former Trump aide to be so charged. Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram is here from Capitol Hill to tell us how Navarro is responding tonight. Good evening, Chad.</p><p>CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. Peter Navarro was combative and defiant in court today. the Feds picked up Navarro at Reagan National Airport this morning. Navarro is charged with two counts of ignoring a subpoena issued by the 1/6 committee. Navarro is suing the House. He wants to suit resolved before his prosecution starts.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, FORMER TRUMP AIDE: This was a preemptive strike by the Department of Justice to prevent my civil suit from going forward, and shame on them.</p><p>PERGRAM (voiceover): Agents handcuffed Navarro. He says they put him in leg irons. Varro accused the FBI of misconduct. Navarro contends he's exempt from testimony because he worked at the White House.</p><p>NAVARRO: What they did was they colluded with the White House to have Joe Biden engaged in the fanciful and absurd notion that somehow a sitting incumbent could strip his predecessor of executive privilege in me of testimony immunity. It does not fly.</p><p>PERGRAM: Navarro argues the 1/6 committee is not valid even though the House voted to create the committee in accordance with the Constitution.</p><p>NAVARRO: What that kangaroo committee is doing right now is investigating for punitive purposes. They're essentially acting as judge, jury, and executioner. Their mission -- their clear mission is to prevent Donald John Trump from running for president in 2024.</p><p>PERGRAM: Magistrate Zia Faruqui warned Navarro that every time he speaks in public it could be used against him in court. The House voted to hold Navarro and former Trump aide Dan Scavino in contempt. It also voted to hold Steve Bannon and former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows in contempt. But so far, the DOJ has only prosecuted Bannon and Navarro. Navarro is representing himself. He says he doesn't want to spend the money on counsel.</p><p>KARL ROVE, FORMER GEORGE W. BUSH DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF: If the Department of Justice is coming after you, you better have the ability to talk to them, and you shouldn't just simply take the attitude that both Bannon and Navarro currently have which is you know get lost because they have the ability to enforce their actions.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PERGRAM: Navarro crafted a dubious plan to subvert the 2020 election results. He wanted Vice President Pence to send electoral votes back to the states. Navarro appears in court again on June 17. The 1/6 committee plans a primetime hearing next Thursday, Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Chad Pergram live on the hill. Chad, thank you. The Chief of Staff for then-Vice President Mike Pence warned the Secret Service that then- President Trump was about to publicly attack his boss one day before the January 6 Capitol riot. That's according to The New York Times.</p><p>Marc Short was said to be unsure of the specific nature of the threat but he was concerned enough to make that call to the Secret Service about a possible security issue for Pence should the former president come after him publicly for not doing what he wanted. Short could not be reached today for comment. During the January 6, 2021 riots, some protesters chanted hang Mike Pence, and the vice president was taken to a secure location that day.</p><p>The state agency investigating last week's mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas says the commander facing criticism for the slow police response was not carrying a radio as that massacre unfolded. Texas State Senator Roland Gutierrez says that is according to a state public safety official. 19 children, two teachers were killed in that attack.</p><p>Congressional lawmakers are discussing new gun control measures, but that new push for cooperation has been severely limited by traditional positioning on both sides of the aisle. And that's not just among Democrats. Last night, President Biden made an impassioned plea for Congress to pass a new assault weapons ban, like the one in 1994. But some of his statements about the prospect of that are being questioned. Congressional Correspondent Aishah Hasnie has the latest tonight from Capitol Hill.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The president says he wants to talk to lawmakers about guns but it doesn't appear he has yet.</p><p>BIDEN: My staff is dealing and has been dealing constantly with every member of the House and Senate who's wanted to talk about guns.</p><p>HASNIE: He is applying pressure on them.</p><p>BIDEN: How much more carnage are we willing to accept?</p><p>HASNIE: In a rare address last night Biden, called on Congress to reinstate a federal ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. A ban he helped pass as senator in 1994 and that expired in 2004.</p><p>BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It is the toughest crime bill we've ever drafted.</p><p>BIDEN: In the 10 years it was law, mass shootings went down.</p><p>HASNIE: But factcheck.org says the numbers aren't so clearly pointing to a 2004 study funded by the Department of Justice which found should it be renewed the band's effects on gun violence are likely to be small at best and perhaps too small for reliable measurement.</p><p>With factcheck.org adding, there is, however, growing evidence that bans on large-capacity magazines, in particular, might reduce the number of those killed and injured in mass public shootings. If Biden can't get an outright ban, he wants Congress to raise the age to buy assault rifles from 18 to 21.</p><p>REP. THOMAS MASSIE, (R-KY): The insult to injury comes when we tell these 18, 19, and 20-year-olds that they can die for their country yet they themselves will not be able to enjoy the rights protected under that Constitution.</p><p>HASNIE: None of it is an easy task for a narrowly Democrat-controlled Congress. In the House, Democrats are lurching to the left threatening to blow up the filibuster and pack the courts to pass a sweeping gun control package, which includes the ban on new sales of high-capacity magazines. In the Senate, they are trying a bipartisan path but no deal yet with the president still wavering on a visit to the Hill to help.</p><p>BIDEN: I'll do what I can to try to see if we have some real progress.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HASNIE: So, Bret, Congress finally returns next week and that is when the House will vote on that sweeping gun reform package among another gun control resolution for the Senate talks. Senators are still talking and GOP leader Mitch McConnell hopes we can see a conclusion on those talks by next week. Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Aishah Hasnie live on the Hill. Aishah, thanks. Up next, we'll take you to the south of the border to a shelter where Mexican migrants wait for the asylum rules to change.</p><p>First, here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. Fox26 in Houston, for a convicted inmate who has been on the run for three weeks, is fatally shot by police. Officers say Gonzalo Lopez was driving a stolen truck belonging to the family of five he's suspected of killing. Lopez was a former associate of the MexicanMafia who had been convicted of murder. He originally escaped a prison bus last month by stabbing the driver.</p><p>And this is a live look at Boston from our affiliate WFXT, one of the big stories there tonight. Donut shops around the country offer sweet deals on National Donut Day. Oh, donuts. Massachusetts-own Dunkin Donuts' will give customers a free donut with a drink purchase. Don't think about the calories.</p><p>That's tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back.</p><p>BAIER: Tonight, correspondent Griff Jenkins gets a firsthand look at one of those Mexican shelters.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HECTOR SILVA, MEXICAN PASTOR: People suffering outside, sleeping outside is not the right way.</p><p>GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Pastor Hector Silva has been running the Senda de Vida or Path of Life Migrant Shelter for 26 years in Reynosa, Mexico.</p><p>Fox News getting an exclusive look inside, where more than 1,500 migrants are crowded in tents in a space built for 1200 or less. With migrants coming from Haiti, Cuba, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua. And even these Ukrainians and Russians sharing a room.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We don't support war in Ukraine, because of this, we have problem in our country.</p><p>JENKINS: Silva hopes the Biden administration will send a stronger message to the migrants, telling them now is not the time to come.</p><p>SILVA: Don't come to United States because right now the border is close.</p><p>JENKINS: Outside the shelter, Silva says there are more than 5,000 migrants in the city. Many of them Haitian, like Junior, who feels President Biden is in keeping his word.</p><p>JUNIOR, HATIAN MIGRANT: He promised the Haitian community he will help them. He will recall Title 42.</p><p>JENKINS: And he thinks it's being applied unfairly.</p><p>JUNIOR: He let the Afghans cross in. They don't apply Title 42 for them.</p><p>JENKINS: But not all migrants are willing to wait.</p><p>JENKINS (on camera): This is a popular crossing spot for migrants on the Mexican side directly across from La Joya. You can see Border Patrol has spotted us, they want to have a look and see who we are. And if we may be crossing, and that's exactly the trek that Garrison from Honduras took.</p><p>GARRISON, HONDURAN MIGRANT: They caught me on the motorcycles --</p><p>JENKINS (voice over): So, you're trying to not get caught.</p><p>GARRISON: Yes, I'm going to go try again.</p><p>JENKINS: You probably try again.</p><p>GARRISON: Yes. Yes, I have to do.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JENKINS (on camera): And things could get worse, Fox News confirms the largest caravan to ever depart top Tapachula in southern Mexico will likely leave on Monday. If migrants don't get a work visa, the organizer is saying it could number as many as 11,000. Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Griff Jenkins on the other side of the border in Mexico Griff, thank you.</p><p>The cardiologist for Pennsylvania's Senate nominee, Democrat John Fetterman says the Democrat has cardiomyopathy. Lieutenant Governor Fetterman revealed May 15th that he had, had suffered a stroke on the campaign trail.</p><p>The 52-year-old easily won the Democratic nomination while in the hospital, just hours after undergoing surgery to implant a pacemaker with a defibrillator.</p><p>His doctor says Fetterman will be fine if he eats healthy foods, takes prescribed medication, and exercises.</p><p>Some pundits, however, are not so sure. Josh Kraushaar, a frequent SPECIAL REPORT panelist says the statement does not sound like the portrait of a candidate in good health Fetterman says he'll be campaigning again soon.</p><p>New Census Bureau estimates indicate the agency under counted the population in some states, and over counted in others during its 2020 survey. Some critics are now warning of detrimental consequences throughout the decade, and particularly, in 2024.</p><p>Correspondent Mark Meredith takes a look tonight. Good evening, Mark.</p><p>MARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Bret, good evening to you. Well, the Census Bureau recently re-examined its 2020 survey and found through new estimates that the population of 14 states were either over counted, or undercounted.</p><p>MEREDITH: The latest data shows the census under counted the number of people living in six states, including Texas, Tennessee, and Florida. While over counting the number of people living in eight states, including Delaware, Hawaii, and Rhode Island.</p><p>Now, the report does not say why the numbers were a bit off. But the bureau's director says, \"Achieving an accurate count for all 50 states in D.C. is always a difficult endeavor, and these results suggest it was difficult again in 2020, particularly given the unprecedented challenges we faced.\"</p><p>But now, some political pundits argue the incorrect numbers may have a major impact on elections this fall and through the rest of this decade. That's because the number of congressional seats and electoral votes of each state are directly tied to census data collected every 10 years.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HANS VON SPAROVSKY, LEGAL SCHOLAR, HERITAGE FOUNDATION: If you take into account the new numbers they have shown, you have states like Florida and Texas that were cheated out of congressional seats. Texas should have gotten an additional seat, Florida should have gotten an additional seat.</p><p>MEREDITH: Democrats are also raising concerns about the 2020 census. In April, 45 House lawmakers urged the commerce secretary and census director to examine why there was also an undercount in the number of minorities living in the U.S., especially when it comes to the Latino population.</p><p>The lawmakers writing, \"With Latinos being the country's second-largest population group, the Census undercount could severely impair the future wellbeing and the prosperity of the Latino community especially, on our nation as a whole.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MEREDITH (on camera): Now, we had a chance to reach out to the Census Bureau today and they tell Fox it sees itself as apolitical statistical agency. And then, it plans to continue to release information tied to the recent census on an effort to try explained its findings, but a lot of people also asking questions. Bret.</p><p>BAIER: We'll continue to follow it, Mark, Thanks.</p><p>Up next, the war in Ukraine hits a grim milestone. We'll have a live report from Kyiv.</p><p>First, beyond our borders tonight, Queen Elizabeth skips the church service celebrating her Platinum Jubilee. The 96-year-old monarch has limited her public engagements in recent months due to difficulties getting around.</p><p>Prince Harry and Meghan were in attendance alongside other members of the royal family to celebrate the Queen's 70-year reign.</p><p>This is a live look at Paris. One of the big stories there tonight. Tennis legend Billie Jean King receives France's highest civilian award, President Emmanuel Macron presented King, The Legion of Honor for her contributions to women's sports, gender equality, LGBTQ rights. It's also the 50th anniversary of King's French Open win at Roland-Garros.</p><p>Just some of the other stories beyond our borders tonight. We'll be right back.</p><p>BAIER: This is the 100th day of the Russian invasion in Ukraine. While the Ukrainians have put up a fierce resistance, Russian troops are still making gains in the east. Correspondent Trey Yingst is in Kyiv tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>TREY YINGST, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: A priest in Kyiv blesses the body of a Ukrainian soldier. His friends and family grieve for the man killed one week ago.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): He was always smiling saying this is our job.</p><p>YINGST: A hundred days into the war, Ukraine is suffering heavy losses on the eastern front. Troops are still fighting for control of the strategic city of Severodonetsk that sits in the central Donbas region, though the Russians are reportedly advancing. American rocket systems are set to arrive in eastern Ukraine later this month to help slow the invasion amid questions about when, exactly, they will be delivered.</p><p>BRIDGET BRINK, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE: I do think and understand there was some problems at first, but my understanding is that now it's very quick.</p><p>YINGST: In the capital, Ukrainian leadership remains confident they will be able to win this bloody and ongoing war with more international assistance.</p><p>VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): We have been defending Ukraine for 100 days. Victory will be ours. Glory to Ukraine.</p><p>YINGST: With civilians returning to Kyiv, the city is coming back to live. Today Mayor Vitali Klitschko presented awards to municipality workers who planted flowers honoring Ukrainian fighter pilots, the latest patriotic act to bring a broken city back together.</p><p>VITALI KLITSCHKO, MAYOR OF KYIV, UKRAINE: Just a couple of months ago, two months ago the city was empty, no cars, no workers here. Right now, life is coming back. The people are moving back to our hometown.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>YINGST: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Russia now controls 20 percent of his country's territory, though efforts are underway to reclaim that land. Bret?</p><p>BAIER: Trey Yingst live in Kyiv. Trey, thank you.</p><p>China is formally requesting a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin next week in Singapore while the Pentagon chief is traveling in the region. A U.S. official says the secretary has agreed to the meeting, the focus of which will be on what's called managing competition. This comes as China enjoys unusual leverage over the U.S. in one vital supply chain category. Here is national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: What do an F-35 fighter jet, and M1 Abrams tank, a surface to air missile, and a handheld radio all have in common? They all rely on rare earth minerals, 17 elements that make up the basis for most of the world's high-tech electronics. Right now, China controls nearly 90 percent of the world's supply of rare earth minerals, a supply chain that is so crucial to national security that the Defense Department submitted its own legislative proposal to the House Armed Services Committee asking for $253.5 million to build up a bigger mineral stockpile.</p><p>SEN. MARK KELLY (D-AZ): We cannot continue to rely on our adversaries, especially China.</p><p>GRIFFIN: It's an issue that has rare bipartisan support. Senators Tom Cotton and Mark Kelly have introduced legislation to help create a larger stockpile for the U.S. military, along with creating more incentives to mine these minerals in the U.S. Senator Kelly, a former astronaut, explained how he saw the problem firsthand from space.</p><p>KELLY: You look down over China and you see like what looks like lakes of very strange colors. And it's because their processing things like rare earth metals, it's a very dirty process.</p><p>GRIFFIN: Production and mining of these materials in the U.S. is highly limited due to heavy environmental regulations.</p><p>SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AR): It's so important that we not just stockpile our minerals for our military, but we develop domestic mining and manufacturing capabilities for all American industry.</p><p>GRIFFIN: The Reagan Institute highlighted its concern in a report released last November.</p><p>ROGER ZAKHEIM, RONALD REAGAN INSTITUTE: China has subsidized its own manufacturing in their country to basically double down on rare earth minerals. And the rest of the world hasn't caught up. They haven't been competitive in that space. We've given it to China. We've essentially ceded it to China.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>GRIFFIN: Senator Cotton warns if China were to cut the U.S. off now, within a year the military would run out of these rare earth elements needed to make most weapons. Bret?</p><p>BAIER: Jennifer Griffin at the Pentagon. Jennifer, thank you.</p><p>Up next, the panel on the president's plea for gun control legislation, and the blame game over the U.S. economy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Part of the reason I ran for president is because I was tired of trickle-down economics. It doesn't work. My plans will produce the strongest, fastest, most widespread economic recovery America has ever experienced.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BIDEN: Look, I understand that families who are struggling probably don't care why the prices are up. They just want them to go down. Joe, what are you going to do to bring them down?</p><p>I have been upfront with the American people from the outset that there would be a cost here at home of Putin's decision to brutally and savagely invade a sovereign nation. But as your president, I remain committed to doing everything in my power to blunt the impact on American families.</p><p>We can't take immediate action that I'm aware of yet to figure out how we bring down the price of gasoline back to $3 a gallon, and we can't do that immediately with regard to food prices either.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Talking about inflation there, but today's jobs report was a good jobs report. There's no doubt about that, 390,000 jobs added in May. Unemployment rate at 3.6 percent.</p><p>Here's the issue though. The labor force participation rate, if you look at February 2020, 63.4 percent, May 2022, 62.3 percent. U.S. job openings, these are jobs that are open right now, 11.4 million. Job seekers, 5.68 million. Those are some things that experts say are warning signs, including Art Laffer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ART LAFFER, FORMER REAGAN ECONOMIC ADVISER: You have got a lot of people who have left the labor force who aren't even looking for jobs, and these people aren't planning on coming back, and they aren't coming back in numbers. Our participation rate, which is the key point here, has way down from what it was in February of 2020. So we have not only not caught up, our trend line is way below that. This is a flashing red sign. It's a warning sign for the economy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: OK, so there you go.</p><p>Let's bring in our panel, \"Washington Post\" columnist Marc Thiessen, Juan Williams is a FOX News analyst, and Byron York, chief political correspondent of \"The Washington Examiner.\" Marc, your thoughts, the president's comments and where we stand?</p><p>MARC THIESSEN, COLUMNIST, \"WASHINGTON POST\": He's right that he can't flip a switch and stop inflation. That's because inflation is like a forest fire. Once you set off a forest fire you can take steps to mitigates it, but the fire has to burn itself out. The problem is he is channeling his inner Billy Joel and seeing we didn't start the fire. It's not just Art Laffer. There's a bunch of Democratic strategists who say he did. Larry Summers warned in February, 2021, that if he passed that $1.9 COVID relief bill it would set off inflation like we haven't seen in a generation. You just had Steve Rattner this week who said he overstimulated the economy during a pandemic, putting too much money in people's pockets which created this inflation.</p><p>It's economics 101. If you flood the zone with free money and the supply side can't keep up, you listed those empty jobs, the supply side can't find workers, the result is shortages and inflation. It's not hard to figure out. It's hard to solve once you do it.</p><p>BAIER: OK, I just want to break in for this breaking news that's just happening at this very moment. Control room, if we can get a graphic of that race, we are just getting word that David McCormick in Pennsylvania has conceded that race to Mehmet Oz. Remember, that's the runoff, the recount that was happening in Pennsylvania. Oz was up some 900 votes heading into the recount. The GOP Senate nomination on the line in that race. Mehmet Oz will now win that as David McCormick is now conceding.</p><p>He says \"It's now clear to me with the recount largely complete that we have a nominee. Today I called Mehmet Oz to congratulate him on his victory. I told him what I always said I would do, and that I would do my part to try to unite Republicans and Pennsylvanians behind his candidacy for the Senate. It's so important for Pennsylvania, so important that we beat John Fetterman.\" Again, that's the Pennsylvania race. Mehmet Oz will be the nominee in Pennsylvania.</p><p>Just quick reaction to that, Juan. It took a long time, I guess, but here's -- now you have this race between Mehmet Oz and John Fetterman, who came out with his own health statement today saying he is going to be off the trail some more as he recovers from his operation and getting a pacemaker.</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Just a second on Fetterman, that was a very surprising kind of medical statement because it had lots of red flags in it. The bottom basically said he can serve -- run a campaign and serve as a U.S. senator. But there was lots of cautionary notes in there coming from a doctor. You kind of wonder who in the campaign authorized release of that statement.</p><p>But on the big news here, I was thinking that the voters of Pennsylvania would not get to pick the winner of the GOP Senate primary in Pennsylvania, because I thought it was just going to be the matter of the best lawyers and the lawyers were going to argue over the unsigned ballots that have been in contested as McCormick tried it catch up those 900 votes with Mehmet Oz. So I think what you are seeing here is that there's an opportunity for Republicans to come together in Pennsylvania because if the lawyers had decided, it would really have split, I think, so much of the Republican base.</p><p>BAIER: Byron, what are your thoughts now? Now that this race has formed, and you have -- it's one of the premier Senate races that we're looking at come November.</p><p>BYRON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": Yes, and first of all, we should say this is a victory for former President Trump who endorsed Dr. Oz. It looked real close for a while. Got about 1,500 votes, got all the way down to 900, but it just wasn't changing after that. And recounts don't usually change the results of these votes.</p><p>So now I would expect that since Dr. Oz is the handpicked candidate of Donald Trump, you will see that be a big issue in Pennsylvania, which Trump won in 2016 and lost in 2020. So, I look to this to be one of those races in which the presence of Trump is strong all the way to Election Day.</p><p>BAIER: OK, I want to turn to the other topic that we had, and that is gun control. The president making this pitch again last night. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This is still a free country. This isn't about taking away anyone's rights. We need to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. And if we can't ban assault weapons, then we should raise the age to purchase them from 18 to 21.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: OK. Marc, there are disputed stats here about the 1994 assault weapons ban. \"The Federalist\" says data, \"Biden again bragged about how wonderful his 1994 assault weapons ban was in stopping mass public shootings, but even studies paid for by the Clinton administration couldn't find evidence of its effectiveness. Comparing the 10 years before to 1994 to the 10 years after, we find the percentage of mass public shootings with assault weapons rose slightly when the ban was in effect, and then fell in the 10 years after the ban ended.\"</p><p>The bottom line is the data is pretty murky there. He did put a caveat, Marc, if you can't get the assault weapons ban, raise the age to 21 on AR- 15s and the like.</p><p>THIESSEN: Yes, so first of all, 77 percent of school shootings are conducted with handguns. So even if you got rid of them, you wouldn't be affecting the majority of those cases. And second of all, I was disappointed with his speech last night, because basically, we have two things that we need to hold together. One, we need to protect our kids. And second of all, Americans have a constitutional right to keep and bear arms. So talking about the assault weapons ban, talking about things that are not going to happen is just fodder for the leftwing base that is so moribund going into the election.</p><p>There is actual movement in the Senate on some kind of a bipartisan compromise on encouraging red flag laws, on school security, on other things that are achievable. And the president could have used his speech last night to get behind that and rally behind that, and instead he chose to make a campaign speech and politicize the issue, which I thought was disappointing, because, once again, he's dividing us, not uniting us.</p><p>BAIER: We'll follow it all.</p><p>All right, up next, panel, the Friday lightning round, the Navarro indictment, what's next with COVID-19, plus Winners and Losers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: If I were it go to prison for a year, which is what the contempt charge could do to for me, that would be a fourth of my remaining life. And there would be a fine that would take a significant portion of my retirement savings.</p><p>They're essentially acting as judge, jury, and executioner.</p><p>They intercepted me getting on the plane, and then they put me in handcuffs. They bring me here. They put me in leg irons. They stick me in a cell.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Adviser to President Trump Peter Navarro indicted by a grand jury, as you heard there, arrested at a national airport and in court today. He talked about the possibility of all of that in an interview last night. We're back with our panel. Byron, it was quite something how this all unfolded today.</p><p>YORK: It really was. Navarro and some others have questions about the legitimacy of the January 6th committee, but that doesn't really matter at this moment. He is nuts to represent himself. I think I heard Karl Rove who had good legal representation back in the Bush administration say you are crazy to go through something like this without a good lawyer.</p><p>But finally, I will say the FBI's treatment of him seems like real overkill. This leg iron stuff is kind of reminiscent of the dawn heavily armed raid of Paul Manafort to arrest him, and the heavily armed raid to arrest Roger Stone. It seems in line with that kind of treatment.</p><p>BAIER: Juan, he also said he told him he was in John Hinckley's cell, a number of different things. Do you find that interesting or weird?</p><p>WILLIAMS: I just -- I feel for Peter because he looked really distressed to me. I think we all know Peter Navarro, and he looked really very much upset as if he was -- felt personally injured. So I hope he is OK.</p><p>But you can't, at this point, I don't see what his argument is for the court. The January 6th commission is going forward. Next week they start public hearings for goodness' sake. This is the Justice Department telling him that he has got to comply. And the thing is, Peter has written a book talking about the very information that the committee wants to ask him about. It's not exactly he can say, oh, yes, gee, I have executive privilege as an extension of the president while I have written a book about it.</p><p>BAIER: I get you. Marc, I guess their argument is, this committee if Republicans take control as expected once they win in November if it goes that way is going to be disbanded. And so a contempt of Congress for not appearing before this committee, they wonder how much weight that holds, number one. Number two, the treatment of how the contempt of Congress is being handled by Justice and the FBI. That's their argument.</p><p>THIESSEN: OK, but leg irons? Seriously, leg irons? The FBI, one of the raps against the FBI is that they were part of a Democratic conspiracy to get Trump. And so the way they respond to that is by sending officers to pull him off of a plane in handcuffs and throw him in John Hinckley's cell with leg irons? I'm all for complying with congressional subpoenas, but this is just so over the top and such a self-destructive move by the FBI. I don't know who authorized it. They should be fired.</p><p>BAIER: Winners and Losers. Byron, you first.</p><p>YORK: My winner this week is Johnny Depp. The experts said that he had already brought a trial on this kind of subject in Great Britain where it's easier to win and he lost there. So there was no way in the world he could win here. But he did.</p><p>My loser is Janet Yellen, treasury secretary, has become the Biden administration's designated scapegoat for inflation. She confessed that she didn't take it seriously enough last year. Now, if only President Biden will say the same thing.</p><p>BAIER: Juan, winner and loser?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, my winner, I think, it's pretty clearly Michael Sussmann, Hillary Clinton's former lawyer in the 2016 campaign who was acquitted this week by a jury. John Durham, the special counsel, charged that he had lied to the FBI and may have been working for the Clinton campaign when he said he was not. The jurors basically said, this case never should have been brought. It was political messaging all about, but not really a matter of lying.</p><p>I had for a loser, Bret, I had had the voters of Pennsylvania for not being able to select their Republican Senate primary winner, but your news took me out. But, let me just say, I think Putin had a very rough week with losing the European Union support on oil imports.</p><p>BAIER: Maybe it was a winner. Mehmet Oz is the winner in Pennsylvania in the end. Marc, winner and loser?</p><p>THIESSEN: My loser is Joe Biden. On the 500th day of his presidency, he is he officially the lowest -- has the lowest approval of any president in American history in the history of polling to Donald Trump to Harry Truman. My winner, I'm sorry, Bret, is the New York Rangers. They are the only team in NHL history to make it to conference finals without having led in a series and surviving five elimination games. Let's go Rangers. Puck drops in an hour.</p><p>BAIER: Our executive producer Rick DiBella will be very happy. He's not here today, but he'll be very happy you said that.</p><p>THIESSEN: I'm with the New York bureau today.</p><p>BAIER: OK, all right.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BAIER: We will see you guys. Thanks, have a good weekend.</p><p>It is Friday, and that means it's time for \"Notable Quotables.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JANET YELLEN, TREASURY SECRETARY: I was wrong then about the path that inflation would take.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is the Fed's job to deal with the issue of inflation.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Everyone thinks the Fed can handle this. That hurricane is right out there down the road coming our way.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We aren't looking to see blockbuster job reports month over month like we have over the last year. But that's a good thing.</p><p>BIDEN: I became aware of this problem sometime in -- after April -- in early April.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I told the truth to the FBI and the jury clearly recognized that.</p><p>CROWD: Johnny! Johnny! Johnny!</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's time to turn the page and look to the future.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Does your client want to appeal?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, absolutely.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So this gun would be banned.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I hope to God that is not loaded.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm at my house. I can do whatever I want with my guns.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you confident Congress will take action on gun legislation, sir?</p><p>BIDEN: I served in Congress for 36 years. I'm never confident.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: That's it for us this week, fair, balanced, and unafraid. Jesse Watters is now. Have a great weekend, Jesse.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

In nuclear physics, what happens to a single neutron can result in a nuclear explosion. When the Atomic Age began on the afternoon of December 2, 1942 under the bleachers at the University of Chicago, that\u00a0 was a game changer for science.</p><p>\"This book reveals the secrets of influential rainmakers,\" says DeVries. \"These influential rainmakers in professional services and consulting know that the typical hype that works for retail products and low-cost services is not only a waste of time and money for professional service firms, it actually makes them less attractive to prospective clients.\"</p><p>DeVries is CEO of Indie Books International and is author or editor of more than 300 non-fiction books. He is the former president of an Ad Age 500 advertising agency and was assistant dean for continuing education at the University of CaliforniaSan Diego.</p><p>To improve business development, DeVries encourages rainmakers to take a cue from Hollywood and use stories that communicate on an emotional level to attract prospects, close more sales and cement client relationships. DeVries leads business development retreats for professional service firms based on neuroscience.</p><p>\"Discoveries in neuroscience prove decision-making is largely emotional, not logical,\" says DeVries. \"I teach rainmakers how to uncover their hero stories that communicate trustworthiness in two minutes or less and prove that they know how to take clients from problems to solutions.\"</p><p>The book's advice is ideal for professional service firms in advertising, accounting, architecture, custom software, engineering, financial planning, HR, law, management consulting, marketing, public relations, sales training, technology integration, wealth management and web design.</p><p>Based on a 20-year, $3 million client-attraction proprietary research study, this book elaborates on a proven process for business development with integrity that produces an up to 400 percent to 2000 percent return on a marketing investment. To attract new clients, the best business development approach for consultants and professionals is to demonstrate expertise by sharing valuable information through written and spoken storytelling.</p><p>\"These are emotional times and in order to become more influential you need to be a storyteller,\" says DeVries. \"This I believe in my heart of hearts about rainmaking: the number one marketing tool is a book and the number one marketing strategy is a speech.\"</p><p>DeVries says there is a hidden asset that will set a business apart and trigger the chain reaction, something no one else can offer: the defining story of your business.</p><p>\"A business leader without a book and a speech is like a movie theater without a marquee,\" says DeVries.</p><p>Research shows independent consultants and professionals can fill a pipeline with qualified prospects in as little as thirty days by offering advice to prospects on how to overcome their most pressing problems. The book shares literally hundreds of strategies and tactics.</p><p>\"When writing my best-sellerHow To Close A Deal Like Warren Buffett, I discovered how Buffett uses stories to persuade, gain positive media coverage, and build a world-famous personal brand,\" said DeVries. \"In my weekly column on business development for forbes.com, I see how most professionals and consultants talk about their work in the same drab way. You can't bore prospects into buying.\"</p><p>DeVries says the twin objectives of the client attraction chain reaction approach is to transform ho-hum meetings to blockbuster presentations and turn prospects into lifelong business relationships.</p><p>About Indie Books International</p><p>Indie Books International (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.indiebooksintl.com\">http://www.indiebooksintl.com</url>) was founded in 2014 in Oceanside, California by two best-selling business authors.

It came to them.</p><p>\"The elusive bear tried turning himself in early this morning, then thought differently as police approached. Last seen walking north on N Five Points Rd,\" police said in a tweet Sunday.</p><p>Dustin Stoner, education supervisor for the state Game Commission's Southeastern Pennsylvania office, said wardens in Chester and Bucks Counties investigated both sets of sightings, and concluded it's likely two different bears are roaming in each county. If one or both of the bears can be isolated in a safe location, the Game Commission will tranquilize them and move them to a better habitat.</p><p>\"This is kind of typical,\" Stoner said of the spring sightings.</p><p>He said young male bears go in search of new home ranges after being pushed out by other male bears, or by loss of habitat through development. Some will cross the Delaware River from New Jersey.</p><p>And, with security and phone cameras so prevalent, more sightings than ever find their way onto social media.</p><p>\"As a whole, the bear population has increased over the last two decades,\" Stoner said. \"But it is not exploding.\"</p><p>Black bears, which can weigh from 200 to 600 pounds, are omnivorous, and most active at dusk and dawn in search of berries, corn, acorns, beechnuts, and even grass. Sometimes they'll find table scraps in garbage cans.</p><p>In New Jersey, black bear sightings were up 33% from Jan. 1 through May compared with the same period last year. However, sightings have been down in recent years, with most in the rocky, hilly northwestern part of the state, where it's easier for bears to find dens and lots of nuts.</p><p>But black bears have been spotted in all 21 New Jersey counties over the years. Overall black bear growth has increased since the 1980s, with the carnivores pushing their range south and east from the northwest.</p><p>On Saturday, a bear wandered into Elk Township, Gloucester County, so police asked residents to be cautious. The once mostly rural township is now dotted with suburban housing. Possibly the same bear moved on and was sighted this week in nearby communities, including Mantua Township and Clayton.</p><p>Residents theorized on Facebook groups this week that the bear might have been flushed out during a large fire at the Winslow Wildlife Management Area on the border of Camden and Gloucester Counties, though state officials could not confirm that. The New Jersey Forest Fire Service said the fire burned 2,107 acres on May 20, and that the cause was still being investigated.</p><p>\"The New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife is aware of bear sightings in Gloucester County and has been in contact with local police departments to provide advice,\" Larry Hajna, a spokesperson for the state Department of Environmental Protection, said in a statement. \"Though not certain at this time, the sightings may involve one bear and not multiple animals.\"</p><p>Hajna said black bears are wary of humans and \"should be disturbed as little as possible in order to give them an opportunity to find suitable habitat.\"</p><p>He suggests residents remove any potential food sources, as bears have an extremely keen sense of smell that can lure them to take up in certain neighborhoods.</p><p>Hajna offered some tips to keep bears away:</p><p>&gt;Wash garbage containers frequently with a disinfectant solution to remove odors. Put out garbage on collection day, not the night before.</p><p>&gt;Avoid feeding birds when bears are active. If you choose to feed birds, do so during daylight hours only and bring feeders indoors at night. Suspend bird feeders from a free-hanging wire, making sure they are at least 10 feet off the ground. Clean up spilled seeds and shells daily.</p><p>&gt;Remove all uneaten food and food bowls used by pets fed outdoors.</p><p>&gt;Clean outdoor grills and utensils to remove food and grease residue. Store grills securely. <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:fkummer@inquirer.com\">fkummer@inquirer.com</email></p><p>215-854-2329 FrankKummer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHIINQ-PHQP20200617Ar01900</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHIINQ2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6053-YPT1-DYJT-206P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"752\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Philadelphia Inquirer</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 17, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009OG7</classCode><className>MAMMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N922120QM</classCode><className>POLICE FORCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000123</classCode><className>POPULATION GROWTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00097C9</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS &amp; AUTHORITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001839</classCode><className>WILDLIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001511</classCode><className>RURAL COMMUNITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001645</classCode><className>SUBURBS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>ST0008X5O</classCode><className>ECOSYSTEMS &amp; HABITATS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>ST000D1F5</classCode><className>NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX602</classCode><className>PHILADELPHIA, PA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GS146</classCode><className>NEW JERSEY, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS154</classCode><className>PENNSYLVANIA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Sign up here[1]. <br/><br/>When my friend Sarah Vowell reached out last spring to ask if Montana Free Press would be interested in collaborating on a project to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the 1972 Constitutional Convention, the timing couldn't have been better. <br/><br/>Our editorial team was already thinking about how to commemorate the creation of the historic document that has guided Montana's politics and policies for the past half-century. <br/><br/>The previous year, we'd collaborated with Montana Public Radio and Yellowstone Public Radio on a 10-episode podcast calledShared State[2]that explored campaign-ballyhooed 'Montana values' through the lens of the preamble to the Montana Constitution, which states: <br/><br/>'We the people of Montana grateful to God for the quiet beauty of our state, the grandeur of our mountains, the vastness of our rolling plains, and desiring to improve the quality of life, equality of opportunity and to secure the blessings of liberty for this and future generations do ordain and establish this constitution.' <br/><br/>Shared State bridged history, politics, and the daily realities of everyday Montanans to examine the then-upcoming 2020 election, exploring what it means to be a 'real Montanan,' voter access, public lands, and the tension between rugged individualism and community. <br/><br/>For this new project, Sarah and MTFP's reporting team interviewed most of the surviving delegates to the 1972 'ConCon,' as well as MTFP board chair and longtime statehouse reporter Chuck Johnson, who covered the convention as an intern for the Associated Press. We collected hours of video footage of these interviews, which will be archived at Montana State University. <br/><br/>As I write this, Sarah is busy editing a sort of mini-documentary film that will be presented atan event on March 22 at MSU[3]. Sarah and I will also moderate a conversation with former U.S. Ambassador to China Max Baucus, former Gov. Marc Racicot, former state Superintendent of Public Instruction Denise Juneau, ConCon delegate Mae Nan Ellingson and, of course, Chuck, who documented the whole thing firsthand. <br/><br/>In today's highly polarized, deeply divided political atmosphere, it's almost impossible to imagine that just 50 years ago, 100 people from across this vast state \u2014with widely differing political views, religions, experiences, and backgrounds \u2014overcame their differences and together framed a new guiding document for Montana. In the end, all 100 delegates voted to send the newly drafted Constitution to voters. <br/><br/>Can you imagine that happening today? Could our political leaders set aside their partisan loyalties, personal interests and pursuits of power to debate, compromise and agree on a framework to solve the state's most pressing problems and preserve its most cherished values? <br/><br/>Those are questions we'll be asking a lot over the next 10 months as the 2022 midterm election approaches. We'll hope you'll join the conversation. <br/><br/>\u2014John S. Adams, Editor-in-Chief <br/><br/> By the Numbers  <br/> What else you need to know: <br/> 01.28.202201.30.2022  <br/> 01.27.202201.28.2022  <br/> 01.27.202201.27.2022  <br/><br/><br/><br/> Number of open positions advertised in the Lame Deer school district's elementary and high schools as of late January \u2014half of the two schools' combined current staff of 52. <br/><br/>'I'm principal, vice principal, secretary, and attendance clerk right now,' Lame Deer High School Principal Byron Woods told reporter Jill Van Alstyne for this week's feature onthe district's response to acute COVID and staffing challenges[4]. <br/><br/>\u2014Brad Tyer, Editor <br/><br/> Hot Potato  <br/> Over the past year, different factions within Montana's political machinery have adopted conflicting strategies for safeguarding the integrity of state elections. The disagreement stems from a fundamental divide over how secure Montana elections presently are and whether the results of the 2020 election signal an existential threat to the state's voting processes. <br/><br/>Two separate events in Helena this week presented the clearest illustration to date of the divide. Inside the Capitol, Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen and numerous county election officials convened to formally test and certify the electronic machines slated for use in Montana's 2022 elections. At the same time, four Republican lawmakers gathered in a downtown hotel ballroom for a full day of presentations and public comment perpetuating unsubstantiated claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump. <br/><br/>The former is a matter of routine for election officials every election year, one of many incremental steps taken to ensure that Montana ballots are accurately distributed, verified and counted. It's part of an exhaustive process that takes county officials and their staffs months to complete, and is governed at every turn by federal laws, state laws and agency rules. In the face of a nationwide controversy instigated by Trump and many of his followers, several election officials in Montana encouraged the public last fall to observe various steps of the process firsthand. The message from their offices has been united: The checks and balances baked into the process at the local level are what make Montana's elections secure. <br/><br/>That message is a non-starter for the occupants of the Helena hotel ballroom. Headed by Sen. Theresa Manzella, R-Stevensville,the 'ad hoc election integrity committee'[5]spent Tuesday poring over all the ways in which the current system is vulnerable to attack by politically motivated abusers \u2014 and was attacked, they believe, to install a Democrat in the White House. Much of their narrative suggests coordinated fraud of a size and scoperepeatedly refuted by political scientists across the country[6]. The group's more granular critiques \u2014 for example, that outdated voter rolls could open the door for fraudulent voting by individuals \u2014 focus on the very hypotheticals that the processes employed by county officials are designed to detect and prevent. <br/><br/>One of the earliest and most localized concerns driving the committee's call for action is an allegation leveled in Missoula County by one of its members, Rep. Brad Tschida, last spring. Tschidaclaimed that he and a group of citizens had uncovered a potential 4,600-vote discrepancy[7]in the county's 2020 election results. The allegation prompted pushback from county commissioners and Elections Administrator Bradley Seaman, but has more recently attracted another party to the election integrity table: The Missoula County Republican Party. Early this week, party chair Vondene Kopetski publicly announced herplan to determine the veracity of Tschida's claim[8], one way or another. <br/><br/>There's no telling what Kopetski's forthcoming entry into the debate might yield, but the news was less than welcomed by the ad hoc committee's Republicans. Rather than greet Kopetski's effort as an opportunity to confirm their suspicions, those Republicans questioned her motives, speculating that she's out to discredit them. <br/><br/>\u2014Alex Sakariassen, Reporter <br/><br/> Viewshed  <br/><br/> Wildfire smoke permeates the air in this image of a forest fire burning in the Granite Pass Complex, which included three wildfires that burned nearly 6,000 acres along the Montana-Idaho border last summer. <br/><br/>The health impacts of wildfire smoke were among the topics covered during a meeting of the Legislature's Environmental Quality Council at the Capitol on Tuesday. Katelyn O'Dell, a researcher who authored an August 2021 study in the journal GeoHealth focusing onmortality and morbidity attributable to smoke plumes[9], told council members that 1.2% of Montana deaths between 2006 and 2018 can be attributed to tiny particulate matter (PM) contained in wildfire smoke \u2014 'a much greater rate than all of the states in the contiguous U.S.' <br/><br/>This tiny (sub-2.5 micron) particulate matter is taken into the lungs and passes into the bloodstream. Exposure to 2.5 PM smoke is associated with negative respiratory and cardiovascular health impacts. Women exposed to 2.5 PM smoke during the second trimester of pregnancy experience higher rates of preterm birth. <br/>Michael Gue, who spent 16 years as a wildland firefighter in the Northern Rockies and now conducts prescribed fire operations for the National Park Service in southern Florida, took the photo in late July. Gue told MTFP that a combination of climate change, fuel loading and urban sprawl have resulted in challenging wildfire seasons like 2021's, and he advocates for prescribed fire \u2014 intentionally lit fires designed to consume accumulated vegetation \u2014 as a way to gain greater control over the conditions under which fires burn. <br/><br/>'We know these ecosystems are naturally supposed to burn,' he said. 'If we wait for a wildfire it's going to be a lot of smoke, it's going to be more harmful, and it's harder to control where it goes and who it impacts.' <br/><br/>\u2014Amanda Eggert, Reporter <br/><br/> Verbatim  <br/> 'The Omicron surge is exacerbating these increasing staffing shortages, as we currently have a record number of staff call offs due to COVID-19 diagnosis or quarantine The pool of available candidates to replace the staff members we lose is shrinking by the day. While our staffing shortages are a direct result of the pandemic, this isn't a temporary challenge. This is very much our new reality in health care.' <br/><br/>\u2014St. Peter's Health Chief People and Communications Officer Andrea Groom. The Helena hospital and Shodair Children's Hospital announced Wednesday that their organizations have a combined 330 vacant positions. <br/><br/> On Our Radar <br/> Amanda Eggert\u2014 Speaking of wildfire smoke (See Viewshed, above), thisstory out of Canada[10]about lung function in officers responding to the 2016 Fort McMurray, Alberta, wildfires is both illuminating and depressing. The authors of a recent University of Alberta study found that 'the small airways in [officers'] lungs underwent structural changes after they were deployed, potentially increasing the risk for respiratory diseases in the future.' <br/><br/>Mara Silvers\u2014 Anyone who's tried to drive out of a snowy ditch knows how easy it is to keep spinning your wheels and just get more stuck. That's the imagebrought to mind bythis Wall Street Journal piece[11]about how the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention havefumbled recent COVID curveballs. It might be a good time for a truck with chains. <br/><br/>Alex Sakariassen\u2014 It probably won't come as much of a shock, but Montana's not the only state in the West struggling with government employee turnover. WyoFile published an extensive report last week onjust how dire the recruitment and retention woes are across Wyoming's government[12], and what political leaders there propose to do about it. <br/><br/>Eric Dietrich\u2014 This piece from the New York Times includesthe best explanation I've seen about what's driving inflation in the national economy[13].

The 73-year-old retired SEPTA man had just parked his baby, School Bus No. 17, alongside Swarthmore-Rutledge elementary school. I peeked inside from the sidewalk through open accordion doors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I've been on this route for five years,\" Collier said Monday afternoon. \"The kids know me. The parents know me. When they're on my bus, they're <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">my</emphasis> kids.\"</p><p>For children inside the school at that moment, Monday was the first time they had been back inside a classroom since the coronavirus shut down schools in March. Wallingford-Swarthmore School District is among a select number of suburban Philadelphia districts that have begun reopening to partial-week instruction. It is momentous for children and parents alike in this ever-so-disorienting pandemic year.</p><p>A fraction of what so many of us have lost during this terribly managed coronavirus pandemic was visible right there inside Collier's idled school bus. A bus that, in a normal year, is packed with spunky kids who like to needle - and be needled by - the driver they all call \"Mister Howard!\"</p><p>\"I had two brothers this morning,\" Collier said, and for a moment I thought he was singling out a pair on a reasonably full bus.</p><p>I was wrong.</p><p>He had <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">two kids total</emphasis> on the whole bus Monday morning.</p><p>\"I don't see any relief from this whole mess,\" he said of the pandemic and its effect on our lives, still.</p><p>I had dropped off my own sons at school in a different district Monday for their own stab at two days a week of in-person instruction. It's all that crowded public schools can manage without turning classrooms into the kind of petri dish that President Donald Trump apparently has been presiding over at the White House.</p><p>What I saw in both districts was, like so much else in this crazy year, a confusing if also welcome scene: Kids and adults wearing masks without flinching. A crowd at less than half capacity. Everyone marching through a New Normal that does not feel normal, even though the numbness of this terrible year makes today feel slightly better than yesterday, and last week, and the month before that.</p><p>For six long months (and counting in Philadelphia and other districts that have yet to reopen their actual classrooms at all), schools had been shuttered.</p><p>The sound of them back on the scene, if in shockingly fewer numbers due to staggering of schedules and decisions by other families to stay home, was glorious.</p><p>\"They launched like a rocket!\" I heard a teacher say from beneath a canopy of trees just outside the Swarthmore elementary school's front doors. I was sitting on a wooden bench nearby, eavesdropping. She held open a hardback book and dangled it over eight masked first graders seated on the grass in crisscross applesauce style. They were reading <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Awful Aardvarks Go to School.</emphasis></p><p>The children chirped. It was like a burst of oxygen in a smothering forest fire. I kept turning my eyes toward a nearby mylar balloon tied to a wooden bench. It swayed in the sunny, crisp pre-Halloween air. \"WELCOME BACK,\" it said.</p><p>\"Now listen carefully, my first graders,\" the teacher continued. \"We're going to go back into the classroom. We're going to wash our hands, and then it's time for a snack.\"</p><p>The children marched past me at six-feet-apart intervals. One little boy appeared to be talking animatedly about a tiny creature.</p><p>\"I learned about it on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wild Kratts</emphasis>,\" he told a classmate as they breezed past. \"It's the size of a tip of a pin!\"</p><p>The return of children to even just some of our region's suburban schools, while a huge milestone, was also bittersweet given the backdrop of drama in the White House. Our mask-averse president was hospitalized until Monday evening with COVID-19. He had been whisked to the hospital Friday via helicopter, for all the world to see, a portrait of hypocrisy and ineptitude. The fearless leader who spent much of the year talking down masks and doing little to nothing to help public schools reopen with resources to do so safely, was in the hospital while children finally began to squeeze out a few hours of school again, no thanks to his incompetent administration.</p><p>\"I'm happy for my son,\" Christine Anderson said of 6-year-old first-grader R.J. Contraday, moments before he emerged from his first day back since March. \"He shed a couple of tears this morning.\"</p><p>All around, parents and kids were wearing masks. No one was whining about personal liberty or politics. They were acting, in other words, like grownups act when a common goal is identified that requires a touch of communal sacrifice.</p><p>I asked Cora Alessi, 43, after she greeted her fifth- and firstgrade children, what she thought of the year.

SBA uses two primary measures of business size for size standards purposes: Average annual receipts and average number of employees. SBA uses financial assets for certain financial industries and refining capacity, in addition to employees, for the petroleum refining industry to measure business size. In addition, SBA's Small Business Investment Company (SBIC), Certified Development Company (CDC/504), and 7(a) Loan Programs use either the industry-based size standards or tangible net worth and net income-based alternative size standards to determine eligibility for those programs.</p><p>In September 2010, Congress passed the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-240, 124 Stat. 2504, September 27, 2010) (\"Jobs Act\"), requiring SBA to review all size standards every five years and make necessary adjustments to reflect current industry and market conditions. In accordance with the Jobs Act, in early 2016, SBA completed the first five-year review of all size standards--except those for agricultural enterprises for which size standards were previously set by Congress--and made appropriate adjustments to size standards for a number of industries to reflect current industry and Federal market conditions.</p><p>Section 1831 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (\"NDAA 2017\"), Public Law 114-328 (December 23, 2016) directed SBA to establish size standards for all agricultural enterprises in the same manner as for other industries and to include them in the five-year rolling review procedures established under section 1344(a) of the Jobs Act. Accordingly, in this final rule, SBA has evaluated the size standards for all agricultural industries, including 46 industries that are being reviewed for the first time. As stated above, historically, the size standards for most agricultural industries were established by statute.</p><p>In addition to the comprehensive review of size standards, SBA also adjusts its monetary-based size standards for inflation at least once every five years. An interim final rule on SBA's latest inflation adjustment to size standards, effective August 19, 2019, was published in the Federal Register on July 18, 2019 (84 FR 34261). SBA also updates its size standards every five years to adopt the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) quinquennial North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) revisions to its table of small business size standards. Effective October 1, 2017, SBA adopted the OMB's 2017 NAICS revisions to its size standards (82 FR 44886 (September 27, 2017)).[1]</p><p>This final rule is one of a series of final rules that will revise size standards of industries grouped by various NAICS sectors. Rather than revise all size standards at one time, SBA is revising size standards by grouping industries within various NAICS sectors that use the same size measure ( i.e., employees or receipts). In the prior review, SBA revised size standards mostly on a sector-by-sector basis. As part of second five-year review of size standards under the Jobs Act, SBA reviewed all receipt-based size standards in NAICS Sectors 11, 21, 22, and 23 to determine whether the existing size standards should be retained or revised based on the current industry and Federal market data. After its review, SBA published a proposed rule in the October 2, 2020 issue of the Federal Register (85 FR 62239) which proposed to increase the size standards for 68 industries in the above sectors, including 58 industries and two subindustries (\"exceptions\") in NAICS Sector 11 (Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting), three industries in Sector 21 (Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction), three industries in Sector 22 (Utilities), and one industry and one subindustry (\"exception\") in Sector 23 (Construction). In this final rule, SBA is adopting the proposed size standards from the October 2020 proposed rule without change, except for a further increase to the size standard for the Forest Fire Suppression and Fuel Management Services exceptions to NAICS 115310 based on public comments and the latest available data. For these exceptions, SBA is adopting a higher size standard of $30 million instead of the proposed $25 million.</p><p>In conjunction with the current comprehensive size standards review, SBA developed a revised \"Size Standards Methodology\" (Methodology) for developing, reviewing, and modifying size standards, when necessary. SBA's revised Methodology provides a detailed description of its analyses of various industry and program factors and data sources, and how the agency uses the results to establish and revise size standards. In the proposed rule itself, SBA detailed how it applied its revised Methodology to review and modify where necessary, the existing size standards for industries covered in this final rule. Prior to finalizing the revised Methodology, SBA issued a notification in the April 27, 2018, edition of the Federal Register (83 FR 18468) to solicit comments from the public and notify stakeholders of the proposed changes to the Methodology. SBA considered all public comments in finalizing the revised Methodology. For a summary of comments and SBA's responses, refer to the SBA's April 11, 2019, Federal Register notification (84 FR 14587) of the issuance of the final revised Methodology. SBA's Size Standard Methodology is available on its website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sba.gov/size\">www.sba.gov/size</url>.</p><p>In evaluating an industry's size standard, SBA examines its characteristics (such as average firm size, startup costs and entry barriers, industry competition and distribution of firms by size) and the small business level and share of Federal contract dollars in that industry. SBA also examines the potential impact a size standard revision might have on its financial assistance programs, and whether a business concern under a revised size standard would be dominant in its industry. SBA analyzed the characteristics of each receipt-based industry in NAICS Sectors 11 (except industries under Subsectors 111 and 112), 21, 22, and 23, mostly using a special tabulation obtained from the U.S. Bureau of the Census from its 2012 Economic Census (the latest available). The 2012 Economic Census special tabulation contains information for different levels of NAICS categories on average and median firm size in terms of both receipts and employment, total receipts generated by the four and eight largest firms, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), the Gini coefficient, and size distributions of firms by various receipts and employment size groupings. To evaluate industries under Subsectors 111 and 112, SBA used the special tabulation of the 2012 Census of Agriculture obtained from the USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). To evaluate average asset size, SBA combines the sales to total assets ratios by industry, obtained from the Risk Management Association's (RMA) Annual eStatement Studies ( <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.rmahq.org/estatement-studies\">http://www.rmahq.org/estatement-studies</url>/ ) with the simple average receipts size by industry from the 2012 Economic Census tabulation to estimate the average assets size for each industry. SBA also evaluated the small business level and share of Federal contracts in each of the industries using data from the Federal Procurement Data System--Next Generation (FPDS-NG) for fiscal years 2016-2018. Table 4 of the October 2020 proposed rule, Size Standards Supported by Each Factor for Each Industry (Receipts), shows the results of analyses of industry and Federal contracting factors for each industry and subindustry (exception) covered by the proposed rule. Of the 100 industries and three subindustries (exceptions) reviewed in the proposed rule, the results from analyses of the latest available data on the five primary factors from Table 4 of the proposed rule supported increasing size standards for 65 industries and three subindustries, and decreasing size standards for 35 industries. Table 1, Summary of Calculated Size Standards, summarizes the analytical results from the proposed rule by NAICS sector.</p><p>Table 1--Summary of Calculated Size Standards</p><p>NAICS sector ... Sector name ... Number of size standards reviewed ... Number of size standards increased ... Number of size standards decreased ... Number of size standards unchanged</p><p>11 ... Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting ... 64 ... 60 ... 4 ... 0</p><p>21 ... Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction ... 4 ... 3 ... 1 ... 0</p><p>22 ... Utilities ... 3 ... 3 ... 0 ... 0</p><p>23 ... Construction ... 32 ... 2 ... 30 ... 0</p><p>All Sectors ... ... 103 ... 68 ... 35 ... 0</p><p>In the October 2020 proposed rule, SBA discussed the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on small businesses and greater society. Recognizing the wide-ranging economic impacts of the pandemic, SBA decided not to lower any size standards for which the analysis suggested lowering them. Instead, SBA proposed to maintain all size standards for industries in which the analytical results supported a decrease or no change to size standards and adopt all size standards for which the analytical results supported an increase to size standards. To evaluate the impact of the changes to size standards adopted in this final rule on the Federal contracting market and SBA's loan programs, SBA analyzed FPDS-NG data for fiscal years 2018-2020 and internal data on its guaranteed loan programs for fiscal years 2018-2020. The results of this analysis can be found in the Regulatory Impact Analysis section of this final rule.</p><p>In the proposed rule, SBA sought comments on its proposal to increase size standards for 68 industries and subindustries and retain the current size standards for the remaining 35 industries in NAICS Sectors 11, 21, 22 and 23. Specifically, SBA requested comments on whether the proposed revisions are appropriate for the industries covered by the proposed rule, whether the decision not to lower any size standards is justified by the COVID-19 pandemic, whether the equal weighting of individual factors to derive an industry size standard is appropriate, and whether the data sources used were appropriate or sufficient.</p><p>Discussion of Comments</p><p>SBA received a total of 1,021 comments to the proposed rule from a wide range of entities, including individuals, businesses, organizations, and trade associations. Of the 1,021 comments received, 1,013 comments pertained to Sector 11--including 942 comments that pertained to the animal production industries and 71 comments that pertained to the Agricultural (Sector 11) industry generally. SBA also received three comments on NAICS 115310 (Support Activities for Forestry) and its two exceptions, and one comment each on NAICS codes 237990 (the dredging exception), 236220 and NAICS Sector 23. SBA received one comment that was not relevant to the proposed rule and 1 comment that voiced a general objection to the proposed rule without providing any rationale. The comments to the proposed rule are available at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.regulations.gov\">www.regulations.gov</url> (RIN 3245-AG89) and are summarized and discussed below.</p><p>Comments on Proposed Changes to Sector 11--Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting</p><p>SBA received a total of 1,013 comments to its proposed changes to size standards for industries in Sector 11. Of the 1,013 comments received, 942 comments, many of which were nearly identical, objected to the proposed rule on the grounds that it would result in Federal funding for corporate animal agribusiness, including concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs). These commenters stated that the increase of certain agricultural size standards would result in large corporate agricultural concerns with potentially abusive animal practices qualifying as small for SBA's financial assistance programs. Most of these commenters did not identify a particular NAICS code or set of NAICS codes, but the SBA assumes they most likely referred to NAICS codes 112111 through 112519, which correspond to the animal production industries. The remaining 71 comments objected to the proposed changes to the size standards on the grounds that it would unfairly benefit larger businesses and farms. These comments emphasized the historical consolidation in the agricultural sector as well as larger farms receiving the majority of Federal assistance and subsidies. One commenter also cited the difficulty for smaller farms to enter the market and the prevalence of vertical integration for concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) as reasons not to raise agricultural size standards.</p><p>SBA Response</p><p>SBA disagrees with commenters that the proposed regulations will allow a significant number of large firms to qualify as small in the animal production industries, namely NAICS codes 112111, 112112, 112120, 112310, 112320, 112330, 112340, 112390, 112410, 112420, 112511, 112512 and 112519. Based on data from the 2012 Agricultural Census, SBA determined that if the proposed size standards were adopted, the number of small firms in these industries would increase from 801,603 to 821,632, an increase of 20,029 firms or 2.5%. The percentage of small firms in these industries would increase from 96.5% under current size standards to 98.9% under the proposed size standards. SBA also analyzed its internal data on 7(a) and 504 loans to determine the impact of increases to size standards on SBA's financial assistance programs for these industries.</p><p>As discussed in the proposed rule, the majority of the animal production industries previously had a $750,000 receipts-based size standard, which was established directly by Congress in section 806 of the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000, Appendix I, Public Law 106-554, 114 Stat. 2763, (December 21, 2000). In 2016, Congress passed NDAA 2017, directing SBA to establish size standards for these industries in the same manner that the agency establishes the size standards for other industries and to include them in the five-year rolling review under the Jobs Act. Effective August 19, 2019, SBA raised the $750,000 receipts-based size standard for these industries to $1 million in an interim final rule, adjusting all monetary size standards for inflation (84 FR 34261 (July 18, 2019)).</p><p>Based on the data for fiscal years 2019-2020, the time period when the higher $1 million size standard was effective, SBA did not see any increase to the total number of firms receiving loans in the animal production industries identified above. Recognizing that firms may have qualified for SBA's financial assistance programs under the tangible net worth and net income based alternative size standard, and thus, may have exceeded the industry size standard, SBA also analyzed the distribution of loans by revenue and determined that there was not an increase in the number of loans to firms with revenues between $0.75 million and $1 million during fiscal years 2019-2020. SBA found that the average firm size of businesses receiving loans was much smaller than the current $1 million industry size standard, indicating that larger small firms are not the primary beneficiaries of SBA's financial assistance programs.</p><p>Generally, the majority of loans guaranteed by SBA through its 7(a) and CDC/504 loan programs are disbursed to firms that are much smaller than the industry size standard, in part due to the SBA's \"credit elsewhere\" test (13 CFR 120.101). This test requires lenders to certify that an applicant to the SBA's loan program is unable to obtain a loan on reasonable terms without a Federal Government guaranty, and that some or all of the loan is not available from the resources of the applicant business or the personal resources of the principals of the applicant business. SBA's proposed changes to size standards do not impact this requirement; thus, smaller small firms are more likely to remain the primary beneficiaries of SBA's financial assistance programs as firms at the margin of SBA's industry size standards are more likely to be able to obtain credit elsewhere.</p><p>For the above reasons, SBA does not anticipate that a 2.5% increase to the total number of small firms in the animal production industries will unfairly favor larger small firms in those industries, particularly those that may be classified as CAFOs, to the detriment of smaller small firms in accessing SBA's financial assistance. Therefore, SBA is adopting the size standards for the animal production industries identified above, as proposed.</p><p>[FR Doc. 2022-06604 Filed 3-30-22; 8:45 am]</p><p>BILLING CODE 8026-03-P</p><p>The document is published in the Federal Register: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/03/31/2022-06604/small-business-size-standards-agriculture-forestry-fishing-and-hunting-mining-quarrying-and-oil-and\">https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/03/31/2022-06604/small-business-size-standards-agriculture-forestry-fishing-and-hunting-mining-quarrying-and-oil-and</url></p><p>TARGETED NEWS SERVICE (founded 2004) features non-partisan 'edited journalism' news briefs and information for news organizations, public policy groups and individuals; as well as 'gathered' public policy information, including news releases, reports, speeches.

I peeked inside from the sidewalk through open accordion doors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I've been on this route for five years,\" Collier said Monday afternoon. \"The kids know me. The parents know me. When they're on my bus, they're <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">my</emphasis> kids.\"</p><p>For children inside the school at that moment, Monday was the first time they had been back inside a classroom since the coronavirus shut down schools in March. Wallingford-Swarthmore School District is among a select number of suburban Philadelphia districts that have begun reopening to partial-week instruction. It is momentous for children and parents alike in this ever-so-disorienting pandemic year.</p><p>A fraction of what so many of us have lost during this terribly managed coronavirus pandemic was visible right there inside Collier's idled school bus. A bus that, in a normal year, is packed with spunky kids who like to needle - and be needled by - the driver they all call \"Mister Howard!\"</p><p>\"I had two brothers this morning,\" Collier said, and for a moment I thought he was singling out a pair on a reasonably full bus.</p><p>I was wrong.</p><p>He had <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">two kids total</emphasis> on the whole bus Monday morning.</p><p>\"I don't see any relief from this whole mess,\" he said of the pandemic and its effect on our lives, still.</p><p>I had dropped off my own sons at school in adifferent district Monday for their own stab at two days a week of in-person instruction. It's all that crowded public schools can manage without turning classrooms into the kind of petri dish that President Donald Trump apparently has been presiding over at the White House.</p><p>What I saw in both districts was, like so much else in this crazy year, a confusing if also welcome scene: Kids and adults wearing masks without flinching. A crowd at less than half capacity. Everyone marching through a New Normal that does not feel normal, even though the numbness of this terrible year makes today feel slightly better than yesterday, and last week, and the month before that.</p><p>For six long months (and counting in Philadelphia and other districts that have yet to reopen their actual classrooms at all), schools had been shuttered.</p><p>The sound of them back on the scene, if in shockingly fewer numbers due to staggering of schedules and decisions by other families to stay home, was glorious.</p><p>\"They launched like arocket!\" I heard a teacher say from beneath a canopy of trees just outside the Swarthmore elementary school's front doors. I was sitting on a wooden bench nearby, eavesdropping. She held open a hardback book and dangled it over eight masked first graders seated on the grass in criss-cross applesauce style. They were reading <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Awful Aardvarks Go to School.</emphasis></p><p>The children chirped. It was like a burst of oxygen in a smothering forest fire. I kept turning my eyes toward a nearby mylar balloon tied to awooden bench. It swayed in the sunny, crisp pre-Halloween air. \"WELCOME BACK,\" it said.</p><p>\"Now listen carefully, my first graders,\" the teacher continued. \"We're going to go back into the classroom. We're going to wash our hands, and then it's time for a snack.\"</p><p>The children marched past me at six-feet-apart intervals. One little boy appeared to be talking animatedly about a tiny creature.</p><p>\"I learned about it on<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wild Kratts</emphasis>,\" he told a classmate as they breezed past. \"It's the size of a tip of a pin!\"</p><p>The return of children to even just some of our region's suburban schools, while a huge milestone, was also bittersweet given the backdrop of drama in the White House. Our mask-averse president was hospitalized until Monday evening with COVID-19. He had been whisked to the hospital Friday via helicopter, for all the world to see, aportrait of hypocrisy and ineptitude. The fearless leader who spent much of the year talking down masks and doing little to nothing to help public schools reopen with resources to do so safely, was in the hospital while children finally began to squeeze out a few hours of school again, no thanks to his incompetent administration.</p><p>\"I'm happy for my son,\" Christine Anderson said of 6-year-old first-grader R.J. Contraday, moments before he emerged from his first day back since March. \"He shed a couple of tears this morning.\"</p><p>All around, parents and kids were wearing masks. No one was whining about personal liberty or politics. They were acting, in other words, like grown-ups act when a common goal is identified that requires a touch of communal sacrifice.</p><p>I asked Cora Alessi, 43, after she greeted her fifth- and first-grade children, what she thought of the year. Her attention turned to Trump.</p><p>\"I thought it was ironic that he got sick,\" Alessi said. \"The one person opposed to a mask got sick.\"</p><p>Principal Angela Tuck and kindergarten teacher Ellen Cooper-smith said they heard children laughing all through the halls.</p><p>\"We played 'Welcome Back Kotter' on the public address system,\" Tuck said. Children were so glad to be back, they couldn't believe they could see each other again in the flesh.</p><p>\"One little girl actually said, 'I wish there wasn't any COVID,' \" Coopersmith said. But - and here is where the light of this dark time can, indeed, be found: \"The kids are not scared.\"</p><p>\"The kids,\" she added, \"are happy.\"</p><p>+<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:mpanaritis@inquirer.com\">mpanaritis@inquirer.com</email></p><p>^610-313-8117 \"panaritism</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHIDLY-PHDN20201006Ar00700</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHIDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:610S-R311-JC3R-B0M0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247246</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"889\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Philadelphia Daily News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 6, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp; TEENS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N611110QM</classCode><className>PRIMARY SCHOOLS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009P1Q</classCode><className>SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002064</classCode><className>EPIDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOXW</classCode><className>PANDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009P0D</classCode><className>SCHOOL DISTRICTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001434</classCode><className>PUBLIC SCHOOLS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOZG</classCode><className>SCHOOL CLOSINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX002145</classCode><className>VIRUSES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001175</classCode><className>MOTORCOACHES &amp; BUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N611110QM</classCode><className>PRIMARY SCHOOLS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001378</classCode><className>PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N610000CC</classCode><className>EDUCATIONAL SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001434</classCode><className>PUBLIC SCHOOLS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>PE0009THX</classCode><className>DONALD TRUMP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GX602</classCode><className>PHILADELPHIA, PA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS154</classCode><className>PENNSYLVANIA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Former Obama Attorney General Eric Holder joins me live at this hour.</p><p>Also tonight, new details on an astonishing emergency landing by an untrained airplane passenger forced to take the helm after the pilot was in incapacitated. The air traffic controller who help guide the plane to safety is taking CNN inside the harrowing ordeal.</p><p>We want to welcome our viewers here in the United States and around the world, I am Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM.</p><p>Tonight, Ukraine is claiming several victories in the hotly contested terrains around Kharkiv, a major city just miles from the Russian border.</p><p>CNN's Scott McLean is on ground for us in Lviv with more on the Ukrainian counteroffensive. Oren Liebermann is joining us live from the Pentagon with a new U.S. assessment from top U.S. defense officials.</p><p>But let's begin with Scott for more on the developments near Kharkiv. Scott, this is highly important territory near a pivotal city and Ukraine now says it has the upper hand.</p><p>SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Exactly, Wolf. They are starting to take back towns and villages outside of Kharkiv. In some places, Wolf, they say that they are mere miles from the Russian border, a border that Ukrainians say the Russians have amassed a huge amount of troops on, 20 battalion tactical groups which is about 18,000 troops. So, clearly, the Russians could strike back at any moment.</p><p>The Ukrainians are urging civilians not to return back to these retaken villages and towns because they are heavily mined and also they are very much within Russian artillery range.</p><p>Russia though is also within artillery range now for Ukrainian shelling. And the governor of the Belgorod region in Russia says that for the first time a civilian was killed by Ukrainian shelling in a village six miles inside of the border.</p><p>Now, this is not the first time that there has been explosion in that region, though the Ukrainians have not been keen to take responsibility for them.</p><p>And, Wolf, in the southern part of the country, in the Kherson region, the Kremlin appointed leaders of this occupied territory are putting, or planning to put in a formal request to join the Russian Federation without any kind of referendum. They say that they could be issuing passports and citizenship documents by the end of the year. The Kremlin says that it is the people of Kherson who should be deciding what to do, though they are not calling for a referendum either.</p><p>BLITZER: Scott, as you know, Ukrainians now say the latest shipments of foreign weapons supplied by the U.S. and other NATO partners have already started to arrive at the frontlines. What kind of impact is all this having?</p><p>MCLEAN: Yes, the Ukrainian say that they are getting into a rhythm, getting into a flow of these weapons shipments and then delivery throughout the country. The United States, the Pentagon says that 89 out of the 90 howitzers for instance that it's pledged to Ukraine are already inside of the country. These are modern day artillery systems.</p><p>Also consider that Russia has a troop advantage of -- they have 4.5 times the number of troops at their disposal compares to the Ukrainians. But at least when it comes to military hardware, Ukrainians now say that it is getting to the point where the Russians no longer have a clear advantage when it comes to equipment. Wolf?</p><p>BLITZER: Very interesting. All right, Scott McLean on the scene for us, thank you very much.</p><p>The Russian assault on Kharkiv flattens countless buildings and left scores of civilians, men and children dead, Ukrainians. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh has a story of one Ukrainian woman who survived for hours buried beneath the rubble after a Russian airstrike.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY EDITOR (voice over): Sometimes places that speak only of death throw up a jewel of life. This is the first time Ayuna has stood in this spot. Since 72 days ago, she was dragged out from the rubble here. Her husband, Andrey, had been scouring it, looking for her for three hours.</p><p>[18:05:02]</p><p>She remembers the cupboard.</p><p>AYUNA MOROZOVA, KHARKIV BLAST SURVIVOR: That was where I was standing.</p><p>WALSH: The, multiple rocket attacks on this, the Kharkiv regional administration was an early sign of the ferocious, cowardly brutality Russia would unleash on civilian target. This is Ayuna then. She had been serving coffee and cookies to soldiers, sort of flashed (ph) and curled into a ball (ph).</p><p>MOROZOVA: I fear of physical manifestation of fear. I don't like cookies anymore. The box fell on me and I remember the smell.</p><p>WALSH: She asked to step away, saying she's sick of butterflies like she hasn't not felt since before races when she used to swim professionally. Andrey picks up the story.</p><p>ANDREY MOROZOV, AYUNA'S HUSBAND: When I heard her voice, I was crawling across the rubble and the emergency services were trying to kick me out. I pulled a man out and then heard her. I did not plan to leave her here.</p><p>WALSH: The soldiers waiting in the corridor outside from her died, the young woman in the basement below here died. Their bodies not found for three weeks, yet somehow the concrete here fell and shielding Ayuna.</p><p>MOROZOVA: I knew I was alive, in pain but nothing broken but was worried that I would be left and never be heard. The first time they heard me, they started to get me out and the second missile came and I was properly trapped.</p><p>WALSH: A rescuer eventually heard her.</p><p>MOROZOVA: Andrey got closer and I said it was me and he cried. They said they should not lift the baton on me but Andrey did, alone. It got easier to breathe. I was surprised as I thought I was still at ground level. The ambulance guy said it is your second birthday, you are alive.</p><p>WALSH: Fragments of the Kharkiv now past peppered the shell, cleaning up and trying to sweep away its trauma.</p><p>MOROZOVA: I sleep with the lights on. And when there is a loud car or, God forbidden, a jet plane, I brace. The nightmares that I am again lying there in and shivering cold and that nobody hears my cries, that also stops me from sleeping. WALSH: Ayuna was born in Russia but could no longer talk to her relatives there. She says they believe Russian state media's absurd claims this is a limited operation against Nazi's.</p><p>MOROZOVA: They say it was my stupidity and that I don't need to be here. I hope when time passes our children can talk but I can't talk to them now. Russia has lost its minds and cannot control its president. They are all each responsible, every citizen.</p><p>WALSH: The story here not of ruins, loss or burial in dust but instead of the feverish energy that burns through the building's bones, as Kharkiv, gets to decide where it's pieces fall now.</p><p>Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, Kharkiv, Ukraine.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BLITZER: Nick, thank you very, very much.</p><p>Now to CNN's Oren Leibermann is over at the Pentagon. Oren, I understand top U.S. defense officials, they are reacting today publicly to Russia's use of these hypersonic missiles in Ukraine, the first time these weapons have been used in combat, were told. What did they say?</p><p>OREN LEIBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: The U.S. has watched all of the launches of hypersonic missiles from the Russians, not only to learn about the use of such weapons in combat, the top U.S. general says the first time they've been used in combat anywhere, but also to learn about the capabilities of the Russian military.</p><p>Now, according to Russian claims and U.S. assessments, Russia has used a few different kinds of hypersonic missiles, mostly essentially short-range ballistic missiles. The Tochka, the Iskander, those are ground-launched, as well as the Kinzhal, which is an air-launched version of those missiles.</p><p>But despite all of the hype around these and the growing concern you hear in the U.S., especially among politicians, that the U.S. is falling behind Russia and China when it comes to hypersonic developments, the conclusion was that these weren't the game changer that many had feared they would be if they were used on the battlefield.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEN. MARK MILLEY, JOINT CHIEFS CHAIRMAN: In terms of their effect of a given target, we are not seeing really significant or game-changing effects to date with the delivery of the small number of hypersonics that the Russians have used.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEIBERMANN: The Pentagon says that Russia has used somewhere between 10 and 12 hypersonic missiles since this war began about two and half months ago. [18:10:00]</p><p>As for why that remains pretty much an open question but they believe it might be an indication that Russia is running out of smart weapons, precision-guided munitions and has had to come to these hypersonic weapons to simply carry out their attacks.</p><p>They also note, Wolf, that the targets are centrally structures or buildings, not dynamic moving targets, and that tells you something about Russia's inability to hit moving targets, perhaps. Wolf?</p><p>BLITZER: Yes, very significant information. Oren Liebermann at the Pentagon, thank you.</p><p>Just ahead, CNN is now learning new information about potential high- profile witnesses who could appear at public January 6 select committee hearings next month. A key member of the panel, Congressman Adam Schiff, he's standing by live, he will join us when we come back.</p><p>[18:15:00]</p><p>BLITZER: We're following breaking news. We now have new information about next month's public January 6th select committee hearing. Sources tell CNN the panel is finalizing its witness list, which could include some high-profile figures in the investigation.</p><p>Our Congressional Correspondent Ryan Nobles is joining us live from Capitol Hill right now. Ryan, tell our viewers what you are learning.</p><p>RYAN NOBLES, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right, Wolf. These hearings now is less than month away and they are important to the January 6 select committee because it is going to be the first time that they really present with a great deal of specificity of this work that they have been doing largely behind closed doors for the better part of ten months.</p><p>And you're right, at this point, they have not finalized that witness lists. As far as we've learned, they have not even reach to potential witnesses. But there are a number of people that they have already talked to behind closed doors who they might want to bring some of that testimony out into the light, people like the former acting attorney general, Jeffery Rosen, his deputy, Richard Donoghue, as well as people that were close to the former vice president, Mike Pence, including his Chief of Staff Marc Short and his Chief Counsel Greg Jacob.</p><p>Now, there's also some witnesses who the committee has spoken to who may not be interested in coming forward and speaking publicly, but the committee does have a way around that as well. People like Ivanka Trump, her husband, Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of the former president, and his son, Donald Trump Jr. The committee, we've learn, has videotaped many of these depositions. And there's always a possibility that if these folks are not brought forward to testify publicly, that the committee could play clips of these witness testimony. And we've been told for some time, that video tapes and other elements will be a big part of this multimedia presentation what it all happens.</p><p>And we've also learned that they exerted to zero in on some topics that they want to cover during these hearings. There's going to be eight in total, and including what President Trump is doing during the riot. There were a lot of times that is unaccounted in the president's schedule. Also the efforts to pull false election fraud claims, how law enforcement responded to riot on that day and then, of course, the organizing and financing of the January 6 rally.</p><p>You know, Wolf, the committee has taken into so much information and this is their opportunity to distill some of that information and put together some of the things that they have learned and present it to the American people.</p><p>But as they get these presentations together, they are still taking in more information. The National Archives announced today that they are releasing an eight tranche of documents from the Trump White House, some 23,000 emails and attachments that will soon be in the hands of the committee. So, even as they are sifting through the thousands and thousands of documents they already have, Wolf, they are still taking in more information and they are also continuing interviews and depositions of many potential witnesses. Wolf?</p><p>BLITZER: Yes. Starting next early month, we'll start seeing some of the evidence that the committees -- the select committee has collected and these hearings, no doubt, will be televise. We will watch them very, very closely. Ryan Nobles up on Capitol Hill, thanks very much.</p><p>Let's bring in a key Member of January 6 select committee, the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, Congressman Adam Schiff of California. Congressman, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>Will these hearings lay out new insight into the insurrection? Will they reveal for example details that are so far not been made public?</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): Without a doubt, there will be new information and new details. Certainly, the public is aware of a lot of information already through a lot of impressive reporting about the multiple lines of effort to overturn the presidential election. But we expect in these multimedia presentations, that include live testimony, video, audio, documentary evidence, to provide a kind of important texture to this nefarious effort for the first time in our history to overturn a presidential election, interfere with the peaceful of transfer of power. We want to expose the action of the malefactors to the public scrutiny.</p><p>BLITZER: So, what is the strategy, Congressman, for the witnesses who are refusing to testify publicly? They've testified behind closed doors, but publicly? Are you willing, for example, to agree to ground rules to get some of these reluctant witnesses to speak out during these televised hearings?</p><p>SCHIFF: Well, you know, Wolf, we'll have to take it on a case by case basis. The reality is we have so much information, the challenges to decide, okay, these are the most important witnesses, these are the most important pieces of evidence. We do have to obviously hone things down. But it is, I think, essential to tell the story, the complete story to the American people.</p><p>It was not just about January 6. That was the violent culmination of a lot of different effects to overturn the election, to coerce state legislators and local election officials through bogus litigations, through pressure campaigns on the vice president, through voting to overturn the election in the House of Representatives.</p><p>[18:20:03]</p><p>So, we want to lay out that whole picture before the country.</p><p>BLITZER: Will the American public, Congressman, see video clips from the tape interviews your committee has already conducted with witnesses and we're talking about several witnesses, including Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, for example?</p><p>SCHIFF: You know, we will certainly considered using evidence that came from the depositions in a variety of different forms. We want to make this visually interesting to the viewing public and we are not going to call all the witnesses because we've interviewed hundreds of them.</p><p>So, I think it will be a combination of live testimony. It maybe some videotaped interviews. It may be audio tapes or maybe T.V. clips. I think you will see really a clever integration of this different source of information to tell the story and tell it in an easily digestible form.</p><p>BLITZER: I'm really looking forward to this public televise hearing. Let me turn while I have you, Congressman, to Ukraine. You're the chairman of the Intelligence Committee. The House just passed a $40 billion Ukraine aid package, it's now waiting on a Senate vote and waiting, of course, for President Biden's signature after the Senate passes it. Will this be enough and will it arrive fast enough to tip the scales on the battlefield in Ukraine's favor?</p><p>SCHIFF: It will arrive quick enough if we can get the Senate to act and we can get that over to the president. I can't tell you that the aid that we have approved thus far have moved very quickly from congressional approval to presidential approval and onto the battlefield and dispersed to where it needs to go in Ukraine. So, those supply lines are now well orchestrated and Ukrainians have, I think, done an extraordinary job in getting the materials to their fighters and to defend the country.</p><p>Will this ultimately be the last? It really depends on how long the conflict goes on. But I think the more that we do now, the quicker we can bring this to an end once Putin realizes he has not accomplished his objectives there and the cost to Russia had simply becoming too high, costs in terms of Russian lives and costs in terms of the sanctions and the impact on the Russian economy and the Russian people. BLITZER: Yes. So far, the delivery of these Javelins, these howitzers, these Stingers, they have move very, very quickly. Congressman Adam Schiff, thank you very much for joining us.</p><p>SCHIFF: Thank you.</p><p>BLITZER: Coming up, inflation here in the United States at a 40-year high and causing real financial hardships for millions of Americans. We're going to take a closer look at the hard choices that some are having to make. We'll be right back.</p><p>[18:25:00]</p><p>BLITZER: President Biden is trying to shift focus to his predecessor as the United States faces the highest inflation in 40 years.</p><p>Let's go to our Chief White House Correspondent Kaitlan Collins. Kaitlan, what's the latest over there?</p><p>KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Wolf. The president said today that he is heartened by the modest decrease in prices that this new information released by the federal government today showed. But the fact to the matter is he still believes that these inflation numbers are way too high, and that includes food prices, Wolf, which we are seeing in this report rose 0.9 percent in the month of April from the previous month.</p><p>That is what took President Biden to a farm in Illinois today. Where he was talking about efforts that they are taking to try to boost food production here in the United States, not just an issue here but also one globally, as the president was praising farmers that he was meeting with while on the ground in Illinois.</p><p>But, Wolf, also he is trying to push this debate back on Republicans who have been sharply critical of his handling of the economy of the inflation rates that we have seen and the concerns that officials have had, until later in Chicago, he even brought up his predecessor and talked about his handling of what's happening right now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: Under my predecessor, the great MAGA-king, the deficit increase every single year he was president.</p><p>They don't want solve inflation by lowering the cost. That wanted to solve by raising taxes and lowering your income.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COLLINS: That comment there obviously a dig at Senator Rick Scott in an economic proposal that he put out. We should not that this one that has been rejected by people, like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Of course this is still expected to be the debate that you are going to see the president pursuing, Wolf, over the next six months now that, of course, as this inflation numbers are still as high as they are, despite coming down, are dominating the political landscape.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes, they are. Kaitlan Collins at the White House, thank you.</p><p>With inflation now to 40-year high here in the United States, the financial impact is painful for many Americans and forcing some to make very hard choices.</p><p>CNN's Brian Todd is working this part of the story for us. Brian, almost all of Americans' daily necessities are still much more expensive than they were, what, a year ago?</p><p>BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Wolf. There is been almost no break for Americans and places like this grocery stores seemed to be what consumers are feeling the most.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TODD (voice over): At a grocery store in Northeast D.C., shoppers are more than a little fed up with food prices.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You know it's high. It is hard trying to balance, you know, what you need and what you want.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Everything from sodas, to meats, to vegetables, everything has just increased.</p><p>TODD: According to new government figures, annual inflation did ease off a little bit last month but is still a near 40-year high, prices rising 8.3 percent for the year ending in April, slightly lower than the 8.5 percent rise through March.</p><p>[18:30:00]</p><p>And food was one of the biggest factors along with shelter. In just a month, meat, poultry, fish and eggs when up 1.4 percent, with eggs by themselves spiking 10.3 percent.</p><p>What have you noticed most gone up?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, it would be the eggs, because a while ago they were really cheap.</p><p>TODD: And housing costs for renters and owners went up 0.5 percent for the third month in a row, consumers taking a big hit each month.</p><p>MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ANALYTICS: The typical American households are spending $450 more now than a year ago that buy the same goods and services, and that's because of the higher inflation. So, this is incredibly painful.</p><p>TODD: Gas prices dipped last month but are now back to setting records, the national average for regular at $4.40 a gallon, up a $1.40 since a year ago.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So, every day you walk by, I mean, drive by it's one price, and within a matter of hours, it will jump up again.</p><p>TODD: Analysts say with inflation this high, millions of Americans families already struggling to make ends meet due to pandemic may still have to make tough choices.</p><p>MICHELLE SINGLETARY, AUTHOR, WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR MONEY WHEN CRISIS HITS: It really will mean that some people might actually have to skip a meal. Maybe they can't feed their children the way they want to. They will perhaps not be able to cover their rent or all of their rent.</p><p>TODD: But on the bright side, at least one top economist says there could be relief in sight.</p><p>ZANDI: Inflation is peaking, I think the high inflation, that painfully high inflation is due to the pandemic and to the Russian invasion. If those things don't go off the rails, then I think we will see inflation lower by the end of the year and certainly this time next year.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TODD (on camera): Analyst Mark Zandi says that does not mean the price of everything is just going to come down. He says we should get use to high prices for things like groceries. But he says, what will actually come down, the price of gasoline, and he believes that before the end of the year, the prices of new parcels are going to come down as some of those supply chain issues can ironed out. Wolf?</p><p>BLITZER: Well, let's hope. Brian Todd, reporting for us, thank you very much. Good explanation.</p><p>Just ahead, Ukraine claims pivotal territory around the northern city of Kharkiv have been liberated from Kremlin forces. Can the Ukrainians push Putin's army all the way back to the Russian border? The former Ukrainian prime minister is standing by live, he will join us when we come back.</p><p>[18:35:00]</p><p>BLITZER: Just into CNN, new images showing Russian pantone bridges obliterated by Ukrainian artillery strikes. Kremlin forces were trying to cross a key strategic river in Eastern Ukraine. But Ukrainian attacks have frustrated those Russian attempts at least so far.</p><p>For more on that, let's bring in the former Ukrainian Prime Minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk. Prime Minister, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>As you know, the Ukrainians clearly, having some impressive success in the eastern part of the country. It says it recaptured some territory around Kharkiv, but how much of the Eastern Donbas region does Russia now control?</p><p>ARSENIY YATSENYUK, FORMER UKRAINIAN PRIME MINISTER: Well, that's for Ukrainian army over launched a number of counter offensive operations and we are doing quite well and do really commend the Biden administration and bipartisan support. President Biden already signed the Land Lease Act into law and we expect the U.S. Congress is to pass, and to President Biden is to sign $40 billion support act of Ukraine, and this really helps.</p><p>On the other hand, Wolf, look, I want to be very realistic. Putin decided to actually -- to wage a new type of war which is a war of attrition. This is to be a long-lasting war. And we are not to under estimate this bloody Nazi-style, dictator Putin. So, that's the reason why so much needed support of Ukrainian military that is delivered by the United States is of crucial important importance.</p><p>I just got the report that American made howitzers and M3777 are already at the frontlines and they are defending Ukraine. So, on the one hand, we launched a counteroffensive, on the other hand we are not underestimate Putin and his bloody military.</p><p>BLITZER: You may have heard President Zelenskyy today say, and I'm quoting him now, with each new Bucha, with each new Mariupol, the desire to negotiate with Russia, he says, disappears. Instead of talks, will Ukraine keep pushing for a more decisive military victory to gain leverage for some deal down the road?</p><p>YATSENYUK: Well, here is the thing. Last month, we discussed whether there is any chance for a diplomatic solution. I was, I am and I will be very skeptical about any kind of diplomatic solution with Russia. They have the number of options and they have the number of window opportunities not even to wage this war. But Putin -- you know there's no even off-ramp for Putin because he cornered himself. And that's the biggest problem.</p><p>So, I believe the only chance for us to cut any kind of deal is to win at the battlefield. The only victory is the victory of Ukrainian military, which is to reclaim the territories that have been occupied by the Russian military, and only afterwards Putin may be to realize that there is no other options rather than to push back and to sit at some kind of a negotiating table and to hammer out the deal.</p><p>But the deal is very clear. Ukraine is to restore its territorial integrity and Russia is to respect Ukraine as an independent country.</p><p>BLITZER: And the speedy of the delivery of the U.S. weaponry, the howitzers, and all the other equipment, that will certainly help in your effort.</p><p>[18:40:02]</p><p>The former Ukrainian prime minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk --</p><p>YATSENYUK: No doubt.</p><p>BLITZER: -- thank you so much for joining us. I want to continue our conversations down the road. I appreciate it very, very much. Thank you.</p><p>YATSENYUK: Thank you.</p><p>BLITZER: There is more breaking news coming up next. A key vote to protect access to abortion here in the United States fails in the Senate, just ahead of a possible Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. We're going to talk about that and more with the former Obama attorney general, Eric Holder. He's standing by live.</p><p>Plus, new details of how an air traffic controller taught a man who never flown a plane to a safe landing after the pilot passed out.</p><p>[18:45:00]</p><p>BLITZER: Breaking news tonight, a key procedural vote to protect access to abortion has just failed in the United States Senate by a vote of 49 to 51 with Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia joining Republicans to block the measure from advancing. This comes as a leaked draft shows the Supreme Court's new conservative majority likely to overturn Roe versus Wade, the ruling that the right to an abortion almost 50 years ago.</p><p>Let's talk about this and more with the former Obama attorney general of the United States, Eric Holder.</p><p>Attorney General, thank you so much for joining us. Your new book is entitled \"Our Unfinished March: The Violent Past and Imperiled Future of the Vote, A History, A Crisis, A Plan\".</p><p>Thanks so much, Attorney General, for writing this book. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>You say be surprised if the final opinion in the Supreme Court reflects the language in Justice Alito's original draft. But even if the tone is water down a bit, do you expect the U.S. Supreme Court to ultimately overturn Roe versus Wade?</p><p>ERIC HOLDER, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL: I think the point you make is a good one. Whatever I say about the language is secondary to what I think the court is likely to do, which is to overturn Roe versus Wade, turn its back on the precedent, turn its back on the reliance that people have put into the Roe decision over the course of the last almost 50 years. This is going to have a seismic impact on our nation. And I think have a negative impact on the views of many people with regard to the legitimacy of the Supreme Court.</p><p>BLITZER: In your new book, which I've gone through, obviously you call this, and I'm quoting now, you call this quote, stolen Supreme Court, your words. You describe a quote, illegitimate conservative majority.</p><p>Have you, the former attorney general of the United States, lost faith in the legitimacy of the U.S. Supreme Court? HOLDER: I wouldn't say not -- I wouldn't say I lost total faith in the legitimacy of the court, and yet, if Merrick Garland had an opportunity to have a hearing and had been confirmed. And if we had not rush to have Amy Coney Barrett confirmed while people were voting, you would now have a 54 Supreme Court progressives as opposed to conservatives.</p><p>And he would be in a fundamental place with regard to this decision concerning Roe versus Wade. And also with regard to a whole range of other issues that the court has decided since the time that Merrick Garland should've been on the court.</p><p>BLITZER: As you know, in Florida right now, it looks like an injunction is coming to block Governor Ron DeSantis's congressional map over concerns it would illegally harm black voters in Florida. But DeSantis is already gearing up to appeal.</p><p>When it comes to this erosion of voting rights, and you write a lot about in your new book, do you feel like you've got a garden hose to fight a forest fire?</p><p>HOLDER: I think we actually have, and we don't understand as Americans, we actually have the necessary tools to fight, as you described, this forest fire of voter suppression. What's happened in Florida today is an indication of when people gather together, go to court, ask judges to look at what people in the executive branch or somebody like the sentence is trying to do and then DeSantis gets knocked down. You've seen people around the country put in place, independent commissions to do the registering to fight gerrymandering.</p><p>It really will involve, as we've, seen as we talk about in the book, when ordinary people, so-called ordinary people get together and really commit themselves, dedicate themselves, prepare to sacrifice. You can make fundamental structural changes to the United States government. And that is what is called upon us to do right now. This is a democracy that is at risk, a democracy that is in peril, but not one that cannot be saved.</p><p>BLITZER: You write a lot about your fears about democracy in America and he worn, in your new, book that America could go down a path where you, and I'm quoting you now, a minority party that doesn't represent the interests or the desires of the people would hold on to power by rigging the system in its favor. That's a direct quote from you.</p><p>Do you believe the country is already there?</p><p>HOLDER: I'm not sure we're already there but we certainly have, we see instances of minority rule in a variety of states as a result of partisan and racial gerrymandering, where you have these abortion laws being passed that are not supported by the majority of the people in the states, and yet, legislators vote for them knowing that they are in safe, gerrymandered districts and they face no electoral consequence for them.</p><p>I'm also worried about how elections could be rigged, given we have seen grow out of the fallacies of January the 6th. And this notion of, stolen election, this notion of voters casting votes illegally.</p><p>[18:50:02]</p><p>All of that is simply not bolstered by the facts. And yet policies are being put in place, people, career people being removed from key elections positions and replaced by partisans.</p><p>And I have to add, to be fair, some really good Republican career folks like Vanderbilt in Michigan, potentially Raffensperger in Georgia, people who are Republicans and simply do their jobs. And as a result of doing their jobs, they are being removed by the party.</p><p>BLITZER: The former attorney general of the United States, Eric Holder, thanks so much for joining us. Thanks for writing \"Our Unfinished March: The Violent Past and Imperiled Future of the Vote: A History, A Crisis, A Plan\". There's the cover.</p><p>Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>HOLDER: Thanks, Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: Other news we are following tonight, the U.S. State Department is strongly condemning the killing of a PalestinianAmerican journalist who was shot while killed covering an Israeli military operation.</p><p>CNN's Hadas Gold is joining us from Jerusalem right now.</p><p>Hadas, Israel says it is investigating the killing, what more are you learning tonight?</p><p>HADAS GOLD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, I am standing outside the house of Shireen Abu Akleh. She is the veteran Al Jazeera correspondent, who was shot and killed today while on assignment, while covering an Israeli military operation, what the IDF is saying was a counterterrorism operation in the west bank town of Jenin. There is very disturbing video scene right after she was shot, showing her very clearly wearing a protective vest and helmet with the big words press across the vast.</p><p>These are things we see so many journals wearing in conflict zones. Her producer Ali Al-Samoudi was also shot, but he is in stable condition. And he saying that it was Israeli forces that shot at them. He is saying that there were no Palestinian militants directly near them.</p><p>Now, Al Jazeera is directly blaming Israeli forces for Shireen's death. They are calling the international community to hold them to account.</p><p>Now, Israeli Defense Forces are saying, as they're saying earlier, that they were operating in the area as part of a counterterrorism operations. They came under heavy fire, they said. Although initially suggesting potentially that it was Palestinian militants who Shireen got caught up in the crossfire, are now softening that. Saying at this stage it is not possible to determine who was shot there. The Defense Minister Bennie Gantz is now vowing an investigation, saying that he wants to do a joint investigation from Palestinians and Israelis -- Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: We will stay on top of the story. Hadas Gold in Jerusalem, thank you very much.</p><p>Up next, we're going to tell you what has been called a miracle landing. How a man who has never flown a plane before actually want up safely touching down.</p><p>[18:57:04]</p><p>BLITZER: Tonight, a nearly one billion dollar settlement has been announced of the deadly collapse of that condo building last here in Surfside Florida. And attorney for the victims' families says they've agreed on a tentative deal for $997 million. Ninety-eight people died when the building collapse from the middle of the night, last June.</p><p>Also tonight, a unique plane landing. The pilot passed out in the only other person on board had never flown a plane before.</p><p>CNN's Carlos Suarez reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TOWER: Caravan 333LD, Ft. Piece Tower.</p><p>CARLOS SUAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A new pilot has joined the ranks of heroes like Captain Sully.</p><p>DARREN HARRISON, PASSENGER: I've got a serious situation here.</p><p>SUAREZ: Except this guy is not a true pilot at all.</p><p>HARRISON: My pilot has incoherent, and I have no idea how to fly an airplane.</p><p>SUAREZ: Darren Harrison is in the passenger who had to land a single engine Cessna coming back from the Bahamas Tuesday after the pilot was incapacitated.</p><p>TOWER: Caravan 333LD, Roger, what's your position?</p><p>HARRISON: I have no idea. Ocean in front of me, I have no idea.</p><p>TOWER: Soon enough, the plane was located on radar about 20 miles east of Boca Raton, Florida, and air traffic controller Robert Morgan was urgently cauldron from his brake to help Harrison who suddenly in charge of landing the plane.</p><p>TOWER: What was the situation with the pilot?</p><p>HARRISON: He is incoherent. He is out. TOWER: 3LD, Roger, tried to hold the wings level and see if you can start descending for me. Push forward on the controls and descend at a very slow rate.</p><p>SUAREZ: Morgan's been an air traffic controller for 20 years and is also a flight instructor. He took us of in his Cessna today to show us just how he helped Harrison get out of the air safely.</p><p>TOWER: This is our propeller which moves the blades.</p><p>SUAREZ: Even given me a chance to taken over the controls.</p><p>I've never done this before. You get the call. What's the first thing that I need to do?</p><p>ROBERT MORGAN, HELPED PASSENGER LAND PLANE: So, he was kind of like stable, right? He was already stable at 3,000, you're just going to grab the control wheel. Gentle. Not a lot of pressure. It's like holding your first girlfriend's hand.</p><p>SUAREZ: Teaching two novice pilots to fly in just two days time.</p><p>MORGAN: So you have the controls, so you're flying now.</p><p>SUAREZ: If there was ever a moment of panic for either Morgan or Harrison, you would never know by listening to their calm exchange over the radio.</p><p>MORGAN: He was a really good listener.</p><p>SUAREZ: And how good of a landing was it?</p><p>MORGAN: I would rate his landing a ten. So, I've never flown that plane and he landed it safely and didn't damage it and didn't damage, nobody got hurt.</p><p>SUAREZ: The two are definitely happy to see each other after the plane was on the ground.</p><p>MORGAN: I was just about in two years. I didn't cry, trying to be strong. Look very manly. But I kind of wanted to cry. There was just a lot of emotion. Gave him a big bear hug. Shook hands. Told him I owe him a cold beer, he said, no, I owe you.</p><p>BLITZER: CNN's Carlos Suarez reporting, thanks very much for that report.

Since August, climate change-fueled wildfires have scorched more than five million acres across the three states, taking dozens of lives, destroying thousands of buildings, and making the air unbearable for millions of people.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Benjamin Dittbrenner, an associate teaching professor in the Marine and Environmental Sciences department at Northeastern, says wetlands and beavers are an important part of the fire protection puzzle. Beaver ponds and wetlands have been shown to filter out water pollution , sequester carbon , and attenuate floods.</p><p>But perhaps a lesser-known fact about the tiny rodents is that they play a key role in creating fireproof shelters for plants and animals. And by building dams, forming ponds, and digging canals, these architects of the natural world irrigate stream corridors that help slow the spread of wildfire.</p><p>Dittbrenner, who is the director of the Environmental Science and Policy program at Northeastern, studies the effects of climate change and other types of disturbance on stream systems. Previously, in the Pacific Northwest, he spent time identifying and restoring degraded stream systems using novel approaches.</p><p>One of Dittbrenner's techniques involved relocating beavers to streams from areas where they were at risk for entrapment. As the critters went to work building dams in their new habitats, Dittbrenner evaluated the transformation of the streams into a wetland complexmultiple wetlands that share adjacent streamside land.</p><p>\"Wetlands are definitely an endangered or threatened land type,\" Dittbrenner says. \" There are a ton of existing wetland regulations, but human encroachment is really the biggest threat to that.\"</p><p>Dittbrenner traces the degradation of streams and the disappearance of natural dams to the fur trade in the 1600s, which at the time centered on the beaver. Prior to the arrival of the European settlers in North America, he says, beavers existed in nearly every stream system, and dams could be found in abundance. As the beaver population was nearly extirpated because of heavy trapping, the dams disappeared, too.</p><p>\"As those beaver dams degraded and disappeared, those [wetland] systems became much simpler,\" Dittbrenner says. \"A lot of the wetlands that were there were gone. A lot of the sediment that was there that was doing things like pollution attenuation was gone. And the flood storage capacity was gone.\"</p><p>Dittbrenner is hopeful that the recolonization of streams by beavers will aid in restoration efforts. Beaver ecosystems slow water flowsdissipating the water surge that typically occurs during big storms and leads to erosionwhile capturing the sediment that comes with the water. That's important, he says, because the erosion caused by those large storms can lead to stream channels in which the bed has dropped and as a result, the stream is disconnected from its floodplain. The resulting decrease in water availability for surrounding plants leads to forest stress, says Dittbrenner.</p><p>\"[The trees] become more prone to insect infestation,\" says Dittbrenner, explaining that forest pests contribute to the fires prevalent on the West Coast.</p><p>The dams also enable water to back up, producing pockets of both deep and shallow waters as well as rocky, sandy, and muddy habitats for birds, fish, mammals, amphibians, and reptiles, Dittbrenner says. As such, he says, the number of interactions between these species is higher.</p><p>\"Beavers are modifying the environment to create their preferred habitatwe call them ecosystem engineers,\" he says. \"In doing so, they provide all of this traditional habitat for other species, and all of these additional potential ecosystem services for people as well.\"</p><p>Research suggests that beaver ponds and wetland areas are vulnerable when there's a massive fire, Dittbrenner says. The dry areas around them will often completely burn, he says, and to some extent the wetter areas are also flammable, although those tend to recover quicker.</p><p>\"As we have these big fires, much of the vegetation in the forest (such as trees) is basically gone,\" he says. \"And it creates ash and underlying soil easily migrates when there's precipitation. When there's a big storm, all that ash and soil will washsometimes quicklydown in streams and fill up some of those streams.\"</p><p>The ash and sediment cover salmon egg nests, he says, causing the eggs to suffocate because they can't get enough oxygen. The absence of treeswhich help slow down river and overland flowleads to an uncontrolled surge of water following rainfall and increasing stream flows, which puts added stress on man-made infrastructure, such as bridges and wastewater treatment plants, Dittbrenner says.</p><p>Dittbrenner has also evaluated the effect of warmer temperatures on stream flows across the Pacific Northwest as a result of snowpack depletion. One effect this has, he says, is that it causes the water to heat up faster, and the warmer the water, the less amount of oxygen it can hold .</p><p>\"All of that dissolved oxygen that's no longer there creates these pretty extremely stressful situations for most aquatic species,\" Dittbrenner says.</p><p>And not just aquatic species, he says, but trees lose water as well. The stress makes them more prone to disease and insect infestation. This systemic stress creates what Dittbrenner calls a \"positive feedback mechanism\" that often results in environmental disasters.</p><p>\"If there's a fire, those trees might already be dried out; some might be dead,\" he says. \"And that standing fuel load allows for increased forest fire prevalence.\"</p><p>Research shows that healthy streams promote aquatic life and nurture surrounding lands. Dittbrenner's work provides clues to how beaver ecosystems and wetlands fit into that equationand contribute to wildfire protection and recovery.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123997958</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:610T-XB51-JCBF-S23G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"988\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 5, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

From 1952 until late 1963, Greece was governed by conservative parties, the Greek Rally of Marshal Alexandros Papagos and its successor, the National Radical Union, or ERE, of Constantine Karamanlis. In 1963, the Center Union Party of George Papandreou was elected and governed until July 1965. It was followed by a succession of unstable coalition governments.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On April 21, 1967, just before scheduled elections, a group of colonels led by Colonel George Papadopoulos seized power in a coup d'etat. Civil liberties were suppressed, special military courts were established, and political parties were dissolved. Several thousand political opponents were imprisoned or exiled to remote Greek islands. In November 1973, following an uprising of students at the Athens Polytechnic University, General Dimitrios Ioannides replaced Papadopoulos and tried to continue the dictatorship.</p><p>General Ioannides' attempt in July 1974 to overthrow Archbishop Makarios, the president of Cyprus, brought Greece to the brink of war with Turkey, which invaded Cyprus and occupied part of the island. Senior Greek military officers then withdrew their support from the junta, which toppled. Leading citizens persuaded Constantine Karamanlis to return from exile in France to establish a government of national unity until elections could be held. Karamanlis' newly organized party, New Democracy, or ND, won the elections held in November 1974, and he became prime minister.</p><p>Following the 1974 referendum that resulted in the rejection of the monarchy, parliament approved a new constitution on June 19, 1975. The parliament then elected Constantine Tsatsos president of the republic. In the 1977 parliamentary elections, New Democracy again won a majority of seats. In May 1980, Prime Minister Karamanlis was elected to succeed Tsatsos as president. George Rallis was then chosen party leader and succeeded Karamanlis as prime minister.</p><p>Political Chronology from 1980s to 2000:</p><p>In 1981, Greece became the 10th member of the European Community, which is now known as the European Union or EU. In parliamentary elections held on Oct. 18, 1981, Greece elected its first socialist government when the Panhellenic Socialist Movement, also known as PASOK, led by Andreas Papandreou, won 172 of 300 seats. On March 29, 1985, after Prime Minister Papandreou declined to support President Karamanlis for a second term, the Greek parliament elected Supreme Court Justice Christos Sartzetakis as president and head of state.</p><p>Greece had two rounds of parliamentary elections in 1989, both of which produced weak coalition governments with limited mandates. Party leaders withdrew their support in February 1990, and elections were held on April 8. In the April 1990 election, \"Nea Dimokratia\" (New Democracy or ND) won 150 seats and subsequently gained two others. The new prime minister, Mitsotakis, fired his first foreign minister, Andonis Samaras, in 1992; Samaras then formed his own political party, Political Spring. A split between Mitsotakis and Samaras led to the collapse of the New Democracy government and new elections in September 1993.</p><p>In October 1993, Papandreou was re-elected prime minister when PASOK won 170 seats. After his election, Prime Minister Papandreou focused on improving Greece's relations with its northern neighbors. The PASOK government also reversed two major privatization projects undertaken by Mitsotakis involving the national telephone system and the Athens bus system.</p><p>On Jan. 17, 1996, following a protracted illness, Prime Minister Papandreou resigned and was replaced by former Minister of Industry, Costas Simitis. In elections held in September 1996, Costas Simitis was elected prime minister after PASOK won 162 parliamentary seats over New Democracy's 108 seats.</p><p>The Simitis government faced severe opposition to its fiscally strict budget, which was devised to obtain Greek entry into the Economic and Monetary Union, or EMU. Throughout 1997, millions of public workers went on strike protesting the PASOK government's economic program.</p><p>Prime Minister Costas Simitis called for elections in April 2000 - six months before the end of the maximum term of four years. The Simitis government had been in office during several major foreign policy events and had also overseen significant domestic political and economic developments.</p><p>Two major foreign policy events in particular affected the Simitis government's popularity and the electoral fortune of PASOK. First, Greece had participated in a North Atlantic Treaty Organization action against its neighbor Serbia from March until June 1999, despite widespread domestic opposition to the war. Second, following the Abdullah Ocalan affair, there was an initial deterioration of relations with Turkey. In brief, Greece attempted to harbor Ocalan, the leader of the Kurdish rebels, whom the Turks wanted to stand trial. Greek-Turkish relations subsequently improved after Greece and Turkey provided mutual aid after each experienced devastating earthquakes (in August and September 1999). The substantial diplomatic rapprochement led Greece to be somewhat more accepting of Turkey's possible future accession to the European Union, historically a point of much contention. Relations between Greece and Turkey have also been affected by developments in Cyprus -- a matter which will be discussed below.</p><p>On the domestic front, the Simitis government had overseen the steady improvement of the Greek economy, after implementing unpopular economic reforms, and had applied for membership in the Economic and Monetary Union, or EMU, which would allow Greece to adopt the European single currency, the euro. Greece wanted to join the EMU in 1999, but failed to meet the economic criteria (limits on the budget deficit, public debt and inflation) necessary for membership.</p><p>Political Developments from 2000 to 2004</p><p>In 2000, while the Simitis government enjoyed popular support, PASOK faced substantial competition from the conservative New Democracy.</p><p>PASOK maintained its parliamentary majority in the April 2000 elections, winning 43.8 percent of the vote and, due to the reinforced proportional representation electoral system, 162 of the 300 seats in parliament. New Democracy, however, substantially increased its electoral fortunes from the 1996 elections, winning 42.7 percent of the vote for 125 seats, having previously won 38.1 percent and 108 seats. The \"Kommounistiko Komma Ellados,\" the (Communist Party of Greece or KKE), won 5.5 percent of the vote and kept its 11 parliamentary seats. The socialist \"Sinaspismos tis Aristeras ke ti Proodu,\" the Coalition of the Left and Progress or SIN, experienced something of a decrease in electoral support, winning 3.2 percent of the vote and six seats, having won 5.1 percent and six seats in 1996. The socialist \"Dimokratiki Kinoniku Kinima\" (the Democratic Socialist Movement or DIKKI) also failed to improve its electoral standing, winning only 2.7 percent of the vote and no seats, after winning 4.4 percent and nine seats in 1996.</p><p>A major goal of the Simitis government was met when Greece was formally accepted into the EMU on Jan. 1, 2001. The decision to allow Greece entry was reached at a meeting of EU finance ministers in June 2000. As noted above, the Simitis government had implemented a number of austerity measures to bring the Greek economy more into line with the other members of the EMU. While attaining EMU membership was a great success for the Simitis government, its fellow EMU members warned Greece that further reforms to the Greek economywould benecessary. Thus, maintaining fiscal discipline and further privatizing state-owned industries, especially in utilities, transportation, and communications, would continue to be the main domestic public policy issues on the second Simitis government's agenda.</p><p>One area slated for reform involved the system of taxation. Greece had the same taxation system for 50 year untilApril 2002 whenthe Greek government announced plans to reform the tax structure in an effort to stimulate the economy. The government's goal with the new systemwas to simplify Greece's complex taxation regime.</p><p>The government was also faced with balancing the need to maintain its \"stability pact\" with the rest of the EMU with the increasingly pressing need to address ailing social services, especially the health, education, and pension systems. Because PASOK had typically drawn significant electoral support from those groups most likely to bear the costs of rationalizing these systems (for example, labor unions), Prime Minister Simitis' job was not to be easy and his objectives would not be painlessly realized.</p><p>A more symbolic success for the government occurred when Greece won its bid to host the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. Since winning the bid, however, Greecewas criticized internationally for its lack of progress in improving its infrastructure. Olympic officials had even threatened to award the games to a different country if Greece failed to improve its ability to house, transport, service, and protect the thousands of athletes and visitors that accompany the games. The slow pace of preparations had been partiallyblamed on political infighting among the government's supporters. Indeed, Prime Minister Simitis was compelled to replace the culture minister in charge of preparing for the games due to criticism of the government's policies.</p><p>By 2002, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) reported that Greece had made some progress. However, the IOC still strongly encouraged the Greek government to meet its agreed-upon deadlines for Olympic construction projects. The Greek government continues to promise to have all the venues ready in time for the Games.</p><p>The potential for acts of terrorism also had many concerned about the games being held in Athens. Previously, in June 2000, a group known as \"November 17\" assassinated the British military attach\u00e9 in Greece. The \"November 17\" group first became public in 1975 andwas blamed for an estimated two-dozen deaths. By 2003, 18 men and one women were arrested and faced trial in regard to the killings. The group's strong anti-Western sentiments (including anti-European Union and anti-NATO sentiments) were of significant concern to Greek and international officials responsible for the Olympic Game preparations. The September 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon also heightened the security concerns of the Greek government and the International Olympic Committee.</p><p>Meanwhile, in 2002, relations between Greece and Turkey improved when the Greek and Turkish governments signed an agreement to build a gas pipeline along which Turkey would supply Greece with gas. Then, in 2003, the foreign ministers of Greece and Turkey offered remarks at a joint news conference held at Kas, in Turkey's southwestern Antalya province, where the Turkish foreign minister had been hosting all the foreign ministers of the European Union. The two ministers announced their respective countries could work together with regard to the Ottawa Treaty, which prohibits anti-personnel landmines. Although Athens and Ankara had yet to ratify the treaty, they were tosubmit documents on their joint agreement to the United Nations, which would make both Greece and Turkey party to the Ottawa Treaty. The concurrence and willingness to work together in regard to the landmine treaty was intended to symbolize strengthened bilateral relations.</p><p>In 2003, relations between the two countries were challenged by the matter of Cyprus. The island of Cyprus has been divided into the GreekCypriot and TurkishCypriot sides since 1974 when Turkey invaded the northern third of the island, following a short-lived coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece. Cyprus' northern third has been occupied by Turkish Cypriots ever since and is backed by the government of Turkey. For its part, Greek supports the GreekCypriot government, which is also recognized by the international community. The United Nations tried to broker the reunification of Cyprus butnegotiations failed. Recent decisions to lift restrictions on passage from and to the two sides of Cyprus were well-received by the Greek government in the wake of failed unification talks.</p><p>Meanwhile, Greece held the European Union presidency. Turkey has applied for membership in the regional body and George Papandreou -- in his role as the European Union president -- said that he hoped for a positive outcome for Turkey in 2004.</p><p>On the issue of the war in Iraq, in April 2003, the European Union -- headed by a Greek presidency as noted above -- stated that the United Nations should have a \"central role\" in rebuilding Iraq, while noting that the United States-led forces in the country should have the responsibility of restoring stability. The function of the European Union, however, was left unspecified until further details could be determined in regard to the roles of the coalition forces and the United Nations, respectively.</p><p>In May 2003, two informal texts -- one dealing with European Union participation in Iraq's reconstruction, and the other with the prospective common European security and defense policy -- were prepared by the Greek Presidency of the European Union. They were then presented to the informal European Union General Affairs and External Relations Council. In regard to participation in Iraq's reconstruction, the text restated the European Union's intent to assist in the political and economic reconstruction of Iraq. Included was a provision for humanitarian aid on the day after which sanctions against Iraq were lifted. The second text presented by the European Union Presidency was a prioritization of a European security and external relations policy.</p><p>On the domestic agenda, despite speculative reports that Costas Simitis would step down from the leadership of PASOK, the prime minister's office stated he would remain as the head of the party, at least until the next national elections,which were scheduled for2004. In fact, inearly 2004, when Simitis called for elections in March, he also stated he would not stand as PASOK leader and that Minister of Foreign AffairsGeorge Papandreou would insteadhold the reins as the head of that political party. Papandreou came from a Greek political dynasty as the son and grandson of former Greek leaders.</p><p>One the rationales behind the call for elections was the impetus for reaching a settlement on the matter of Cyprus ahead of the May 1, 2004, date for that country to join theEuropeanUnion.Domestic concerns, however, were of paramount importance to the Greek citizenry as people complained aboutinflation,unemployment, the sense of a decreasing standard of living, as well as apparent corruption.Indeed, with these issues burning in the consciousness of voters,and with the opposition New Democracy party offering an economic program that included tax cuts, that partyseemed to have an eight point advantage ahead of the incumbents in polls leading up to the election.</p><p>On election day in March 2004, PASOK's dominance in Greekgovernment for over a decade ended whenthe conservative New Democracy party, led by Konstantinos Karamanlis, won the vote.The victory for Karamanlis and New Democracy heralded a significant shift in Greek politics. Expressing jubilation about his success, Karamanlis said, \"This is a victory for democracy. We've been handed a mandate to move the country forward.\"He went on to become prime minister and formeda government.</p><p>The actual results of the election were as follows: \"Nea Dimokratia\" or New Democracy (ND), conservatives -- 45.4 percent and 165 seats;Panellino Socialistiko Kinima or Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK, socialists/social-democratics -- 40.5 percent and 117 seats;Kommounistiko Komma Ellado or Communist Party of Greece (KKE), communists -- 5.9 percent and 12 seats; Sinaspismos tis Aristeras ke ti Proodu or Coalition of the Left and Progress (SIN),left-wing socialists -- 3.3 percent and6 seats; Laikos Orthodoxos Synagermos or Populist Orthodox Rally (LAOS), right-wing populists -- 2.2 percent and0 seats; Dimokratiki Kinoniku Kinima or Democratic Social Movement (DIKKI), left-wing socialists --1.8 percent and 0 seats.</p><p>In May 2004, apolice station in Athenswas the target ofthree bomb attacks as fears of terrorism again emerged ahead of the Olympics.Leading up to August of that year,attention in Greece was on the preparations for the Olympics. (See \"Special Entry\" below for details about the Olympics.)</p><p>Meanwhile, inJune 2004, indications from the European Union (EU) parliamentary elections suggested there had been a record low turnout of only 44.2 percent for the EU. Reports also suggested that turnout among the 10 new member states was even lower than the overall average at only 26 percent.In some countries such as Greece, sunny weather was deemed to have been the culprit as people left their homes and headed for the coast rather than toward the polls. Still, officials from the Interior Ministry of Greece claimed that turnout had exceeded 60 percent.</p><p>In December 2004, the European Commission issued a warning toGreece after it was discovered that the country had falsifieddata regarding its budget deficit in the period prior to joining the Eurozone.</p><p>Special Entry on the Olympic Games:</p><p>From Aug. 13, 2004 to Aug. 29, 2004,the XXVIII Summer Olympic Games were held in the Greek capital city of Athens. Greece is the birthplace of the ancient Olympic Games, dating back to 776 BC, according to the historic record. These Olympic Games marked the second time Greece has hosted the Olympics in modern times. Athens played host to the first modern Olympics in 1896.</p><p>\"Phevos\" and \"Athena\" were the Olympic mascots whose symbolism were rooted in the legacy of an Olympian god and an Olympian goddess. \"Phevos\"was known asthe god of light and music, also known as Apollo in Greek mythology. His sister, Athena,was regarded asthe goddess of wisdom. Fittingly, shehas also beenknownas the patron of the city of Athens. The choice of \"Phevos\" and \"Athena\" were illustrative of the rich and compelling history and culture of Greece and Greek civilization. The concept of Olympic mascots first came into being during the Winter Olympic Games in Grenoble in 1968. Greek history and culture were also emblazoned on the Athens Olympic torch which was designed to resemble an olive leaf. As well, the emblem of the Olympic Games depicted the \"kotinos\" or an olive wreath. The olive tree was considered to be of great cultural importance and going back to the ancient Olympic Games, the \"kotinos\" was awarded to the champion.</p><p>In these modern games in Athens, 28 sporting eventstook place at 38 venues. Three hundred and one medal ceremonies also took place. More than 10,500 athletes competed in the Olympic Games, representing more than 190 countries. Notably, the country of Afghanistan participated in the Olympics following a suspension, in some measure due to the now-ousted Taliban regime's refusal to allow female athletes to compete.</p><p>On the ground in Athens, security was a major concern. Approximately 45,000 security personnel wereon duty during the course of the games along with 60,000 trained international volunteers.</p><p>Developments from 2005 to 2007</p><p>InMarch 2005, the domestic scene in Greece was dominated by the launch of a spate of strikes bytrade unions across the country. The strikes were carried out to protest against the country's increasing unemployment rate, in conjunction with the rising rate of inflation.ByDecember 2005, strikes were ongoing with a specific focus on protesting the parliament's approval ofchanges to labor laws, which wouldessentially end lifetime employment tenure within the public sector. (See \"Recent Developments\" below for information about further strike activity.)</p><p>The year 2005 was also marked by ratification of the European constitution among Greeks. In April 2005, Greece's parliament voted during a special session in favor of the proposed constitution of the European Union (EU). The proposed constitution was backed by 268 votes in the 300-member parliament, with 17parliamentarians voting against it and another 15 abstaining. According to European Union mandates, all member states must vote in support of the documenteither by public referendum or parliamentary vote.</p><p>Also in 2005, Karolos Papoulias became the country's new president after being elected by the \"Vouli ton Ellinon\" or parliament for a five-year term.</p><p>The first part of 2006 was marked by strike action undertaken by a constellation of public and private sector unions in Greece. In March, the 24-hour general strike led to disruption in services across the country, including public transportation in the capital city of Athens, but also affecting banks, hospitals, schools and government offices. Cities such as Athens were particularly hard-hit with log-jammed streets filled with workers marching to government facilities to attend rallies.</p><p>The strike was called by the unions in order to protest the conservative government's economic reform program. Among the Greek people, there is an increasing sense of frustration regarding high prices of goods and services, along with low wages. Indeed, the union leaders have argued that the minimum wage in Greece is half that of the European Union average. At the broader level, there was intensifying uneasiness about the government's intent to privatize state enterprises amidst a climate of high unemployment.</p><p>For its part, the government had to go forward with these plans in order to bring the Greek economy in line with European Union mandates to cut the budget. It is a mandate that is more stringent for countries that do not use the Euro as the currency. As well, the government has argued that its economic reforms have been intended to increase Greece's competitiveness within the global economy</p><p>The first part of 2006 was also marked by a brewing phone tapping scandal. In March 2006, George Koronias, the head of mobile phone company Vodafone Greece, began giving testimony before a parliamentary committee's inquiry into the apparent surveillance of various officials. A month prior, the government of Greece acknowledged that the mobile phones belonging to the prime minister and over 100 other officials, including politicians, security personnel, and journalists, had been bugged. The surveillance was said to have begun before the Olympics held in Athens in 2004 but continued after until it was detected in 2005. Once the matter came to light, there was increased suspicion that the matter involved United States intelligence agents in some manner.</p><p>The alleged suicide of a Vodafone network manager just days after the surveillance was revealed only added to the sense of scandal surrounding the matter. The company's denial that the man's death was connected to the scandal seemed to have had little effect in minimizing public concern.</p><p>Parliamentarians participating in the committee's inquirytried to determine why it took a year for the surveillance to be uncovered. Clearly, issues surrounding the death of the Vodafone manager were also expected to be addressed. As well, parliamentarians on the investigating committee were hoping to determine how the sophisticated software, which was used for intercepting calls, was able to be installed and activated in a clandestine manner within the Vodafone system shortly before the Olympics.</p><p>Indeed, it has been this very question that led to allegations that the United States may have been involved, as expressed by Liana Kanelli, a Member of Parliament. Kanelli's charges were not out of the mainstream. In fact, there has been a widespread belief among the Greek public that the Vodaphone tapping scheme was orchestrated by agents of the United States in the first place. The claim by a former American diplomat that the United States was involved has only bolstered that perception. The diplomat, who was based at the United States embassy in Athens until his resignation, said that the United States did not believe the Greek authorities could be trusted to protect the Olympics from a possible terrorist attack, hence their involvement, which including the phone surveillance.</p><p>In response to the phone tapping scandal, Prime Minister Karamanlis announced that there would be strict rules regulating mobile phone operations. The new regulations would be oriented toward ensuring a higher level of privacy in communications, along with harsh punishments for violators.</p><p>In May 2006, apowerful bomb exploded in the Greek capital city of Athens. Although there were no casualties, the bomb was apparently aimed at Greek Culture Minister George Voulgarakis. There was, however,no claim of responsibility. The former Public Order Minister took on the Culture portfolio following a cabinet shuffle that some have said was a demotion of sorts. The shuffle appeared to be associated with the telephone tapping scandal (discussed above) that had been the center of the political purview in Greece for some time. That issue aside, Voulgarakis was also associated with claims made by 28 Pakistani immigrants that they were abducted and tortured by Greek authorities at unknown locations following the 2005 terrorist attacks in London. For his part, Voulgarakis denied any wrongdoing.</p><p>Also in May 2006, Greek and Turkish fighter planes collided in the air andcrashed into the Aegean Sea. The Greek pilot died in the incident although the Turkish pilot ejected safely and was rescued. It was believed that the collision, which ensued near the island of Karpathos, may have occurred as a result ofefforts by theGreek authorities toscramble a jet in order to intercept a Turkish aircraft.</p><p>The area in the Aegean has been the site of a prevailing territorial dispute betweenGreece and Turkey becauseboth countries do not agree about the jurisdiction of air space. There were some fears that the incident might hinder thetrend toward improved bilateral relations that had been ongoing in recent years. Putting some rest to these anxieties,Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gulimmediately extended his country'ssympathies to his Greek counterpart, Dora Bakoyanni.For its part, the Greek Foreign Ministry released a statement that read, \"The two foreign ministers expressed their regret at today's incident and agreed that this should not affect the two countries' efforts to improve their relations.\"</p><p>February 2007 saw the conservative government of Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis survive a non-confidence motion in parliament and stave off the possibility of fresh elections. The motion, which was brought by the Socialist opposition, was defeated by a 164-122 vote in parliament after three days of debate. The Socialists accused the government of incompetence over the three years it held office.</p><p>For his part, Prime Minister Karamanlis said that his New Democratic government would complete its term. He also promised to move forward with his reform agenda, saying, \"We will continue our reforms in health, education and the economy, and nothing will stand in our way.\"But, in fact, for his reform agenda to move ahead, it would require a constitutional amendment. It would also have to withstand popular opposition, as evidenced by mass protests in the capital of Athens in January 2007, which were intended to register opposition to such changes.</p><p>Special Note</p><p>In August 2007, forest fires ravaged significant portions of Greece. The affected areas included Athens, Evia Island and the Peloponnese. More than 50 people had died at the times of writing. The fires have left several revered cultural sites, artifacts and other historic interests at grave risk of destruction. Among the vulnerable sites was the ancient Olympia, renowned for being the birthplace of the Olympics. Firefighters were attempting to keep the site from being affected, however, flames were edging close to the original Olympic stadium as well as the yard of the museum housing some of Greece's greatest archaeological artifacts. As a result, fire engines were deployed to the area to stand ready to defend the country's cultural legacy. As well, a new fire protection and sprinkler system, which had been installed prior to the 2004 Olympics, was turned on.</p><p>Elections of 2007</p><p>The Greek people went to the polls to vote in parliamentary elections on September 16, 2007. Voter turnout was in line with normal levels, however, there was a reduced rate of participation in the Peloponnese peninsula south of Athens, which suffered terribly as a result of forest fires a month earlier. That region saw dozens of people killed as a result and the government came under fire for its slow reaction and poor handling of the crisis.</p><p>Nevertheless, despite the shadow of the forest fire crisis, exit polls indicated that the governing New Democracy party of Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis was expected to win over George Papandreou's socialist party, Pasok. With most of the votes counted, it appeared that the outcome would be in line with the exit poll data. Indeed, New Democracy had about 43 percent of the vote share over Pasok, which took 38.5 percent of the vote share. The result meant that New Democracy would have the most seats in the 300-seat parliament -- albeit with a reduced majority. Indeed, control over 154 seats meant that it had an advantage of four seats in parliament -- far fewer than the situation following the previous elections but enough to claim an absolute majority.</p><p>As such, Prime Minister Karamanlis claimed victory saying that his government had a \"clear mandate\" from the people to continue its reform agenda. His policy program was thus expected to concentrate on economic development, poverty alleviation, pensions increases, and the creation of a social state for the future. In a gesture intended to rectify the government's handling of the forest fire crisis, Prime Minister Karamanlis promised that the government was committed to helping victims. He also expressed his sense of responsibility saying, \"I feel doubly responsible to be more effective and avoid mistakes.\"</p><p>On the other side of the equation, Papandreou thanked his supporters for their \"love and trust\" in him and his party, but conceded defeat saying, \"Pasok fought a battle and lost it.\" Attention then turned to the question of whether Papandreou would resign as Pasok leader. Former Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos was mentioned in the public purview as a possible successor.</p><p>The Macedonia Controversy</p><p>Although there were hopes that the Former YugoslavRepublic of Macedonia (FYROM)and Greece would find their way toward an improved and allied relationship, difficulties have continued over questions of names and insignias used by FYROM. This country, FYROM, has looked to Greece's historic enemy, Turkey, for diplomatic support. Greek refusal to recognize FYROM under the name \"Republic of Macedonia\" has been an important issue in Greek politics since 1992.</p><p>Greece was adamantly opposed to the use of the name \"Macedonia\" by the government in Skopje, claiming that the name is intrinsically Greek and should not be used by a foreign country. Furthermore, Greece believes that an independent \"Republic of Macedonia\" bordering the Greek region of Macedonia would fuel irredentist tensions in FYROM. The dispute led to a Greek trade embargo against FYROM in February 1994.</p><p>Mediation efforts by the United Nations, United States and European Union brokered an interim solution to some of these differences in September 1995, leading to the lifting of the Greek embargo. Since the signing of these interim accords, the two governments have concluded agreements designed to facilitate the movement of people and goods across their common border and improve bilateral relations. Talks on remaining issueswere still being held under United Nations auspices several years later.</p><p>That said, the issue emerged strongly in the spring of 2008 when FYROM was moving toward accession to the European Union and NATO. Greece, which is a member state of both organizations and holds the power of veto, has strenuously objected to FYROM's accession, again on the basis of the \"name\" controversy, objecting to new forms of the country's name. On the other hand, FYROM has said that it has gone the extra mile in trying to assuage Greece's anxieties over the issue by changing its flag and amending its constitution tomake clear that it heldno territorial aspiration against any neighbors, including Greece.Nevertheless, in March 2008, Greece blocked FYROM's bid to join NATO over the ongoing controversy.</p><p>Special Entry:</p><p>Global credit crisis; effects felt in Europe</p><p>Summary:</p><p>A financial farrago, rooted in the credit crisis, became a global phenomenon by the start of October 2008. In the United States, after failure of the passage of a controversial bailout plan in the lower chamber of Congress, an amended piece of legislation finally passed through both houses of Congress. There were hopes that its passage would calm jitters on Wall Street and restore confidence in the country's financial regime. However, a volatile week on Wall Street followed, most sharply characterized by a precipitous 18 percent drop of the Dow Jones. With the situation requiring rapid and radical action, a new proposal for the government to bank stakes was gaining steam. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic in Europe, with banks also in jeopardy of failing, and with no coordinated efforts to stem the tide by varying countries of the European Union, there were rising anxieties not only about the resolving the financial crisis, but also about the viability of the European bloc. Nevertheless, European leaders were able to forge an agreement aimed at easing the credit crunch in that region of the world. Following is an exploration, first, of the situation in the United States, and, second, of the situation unfolding in Europe.</p><p>Report:</p><p>On Sept. 28, 2008, as the United States was reeling from the unfolding credit crisis, Europe's banking sector was also hit by its own woes when the Dutch operations of the European banking and insurance entity, Fortis, was partly nationalized in an effort to prevent its ultimate demise. Radical action was spurred by anxieties that Fortis was too much of a banking and financial giant to be allowed to fail. The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg forged an agreement to contribute more than 11 billion euros (approximately US$16 billion) to shore up Fortis, whose share price fell precipitously due to worries about its bad debts.</p><p>A day later, the mortgage lender -- Bradford and Bingley -- in the United Kingdom was nationalized when the British government took control of the bank's mortgages and loans. Left out of the nationalization scheme were the savings and branch operations, which were sold off to Santander of Spain. Earlier, the struggling mortgage lender, Northern Rock, had itself been nationalized. The head of the British Treasury, Alistair Darling, indicated that \"big steps\" that would not normally be taken were in the offing, given the unprecedented nature of the credit crisis.</p><p>On the same day, financial woes came to a head in Iceland when the government was compelled to seize control of the country's third-largest bank , Glitnir, due to financial problems and fears that it would go insolvent. Iceland was said to be in serious financial trouble, given the fact that its liabilities were in gross excess of the country's GDP. Further action was anticipated in Iceland, as a result.</p><p>On Sept 30, 2008, another European bank -- Dexia -- was the victim of the intensifying global banking and financial crisis. In order to keep Dexia afloat, the governments of France, Belgium, and Luxembourg convened talks and agreed to contribute close to 6.5 billion euros (approximately US$9 billion) to keep Dexia from suffering a demise.</p><p>Only days later, the aforementioned Fortis bank returned to the forefront of the discussion in Europe. Belgian Prime Minister Yves Leterme said he was hoping to locate a new owner with the aim of restoring confidence in Fortis, and thusly, preventing a further downturn in the markets. Leterme said that the authorities were considering takeover bids for the Belgian operations of the company (the Dutch operations were nationalized as noted above.)</p><p>By Sept. 5, 2008, one of Germany's biggest banks, Hypo Real Estate, was at risk of failing. In response, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would exhaust all efforts to save the bank. A rescue plan by the government and banking institutions was eventually agreed upon at a cost of 50 billion euros (approximately US$70 billion). This agreement involved a higher cost than was previously discussed.</p><p>Meanwhile, as intimated above, Iceland was enduring further financial shocks to its entire banking system. As such, the government of Iceland was involved in intense discussions aimed at saving the country's financial regime, which were now at severe risk of collapse due to insolvency of the country's commercial banks.</p><p>Meanwhile, on Sept. 4, 2008, the leaders of key European states -- United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy -- met in the French capital city of Paris to discuss the financial farrago and to consider possible action. The talks, which were hosted by French President Nicolas Sarkozy, ended without consensus on what should be done to deal with the credit crisis, which was rapidly becoming a global phenomenon. The only thing that the four European countries agreed upon was that there would not be a grand rescue plan, akin to the type that was initiated in the United States. As well, they jointly called for more greater regulation and a coordinated response. To that latter end, President Nicolas Sarkozy said, \"Each government will operate with its own methods and means, but in a coordinated manner.\"</p><p>This call came after Ireland took independent action to deal with the burgeoning financial crisis. Notably, the Irish government decided days earlier to fully guarantee all deposits in the country's major banks for a period of two years. The Greek government soon followed suit with a similar action. These actions by Ireland and Greece raised the ire of other European countries, and evoked questions of whether Ireland and Greece had violated any European Union charters. An investigation by the European Union was pending into whether or not Ireland's guarantee of all savings deposits was anti-competitive in nature.</p><p>Nevertheless, as anxieties about the safety of bank deposits rose across Europe, Ireland and Greece saw an influx of new banking customers from across the continent, presumably seeking the security of knowing their money would be safe amidst a financial meltdown. And even with questions rising about the decisions of the Irish and Greek government, the government of Germany decided to go down a similar path by guaranteeing all private bank accounts. For his part, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said that his government would increase the limit on guaranteed bank deposits from \u00a335,000 to \u00a350,000.</p><p>In these various ways, it was clear that there was no concurrence among some of Europe's most important economies. In fact, despite the meeting in France, which called for coordination among the countries of the European bloc, there was no unified response to the global financial crisis. Instead, that meeting laid bare the divisions within the countries of the European Union, and called into question the very viability of the European bloc. Perhaps that question of viability would be answered at a forthcoming G8 summit, as recommended by those participating in the Paris talks.</p><p>A week later, another meeting of European leaders in Paris ended with concurrence that no large institution would be allowed to fail. The meeting, which was attended by leaders of euro zone countries, resulted in an agreement to guarantee loans between banks until the end of 2009, with an eye on easing the credit crunch. The proposal, which would apply in 15 countries, also included a plan for capital infusions by means of purchasing preference shares from banks. The United Kingdom, which is outside the euro zone, had already announced a similar strategy.</p><p>French President Nicolas Sarkozy argued that these unprecedented measures were of vital importance. The French leader said, \"The crisis has over the past few days entered into a phase that makes it intolerable to opt for procrastination and a go-it-alone approach.\" He also tried to ease growing frustration that such measures would benefit the wealthy by explaining that the strategy would not constitute \"a gift to banks.\"</p><p>While these developments were aimed at restoring confidence in the financial regime in Europe, Iceland continued to struggle. Indeed, the country's economy stood precipitously close to collapse. Three banks, including the country's largest one -- Kaupthing -- had to be rescued by the government and nationalized. Landsbanki and Glitnir had been taken over in the days prior. With the country in a state of economic panic, trading on the OMX Nordic Exchange was suspended temporarily, although it was expected to reopen on October 13, 2008. Iceland's Prime Minister Geir Haarde said that his country was considering whether to seek assistance from the International Monetary Fund to weather the crisis.</p><p>In early 2009, according to the European Commission, European banks werein need of as much as several trillion in bailout funding. Impaired or toxic assets factored highly on the European Union bank balance sheets, with credit default swaps on Irish debt running at 355 basis points higher at the time of writing -- the highest rate in Europe and well on its way down the path of Iceland. Anxieties were so high in Dublin that tens of thousands of people took to the streets to protest the growing financial crisis.</p><p>Meanwhile, the fallout from the housing bubble was deleteriously affecting the United Kingdom, with anxieties being stoked about whether British banks could at all be saved.</p><p>In Spain, unemployment was in double digit territory and industrial production plunged 20 percent from where it was a year earlier. It was anticipated that credit default swaps for Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece would double over the course of the next year. In other parts of Europe, according to economist Nouriel Roubini, the economies of Ukraine, Belarus, Hungary, Latvia and Lithuania appeared to be on the brink of disaster.</p><p>Regarding Ukraine, there were fears that it would might not abide with terms of a loan from the International Monetary Fund and thusly default on its debt. Meanwhile in Poland, the currency was falling and in Russia, even as the rouble fell, the Kremli warned of economic contraction.</p><p>Overall, Eastern European countries borrowed heavily from Western European banks. Thus, even if the currencies on the eastern part of the continent collapse, effects will be felt in the western part of Europe as well. For example, Swiss banks that gave billions of credit to Eastern Europe cannot look forward to repayment anytime soon. As well, Austrian banks have had extensive exposure to Eastern Europe, and can anticipate a highly increased cost of insuring its debt.</p><p>German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck has warned that as many as 16 European Union countries will require assistance. Indeed, his statements suggest the need for a regional rescue effort. Of consideration is the fact that, according to the Maastricht Treaty, state-funded bailouts are prohibited.</p><p>By the close of February 2009, it was announced that the banking sectors in Central and Eastern Europe would receive a rescue package of $31 billion, via the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the World Bank. The rescue package was aimed at assisting the survival of small financial institutions and included equity and debt financing, as well as access to credit and risk insurance aimed at encouraging lending.</p><p>Also in February 2009, with the global financial crisis intensifying, leaders of European Union countries backed sweeping financial regulations. Included in the package of market reforms were sanctions on tax havens, caps on bonus payments to management, greater hedge fund regulation, and increased influence by the International Monetary Fund. European leaders also backed a charter of sustainable economic activity, that would subject all global financial activities to both regulation and accountability by credit rating agencies.</p><p>These moves were made ahead of the Group of 20 summit scheduled for April 2, 2009, in London. It was not known whether other countries outside Europe, such as the United States, Japan, India and China, would support the new and aggressive regime of market regulation. That said, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in Berlin that Europe had a responsibility to chart this track. She said, \"Europe will own up to its responsibility in the world.\"</p><p>Recent Developments</p><p>In the spring of 2008, Greece was gripped by public sector strikes and other forms of mass action, aimed at protesting the government's pensionreform plan.Despite the public's outcry over the proposed reform proposal, the Greek parliament narrowly passed thelegislation oriented toward putting the plan into action.</p><p>In October 2008, further strikes and mass action ensued by both public sector employyes and professionals in reaction to proposalsfor privatization andcaps on compensation.</p><p>The start of December 2008 in Greece was marked by violence as masses took to the streets in Athens to protest the shooting death of a youth -- Alexandros Grigoropoulos -- by police. Students took to the streets, even throwing gas bombs, rocks and stones at a police station during more than a week of ongoing violence. Police retaliated with tear gas but the crowds were only deterred temporarily, rallying again to set three banking institutions ablaze and damaging cars. About 400 people were detained as a consequence of the chaotic situation on the ground, which also resulted in injuries to at least 70 people. As the protests entered mid-December, an uneasy calm returned to Athens. That said, student protestors said they intended to launch a demonstration outside police headquarters.</p><p>By mid-month, the situation was ongoing and Athens continued to be the site of further violent clashed between protestors and police. The protestors, most of whom were youthful students, were using the National Technical University of Athens, known locally as the Polytechnic, as their base of operations.</p><p>Meanwhile, the general sentiment in Greece was that the protests, which began in reaction to the shooting of Grigoropoulos by police, had evolved into a broader social uprising. Of particular note was the fact that a substantial number of the young people involved in the protests were unemployed and further unrest could be in the offing, with more loss of jobs anticipated in 2009.</p><p>The situation had political implications for the government of Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis, which was viewed as having handled the situation poorly, according to polling data on the matter. Seizing upon the popular sentiment of discontent, George Papandreou, the leader of the opposition Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok), called for fresh elections. He accused the government of being \"incapable of steadily driving the country towards change.\" For his part, Prime Minister Karamanlis rejected calls for either his resignation or early elections. Instead, he said that Greece was in need of a \"steady hand\" to deal with the economic strife.</p><p>Primer on 2009 Parliamentary Electionsin Greece</p><p>Background</p><p>On Sept. 2, 2009, Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis announced that a snap general election would be held in the near future. The Greek head of government said he would meet with President Karolos Papoulias to discuss this decision to hold early elections ahead of the expected 2011 date when the tenure of his ruling conservative New Democracy government would normally come to an end. A day later, it was announced that the snap election would be held a month later on Oct. 4, 2009.</p><p>Prime Minister Karamanlis explained that his decision to call the snap election was \"an act of responsibility,\" and it had been advanced in the country's best interest. Prime Minister Karamanlis said that Greece was in need of significant reforms to deal with the after-effects of the 2008 global financial crisis, as well as enduring challenges in the domestic economy and public sector. Indeed, Greece has seen a sharp rise in its unemployment rate, negatively matched by declining economic growth, in recent times -- both of which Prime Minister Karamanlis said had been the result of the previous Socialist government's mismanagement. Accordingly, the Greek head of government called for strict fiscal discipline, structural reforms, and a \"war\" on tax evasion -- a problem that has plagued the country and added to its economic woes. Prime Minister Karamanlis wasted no time in calling for the public to give his party a \"fresh mandate\" to address these issues.</p><p>Some critics surmised that despite this noble agenda, the Karamanlis government was under pressure due to a number of scandals and criticisms for handling various crises, and was thusly acquiescing to the call for an early vote. Complicating the matter was the fact that Socialist leader George Papandreou was agitating for another early poll. He said he wished to force an early presidential election.</p><p>Election Issues</p><p>The main issue surrounding the election was the path to dealing with Greece's economic challenges. Whereas Karamanlis advanced an austerity measure program to tackle this issue, Papandreou promised a significant stimulus package, movement toward the building of a green economy, and the introduction of technocratic experts to help Greece tackle its problems.</p><p>Polling Data</p><p>Polling data indicated that Karamanlis' conservative New Democracy party was trailing the Socialists by six percent in the month ahead of the election.</p><p>Results</p><p>After the votes were counted following the October 4, 2009 parliamentary elections, it was clear that Greece's Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) had won the country's snap general elections. The results showed that the Socialists garnered more than 43 percent of the vote count, while New Democracy obtained 35 percent. The Communist Party of Greece (KKE) remained as the third largest party in parliament, winning 7.6 percentage of the vote. The right People's Orthodox Rally (LAOS) was estimated to have received 5.6 percent of the vote. The Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA) was expected to garner 4.5 percent of the vote. While the Green Ecologists party secured 2.5 percent of the votes, it would not enter parliament due to the three percent threshold required by electoral law.</p><p>Outgoing Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis conceded defeat, resigned as leader of the conservative New Democracy party, and congratulated Socialist leader, George Papandreou. In this way, the Socialists ended their five-year stay in opposition and prepared to take the reins of government once again. In an address to jubilant supporters in Athens, Papandreou said: \"We stand here united before the great responsibility which we undertake.\"</p><p>Daysafter the election, Socialist leader, was sworn into office as Greece's new prime minister by Archbishop Ieronymos of Athens and All Greece, andin the presence of President Karolos Papoulias. The new head of government paid tribute to the contributions of his predecessor, Costas Karamanlis. For his part, Karamanlis congratulated Papandreou and wished him \"all the best for the benefit of the country.\"</p><p>The process of government formation was expected to follow with Prime Minister Papandreou's impending announcement ofthe composition of the new cabinet. To that end, the new head of government noted that the cabinet would be both small and include several women. Attention was also focused on the leadership race for the New Democracy party, which was now officially in opposition.</p><p>Weeks later, the incumbent Greek President Karolos Papoulias was asked by newly-elected Prime Minister George Papandreou to serve a second term as Greece's head of state. In response, Papoulias said, \"I accept the nomination for my re-election to the Presidency of Greece.\" With both the ruling PASOK party and the main opposition New Democracy party backing Papoulias' second term, the actual parliamentary vote in March 2010 was expected to formalize the second term in office.</p><p>Briefing on 2010 Presidential Election in Greece</p><p>On February 3, 2010, Greek President Karolos Papoulias was re-elected to a second term in an internal vote in parliament with an overwhelming majority. Papoulias won 266 of the votes cast in the 300-seat parliament. The incumbent president was supported by the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), the main opposition New Democracy (ND), as well as some smaller opposition parties. Parliamentarians belonging to the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) and the Coalition of the Radical Left abstained from the vote.</p><p>Note: Papoulias was born in 1929 and served as a former government minister and member of parliament.</p><p>Special Entry on Greece's Debt Crisis</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Since late 2009, attempts to resolve Greece's economic crisis have been at the forefront of the national agenda. There have also been serious concerns about Greece\u2019s economic viability on the regional landscape across Europe and internationally. At issue have been deep anxieties about Greece defaulting on its debt, along with subsequent speculation about whether the European Union (EU) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would have to step in to prevent such an outcome. By April 2010, the prospects of Greece resolving the matter without help from some transnational body came to a head when the Papandreou administration formally said it would accept the EU-IMF financial rescue package to ensure debt service.</p><p>Crisis Landscape:</p><p>In December 2009, the new Greek head of government, Prime Minister George Papandreou, announced a series of harsh spending cuts in order to address the country's economic woes. He warned that without action such as a hiring freeze on public sector jobs, closure of overseas tourism offices, and decreased social security spending, Greece was at risk of \"sinking under its debts.\" He also said that his country had \"lost every trace of credibility\" on the economic front and would have to \"move immediately to a new social deal.\"</p><p>Fears of a government debt default in Europe emerged in the first week of February 2010, with all eyes focused on Greece. Of concern was the rising cost of insuring Greek debt against default, and fears were rising that a bailout by the International Monetary Fund might be in the offing.</p><p>For its part, the Greek government pledged to reduce its budget deficit by three percent of gross domestic product by 2012. That move was welcomed by the European Commission but met with the threat of strikes by Greece's largest union, which has railed against the prospect of austerity measures. By Feb. 10, 2010, the strike by the country's largest public sector union in Greece was going forward. Simultaneously, Prime Minister George Papandreou promised to \"take any necessary measures\" to reduce Greece's deficit including a freeze on public sector pay, increased taxes and the implementation of changes to the pension system.</p><p>The next day, leaders of the European Union said that while Greece had not asked for assistance, they stood ready to help ensure stability within the euro zone. A statement issued from a summit in Brussels read as follows: \"We fully support the efforts of the Greek government and their commitment to do whatever is necessary, including adopting additional measures to ensure that the ambitious targets set in the stability program for 2010 and the following years are met.\" The statement, however, did not specify the nature of such support although there were indications that a loan might be in the offing. Following a meeting of European leaders on Feb. 11, 2010, Austria's Chancellor Werner Faymann explained the need to support fellow European Union member states saying, \"It is important to have solidarity.\" However, he added, \"We are not going to give the money as a present, it will be as loans.\"</p><p>Only a few days later, however, the news emerging from Europe was more grim as regards to Greece's situation. As reported by the British publication, the Telegraph, the council of European Union finance ministers issued an ultimatum to Greece, warning that if that country did not comply with austerity measures by March 16, 2010, it would lose sovereign control over its tax and spend policies. The council also warned that the European Union would invoke Article 126.9 of the Lisbon Treaty to take control from Athens and impose requisite cuts. This threat was likely to have more of a practical effect on Greece than an earlier move by the European Union to suspend Greece's voting rights, although both measures indicated a severe blow to Greek sovereignty within the European bloc. From the point of view of the European Union, the verdict was that Greece's austerity plan contained insufficient spending cuts and uncoordinated measures, and compelled the need for such drastic action.</p><p>Perhaps not surprisingly, Greece took a different view. Greek Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou argued that his country was \"doing enough\" to reduce its public deficit from 12 percent to eight percent of GDP in 2010 by undertaking emergency fiscal cuts. Accordingly, Greece has also been reticent about taking further austerity measures, such as an increase in the value added tax or VAT, as well as further public sector wage cuts, which the European Central Bank has said might be necessary. But the rest of Europe was unlikely to receive Greece's claims on faith alone, given the emerging revelations that Wall Street likely helped Greece hide its balance sheets problem for the purpose of advancing euro zone accession.</p><p>By the third week of February 2010, as talks in Brussels commenced about the financial crisis in Greece, there was no consensus on the possible path toward helping stabilize the situation in that country. In fact, member states of the European Union appeared divided on the issue. Germany has said it wants to protect its own financial interests by constructing a \"firewall\" to prevent Greece's debt crisis from spiraling out of control. It was not known if that \"firewall\" was distinct from, or an actual euphemism for, a bailout for Greece funded by German funds. Certainly, Germany has been careful not to expressly state that it supports some sort of bailout measure for Greece, under the aegis of the European Union , using Germany funds. Indeed, Berlin would have to contend with an outraged domestic reaction, as well as a resistant coalition partner in government whose libertarian inclinations would leave them far from sanguine about such a move.</p><p>At the start of March 2010, in the face of pressure from the European Union, the Greek government agreed to a new package of austerity measures, including tax increases and spending cuts, aimed at resolving the budget crisis. The new package was met with approval from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, who respectively hailed the move as evidence that Greece was taking necessary measures to reduce its precarious debt. The reactions of these two bodies were regarded as crucial, since Greece was hoping for German-funded assistance from the European Union, with the International Monetary Fund in line as an alternative avenue of assistance.</p><p>Nevertheless, since the measures included reductions in holiday bonuses paid to civil servants as well as a pension freeze, it effectively raised the ire of public sector workers and trade unions. From their point of view, the financial package would exact a punishing toll on the workers of the country. Not surprisingly, the country was hit by strikes with workers angrily protesting the deficit-cutting government measures detailed above. With schools closed, public transportation, flights and ferries at a halt, and garbage left uncollected, it was clear that the strike was in full-force. On the streets of Athens, striking workers registered discontent, while riot police were deployed across the city.</p><p>Regional Considerations:</p><p>Also at issue have been the fiscal challenges of Portugal and Spain, which like Greece, have to contend with debt and weakened public finances. One challenge for Spain is the fact that the central government (leaving the social security administration aside) controls only one third of public sector spending. Accordingly, while the central government can set guidelines for the regional and municipal authorities, it has a fairly limited effect on overall fiscal policy. In Portugal, the government does not command a majority in parliament, effectively complicating the process of implementing fiscal policies, and necessitating broad national consensus on the matter of the country's economic health. Ireland, like Greece, suffers from budget deficits that exceed 12 percent of their economic output. However, Ireland's record in navigating difficult economic times (late 1980s, early 1990s) was believed to be in that country's favor.</p><p>Thusly, at the broader level, the European Union has been faced with the moral hazard of having to consider going down a similar path with Spain and Portugal, not to mention other European countries. Clearly, the European Union had no appetite for such a precedent being set in Greece. Not surprisingly, non-euro zone European Union members, such as the United Kingdom and Sweden, were recommending the International Monetary Fund route. They argued that an entity such as the IMF possessed the technocratic acumen and experience to orchestrate and supply a loan bailout to Greece.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Fitch ratings agency decided to downgrade Greece's credit rating two notches amidst anxieties that the country will be unable to solve its financial farrago without assistance from external parties.? The downgrade was significant since Greece was now at risk of losing its investment grade status, at least according to Fitch.? Greece retains marginally higher ratings with Moody's and Standard and Poor's. Earlier, Portugal's credit rating was also downgraded by the Fitch ratings agency over concerns regarding its debt woes.? Ironically, the move by Fitch came weeks after Portugal passed an austerity budget aimed at reducing its high budget deficit.? At the broader level, the decision to downgrade the credit ratings of both Greece and Portugal, along with attention on the possible rescue package for Greece,? renewed anxieties about the? problem of heavily indebted economies across the continent.</p><p>The situation in these European countries -- specifically on their debt burdens -- has focused attention concomitantly on the European Union where countries of the euro zone share currency but not economic policies, and whose collective fates would be affected by a devalued euro. Indeed, the euro itself has seen its value slide as a result of rising economic anxieties, and questions have once again surfaced regarding its viability.</p><p>Last Resort:</p><p>By late March 2010, a proposal was advanced to address Greece's debt crisis. The rescue package proposal was intended to be a last resort for Greece, should that country fail to borrow sufficient funds under normal conditions. It would require all euro zone countries to vote unanimously to fund individual loans to Greece, although not all countries would be required to contribute. No actual dollar amount was specified for the possible rescue package although there were suggestions that it would be valued at around 22 billion euro, with the lion's share of the funding being derived from the European Union (EU), and a small remained from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p><p>On April 10, 2010, euro zone countries agreed to fund up to 30 billion euros -- above the amount originally envisioned -- in emergency loans for debt-hit Greece.? The price of the loans would be about five percent and in line with IMF formulas. The loans would not be activated by the euro zone; instead, it would be up to Greece to decide whether or not to avail itself of the funds, which would be co-financed by the IMF, although to what degree was unknown. For its part, Greece has said it does not want to go down the road of such loans, preferring to auction treasury bills. Greece was hoping that the very notion of an EU-IMF rescue package would ease volatile markets and advance an economic recovery, without actually having to activate the loans. However, such a path was viewed as potentially unavoidable, given the fact that Greece has no choice but to finance its debt obligations. As well, there have been the wider considerations at play -- that is, the impact on markets across Europe and the confidence in the euro.</p><p>By the close of April, 2010, Greece officially requested that the EU-IMF \"last resort\" loan package be activated, in order to deal with its debt-ridden economy and to prevent the unacceptable outcome of default by a sovereign European country. The EU and IMF responded by noting that they believed the details of the rescue plan could be worked through quickly. That being said, since much of the funding for the package will go through the EU, several eurozone countries will have to ratify the use of funds. For example, France would have to garner parliamentary approval for its contribution to Greece's rescue package. In Germany, where -- as discussed above -- the political ramifications of such a plan were expected to be pronounced -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel was warning that there would be \"very strict conditions\" attached to her country's contribution of assistance. As well, it was still to be determined how much the IMF would itself finance, along with interest rates by both the IMF and EU. With such hurdles yet to be crossed, it was unlikely that Greece would be in receipt of the much-needed funds until the second week of May 2010.</p><p>Meanwhile, Prime Minister George Papandreou was expressing confidence in the path going forward. Speaking from the Aegean island of Kastellorizo, he said: \"Our partners will decisively contribute to provide Greece the safe harbor that will allow us to rebuild our ship.\" But the Greek people were not easily assuaged by these words or the EU-IMF rescue package. Instead, they were still railing against the austerity measures enacted by the Greek government with tens of thousands of Greek civil servants taking to the streets to participate in mass strike.</p><p>Further reluctance by Germany to to fund the largest portion of the rescue package for Greece did not help the situation. In fact, with Greece acknowledging that it cannot service its forthcoming debt obligations without the EU-IMF loan, plus the realization that German funds will likely not come quickly, there were escalating fears that Greece could well default by May 19, 2010 -- a significant deadline when billions in bond payments would be due. Although Greek Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou insisted his country would \"absolutely and without any doubt\" service that debt, prevailing anxieties led another credit rating downgrade for Greece. Indeed, Standard and Poors downgraded Greece's credit rating to junk status. That move, in addition to a slight downgrade to Portugal's debt on the basis of heightened risks, renewed attention to euro zone stability.</p><p>Regional Considerations as regards the euro</p><p>In May 2010, the European Union (EU) agreed on a euro stability package valued at 500 billion euros, aimed at preventing the aforementioned Greek debt crisis from deleteriously affecting other countries in the region. Countries within the EU's euro zone would be provided access to loans worth 440 billion euros and emergency funding of 60 billion euros from the EU. As well, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would earmark an additional 250 billion euros. The European Commission would raise the funds in capital markets, using guarantees from the governments of member states, for the purpose of lending it to countries in economic crisis.</p><p>In addition, it was announced that the European Central Bank (ECB) was prepared to participate in exceptional market intervention measures, such as the purchase of euro zone government bonds, for the purpose of shoring up the value and viability of the euro currency.</p><p>These moves were aimed at defending the euro, which has seen its value drop precipitously as a result of the Greek debt crisis has gone on, and as anxieties have increased that a similarly disastrous fate could spread to other EU member states, such as Portugal, Spain, Italy and even Ireland. These mostly southern European economies were plagued not only by high deficits but also inherent structural economic weakness.</p><p>But even these overtures, as drastic as they might appear, would do little to address Europe's soaring public debt, according to some economic analysts. Indeed, among this core of economists, the argument resided that this rescue package could actually exacerbate the situation. Of concern has been the collective impact of low economic growth, high unemployment, and governments unwilling to take requisite austerity measures to not only decrease spending but also increase productivity. Rather than relying on heavy government spending to spur growth, governments in euro zone countries have opted to decrease their debt levels -- or at least to make the promise of moving in that direction. However, another core of economic analysts has argued that too much debt reduction -- without government stimulus -- could itself stymie economic growth. To this latter end, Daniel Gros of the Center for European Policy Studies warned that \"the patient is dead before he can get up and walk.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, the economic crisis in Europe was spreading to the domestic political sphere in Germany. With the German cabinet of Chancellor Merkel poised to approve that country's part in the euro rescue deal, German voters issued a punishing blow to Merkel's conservatives in the state elections in North Rhine-Westphalia. The voters' reaction appeared to register discontent over the German federal government's decision. Germans, according to polling data, were already incensed over funding of the bail out plan for Greece. That separate package was also approved by the government and parliament.</p><p>Vulnerable countries take action:</p><p>In a move aimed at addressing its troubling debt, the Spanish government on May 20, 2010, approved an austerity plan. The move was also aimed at soothing fears that Spain would devolve into the same type of debt crisis that had gripped Greece, with deleterious consequences for the value of the euro and the stability of the entire euro zone. A month later in June 2010, the head of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, was hailing Spain for taking corrective measures to move the country on the path toward economic stability. However, as was the case in Italy (see below) and Greece, the citizenry and unions were railing against the harsh actions.</p><p>Italy moved on May 25, 2010 to address its debt challenges by launching its own austerity program on the heels of Spain doing the same. Like Spain, Italy wanted to hold the confidence of international investors and prevent sliding into a Greek-style debt crisis. To these ends, the Italian government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi approved austerity measures worth 24 billion euros for the years 2011-2012. Ultimately, Italy''s government was hoping to reduce its deficit down to below three percent of GDP by 2012. In response, Italian unions took to the streets in protests. Indeed, Italian civilians, particularly those from the public sector, were expected to rail against these moves.</p><p>Special Report</p><p>Letter bombs in Greece sent to embassies and foreign governments</p><p>In the first week of November 2010, a series of letter bombs were sent to embassies in Greece as well as some foreign government, prompting the Greek authorities to stop deliveries of foreign mail. More than a dozen such incidences occurred during this period. In one case, a letter bomb dispatched to the French embassy in Athens had to be safely detonated after an explosive device was found hidden in a book. In another case, a courier was injured when a bomb exploded in her hands. Devices were found at the embassies of Switzerland and Russia. Bombs were earlier mailed to French President Nicolas Sarkozy, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, and the International Criminal Court in The Hague.</p><p>Since the level of explosives contained in the devices was small, the consensus was that the mailed bombs were not intended to fatally kill anyone. Nevertheless, two Greek men were arrested and charged with terrorism, belonging to a criminal organization, and possession and use of bombs and explosives in regard to the dispatching of these letter bombs. It was believed that they were members of a far-left extremist organization carrying out domestic terrorism. To this end, Greek Foreign Minister Dimitris Droutsas said, \"All evidence shows this is a clear domestic case, with no connection with international terrorism.\u201d</p><p>On December 23, 2010, mail bombs exploded at the Swiss and Chilean embassies in Rome. Two employees of the respective embassies were seriously injured as a result. Concerns about security reached new highs at diplomatic missions across Europe since only a month prior, mail bombs targeted embassies in the Greek capital of Athens. Suspicions rested on anarchists, with authorities suggesting a connection between Italian and Greek anarchists in regard to the spate of mail bomb attacks.</p><p>Political Update:</p><p>On November 7, 2010, following a favorable outcome in local Greek elections, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou ruled out the possibility of calling a snap parliamentary election. The local elections were regarded as something of a referendum on the handling of the dire state of the Greek economy by Papandreou's socialist party (PASOK). Elected only a year prior, PASOK has been beset by policy challenges as Greece has tried to survive devastating economic conditions, on the brink of default, and requiring both harsh austerity measures and assistance from the European Union. With the local elections ending without massive losses for PASOK, the Greek prime minister was interpreting the election results as measured approval from the Greek citizenry. To that end, Papandreou said, \"Today voters confirmed their will for change. We will continue our work.\" Indeed, he was making it clear that his government had a mandate to move forward with necessary budget cuts, austerity measures and related reforms, and accordingly, there was no need to call snap elections.</p><p>In mid-December 2010, Greek protesters took to the streets in the Greek capital of Athens to register their anger regarding the government's austerity measures. Those measures, that included caps of salaries of workers in state-run entities, were enacted as part of the economic reform agenda, associated with a massive bailout package funded by the European Union and International Monetary Fund. That bail-out package was intended to save Greece from default. A general strike was also taking place with transportation at a standstill, schools closed, and flights grounded at Greek airports. The protests and general strike had been organized by labor unions; they grew violent as demonstrators threw petrol bombs at buildings close to the parliament and set luxury hotels ablaze. As well, one former conservative government minister, Kostis Hatzidakis, was attacked by an angry mob screaming \"Thieves! Shame on you!\" The violent clashes resulted in Greek police using tear gas to try to disperse the crowds.</p><p>In February 2011, Greek protesters took to the streets in the Greek capital of Athens in a 24-hour general strike. The protesters, numbering more than 30,000 in total, rallied toward the parliament building. At issue for the protesters has been their anger over the government's austerity measures. Those measures, which included caps of salaries of workers in state-run entities, were enacted as part of the economic reform agenda, associated with a massive bailout package funded by the European Union and International Monetary Fund. That bail-out package was intended to save Greece from default. The protests and general strike had been organized by labor unions; they grew violent as demonstrators threw petrol hurled petrol bombs and stones, prompting police to respond with the firing of tear gas. Meanwhile, the city public transport system was left paralyzed, at least 100 flights were cancelled, and schools, hospitals and businesses were forced to close. The deputy leader of one of Greece's most important unions, Stathis Anestis, said in an interview with the Associate Press that the government measures were disproportionately hurting working people. He said, \"We are facing long-term austerity, with high unemployment and destabilizing our social structure.\" He also promised that mass actions of this sort would not only continue but increase. Anestis said, \"What is increasing is the level of anger and desperation... If these harsh policies continue, so will we.\"</p><p>Special Report:</p><p>The Greek Debt Crisis and Effects on the Euro Zone</p><p>Summary:</p><p>An ongoing debt crisis has plagued Greece, leading to the need for a rescue plan from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, with an eye on averting sovereign default. In a separate but related development, the euro zone approved an expansion of the euro bailout fund, breathing life into the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). Despite agreeing to the debt relief package and the expansion of the EFSF, though, the European Union has not been quick to agree to the release of rescue funds for Greece, as concerns have risen about that country meeting necessary conditions -- the implementation of austerity measures and reforms -- associated with the relief package. To that end, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou initially advanced the idea of a national referendum aimed at ratifying the debt relief plan. However, with the angry and outraged Greek citizenry unlikely to ratify the plan, the prime minister ultimately withdrew the referendum idea. Prime Minister Papandreou also resigned from office, and made way for the formation of a national unity government, tasked with pushing through the necessary legislation to implement austerity measures and reforms, and securing a further tranche of rescue funds aimed at averting default. Without the enactment of the debt relief plan, Greece would fail to service its debt commitments -- essentially defaulting on its sovereign debt, yielding to deleterious effects for the euro zone and European banks. At the international level, there could be a seriously damaging influence on the global economy. In the backdrop of these developments remain the prevailing fears of contagion emanating from the Greek debt crisis, and extending to other countries, such as Italy and Spain in the euro zone, and the global economy at large. Debt woes in Italy and Spain were already leading to political consequences.</p><p>Background:</p><p>In Greece, protesters were taking to the streets in strikes and mass action to register their rejection of the government's plan to implement austerity measures.

Ahead of the meeting, the chairman of the body that makes up finance ministers in the euro zone, Jean-Claude Juncker, warned that the latest installment of the bailout might not be advanced if Greece could not make the case for its solvency within the next year. The public's clear rejection of austerity measures -- manifest in the aforementioned mass action, strikes and demonstrations -- was not helping Greece to demonstrate that it could achieve this end.</p><p>Given this landscape, by the start of June 2011, the credit ratings agency, Moody's, downgraded Greece from B1 to Caa1 -- just short of default and indicated a 50 percent possibility that the country would default on its debt. Moody's explained that it was highly concerned about Greece's \"highly uncertain growth prospects.\" In this way, Greece's credit rating had fallen in tandem with the rising fears that the country was not capable of stabilizing its debt burden in a timely fashion. Moody's additionally held its outlook for Greece in the negative column, indicating that further downgrades could be in the offing. Now, though, Greece was now located at the bottom of the Moody's ranking -- below Montenegro -- in a listing of Europe's credit-worthy countries. As mid-June 2011 approached, yet another credit ratings agency -- Standard &amp; Poor's -- downgraded Greece from B to CCC, effectively pushing the country to the bottom of the list of the 131 monitored countries.</p><p>Faced with these emerging challenges, as well as the prevailing burden of debt servicing and ultimate solvency, attention refocused on strategies to address the crisis. One option that surfaced was the restructuring of Greece's debt. As suggested by Chairman Jean-Claude Juncker, repayments on Greece's shorter-term debt could be postponed, if lenders would agree to terms. This type of \"debt re-profiling\" would be voluntary and would not be classified as default by credit ratings agencies. The European Central Bank (ECB) has indicated that while typical restructuring schemes would be opposed, a voluntary debt re-profiling arrangement might be deemed acceptable.</p><p>Note that by the second week of June 2011, the Greek cabinet had backed budget cuts as part of a fiscal and structural adjustment program required by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, as part of the conditions associated with the aforementioned rescue package. The plan would now have to be voted on in parliament; that vote was expected to take place by the end of the month (June 2011) -- the deadline specified for the next tranche of rescue loans to be made available.</p><p>Meanwhile, early June saw public sector unions take to the streets in a mass strike in protest of harsh austerity measures to come. By the second week of June, the anti-austerity riots continued with thousands of people involved in demonstrations. Syntagma Square in Athens was becoming \"ground zero\" of the protest movement. That being said, protest action was spread across other terrain. Ports and state-run companies were shut down, public transportation was disrupted, while banks and hospitals could only offer limited service. The scene eventually devolved into violent territory, forcing police to fire teargas to disperse crowds outside the parliament building. This scene erupted as members of parliament were about to debate the new fiscal and structural adjustment program (discussed above), which the Greek cabinet had already passed, and which was a required condition for the EU and IMF bail-out packages. Further strike action was expected by protesters, self-termed \"the Indignants,\" and calling for \"resistance\" ahead of the parliamentary vote.</p><p>At the political level, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou was facing an all-out revolt from his own Socialist Party (known by the acronym, PASOK), the members of whom were reacting to the scene on the streets of Athens. In fact, at least one member of PASOK defected to the opposition to register his personal protest against the austerity measures, while another PASOK member warned that he intended to vote against him. Several other PASOK members of parliament were making it known that their votes were not assured. It was apparent that they were showing solidarity with \"the Indignants\" in the streets.</p><p>While the members of parliament were accountable to the citizens of the Hellenic republic, the fact remained that Greece -- as a sovereign state within the EU -- was itself accountable to the economic bloc of which it is a member. Understanding the gravity of the political situation and the potentially devastating economic fallout -- not only for Greece nationally, but for its standing in the EU, and the future of the euro -- Prime Minister Papandreou proposed the formation of a unity government, with an eye on passing the measures in the national interest. To this end, the prime minister convened talks with Greek President Karolos Papoulias, arguing passionately that \"a national effort\" was required at this \"historically crucial moment\" to resolve the situation. Prime Minister Papandreou, therefore, met with conservative New Democracy Party leader, Antonis Samaras, to discuss the possible formation of a power-sharing government. For its part, the conservatives demanded that Papandreou step aside and that the rescue package be renegotiated. While Prime Minister Papandreou made it clear that he would be willing to resign as the head of government, the notion of a potentially protracted process of renegotiating the bail-out terms was viewed as untenable at a time of dire instability. Thus, the prime minister abandoned the idea of a unity government and instead announced that he would reveal a new cabinet. The new government, which could very well exclude Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou, the architect of unpopular austerity budget, would have to be ratified via a vote of confidence in the parliament.</p><p>Indeed, on June 17, 2011, as Prime Minister Papandreou unveiled his cabinet changes, it was apparent that Finance Minister Papaconstantinou would no longer be in that role; instead, outgoing Defense Minister Evangelos Venizelos would take on the finance portfolio. Having moved forward with a cabinet shuffle, Greek Prime Minister Papandreou was calling for \"national accord\" in parliament to address the crisis. In a speech to parliament, the Greek head of government said, \"I have asked for a renewal of confidence in the government, because the country finds itself at a crucial point.\"</p><p>The move to appoint Venizelos as the new finance minister was geared toward assuaging the rising tide of discontent among the prime minister's party, PASOK; however, the elimination of Papaconstantinou was simultaneously delivering a negative message to the international community about Greece's ability to seriously and effectively tackle its economic problems. Venizelos statement that he would forge a deal with Greece's bail-out lenders that would allow Greece to implement a less painful reform package indicated that the incoming finance minister would be a weaker voice in the austerity thrust.</p><p>The crisis was seeping outside Greek borders as finance ministers of the euro zone failed to find concurrence on the measures associated with garnering contributions from private creditors towards a second Greek rescue package. Of concern was the potential destabilization of the financial markets as this process played out -- and failed -- in the Belgian capital in Brussels. Now other \"secure\" countries were being affected as news emerged that Moody's might downgrade some French banks -- BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole and Societe Generaledue -- due to their exposure to Greek debt. With an eye on calming the situation, the French government made it clear that its position was consistent with that of the European Central Bank (ECB), which warned that the German plan to convince bondholders to share part of the costs in a new Greek aid package could be risky and lead to default. It was also announced that French President Nicolas Sarkozy would meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on June 17, 2011, to address and resolve the matter.</p><p>On June 19, 2011, finance ministers of the euro zone were meeting in Luxembourg to discuss the anticipated approval of the latest tranche of funds associated with the EU/IMF rescue package for debt-ridden Greece. The group was also expected to consider a second bail-out package for Greece. The new Greek finance minister, Venizelos, attended the meeting and said that his country was committed to meeting the targets of the EU/IMF agreement. In an interview with the media, Venizelos said, \"It is a great opportunity for me to repeat the strong commitment of the Greek government and the strong will of the Greek people for the implementation of the program.\" That being said, recent surveys of the Greek citizenry suggested that the vast majority of Greeks at home were in fact opposed to the austerity measures associated with the rescue package and were increasingly saying that the country should just default. Of course, such a fate would increase exposure of other euro zone countries, increasing the possibility of default elsewhere in the region.</p><p>Note that as June entered its fourth week, the newly-shuffled Greek government was set for a confidence vote. To that end, the government indeed survived the vote with a comfortable majority. Indeed, Prime Minister George Papandreou's new cabinet was approved by 155 votes to 143, with two abstentions. Another vote in parliament on the austerity budget had yet to transpire by the close of June 2011. Release of the EU/IMF rescue package funds would only be released if the austerity measures were passed into legislation in the parliament. Accordingly, the finance ministers of the euro zone postponed their decisions regarding the release of the funds as well as a second rescue package until after the anticipated vote. The new head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde, called on the Greek members of parliament to act to avoid default saying: \"If I have a message this evening about Greece, it is a call to the Greek opposition... to join in national unity with the party which is currently in power. The country's destiny is at stake.\" Warning of global consequences, EU President Herman Van Rompuy said, \"The coming hours will be decisive, crucial for the Greek people, but also for the euro zone and the stability of the world economy.\"</p><p>On June 28, 2011, ahead of the parliamentary vote on the austerity budget, thousands of people had gathered outside the parliamentary building as part of an anticipated mass strike. To that end, as before, transportation and other public services, hospitals, banks, and the Athens international airport, were all either closed down or severely curtailed. In a corner of Syntagma Square, the protest movement, which was intended to be a peaceful gathering, took a violent turn as anarchist youth dressed in black hoods hurled stones, bottles, debris, and even sledgehammers at police, who responded with tear gas and stun grenades. As well, protesters set mobile telecommunications transmitting vehicles were set ablaze, seemingly having been mistaken for being satellite television trucks. Members of trade unions tried to persuade anarchists to stop their violent actions and exit Syntagma Square; they argued that the violence only hurt the objectives of the protest movement. However, the scene had already devolved into some degree of chaos. Indeed, several people were injured in the fracas, including 20 police officers, while a number of demonstrators were detained by authorities.</p><p>With the vote in parliament set to go forward on June 29, 2011, regardless of the chaos in the streets, Greek Prime Minister Papandreou warned that without affirmative action, and further, without being able to secure new loans, the Greek national coffers would fall empty before long. Newly-installed Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos admitted that the austerity measures were \"unfair,\" but argued that there was no other alternative. Greece's Central Banker George Provopoulos warned that a negative vote against the austerity budget vote would constitute \"suicide\" for the country. But on the other side of the equation, the main opposition leader, Antonis Samaras of the New Democracy party, was not keen to assent to the austerity package as it stood (including tax hikes), saying that tax rates should be lowered in order to stimulate the economy. In addition to resistance from the opposition, Prime Minister Papandreou would also have to deal with the aforementioned revolt from within his own PASOK party.</p><p>Nevertheless, on June 29, 2011, when the much-anticipated vote on the austerity budget was held in parliament, the measure passed with a slim majority of 155 votes in its favor to 138 votes against it. Ultimately, only one member of parliament form the ruling PASOK party voted against the bill, although there were a handful of abstentions and \"non\" votes. Contained in the austerity budget were tax increases, cuts to salaries, as well as action on privatizations and public sector redundancies. Greek Prime Minister Papandreou welcomed the passage of the legislation as \"a crucial step\" for Greece. At the multilateral level, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and European Council President Herman Van Rompuy issued a joint statement that hailed the vote as a measure of national responsibility. The statement included the following sentence: \"The country has taken an important step forward along the necessary path of fiscal consolidation and growth-enhancing structural reform.\" However, the vote outcome prompted an angry renewal of violence by protesters in the streets of Athens. A second vote ensued a day later on June 30, 2011, and passed with a majority of votes in its favor. The second bill would reform laws and effectively facilitate the implementation of the rescue package.</p><p>Status of Events in mid-2011</p><p>All eyes were on the deadline in the first week of July 2011 for the euro zone whereby the EU would have to approve the latest rescue loans to Greece. It was assumed that with the parliament voting favorably on the austerity and privatization program, the funds by the EU and IMF would, indeed, be released. To that end, on July 2, 2011, finance ministers of the euro zone said that they would clear the release of the funds for Greece. Yet to be decided were the details surrounding a second bailout package for Greece.</p><p>Note that in mid-July 2011, at an emergency euro zone summit, German Chancellor Angela Merkel cast the second rescue package for Greece in some degree of doubt when she said that there would be no \"spectacular\" measures aimed at resolving Greece's debt crisis, such as the restructuring of Greek debt. The German chancellor made it clear that there needed to be a concrete plan for a second Greek rescue package, if there was any hope that the debt crisis in that country would be prevented from spreading across the euro zone. Merkel's statement appeared to reflect an ongoing disagreement between her country and the European Central Bank (ECB) over the matter of private investors sharing the costs of another rescue deal. Germany, backed by Finland and the Netherlands, has made it clear that private investors need to share the pain, rather than only burdening taxpayers. On the other hand, the ECB has held the view that forcing private investors to take losses on their loans would be akin to a default by Greece on its debts. This impasse did not bode well for the core objective in bailing out Greece in the first place -- the prevention of contagion across the euro zone.</p><p>Ultimately, though, concurrence was reached on July 21, 2011, with a rescue package of about 109 billion euro. Early drafts of the plan indicated that it would entail several proposals to reduce Greece\u2019s debt, including exchanging existing bonds for new lower interest rate bonds, and could result in short-term or \"partial\" default for Greece. To be clear, the plan provides for the Germany-endorsed position that private lenders, including banks, would have to do their part in contributing to the package. Any measures that would allow Greece easier repayment terms could be viewed by credit rating agencies as acknowledgment that its borrowing was unsustainable -- and therefore, \"partial default.\"</p><p>Given this possibility, it was perhaps not surprising that on July 25, 2011, the credit ratings agency, Moody's, cut Greece's rating further, this time from Caa1 to Ca -- only two notches short of a default rating. Moody's said that the plan discussed above to exchange existing bonds for new lower interest rate bonds, would constitute default. Meanwhile, the ratings agency, Fitch, said that this very deal would be understood as \"selective debt default\" by Greece. Already, as noted above, Standard &amp; Poor's had downgraded Greece from B to CCC, effectively pushing the country to the bottom of the list of the 131 monitored countries. Then on July 27, 2011, Standard &amp; Poor's further downgraded Greece from a CCC rating to CC, reflecting its view that the euro zone restructuring debt plan discussed here would constitute a \"selective debt default\" by Greece. Fitch indicated it would follow in a similar direction.</p><p>Recent Developments (Sept. 2011)</p><p>On Sept. 22, 2011, Greek labor unions convened a 24-hour mass action strike to register discontent over further austerity measures instituted by the government. The unions targeted the public transport sector with workers from bus, taxi, train services involved, as well as air traffic controllers stopping work for several hours. Teachers and other civil servants were additionally joining the strike. Athens was expected to shut down, including the airport.</p><p>At issue were the additional strict measures to be taken up by the Greek government to cut pensions and suspend certain civil service jobs, in an effort to satisfy the European Union (EU) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and thus procure the latest installment of loan funding intended to assist Greece in paying its massive debt and avert default. To date, the European Commission, the EU, and the IMF have been unimpressed by Athens' slow pace of reform and have warned that further measures would be needed to qualify for the funding. For the people in the streets, though, there was no appreciation for the need to meet the terms set forth by the EU and the IMF, with many of them disconnected from the financial realities of the scenario, such as default avoidance and maintaining EU status.</p><p>As stated by Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos, \"The situation is extremely critical and I could say dangerous. There is great nervousness in the euro zone, the European banking system and the world economy.\" Whereas Finance Minister Venizelos was saying that the Greek government was prepared to do \"anything\" to avoid deleterious consequences, many Greek citizens were under the impression that they were being faced with years of austerity in order to pay French and German banks, with Greek newspapers striking populist tones and accusing the government of placing Greek citizens on the \"sacrificial altar.\"</p><p>As September 2011 drew to an end, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou was engaged in talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss the efforts by the Greek government to reduce its budget deficit. With Germany funding the bulk of the EU rescue package, support from German quarters was essential. To that end, the Greek head of government also delivered a speech to German business leaders, in which he made his case for German funding assistance in resolving the Greek debt crisis. That being said, the European Commission, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the IMF were yet to travel to Athens to review Greece's progress in reducing debt levels, and to make a decision on the release of the latest tranche of bailout funds. See below for information related to the decision made on that matter.</p><p>Status of Greek Debt Crisis (Oct. 2011)</p><p>At the start of October 2011, the Greek government in Athens adopted its 2012 draft austerity budget. That news was somewhat overshadowed by the Greek government's announcement that the country was likely to miss its deficit reduction targets. Athens blamed its shortfall on meeting deficit reduction targets on the country's deepening recession, pointing toward an economic contraction of 5.5 percent in 2011 rather than a rate of 3.8 percent, as expected months earlier. A statement from the Greek Finance Minister read as follows: \"Three critical months remain to finish 2011, and the final estimate of 8.5 percent of GDP deficit can be achieved if the state mechanism and citizens respond accordingly.\" But the Greek citizenry was in no mood to respond favorably and, instead, continued to take to the streets in strikes and protests.</p><p>In an attempt to cast the scenario in the most positive light, the Greek finance ministry said that it was moving forward with its highly unpopular austerity measures, regardless of the outrage coming from the Greek citizenry. Included in the austerity provisions was a plan to put 30,000 civil service staff on \"labor reserve\" by the end of 2011, as well as cuts to salaries and wages, and a package of tax increases. These austerity measures were intended to show the economic rescue \"troika\" of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Union (EU), and the European Central Bank (ECB) that Greece was taking on necessary measures to address its debt crisis.</p><p>To this end, representatives of the IMF, the EU, and the ECB, were set to review Greece's progress in reducing debt levels, and to make a decision on the release of the latest installment of bailout funds. However, before a decision could be made, the finance ministers from the euro zone put the metaphoric \"brakes\" on the decision-making. After hours of talks in Luxembourg, the finance ministers from the 17-nation euro zone urged Greece to take on more sacrifices and warned that banks in region should prepare for further challenges.</p><p>With a delay on the decision on releasing the latest tranche of bailout funds for Greece, it was yet to be seen if the IMF, EU, and ECB would ultimately recommend the release of eight billion euros in bailout funds for Greece. Some deadlines of significance included mid-October 2011, when the decision would finally be made, and the actual release of funds to come (pending approval) at the close of October 2011. However, the current scenario suggested that Greece might not receive its needed installment of rescue funds until November 2011. Presumably with the aim of preventing a sense of panic, Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos wasted no time in stating that the Greek government would have no funding problems until November 2011. Of course, Greece had earlier indicated it would be in need of funds by the middle of October 2011.</p><p>Note that as October 2011 entered its final week, finance ministers of the euro zone finally approved the tranche of rescue funds needed for Greece to escape disastrous default. The International Monetary Fund would also have to sign off on the release of the bail out money, but all expectations were that Athens would receive the much-needed funds by mid-November 2011.</p><p>Should Greece fail to service its debt commitments, there would be deleterious effects for the euro zone, European banks, and at the international level, there could be a seriously damaging influence on the global economy.</p><p>Chairman of the euro zone finance ministers (known as the euro group), Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg, foreclosed the possibility of a debt default by Greece, while simultaneously warning that Greece's private sector creditors should anticipate further losses on their Greek sovereign debt holdings \u2013 indeed, greater than the 21 percent \"haircut\" that was previously agreed upon months earlier. At that time in July 2011, private sector creditors had agreed to join the euro zone and the IMF in providing a second bailout package for Greece.</p><p>The European Financial Stability Facility</p><p>In mid-October 2011, all euro zone countries had ratified a plan to expand a rescue fund for Europe's heavily indebted countries, known as the European Financial Stability Facility. By the end of the month, European leaders announced that an agreement had been reached to help to resolve the euro zone debt crisis. Central to the agreement was acceptance from the banks that they would take a 50 percent loss on the face value of their Greek debt. Banks would also have to raise more capital to protect them against losses resulting from any future government defaults. As well, the actual rescue or \"bail out\" fund, known as the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), would be boosted to one trillion euros.</p><p>The hope was that the move would aid in reducing Greek debt to 120 percent of GDP by the year, 2020. While this remained a significant enduring debt, it was deemed to be far more sustainable for a recession-plagued economy undertaking harsh austerity measures. It was hoped that the accord would contain the debt crisis and prevent contagion into other vulnerable euro zone countries, such as Italy, Ireland, Spain and Portugal. It was also hoped that the deal would serve to revitalize the credibility of the euro.</p><p>The issue has been an extremely contentious one, with the participants of the global economy anxious for action to be taken in response to the debt crisis, but with stakeholders in various euro zone countries infuriated that they would be funding bailout packages that would benefit countries, such as Greece. It should also be noted that there was a growing chorus of complaints about the slow and protracted political response to the debt crisis and concomitant euro zone challenges, which was largely due to the EU's institutional structure.</p><p>Referendum for Greece?</p><p>By the start of November 2011, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou was seeking national consensus for the implementation of the series of harsh and unpopular austerity measures, which were required elements of the debt relief plan to stabilize Greece and the euro zone. To that end, the embattled Greek head of government was considering seeking the public's ratification of the European Union plan in a national referendum. However, all indications pointed toward a definitively negative outcome at the polls, given the incensed Greek citizenry's antipathy toward the massively unpopular austerity measures, and the belief that the country should simply default and exit the euro zone. The international community reacted in a state of collective horror, given the likely outcome of this risky move. Clearly, a \"no\" vote would return Greece to the brink of economic disaster, as it would effectively be a rejection of the debt relief plan. Prime Minister Papandreou was also facing by a rebellion in his own government and in parliament, with various players outraged at the various options going forward -- austerity or bankruptcy.</p><p>Accordingly, Prime Minister Papandreou on Nov. 3, 2011 backed away from the controversial referendum notion and, instead, suggested that he would pursue coalition talks, with the intention of forming a stable unity (or \"salvation\") government that would be tasked with bringing the Greek economy from the precipice of crisis. Prime Minister Papandreou said, \"We had three alternatives, to call general election, hold a referendum, or achieve a wide consensus.\"</p><p>With the main Greek opposition party reversing course, and now expressing support for the European Union debt relief deal (discussed above), Prime Minister Papandreou was pursuing the third option. The beleaguered Greek head of government said that he had no intention of resigning from office, but that he would seek a confidence vote in parliament, and then move forward with the formation of \"a national salvation government.\"</p><p>Two days later on Nov. 5, 2011, Prime Minister Papandreou survived the crucial confidence vote in parliament and promised to form the aforementioned \"national salvation government.\" Despite open rebellion among the ranks of the ruling Socialists (known by the acronym, PASOK), all PASOK members of parliament stood in solidarity with the prime minister on the confidence motion discussed above. The final vote result was 153 favorable votes and 147 against the Papandreou government. Clearly, it was a narrow victory and may have averted the another potentially negative outcome -- immediate elections, which clearly would have been politically catastrophic for Greece, which was already dealing with economic crisis.</p><p>New Government for Greece</p><p>With the confidence vote behind him, Prime Minister Papandreou pledged that he would commence negotiations to form a national unity (re: \"salvation\") government immediately, saying that he would soon visit Greek President Karolos Papoulias to start the process, and indicating that he was even ready to step aside as head of government, if necessary. After that meeting, the Greek head of government said, \"I informed the president on my intention to seek wide consensus in order to proceed with the implementation of the historic decisions of October 26 upon which depends our membership inthe euro zone.\" The outcome of the negotiations, though, remained hazy.</p><p>At issue was a brewing disagreement on the tenure of the interim government and the timeline leading to fresh elections. Antonis Samaras, the head of the main opposition New Democracy (ND) party, was insisting that the interim government have only a limited term, given the immediate objective at hand (re: rescuing Greece from the brink of economic disaster under the aegis of national consensus), with snap elections to be held by the year's end. Samaras argued, \u201cThe masks have fallen. Mr. Papandreou has rejected our proposals in their entirety. The responsibility he bears is huge. The only solution is elections.\u201d</p><p>It was possible that Prime Minister Papandreou could form a coalition government with two minor opposition parties, whose leaders have expressed their willingness to join a temporary coalition. These two right-wing parties appeared more amenable to a longer timeline of cooperation with Papandreou, expressing doubt that any coalition government would be able to easily push through parliament the necessary legislation to enact the provisions of the European Union debt relief deal. They were particularly skeptical that the interim government would be effective without the involvement of the ND, which was emphatic in its demands for snap elections by the end of 2011.</p><p>By Nov. 6, 2011, opposition leader Samaras of the ND was demanding that Prime Minister Papandreou resign from office, arguing that the head of government was taking too long to enact reforms. In an interview with the media, Samaras said, \"The prime minister must decide what he wants to do, as by not resigning he hampers any solution.\" Samaras also made it clear that his party would not participate in a national coalition plan if Papandreou remained as prime minister. For his part, Prime Minister Papandreou had made it clear that he was willing to relinquish his post -- but only after a national unity government was formed, rather than as a condition of that possible outcome. It was evident that the two main political parties in Greece -- PASOK and the ND -- were embroiled in a high-stakes game of political brinkmanship, with the national, and indeed, the international community as the metaphoric victims in the center of the political cross-fire.</p><p>Nevertheless, later on that very day, the office of the Greek Presidency announced that a new coalition government had been formed, without Prime Minister George Papandreou, who had agreed to step down as the head of government. Once a new prime minister was named, President Papoulias would prevail on all parties to join the new government. All eyes were on current Finance Minister Venizelos or former Deputy President of the European Central Bank Lukas Papademos, as possible candidates to head the new national government.</p><p>Ultimately, on Nov. 7, 2011, it was Papademos who was tapped to be the interim leader of the new transitional Greek administration. With academic gravitas as an economist who has written extensively about the debt crisis as well as macroeconomic theory, the structure and functioning of financial markets, monetary analysis and policy, economic performance, financial stability, and economic policy in the European Union, Papademos was regarded as a credible choice to guide the interim \"national salvation\" government. Papademos' background at the helm of the European Central Bank augured the possibility of a cooperative relationship with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund during this time of crisis.</p><p>Note that Prime Minister Papademos' government won a confidence vote in parliament on Nov 16, 2011. The governing coalition garnered a substantial majority of 255 favorable votes. The successful vote was a significant development for the new government, despite strong concerns from opposition parties -- the conservative New Democracy party and the far right Laos party -- regarding the austerity measures that are part of the plan to address the Greek debt crisis.</p><p>It was hoped that the concurrence on the new interim government would bring an end to the climate of turmoil and uncertainty gripping Greece and the overall euro zone. Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos was warning that the Greek economy remained in \u201cmortal danger,\u201d ultimately requiring that the interim government toremain in power long enough to ensure the full implementation of all necessary procedures to stabilize the Greek economy. Indeed, the interim government would be tasked with implementing the full slate of required procedures needed to stabilize the Greek economy. It would have to ensure the release of the next European Union / International Monetary Fund loan installment in the near future, and would also have to finalize legislation for the new rescue package. Most importantly, that legislation would have to be passed into law. Moreover, Greece would have to look to private creditors for assistance in writing off its debt.</p><p>Recent Developments --</p><p>By the start of December 2011, the leaders of the two biggest players in the euro zone -- French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel -- issued a joint call for serious changes to Europe\u2019s governing treaties, aimed at ameliorated economic governance for the 17 countries that make up the euro currency bloc. French President Sarkozy and German Chancellor Merkel met for talks on the matter in Paris as the euro zone countries continue to grapple with the regional debt crisis, emanating from Greece but extending across the euro bloc.</p><p>Included in their proposal were: (1) the creation of a monetary fund for Europe, (2) automatic penalties for countries that exceed European deficit limits, and (3) monthly meetings of European leaders. The proposal entailed compromises by both European leaders. President Sarkozy had to accept the notion of automatic sanctions for countries in violation of debt limit rules, while Chancellor Merkel had to accept that the European Court of Justice will not be empowered with the power of veto over budgets. Meanwhile, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which was intended to replace the European Financial Stability Facility in 2013, would be advanced earlier in 2012.</p><p>President Sarkozy said that they were looking to March 2012 to complete negotiations on the new treaty. Ideally, the new treaty would be ratified by all 27 member states of the European Union. However, if concurrence at that level proved impossible, then the 17 states of the euro zone would have to approve it. It should also be noted that European Council President Herman Van Rompuy has said that tougher budget rules for the euro zone may not require changing any existing European Union treaties. To that</p><p>President Sarkozy emphasized the imperative that such a crisis not re-emerge in the future. He said, \"We are conscious of the gravity of the situation and of the responsibility that rests on our shoulders.\" For her part, Chancellor Merkel said her country, working in concert with France, was \"absolutely determined\" to maintain a stable euro. She also advocated for \"structural changes which go beyond agreements.\"</p><p>While the new measures would certainly go a long way to addressing the issue of improved economic governance in the euro zone, they did not deal with the question of how many euro zone countries would deal with their debt challenges in a climate of low growth. Nevertheless, in the short run, the steadfast and unified message of intent by the two European leaders was, at least. expected to calm markets and facilitate lower borrowing costs for debt-ridden economies such as Italy, Spain, and Portugal.</p><p>Meanwhile, on Dec. 5, 2011, the credit ratings agency, Standard and Poor's, placed the countries of the euro zone on a \"credit watch\" with negative implications. Even power house economies of Germany and France were included in the move, which presaged a downgrade to come in the future. A day later, Standard and Poor's even warned that the euro zone bailout fund -- the European Financial Stability Facility -- could lose its own AAA rating. These moves have raised eyebrows across the world as regards the credibility of the ratings agency, which failed to warn the world of the sub-prime meltdown in 2008 that ultimately let to the global financial crisis. There were suggestions that this downgrade threat to euro zone countries, in conjunction with the downgrade of the United States months earlier following a particularly ferocious debt ceiling debate in that country, were evidence that the credit ratings agency was trying to \"save face\" by proving its tougher standards at this time. However, Standard and Poor's newly-discovered hard-line stance was being questioned by analysts, who pointed to the timing of the warning against euro zone countries. Indeed, this warning came precisely at a time when France and Germany were leading the charge in the European Union to solve the regional debt crisis emanating from Greece, which has left the euro vulnerable, risked fragmenting the currency union, and which could yet imperil the fragile global economic recovery.</p><p>In January 2012, the credit ratings agency, Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s, downgraded the status of a number of European countries. That being said, Greece's rating was already at \"junk status.\"</p><p>Special Report:</p><p>Greece on the brink; Athens in flames as Greek members of parliament vote to approve austerity measures</p><p>Background</p><p>In recent years, an ongoing debt crisis has raged across the euro zone countries of the European Union (EU). Since 2010, Greece has stood as \"ground zero\" of the crisis, evoking deep anxieties about that country defaulting on its debt.</p><p>Anxieties also increased that a similarly disastrous fate could spread to other EU member states, such as Portugal, Spain, Italy and even Ireland. There were prevailing fears of contagion emanating from the Greek debt crisis, but extending to these mostly southern European economies, which were plagued not only by high deficits but also inherent structural economic weakness.</p><p>The crisis in Greece led to the development of a rescue plan by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, which was aimed at averting sovereign default by Athens. In a separate but related development, the euro zone approved an expansion of the euro bailout fund, breathing life into what has been known as the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).</p><p>Despite agreeing to the debt relief package and the expansion of the EFSF, the European Union has not been quick to agree to the release of rescue funds for Greece, as concerns have risen about that country meeting necessary conditions -- the implementation of austerity measures and reforms -- associated with the relief package.</p><p>A new technocratic government was formed and tasked with pushing through the necessary legislation to implement the required austerity measures and reforms, and securing a further tranche of rescue funds aimed at averting default. But no government can function divorced from the reality of the political realm, and the political scene in Greece was one in which the politicians -- fearing the reaction of an infuriated citizenry -- were not going to easily assent to the stringent transformations needed to secure rescue funds.</p><p>Of course, without the enactment of the debt relief plan, Greece would fail to service its debt commitments -- essentially defaulting on its sovereign debt, and yielding deleterious effects for the euro zone and European banks. At the international level, there could be a seriously damaging influence on the global economy.</p><p>Just past midnight on Feb. 13, 2012, Greek members of parliament voted to approve the austerity and reform package needed to secure rescue funds. But outside the parliament in the streets of Athens, the city was literally ablaze as rioters and protesters set fire to buildings to register their outrage.</p><p>Landscape at the start of 2012</p><p>In late January 2012, Greek authorities were set to meet with private creditors to forge a debt write-off agreement that would reduce Greece's debt. At issue was the lack of concurrence over an interest rate on new bonds that would replace existing debts. The Institute of International Finance ( IIF), which was representing Greece's private creditors in negotiations with the Greek authorities, said that it desired a four percent interest rate on newly-issued bonds. Athens, however, sought a lower rate. Should an agreement be reached, Greece would be positioned for additional rescue funding. Indeed, forging an agreement with private creditors has been mandated before further rescue funds can be dispatched by the European Union, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund. Of course, without those funds, Athens would default on its forthcoming loan repayments.</p><p>There remained questions about whether the intervention of the private creditors would be enough to provide Greece with relief. Accordingly, Christine Lagarde -- the head of the International Monetary Fund -- said that if the level of Greek debt held by the private sector was not sufficiently renegotiated, then public sector holders of Greek debt should also participate in the effort. An unfavorable outcome to this process could result in Greece being forced to exit the euro zone.</p><p>It should be noted that in January 2012, credit ratings agencies downgraded the status of a number of European countries. That being said, Greece's rating was already at \"junk status.\"</p><p>By the start of February 2012, there was no consensus within the Greek leadership regarding the terms of certain reforms and austerity measures needed to secure an aid package. While Greek politicians agreed to cut significant government jobs in 2012, there was also no consensus over reductions in salaries. Indeed, Greek politicians were refusing to yield to the demands of the European Union that severe austerity measures be implemented. There were rumors circulating that interim technocratic Prime Minister Lucas Papademos might consider resigning from office if he failed to gain the support of the three political parties backing the coalition administration. That objective became harder to accomplish when Greek unions closed ranks with management groups and made it clear that they were opposed to proposed salary reductions. They said that wage reductions were unacceptable. Moreover, two of the largest trade unions in Greece were set to commence strikes to register discontent over the plans for pay cuts.</p><p>Given the lack of progress made regarding necessary reforms and austerity measures, Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos blasted the political parties for failing to approach the talks with a sense of urgency. He said, \"Instead of looking at this tragic dilemma... there are many who spend their effort on a conventional, outdated, party confrontation as if nothing has happened. Sadly, we are distracted and we are not telling the Greek people the truth,\" he said in a statement.</p><p>Euro zone leadership frustrated by Greece's lack of action</p><p>At the broader level, other countries of the European Union were making it clear that Greece needed to immediately take the necessary steps -- already agreed upon -- to avoid default. As stated by French President Nicolas Sarkozy, \"Greece's leaders have made commitments and they must respect them scrupulously.\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned the refusal of Greece to take the necessary steps toward austerity and reform threatened \"the entire euro zone .\" The German Chancellor said, \"There can be no new Greece program if agreement is not reached... All those who bear responsibility in Greece must know -- we will not deviate from this position.\" She also expressed frustration over the slowness of Greece to take action, saying, \"I honestly can't understand how additional days will help. Time is of the essence. A lot is at stake forthe entire euro zone.\"</p><p>Likewise, Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the euro zone group of finance ministers, said in an interview with Der Spiegel that he had lost his patience with Greece. He warned that if Athens failed to move forward the required reforms and austerity measures, and failed to forge a debt write off agreement with private creditors, \"Then there would not be a new program and that would mean that in March a declaration of bankruptcy would occur.\"</p><p>Latest Developments (February 2012)</p><p>On Feb. 9. 2012, Greek political leaders finally announced they had reached an agreement by which a package of harsh austerity and reform measures would be enacted into law, as demanded by Greece's financial backers.</p><p>The package included 15,000 public-sector job cuts (as discussed above), the lowering of the minimum wage by 20 percent (a key sticking point that was now going to go forward), the liberalization (or reform) of labor laws, and negotiations aimed at a debt write-off with banks. The package was presented to a gathering of euro zone ministers in Brussels; there, leaders of the European bloc expressed the view that the package was short on savings and that they needed \"strong political assurances\" on the implementation of the packages.</p><p>To that latter end, attention was soon refocused on the approval of the associated legislation by the Greek cabinet and final passage in the Greek parliament.</p><p>While approval in the Greek cabinet occurred, five government ministers resigned from office presumably to show disapproval for the harshness of the measures. Now, the action shifted to the parliament where the bill had to passed if Greece hoped to receive funds needed to avoid bankruptcy in March 2012.</p><p>On Feb. 11, 2012, Prime Minister Papademos took to the air waves in Greece to warn the Greek citizenry that failure to pass the legislation would be \"disastrous\" for the country. He said, \"The social cost of this program is limited in comparison with the economic and social catastrophe that would follow if we didn't adopt it.\" Prime Minister Papademos warned that without the passage of the bill and the infusion of rescue funds, the Greek government would be unable to pay wages, and there would be disruptions to the importation of fuel, medicine and machinery. He argued affirmatively for the legislation asserting, \"It would be a huge historical injustice if the country from which European culture sprang ... reached bankruptcy and was led, due to one more mistake, to national isolation and national despair.\"</p><p>By Feb. 12, 2012, members of parliament were soon ensconced in the process of debating the bill and introducing the legislative measures. The general consensus was that the legislation would be passed since PASOK, along with its coalition ally, New Democracy, controlled more than 230 seats in the 200-seat unicameral \"Vouli ton Ellinon\" or parliament. Members of the Greek legislative body would also have to vote on an additional bill dealing with the debt write-off agreement with private banks.</p><p>As members of parliament debated the legislation, Greeks outside of parliament were opposing the move. While the international community understood that default in Greece could imperil the financial stability of Europe, Greek citizens had a different perspective. Greek citizens, by and large, haveviewed themselves to be already suffering under the weight of an economic disaster and have vociferously opposed further measures that would worsen their living conditions. Indeed, large swaths of the country believed that Greece should exit the euro zone, return to a devalued \"drachma\" (the former currency), and dealing with the consequences with less of an acute stranglehold. Of course, the wishes of the Greek masses and decision makers in Athens and across Europe were on a collision course.</p><p>Perhaps not surprisingly, tens of thousands of people took to the streets to voice their outrage over the proposed austerity and reform legislation. Indeed, for successive days, mass protests rocked Athens. The scene turned violent in Athens on Feb. 12, 2012, as black-masked protesters protesters hurled stones and petrol bombs, leaving buildings damaged and scores of people injured. Battles between protesters and security forces were ongoing throughout the capital. Meanwhile, riots were breaking out in other parts of the country, such as the northern city of Thessaloniki, but also spreading to islands such as Corfu and Crete.</p><p>For his part, Prime Minister Papademos condemned the breakdown of social order saying, \"Vandalism, violence and destruction have no place in a democratic country and won't be tolerated.\"</p><p>Just past midnight on Feb. 13, 2012, Greek members of parliament voted to approve the austerity and reform package needed to secure rescue funds. The economic reform and austerity bill passed overwhelmingly with 199 votes in its favor, 74 votes against it, and 27 abstentions. After the vote, Greece's coalition government expelled 43 members of parliament from its ranks for voting against the cuts. Members of parliament also voted affirmatively to give Prime Minister Papademos' interim government authority to sign a new loan agreement with foreign lenders, and to forge debt write off deal with private banks.</p><p>But outside the parliament in Syntagma Square -- the center of Athens -- tear gas filled the air as security forces tried to disperse angry crowds. In the streets of Athens, the city was literally ablaze as rioters and protesters set fire to buildings to register their outrage. Among the facilities set on fire were cafes, theaters, banks, and historic buildings -- all necessary interests in a country reliant on tourism for revenue. The irony seemed lost of demonstrators who were intent only on expressing their rage at the situation. Left unstated, however, was the fact that Greece has had a long history of tax evasion -- a phenomenon that led to the fact that there has been insufficient means to fund the very social welfare programs and benefits that the citizenry wants to preserve.</p><p>In an interview with Reuters, Costis Hatzidakis, a conservative member of parliament, called on his fellow legislators to stand strong in favor of the austerity and reform package saying, \"We are facing destruction. Our country, our home, has become ripe for burning, the center of Athens is in flames. We cannot allow populism to burn our country down.\"</p><p>On Feb. 18, 2012, the Greek cabinet approved the final austerity package, which aimed to secure further international financing. Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos -- speaking during the extraordinary meeting of the cabinet -- expressed confidence for a positive outcome. As before, Greek activists took to the streets and rallies in front of parliament and at Syntagma Square to register their opposition to the austerity and reform agenda, which they argued has placed an undue burden on the shoulders of the poor and the working class of the country.</p><p>The Rescue Deal</p><p>A meeting of the finance ministers of the euro zone took place on Feb. 20, 2012; participants there would decide whether or not to approve the funding needed for Greece to avoid bankruptcy. Reports were emerging that some euro zone finance ministers needed further assurances of Greece's commitment to actually implementing all necessary measures. Meanwhile, Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the euro group, called for further oversight regarding Greece's implementation of its austerity plans. That spirit of skepticism left the likely outcome of the meeting very much in doubt.</p><p>Late into the night, euro zone finance ministers were holding talks aimed at securing rescue funds for Greece. Early on Feb. 21, 2012, Reuters reported that an agreement had been forged on a 130 billion euro rescue package, and a 121 percent debt to GDP ratio; the deal also included strict conditions and aimed to avert imminent Greek bankruptcy. Still, many economists argued that the deal might serve only to delay default, with recovery of the Greek economy expected to take up to a decade to accomplish.</p><p>According to Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos, the deal meant that his country would avoid a nightmare scenario. He also cast the agreement as the most important in Greece's post-war history. Venizelos additionally urged the rest of cabinet to find ways to implement the measures mandated by international lenders, such as further massive cuts and increased monitoring by the euro zone.</p><p>Since Greece has already been subject to harsh austerity measures due to the previous bailout or rescue package, many in the citizenry were in no mood for further hardship. Not surprisingly, unions were calling for more strikes and other such protest actions.</p><p>On Feb. 29, 2012, the Greek parliament passed a fresh package of spending cuts intended to secure the release of the aforementioned rescue funds, and avoid bankruptcy. The measures -- valued at 3.2 billion euros -- were part of the action plan required by international creditors and suggested by the Greek finance minister, in order to secure the release of the vital rescue package.</p><p>Given the reality of further austerity measures, protesters again took to the streets. The latest round of mass action was organized by Greek labor unions demanding \"employment and social justice.\" Included in the demonstrations and strikes were doctors and nurses from public hospitals protesting the cutbacks on health care and prescribed medicines to slash deficits. They argued that these moves would create risks for patients and consign medical personnel to poverty. They were joined by pharmacists protesting an extension on the working hours, as well as public servants outraged over supplementary spending cuts. Meanwhile, the umbrella trade union of civil servants and private sector employees closed ranks to protest the reduction of the minimum wage in the private sector, which the Greek government said would spur competitiveness and growth. Not to be left out, lawyers, civil engineers, and other professionals participated in a protest facing the Greek Finance Ministry.</p><p>As the first week of March 2012 came to a close, Greek authorities said they were close to forging a debt swap deal with bondholders. Then, on March 12, 2012, Greece said it had forged a debt swap deal with bondholders to avert default. Under the Private Sector Involvement (PSI) scheme sanctioned by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund lenders, old bonds would be exchanged for new ones with lower value, lower interest rates, and extended maturities. The majority of private investors holding bonds gave their assent to the plan. That being said, the collective action clauses (CACs) activated by the Greek government to force losses on reluctant bondholders resulted in further downgrades of Greece's credit ratings by international agencies, which now categorized Greece as being in a state of \"restricted default.\"</p><p>Further Recent Developments:</p><p>On April 5, 2012, a man committed suicide outside the Greek parliament. The 77-year old retired chemist shot himself to death to protest the government's austerity measures, which included cutting his pension. According to Greek media, a suicide note was found in which the man accused the government of reducing his pension to nothing. As reported by the Athens News, the suicide note read as follows: \"The government has annihilated all traces for my survival, which was based on a very dignified pension that I alone paid for 35 years with no help from the state. And since my advanced age does not allow me a way of dynamically reacting... I see no other solution than this dignified end to my life, so I don't find myself fishing through garbage cans for my sustenance.\"</p><p>Flowers were laid in remembrance of the man at the spot where he died, along with notes reading messages such as \"Enough is enough\" and \"Who will be next?\" Meanwhile, enraged Greek protesters took to the streets of the Greek capital city of Athens to register their horror. Violence erupted as the protesters hurled rocks and petrol bombs at the riot police, who used tear gas to disperse the angry crowds.</p><p>With the capital city in a state of uproar, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos issued a statement. He said, \"In these difficult hours for our society we must all -- the state and the citizens -- support the people among us who are desperate.\" Evangelos Venizelos, of the socialist Pasok party that holds a majority in the coalition government, called on colleagues to refrain from \"political commentary\" and \"show solidarity and togetherness.\" Antonis Samaras, the head of the conservative New Democracy party, said politicians had to do more to \"help Greeks escape from despair.\"</p><p>According to a report in Reuters, suicides have increased by 18 percent in Greece in 2010 from the previous year; in Athens alone, the rate of suicide rose 25 percent over 2011 rates.</p><p>Primer on 2012 Elections in Greece:</p><p>Summary --</p><p>Elections were held in Greece on May 6, 2012. That vote yielded inconclusive results, with no one party gaining a majority or able to form a viable government coalition, despite three successive attempts at achieving that end. Accordingly, a new \"re-run\" election was set for June 17, 2012. At stake in the parliamentary elections of Greece would be the 300 seats of the unicameral \"Vouli ton Ellinon\" (Parliament).</p><p>Background --</p><p>An ongoing debt crisis has plagued Greece, leading to the need for a rescue plan from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, with an eye on averting sovereign default. Despite agreeing to the debt relief package and the expansion of the EFSF, though, the European Union has not been quick to agree to the release of rescue funds for Greece, as concerns have risen about that country meeting necessary conditions -- the implementation of austerity measures and reforms -- associated with the relief package.</p><p>To that end, in late October 2011, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou initially advanced the idea of a national referendum aimed at ratifying the debt relief plan. However, with the angry and outraged Greek citizenry unlikely to ratify the plan, the prime minister ultimately withdrew the referendum idea. Prime Minister Papandreou soon resigned from office, as demanded by the opposition, making way for the formation of a national unity government.</p><p>At the start of November 2011, the office of the Greek Presidency announced that a new coalition government had been formed. Once a new prime minister was named, President Papoulias would prevail on all parties to join the new government. Ultimately, it was former Deputy President of the European Central Bank Lukas Papademos who was tapped to be the interim leader of the new transitional Greek administration. With academic gravitas as an economist who has written extensively about the debt crisis as well as macroeconomic theory, the structure and functioning of financial markets, monetary analysis and policy, economic performance, financial stability, and economic policy in the European Union, Papademos was regarded as a credible choice to guide the interim \"national salvation\" government. Papademos' background at the helm of the European Central Bank augured the possibility of a cooperative relationship with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund during this time of crisis.</p><p>It was hoped that the concurrence on the new interim government would bring an end to the climate of turmoil and uncertainty gripping Greece and the overall euro zone. As noted above, the new government would be tasked with implementing the full slate of required procedures needed to stabilize the Greek economy. It would also have to facilitate the release of the next installment of European Union/International Monetary Fund loan funds, including the passage of legislation associated with the rescue package. Before that could take place, Greece would have to have its economic affairs in order since the country would run out of money by December 2011, thus risking default. All eyes were on the spring of 2012 for a likely election timetable.</p><p>Pre-election developments (ahead of the May 2012 vote) --</p><p>On March 19, 2012, Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos resigned from his cabinet post to take over the leadership of the ruling Greece's Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) in its campaign for the general elections to be held in late April or early May 2012. Outgoing PASOK President George Papandreou expressed hope for a new beginning, saying: \"This is a new start for both of us ... We will continue to work together for the sake of the country.\"</p><p>It should be noted that the major parties participating in the ruling coalition posted dismal approval ratings ahead of the elections, but all expectations were that the new government would also involve a coalition of various parties.</p><p>As March 2012 came to a close, polling data from the Kathimerini newspaper showed the conservative New Democracy party, which supports the outgoing technocratic government as well as its harsh austerity and structural reform measures, in the lead with 22.5 percent. The socialist PASOK, which was also in the outgoing coalition, followed in second place with 15.5 percent of the vote. The communists and the leftist SYRIZA were posting about 12 percent of support respectively, while the newly-formed Democratic Left, Independent Greeks, the Greek Ecologist Greens, and the far-right neo-Nazi \"Golden Dawn\" were all trailing behind, but still expected to gain parliamentary representation.</p><p>Together, the two main parties -- the conservative New Democracy party and the socialist PASOK -- could collectively secure enough votes to meet the 38 percent threshold required to obtain a parliamentary majority, thus ratifying their coalition for a new term in office. Still, a larger contingent of voters -- 48 percent -- would prefer a left-wing coalition that would oppose the austerity and structural reform agenda.</p><p>Note that in April 2012, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos announced that elections would be held on May 6, 2012, and called on President Karolos Papoulias to dissolve parliament. With his technocratic government set to end, Prime Minister Papademos said he believed his government left behind \"an important legacy.\" He also urged cabinet ministers and political parties to prevail in their efforts to overcome the debt crisis, and cautioned that any future administration would \"have to make decisions promptly in order to complete the efforts to revive our economy.\"</p><p>Greece's two main parties -- the conservative New Democracy party and the socialist PASOK -- were expected to capture the lion's share of the vote. The main question was whether the two parties -- which support the reform agenda -- could garner the 38 percent threshold necessary to secure a majority in the 300-member parliamentary chamber. There was also some indication that left-wing and right-wing parties, which have been opposed to the unpopular austerity measures associated with the bailout funds, could make significant gains. The leftist SYRIZA coalition, the Democratic Left, the Greek Communist Party, the new Rightist Independent Greeks, and the far-right Golden Dawn could well post historic performances at the polls, given the Greek public's outrage over the austerity programs being put into place. Of course, electoral success for anti-austerity parties could threaten the rescue funding structure currently in place, risk disorderly default for Greece, and thus imperil the entire euro zone.</p><p>In the week ahead of the vote, PASOK leader Evangelos Venizelos promised to lead the country out of its debt crisis by 2015 if the party was elected in the upcoming elections. Antonis Samaras, the head of the conservative New Democracy (ND), made the same election promise. Polling data at the close of April 2012 gave Samaras and the ND the edge, although neither party was likely to have enough seats to command a parliamentary majority. Accordingly, a new coalition was likely in the offing.</p><p>Results of the May 2012 election --</p><p>As the votes were being counted, it was clear that the two main governing parties of Greece were suffering significant losses. Samaras' conservative New Democracy party was leading the country's general elections by a narrow margin with 19 percent of vote share. Center-left PASOK had slipped to third place with just over 13 percent. Left-wing SYRIZA was boosted to second place with close to 17 percent. The right-wing Independent Greeks secured ten percent while the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn managed to garner seven percent and could be positioned to enter parliament for the first time.</p><p>The result suggested that the coalition -- composed of New Democracy and PASOK, which formed the outgoing pro-austerity and reform government -- would not command a majority in parliament. The result also showed the ascendancy of SYRIZA , which has argued vociferously against austerity and reform. Indeed, this result for SYRIZA and even Golden Dawn was illustrative of the impassioned anger by the Greek people against the harsh measures, which were imposed in conjunction with the international rescue packages, in order to prevent Greece from defaulting on its debt.</p><p>Government Formation --</p><p>Having won the plurality of the vote share, Samaras and New Democracy would have the first opportunity to try to form a government. To that end, Samaras said he would form a national salvation government, aimed at keeping Greece in the euro zone. He also said he would try to \"amend\" Greece's bailout agreement with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund in order to increase economic growth. But if Samaras failed to be able to form a government after a three-day period, then SYRIZA would have three days to form a coalition government. To that end, SYRIZA leader, Alexis Tsipras, said he wanted to form a left-wing coalition that would set aside arrangements related to the Greek bailout scheme. Tspiras said the vote made clear that the Greek party had rejected the path of rescue plans and reform. He explained, \"The parties that signed the memorandum (with the EU and the IMF) are now a minority. The public verdict has de-legitimized them.\" PASOK would have its own chance to form a government if Syria\u2019s effort ended in failure after three days. For his part, Venizelos called for a broad coalition or unity government including pro-European parties.</p><p>The government formation process promised to be difficult since New Democracy and PASOK would likely search for pro-euro zone partners, and those options were limited. Meanwhile, the likes of SYRIZA sought to step away from the euro zone-endorsed rescue package and reforms -- stances that both New Democracy and PASOK do not support. Thus, the path toward a viable new coalition was limited. Should all of the three successive efforts toward government formation fail, then Greeks would have to return to the polls in another election. In this way, the scene in Greece after the May 6, 2012, was one of turmoil and turbulence. Indeed, without a stable government willing to adhere to the arrangement forged with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, Greece would not have access to rescue funds. This would return Greece to its prevailing risk of defaulting and possibly exiting the euro zone.</p><p>Note that on May 7, 2012, after one day of serious government formation negotiations, Samaras, the leader of the conservative New Democracy Party, said he was not able to forge a workable coalition and that he returned the government formation mandate to President Karolos Papoulias. \"We did everything we could,\" said Samaras. \"It was impossible. I handed back the mandate.\" Although parties actually have three days to try to form a government, Samaras said he did not want to waste any time, given the dire situation for Greece.</p><p>The leftist bloc, SYRIZA , would now be charged with the mandate of trying to form a ruling coalition. Speaking of his task, SYRIZA leader Tsipras said: \"We will exhaust all possibilities to reach an understanding, primarily with the forces of the left.\" But Tsipras then followed in the footsteps of New Democracy and failed to form a ruling coalition. For the SYRIZA leader, it was imperative that his party not compromise its anti-austerity stance. \"The bailout austerity has already been denounced by the Greek people with its vote, and no government has the right to enforce it,\" Tsipras said.</p><p>The charge for forging a workable coalition then fell on the Socialist leader, Venizelos. That effort likewise resulted in a similar manner. PASOK was able to close ranks with New Democracy but unable to find a third coalition partner. Accordingly, Venizelos formally returned the mandate to the president.</p><p>Such an end had been highly anticipated as the combination of seats for certain parties with corresponding ideologies simply did not add up to a workable result. Stated in plain terms, SYRIZA had firmly rejected the terms of the EU-IMF bailout plan, which required the implementation of harsh austerity measures and structural reforms in return for loan funding. Without the participation of SYRIZA , however, it was unlikely any coalition could be forged. Meanwhile, as explained here, SYRIZA was itself unable to form a workable alliance without one of the two pro-bailout parties -- New Democracy and PASOK. The result was a political impasse.</p><p>President Karolos Papoulias convened emergency meetings on May 13, 2012, with an eye on forming some sort of unity government, of a technocratic variety. The president invited the three largest parties -- center-right New Democracy, socialist PASOK, and the far-left bloc SYRIZA -- for talks. That move was not welcomed by the Greek populace who did not look kindly on the outgoing technocratic government of Papademos; they viewed it as not democratically-elected and responsible for ushering in the dark age of structural economic reform. Ultimately, with the parties divided over the key issue of austerity, the last-ditch effort by the president to form a unity technocratic government ended in failure. Indeed, SYRIZA reiterated its uncompromising stance that it would not join any ruling coalition that instituted further cuts or harsh measures.</p><p>Future Course --</p><p>As of mid-May 2012, with efforts at either forming a governing coalition or a new technocratic government ending without resolution, Greek voters would be returning to the polls, possibly as soon as June 2012. There were strong indications that a new vote could end with SYRIZA winning a plurality of the vote share, possible paving the way for a government willing to walk away from the aforementioned EU-IMF bailout plan.</p><p>Of course, such a course would augur default, act as a catalyst for the possible exit of Greece from the euro zone, and facilitate a return to the drachma. The consequences for Greece -- and Europe at large -- could be dire, as predicted by Germany. The head of Germany's central bank, Jens Weidmann, offered this warning: \"For Greece the consequences would be much more grave than for the rest of the euro zone.\" He continued, \"If Athens does not stand by its word, then that's a democratic decision. The result is that there is no more basis for further financial aid.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, credits ratings agencies were predicting that Greece's exit from the euro zone would affect all the remaining euro zone countries. Specifically, the Fitch ratings agency warned that if Greece abandoned the euro, not only would Greece would be deleteriously affected, but all the sovereign ratings of all the 16 remaining euro zone countries would be placed on negative watch in anticipation of a downgrade.</p><p>Ratings aside, the exit of Greece from the euro zone would also be a blow to the entire framework of Europe's monetary union. Although Jean-Claude Juncker -- the prime minister of Luxembourg and the head of the euro zone -- dismissed the notion of Greece's withdrawal from the bloc as \"nonsense,\" the fact that such a prospect was now being openly debated in Europe illuminated the tumultuous landscape.</p><p>According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, fear and doubt about the economic landscape in Greece led to the withdrawal of nearly $900 million from local banks by Greek depositors on May 14, 2012, alone. The withdrawal of funds was confirmed by President Papoulias who said the withdrawals, in conjunction with \"buy orders\" received by Greek banks for German bonds, placed Greece's lenders in a difficult position and that the banks were \"very weak right now.\" $900 million in one day was clearly a concerning event since outflows in the last two years have amounted to between one and two billion on a monthly basis.</p><p>A \"re-run\" election in June 2012 --</p><p>A caretaker government was formed on May 16, 2012, with elections set to be held in mid-June 2012. Panayiotis Pikramenos, the head of one of Greece's high courts, was named to head Greece's caretaker government ahead of the next elections to be held on June 17, 2012.</p><p>There were serious anxieties that the second elections in the span of a month would, likewise, yield an inconclusive result. Indeed, another divided parliament would do little to resolve the state of impasse in the country as it wrestles with its debt crisis. There was an additional dimension to these anxieties from among some national and international factions that leftist parties could eke control of parliament. Such an end would serve a decisive death knell to the austerity and reform agenda required by the EU and IMF rescue funding deal, and could well spell catastrophic default for Greece.</p><p>Polling data in mid-May 2012 showed that the conservative pro-reform agenda New Democracy was on track to win the most votes. PASOK (also pro-reform despite its Socialist leanings) was expected to post another third-place finish after SYRIZA. This time, though, the two parties in favor of the rescue and reform agenda were expected to have enough seats to form a government, effectively avoiding the impasse of the previous elections. This polling result was a shift from polling data the previous week that showed SYRIZA poised to win the elections. It would seem that after having vented their anger against the establishment parties in the May 2012 elections, voters were slowly coming to the realization that the stakes were high.</p><p>Meanwhile, news emerged that New Democracy would forge an agreement with the other conservative party, the Democratic Alliance, to come together for the June 17, 2012, polls and foreclose vote splitting. This agreement between New Democracy and Democratic Alliance would open the door for a wide alliance of pro-European, pro-reform agenda, parties to form a government.</p><p>SYRIZA party leader Tsipras insisted that the terms of the bailout would have to be replaced, and that his party was confident that new terms could be negotiated with international lenders. Explaining his approach as follows: \"We will not go to the table of dialogue aggressively,\" Tsipras was quite sure that SYRIZA could convince international lenders that austerity in return of the two rescue packages would be catastrophic for Greece's economy, and therefore, they would be amenable to the notion of a new deal that would yet furnish necessary rescue funds. Tsipras was undaunted by the prospect of lenders halting the disbursement of further loans to Greece, and dismissed the notion that a chaotic default on the part of Greece would end its that country's exit from the euro zone. In regards to SYRIZA's participation in a future Greek government, Tsipras expected to lead that government, which he said would consist of a \"left-wing coalition\" and would include the Greek Communists and the Democratic Left.</p><p>The Socialists (PASOK) and the Democratic Left were offering similar political agendas, with an eye on the necessary formation of a government of \"shared national responsibility\" after the June 2012 general elections. Both parties appeared to concur that Greece could not be governed by slim majorities during its time of need. As noted by PASOK leader Venizelos at the start of June 2012, a weak government would not be able to push through important reform measures required to solve Greece's debt crisis. Democratic Left leader Fotis Kouvelis called for a \"progressive unity government.\" He threaded the political needle carefully as he argued that while Greece could not afford to go down the path of exclusive austerity, he nonetheless rejected the idea of annulling already-established rescue deals and risking default. In this way, Kouvelis was taking quite a different position as compared with SYRIZA leader Tsipras, who has advocated the path of annulment.</p><p>It should be noted that SYRIZA leader Tsipras was winning the rhetorical contest and effectively shifting the debate. As noted just above, Tsipras has consistently asserted that should he win the election and lead a future Greek government, Greece would walk away from the prevailing international agreements concerning billions of dollars in bailout assistance and their associated harsh mandates for the budget, including the abolition of collective bargaining and the reduction of the minimum wage. He has also said that he would suspend the repayment of international loans until Greece, which has suffered from a continuing recession, sees economic growth. Now, ahead of the repeat elections, even the leaders of the two main reformist and pro-rescue package parties, New Democracy and Socialist PASOK, were moving a bit away from the singular pro-austerity agenda, and towards the notion that the rescue deals should -- at least -- be renegotiated on less harsh terms.</p><p>Note that at the start of June 2012, the final set of pre-election polls ahead of the repeat elections showed a tight race between leftist SYRIZA and the center-right New Democracy party. Two of three polls showed the two parties essentially tied, while the third poll showed SYRIZA holding 32 percent over New Democracy with 26 percent. It should be noted that Greece suspends election polling in the two weeks prior to election day, so these results offered the final pre-election picture.</p><p>As the first week of June 2012 came to a close, the drama of the political contest in Greece reached new heights when a member of parliament from the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party, Ilias Kasidiaris, was caught on a televised broadcast assaulting a female SYRIZA politician, Rena Dourou, with a glass of water, and then slapping another female left-wing politician, Liana Kanelli of the Communist Party. Although an arrest warrant was issued for Kasidiaris, the Golden Dawn member of parliament placed the blame for the incident on the two female politicians, saying that they provoked him by bringing up his alleged involvement in a 2007 armed robbery case. He also promised to sue them. The wider Greek public appeared shocked by the display and took to the streets on June 8, 2012, in massive protests against Golden Dawn and neo-Nazis. The rallies were organized by left-wing and anti-racism groups in Athens and were attended by thousands of people.</p><p>June Elections</p><p>On June 17, 2012, Greeks returned to the polls to cast their ballots in the second general elections in a month in a renewed attempt to form a government. Exit polls indicated the elections would be a close contest but with the center-right New Democracy in a narrow lead ahead of the leftist SYRIZA, and with the socialist PASOK in third place. With the lion's share of the ballots counted, the Greek Interior Ministry said that New Democracy secured close to 30 percent and was on track to carry as many as 130 seats in the 300-seat parliament; SYRIZA garnered 26.7 percent and was likely to control between 71 and seats; PASOK acquired 12.5 percent and was estimated to win about 33 seats. Several smaller anti-bailout parties were expected to win between 13 and 21 seats; these parties included the Independent Greeks, the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn, the Democratic Left, and the Communists.</p><p>Accordingly, SYRIZA leader, Tsipras, reportedly telephoned the New Democracy leader, Samaras, to concede the elections and offer congratulations. Given these results, Samaras, at the helm of his New Democracy Party, was expected to commence coalition talks on June 18, 2012. Samaras urged all the major political parties to close ranks and form a national salvation government. Since his financial plan for the country going forward would entail spending cuts and the implementation of other reform measures as required by international creditors he would have to find coalition partners with compatible goals. Such goals clearly ran counter to the position of SYRIZA, which has made clear that it would stand against austerity measures demanded as part of the existing rescue deal. A future coalition led by New Democracy, therefore, was unlikely to include SYRIZA. More likely was the possibility that New Democracy, boosted by an additional 50 parliamentary seats as the winning party, would be able to form a majority coalition with PASOK.</p><p>For Samaras, the election result was a ratification of Greece's continued presence in the euro zone. To this end, he said, \"The Greek people voted today to stay on the European course and remain in the euro zone.\" Samaras promised that his country would \"honor its obligations.\" He also said, \"There will be no more adventures. Greece's place in Europe will not be put in doubt. Samaras continued by noting that the flirtation with default, an exit from the euro bloc, and a return to the drachma -- a possible outcome if SYRIZA had won the election -- was now over.</p><p>To be sure, the election result was likely to calm some of the global fears about a SYRIZA victory and a concomitant Greek exit from the euro zone. It was likely to quell speculation for the immediate future about debt default contagion spreading through the European bloc and adding to the sense of turmoil brewing at the international level. In Greece, however, the public's sense of discontent over the austerity conditions would presumably continue, along with anxieties about the future of the country. In a bid to address these anxieties, Samaras promised light at the end of the proverbial dark tunnel, saying, \"The sacrifices of the Greek people will bring the country back to prosperity.\"</p><p>New Government for Greece</p><p>As attention turned towards the government formation process, the question arose as to whether or not a national salvation government -- composed of as many parties as possible -- would be possible. But such an end was not to happen as SYRIZA made it clear that it would neither join such a government. Indeed, SYRIZA leader, Tsipras, rejected a proposal from Samaras and New Democracy to join a coalition government. For his part, Tsipras indicated that his party's role was to operate as the official opposition saying, \"The main opposition party's role is to be critical and responsible. We will do just that.\"</p><p>By June 20, 2012, three parties were able to reach an agreement on the formation of a new Greek government. As the winner of the June 17, 2012 elections, the main coalition partner would be center-right New Democracy, while the Socialists, PASOK, as well as Democratic Left, would participate in the new government. Speaking of the need to establish a stable Greek administration as soon as possible, and to deal with the political and economic challenges facing the country, Evangelos Venizelos of PASOK said: \"Greece has a government ... that is the message that we need to send abroad.\"</p><p>Note that on that day -- June 20, 2012 -- Antonis Samaras, leader of the New Democracy party, was to be sworn in as Greece's new prime minister at a brief ceremony at the presidential palace in Athens, presided over by the archbishop of Greece. After being sworn in as the new Greek head of government, Prime Minister Samaras said that he would demand \"hard work\" from the new government\" and that he intended to \"give hope\" to the Greek people.</p><p>Of course, for the Greek people, they were looking for relief from the harsh terms of the rescue package from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). To that end, the new government would seek to renegotiate the bail out agreement. As noted by Fotis Kouvelis, the leader of the</p><p>Democratic Left, he wanted to see the country \"released\" from the \"painful terms\" of the bail out deal. One provision sought by the new coalition government was a change in the schedule for austerity cuts to be spread over four years rather than two years, as currently outlined.</p><p>In truth, however, there was probably limited room for the new Greek government to negotiate a more pleasing agreement. While leaders in Europe were undoubtedly relieved that the political crisis in Greece had abated and there was a reasonably coalition government with which to talk, they were unlikely to offer much flexibility. Germany was certainly making it clear that few concessions were in the offing. As stated by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, \"Elections cannot call into question the commitments Greece made. We cannot compromise on the reform steps we agreed.\"</p><p>Update (2012/2013):</p><p>In the fall of 2012, trade unions launched a general strike to register opposition and outrage against the government's stringent austerity measures. The strike attracted the participation of anarchists who gathered outside the parliament, thus compelling security forces to use tear gas to disperse the crowds.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Greek government was crafting the budget for 2013, which was intended to confront the reality that the Greek economy would be subject to further economic contraction as well as a continuing heavy debt burden. Recently-elected Prime Minister Samaras warned the country that his government's coffers would be empty by the end of November 2012 without the infusion of funds -- presumably via international aid.</p><p>With an eye on securing further installments of rescue loans from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, the Greek government passed a 13.5bn-euro austerity plan. The budget provisions included increases to taxes along with cuts to pensions. Not surprisingly, union organizations reacted with ire to these measures.</p><p>Nevertheless, the budget plan achieved its objective as the European Union and the International Monetary Fund agreed to release its latest installment of rescue loans by the end of 2012. The move also achieved the end of preventing Greece from leaving the euro zone.</p><p>Note that as of January 2013, Greece's unemployment rate had increased to 26.8% -- the highest figure recorded in the European Union (EU). Indeed, Greece had the dubious distinction of being the country with the highest unemployment rate in Europe.</p><p>On June 21, 2013, the Democratic Left Party -- a participant in the ruling coalition in Greece -- said it was withdrawing from the government amidst disagreements over the shutdown of the state broadcasting service, ERT. At issue was accusation Prime Minister Antonis Samaras' accusation that ERT suffered from a lack of transparency. Accordingly, ERT transmissions were shut down on June 11, 2013. Efforts to forge an agreement leading to the resumption of broadcasts ended in failure. For its part, Democratic Left criticized the prime minister's handling of the situation, and more importantly, the fact that he did not consult with his coalition partners before making the decision.</p><p>It should be noted that the ruling coalition came to power after the last elections in mid-2012 and was composed of the center-right New Democracy, the Socialists (PASOK), as well as Democratic Left. The coalition government was intended to be a representative and unifying force for Greece, which has been embroiled in a debt crisis in recent years. The loss of any party effectively weakened the coalition government in a country beset by political instability and eager for unity as the government makes difficult decisions aimed at addressing Greece's crushing debt crisis.</p><p>On July 17, 2013, protesters in Greece took to the streets of Athens to rally against a public sector reform bill that would lead to massive job cuts. Under the provisions of the legislation, as many as 4,000 government employees, including teachers, would lose their jobs in 2013. By the end of the year, another 25,000 government employees would be placed in \"mobility pool\" by the end of the year. Those employees in the mobility pool would garner only 75 percent of their salaries for an eight-month period in which they would be expected to seek redeployment; at the end of that period, if they were unable to secure transfers to other government departments, their jobs would be declared redundant and they would thus be unemployed. In a country with an unemployment rate of 27 percent, the path of further joblessness was not welcomed by the people.</p><p>Regardless of the unpopularity of the bill -- especially among public sector employees -- it was regarded by Greek politicians as a necessary measure intended to secure a fresh tranche of bailout funding. As such, the bill was passed with 153 affirmative votes to 140 negative votes in the Greek parliament, with conservative Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras saying that there was no option but to move forward with the painful legislation, in the interests of keeping Greece financially afloat. Previous austerity measures included reductions of public sector salaries and pension cuts. Yet despite this constellation of austerity measures, the fact of the matter was that Greece's debt has continued to be alarmingly high.</p><p>Editor's Note:</p><p>An ongoing GDP-debt crisis has plagued Greece in recent years. Greece's burdensome debt resulted in the need for a rescue plan from the European Union, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund, with an eye on averting sovereign default. Despite agreeing to the debt relief (or \"bailout\") package, the European Union, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund have not been quick to agree to the release of rescue funds for Greece, as concerns have risen about that country meeting necessary conditions -- the implementation of austerity measures and reforms -- associated with the relief package. But those very austerity measures -- while deemed vital by international lenders in order to release bailout funds to Greece -- have been rejected and condemned by the Greek public.</p><p>Special Entry</p><p>Political turmoil in Greece involves relations with far-right elements and threat of extremism</p><p>In January 2014, two members of parliament from the neo-fascist Golden Dawn party were arrested and jailed pending trial on charges of belonging to a criminal organization. The two individuals placed under arrest -- Panagiotis Iliopoulos and Yorgos Germenis -- denied the charges against them and emphasized the legitimacy of his party's political</p><p>On the other side of the equation, Greek prosecutors have long argued that they possess evidence connecting Golden Dawn to several acts of violence, including the murder of a Greek rapper in 2013. To that end, they have been carrying out a crackdown against the new-Nazi far-right group. The arrests and detainment of Iliopoulos and Germenis were the latest manifestations of that crackdown.</p><p>Going back to September 2013, several far-right members of the Greek parliament were arrested as part of a government crackdown on extremism. Among those taken into custody at the time was Nikos Mihallkiakos, the leader of the neo-fascist party, Golden Dawn. The offices of Golden Dawn were raided, while Mihallkiakos was arrested and charged with forming a criminal organization. Soon thereafter, the party's deputy leader, Christos Pappas, was also taken into custody. Several other members of parliament also faced the same fate.</p><p>The arrests of Mihallkiakos, Papas, and other Golden Dawn members occurred only weeks after a man claiming to be a supporter of Golden Dawn allegedly murdered a Greek rapper, known as \"Killah P,\" whose music protested the rise of fascism in Greece.</p><p>In another case in September 2013, 50 Golden Dawn members wielding crowbars violently attacking members of the Communist Party as they distributed posters in a working-class district of Athens. That incident left nine people hospitalized with grave injuries. The Communist Party of Greece released a statement in regard to the attack that read as follows: \"The way in which they [the attackers] acted and the weapons employed \u2026 are evidence of the murderous nature of the attack. Among the Golden Dawners, some of whom had covered their faces or wore helmets or [party] shirts, were their leaders, well-known fascists and thugs.\"</p><p>Muslims and Jews were not exempt from the apparent campaign of extremism and hatred. On the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks, Golden Dawn posted an anti-Semetic message on its website in which it claimed \"world Zionism\" was the \"architect of global terrorism.\" Meanwhile, the Muslim Association of Greece was gifted with a letter in which members were told they would be \"slaughtered like chickens\" unless they left Greece.</p><p>The murder of Killah D, the violent attacks on the Communists, and the hate-filled diatribes against Muslims and Jews sparked mass protests across Greece and may have contributed to the government's decision to take action.</p><p>For its part, the government of Greece has said that the arrests of the Golden Dawn members of parliament were part of its decision to push back against extremism -- with particular attention to the rise of neo-Nazism in Greece. The government also said that it had commenced an investigation into whether or not whether extremists associated with Golden Dawn had infiltrated the country's police and military forces. Prime Minister made it clear that Golden Dawn would not be allowed to \"undermine\" democracy and he emphasized the government's stance that the neo-fascist party should be treated as a \"criminal organization.\" In response, Golden Dawn railed against the arrests of its leaders, and urged supporters to back its \"just struggle against the corrupt system.\"</p><p>On Nov. 1, 2013, a shooting outside the office of the neo-Nazi and far-right Golden Dawn political party in Greek capital city of Athens left two party members dead and a third individual wounded.</p><p>According to accounts from Golden Dawn members of Parliament as reported by the Athens-Macedonian News Agency, two assailants on a motorcycle approached the party's office in the northern suburb of Neo Iraklio and opened fire with a rifle before escaping the scene. The party official claimed that the assailants \"literally emptied their guns\" on the victims, ensuring their deaths. In their post-crime investigation, police were able to recover the motorcycle believed to have been stolen and used in the attack.</p><p>While no Greek official was willing to suggest that the killings were political, it was certainly true that in 2013, politics in Greece have been dominated by acrimonious relations between the government and Golden Dawn.</p><p>In November 2013, in the aftermath of the attack on the Golden Dawn office and the deaths of two party members, it was possible that certain factions of Greek society were carrying out revenge attacks against the neo-fascist party. The Greek government was making it clear that such actions were not welcomed and would only lead the country into the realm of lawlessness. Nikos Dendias, the Greek cabinet minister responsibility for domestic security and order, said that the government would \"not allow the country to become an arena for scores to be settled, for whatever reason.\" Dendias was clearly referencing recent events involving Golden Dawn.</p><p>In the second week of January 2014, two members of parliament from the neo-fascist Golden Dawn party were arrested and jailed pending trial on charges of belonging to a criminal organization. The two individuals placed under arrest -- Panagiotis Iliopoulos and Yorgos Germenis -- denied the charges against them. For his part, Iliopoulos insisted that they were innocent and emphasized the legitimacy of his party's political cause. In front of the media and amidst far-right supporters, he declared: \"Golden Dawn is a legitimate political party taking on a sincere political struggle. We will not buckle. Golden Dawn will be victorious - Greece will be victorious.\"</p><p>It should be noted that Golden Dawn has won representation in parliament, with 18 members holding seats in the legislative chamber. Indeed, the party has enough support, irrespective of its neo-fascist tendencies, to claim being the third most popular party in Greece. While Golden Dawn itself denied being a neo-Nazi organization, its members tend to have pro-Hitler orientations, with Golden Dawn members notorious for participating in Nazi-style salutes, and the group's emblem is reminiscent of the Nazi swastika.</p><p>Human rights groups have warned that Golden Dawn has a record of terrorizing immigrants and political opponents, while Greek police have allowed them to do so with impunity. In fact, as indicated by the aforementioned investigation, there were suggestions that extremist members of the Golden Dawn had infiltrated the security forces. Those suggestions were somewhat backed by news reports in Greece detailing the suspension of several police officers who were believed to be associates of Golden Dawn, as well as the arrest of a police officer who was working as a bodyguard for Golden Dawn itself.</p><p>Presidential Election of 2014</p><p>A presidential election was set to be held in Greece in December 2014. A first round would be held on Dec. 1, 2014, with a second round on Dec 23, 2014, and a third round on Dec. 29, 2014. The elections were not expected to be held until the spring of 2014; however, Prime Minister Antonis Samaras and Deputy Prime Minister Evangelos Venizelos called for the vote to be moved forward. They were looking for an ally to occupy the office of the presidency in Greece, which has been in the throes of a debt crisis in recent years. At issue was an impending debt bailout package review and plans for a negotiated exit from that regime.</p><p>Stavros Dimas, the preferred candidate of the ruling New Democracy\u2013PASOK coalition, for the presidency, was being backed by the prime minister. Dimas' main competition would come from Alexis Tsipras, the candidate of the opposition and anti-bailout party, Syriza. Indeed, with polling data indicating that Syriza, was more popular with the people of Greece that Prime Minister Samaras' New Democracy, it was quite possible that this dynamic would play out in the presidential race to Tsipras' benefit and to Dimas' detriment. A survey by GPO for MEGA TV showed support for Syriza at 28 percent while only 23 percent favored New Democracy. PASOK, which was in coaliton with New Democracy had five percent. Still, it was difficult to offer reliable prognostications since as many as 15 percent of Greeks remained undecided.</p><p>Of course, the presidential vote would ensue internally within parliament. But should New Democracy and Prime Minister Samaras fail to see their candidate, Dimas, elected as president by the third round of voting, it was quite likely that snap parliamentary elections would be triggered as a result.</p><p>On Dec. 17, 2014, the first round of voting ended inconclusively with no candidate winning enought votes outright to secure the presidency. With only 160 members of parliament voting for Dimas, 135 against him, and with only five members of the opposition voting with the ruling party, the outcome of Round One was something of an alarm bell for the prime minister ahead of the voting session later in the month.</p><p>Ahead of those subsequent rounds of voting, Prime Minister Samaras suggested that members of parliament discharge their duties seriously, given the stakes. He said, \"Conditions are difficult, Greek lawmakers are aware that the country cannot afford adventures.\" But Alexis Tsipras, the leader and presidential candidate of the opposition and anti-bailout party, Syriza, lauded the poor performance of Dimas in the first round. He noted that the government's \"strategy of fear\" was not working, and added, \"Democracy cannot be blackmailed.\"</p><p>Ultimately, at the end of December 2014 in the third and final round of voting, those aforementioned alarm bells turned out to be prescient. The parliament rejected Dimas -- Prime Minister Antonis Samaras's nominee for president. Indeed, Dimas fell short of the 180 votes in parliament needed to secure the presidency. The defeat of Dimas effectively triggered snap parliamentary elections, which were now set for Jan. 25, 2015.</p><p>Note on Feb. 18, 2015, a new president was elected to a five year term by the parliament. The winner of the presidential election was Prokopios Pavlopoulos.</p><p>Parliamentary Elections of 2015</p><p>Parliamentary elections were set to be held in Greece on Jan. 25, 2015. A presidential election had been held in Greece in December 2014 and ended in the government's failure to elect the prime minster's selection to the post of head of state. This outcome made it clear that the political landscape in Greece was fractious and effectively triggered parliamentary elections to be held at the start of 2015. See discussion of the presidential contest above for details.</p><p>The parliamentary contest -</p><p>At stake in the snap parliamentary elections to be held on Jan. 25, 2015, would be the composition of the unicameral \"Vouli ton Ellinon.\" That parliamentary body was composed of 300 seats with members elected by a system of reinforced proportional representation from 51 multi-seat constituencies and five single-seat constituencies; there is a three percent threshold to obtain seat and members are elected to serve maximum four-year terms.</p><p>In the previous voting exercise of 2012, there were actually two elections. An initial election was held in Greece on May 6, 2012, but yielded inconclusive results, with no one party gaining a majority or able to form a viable government coalition, despite three successive attempts at achieving that end. Accordingly, a new \"re-run\" election was set for June 17, 2012. At the end of that voting exercise, the center-right New Democracy won the most votes narrowly and formed a coalition government with the Socialists (known by the acronym, PASOK) as well as Democratic Left. The 2012 election result was regarded, at the time, as a ratification of Greece's continued presence in the euro zone, and thus acceptance of the austerity measures needed to guarantee a debt rescue program.</p><p>In 2015, however, the political and economic climate had shifted. While the elections would again be dominated by the debt crisis rocking Greece, the Greek citizenry was now deeply frustrated -- and even angry -- over the austerity terms of a massive bail-out package funded by the International Monetary Fund and the European Union to rescue the country from default. With a review of that package on the horizon, and with hopes for an early exit from the bail-out program looming, the radical leftist Syriza party, which wants to cancel that arrangement, had gained support. Indeed, Syriza was now consistently leading the polls.</p><p>Should Syriza's advantage prevail on election day, Greece could well be positioned to make some radical economic moves, which were sure to send shockwaves through the entire euro zone. For its part, Prime Minister Samaras' New Democracy was campaigning on the fact that under its stewardship, Greece had actually turned an economic corner, and were finally posting some growth and had ended a four-year exile from bond markets.</p><p>That argument appeared to hold resonance as in the first week of January 2015, Syriza's polling lead was decreasing and New Democracy was seeing a rebound. The Socialists (PASOK) were trailing far behind -- in fact, behind the far-right xenophobic (regarded as neo-Nazi) Golden Dawn, which was in third place, according to various polling outlets. The Socialists' prospects were not likely to be boosted by an internal split, which was triggered by former Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou's announcement of a new breakaway party, called \"Movement for Change.\" Since there is a three-point threshold for participation in parliament, if the loyal Socialist voters were split between PASOK and Movement for Change, neither party might end up positioned to participate in parliament.</p><p>In the second week of January 2015, the trend discussed above was holding steady. Syriza had a small but consistent lead of about three percent, according to various polling outlets, over New Democracy.</p><p>In the third week of January 2015, Syriza appeared to be consolidating its advantage with a series of polls showing the anti-bailout party leading Prime Minister Samaras' New Democracy party by a margin of at least five percentage points. Of note was the fact that the newly-formed centrist party To Potami (River) had narrowly edged out both the Communists and the far-right xenophobic Golden Dawn to be in third place. Trailing far behind and unlikely to make up enough ground to enter parliament were the Socialists or PASOK (in government with New Democracy) and Movement for Change. Going into the elections, these basic trendlines were holding with Syriza holding a steady and significant lead over the other parties of between five and six percentage points.</p><p>At a final election rally ahead of the vote, Syriza leader, Alexis Tsipras, declared: \"Light has won over darkness. Victory and a majority are within our grasp.\"</p><p>It was to be seen if Syriza's expected victory would come to pass on election day, and if the party would yet gain enough seats to command an outright majority in parliament. Without an outright majority, a governing coalition would have to be formed and it was unclear that Syriza would be the type of entity prepared for compromise.</p><p>On election day on Jan. 25, 2015, Greek voters went to the polls to cast their ballots. After the polling stations closed, the task of counting the ballots commenced. At the time of writing, the results showed a big win for the anti-bailout party, Syriza. In fact, Syriza was holding 36 to 38 percent of the vote share and was on track to win as many as 149 seats -- just two seats short of an absolute majority. The outgoing ruling party, New Democracy, was trailing behind in second place with between 26 and 28 percent. Vying for third place were the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn and the newly-established centrist party, Potami (River). The other parties made up the remainder.</p><p>New Democracy wasted little time in conceding defeat while Syriza said that its victory was \"a return of social dignity and social justice.\" In an interview with Greek media, Syriza spokesperson Panos Skourletis said, \"What's clear is we have a historic victory that sends a message that does not only concern the Greek people, but all European people.\"</p><p>Governance and government formation:</p><p>At the top of the agenda for the new government of Greece would be the matter of attending to the bailout packages. With Greece's arrangement with the euro zone set to expire on Feb. 28, 2015, even with continued support from the International Monetary Fund, Greece would have to be part of a European treaty entity to procure remaining rescue loans and be positioned to receive future support from the European Central Bank. Thus, Greece would essentially have to retain its position as a euro zone country within the European Union. However, Syriza leader, Tsipras, was showing no urgency on the matter of negotiating an agreement to address these collective concerns, insisting that he had at least half a year to negotiate a deal with Greece's creditors.</p><p>Going back to 2010, Greece was in the midst of a debt-to-GDP crisis and at risk of sovereign default. As a result of that crisis, and with the contagion effect on other euro zone countries in the European Union at stake, Greece was the recipient of a rescue package from the European Union (EU) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). That package was dependent on Greece's agreement to implement austerity measures and other structural reforms, and ultimately repay its bailout funds. These terms have long been regarded as harsh by the Greek citizenry, giving rise to the popularity of Syriza, the anti-bailout party, which emerged as a protest entity to the dictates of the global financial system. Worth noting, however, is the fact that as painful as most countries tend to find austerity measures characteristic of structural adjustment programs, Greece's debt problems have at least partially been due to the fact that a wide swath of the Greek population does not pay its taxes. Without taxes, a country simply does not have sufficient funds in its coffers to service its debts. Also contributing to Greece's debt crisis has been its bloated public sector -- an area targeted for reform to the great consternation of Greeks.</p><p>But for the incoming leader of Greece, the focus was not so much on continuing the work of the previous New Democracy government and reforming the economy; instead, it was on delivering a message of defiance to Greece's creditors. The keystone of Alex Tsipras' victory speech as as follows:</p><p>\"Our victory is of all the peoples of Europe who are struggling. I would like to assure you the new Greek government will be ready to co-operate and negotiate with our friends, with a just and useful solution so that Greece will return Europe to development and social stability and values like democracy and solidarity. In this sincere dialogue, Greece will come with its own proposals, its own national plan of reforms and radical changes with a four-year plan, without shortages, without unrealistic proposals about our debt. The new Greek government will prove the Cassandras wrong. No mutual conflict but no continuation of our submission in front of us. We have a great opportunity for a new beginning a new Europe.\"</p><p>On Jan. 26, 2015, Tsipras was sworn into power as the new Greek prime minister without the traditional accompaniment of a Bible and blessing of basil and water from the Greek Archbishop, opting instead for a secular ceremony in which he promised to uphold the constitution.</p><p>Tsipras then formed a new hardline, anti-bailout government with a fringe party, Independent Greeks, which has opposed the European Union/International Monetary Fund rescue program. That was likely the beginning and end of the compatibility between Syriza and the Independent Greeks, given the two arties' divergent views on immigration. In fact, it was the Independent Greeks' \"far-right\" views on immigration that repelled the centrist group, Potami (River), and convinced that party's leader, Stavros Theodorakis, to stay out of the new coalition government.</p><p>Nevertheless, Syriza's 149 seats, in combination with the Independent Greeks' 13 seats, would give the coalition a majority in the 300-seat parliament. Their ideological alliance opposed to austerity and bailouts would likely provide a shared policy vision for moving forward in the immediate future.</p><p>In his first major act as prime minister, Tsipras unveiled his cabinet. The ministerial portfolios were to be held by no shortage of anti-austerity veterans, making clear that he was moving forward with an anti-austerity agenda and his plan to renegotiate Greece's massive debts. Of note was the inclusion in government of the academic economist, Yanis Varoufakis, as the new finance minister. Also of note was the inclusion of Panos Kammenos, the leader of the right-wing Independent Greeks (the junior coalition partner to Syriza), as defense minister.</p><p>Special Report</p><p>Job 1: Servicing Greek debt --</p><p>With its future in Euro zone at stake, Greece finally strikes an agreement with its creditors; new bailout deal filled with harsh austerity measures and major compromises for Greece</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The spring of 2015 saw Greece under pressure as it suffered a \"liquidity crunch\" at a time when several bills and debt obligations were due to be paid. That liquidity crunch could be alleviated by the release of a tranche of rescue funds from Greece's international creditors; however, those creditors - including the finance officials of the Euro zone and the International Monetary Fund - were looking for a comprehensive structural reform plan from Greece to be submitted for approval. In that plan, Greece's creditors were looking for serious austerity measures intended to rein in its social welfare spending, such as reductions of civil service pensions. However, the Greek people have made clear that the radical Syriza government they elected to power at the start of 2015 had to keep its election promises, which included an end to austerity measures and the safeguarding of the social welfare state. Clearly, those demands were in diametric opposition to the imperatives of Greece's international creditors.</p><p>Faced with the impossibility of the situation, the Syriza government was considering a referendum, which if ratified, would give the government a mandate to move forward with a plan that could meet the demands of other European finance ministers. The referendum idea aside, another option for Greece would be to default on its payments, exit the Euro zone, and re-adopt the Drachma as its currency. Such a path would likely be catastrophic for Greece; however, the Euro bloc was increasingly frustrated by Greece's failure to meet its reform demands and thus concomitantly accepting of the idea of a \"Grexit\" from the Euro zone. What had been unfathomable and unpalatable several years prior was now becoming a real possibility on the Euro zone landscape as the clock ticked ever so close to the June 2015 deadline. That deadline would mark the time when Greece would have to advance its reform agenda in order to secure rescue funding.</p><p>As talks with the Euro zone and the International Monetary Fund hit an impasse in mid-June 2015, speculation about either snap elections or painful compromises began to surface, along with continued rumination over a Greek exit from the Euro zone. Finally, on the eve of the highly anticipated June 30, 2015, deadline, Greece rejected a rescue proposal set forth by the European Commission intended to prevent a Greek default. Instead, Greek Prime Minister Tsipras said his country would hold a referendum to seek public ratification on the proposal although he urged fellow citizens to vote against it. His government's position was that a strong national \"no\" vote would add to Greece's leverage against its creditors. Those creditors, however, reminded Greece that a failure to forge a deal with them on structural reforms prior to that June 30, 2015, deadline would essentially result in default and augur catastrophic consequences for Greece.</p><p>Greeks were thus set to go to the polls on July 5, 2015, to vote in a referendum on the very rescue package that the Greek prime minister had already rejected. After the votes were counted, the result showed a decisive \"no\" vote as Greeks overwhelmingly rejected the rescue package by European creditors. This result meant that Greece was now effectively wading into uncharted territory.</p><p>With a sense of urgency at stake and the clock ticking, the Euro zone issued a deadline for Greece to present new proposals for consideration. With two hours to spare, Greece met that deadline although the new slate of proposals from Greece were essentially a repeat of the package Greece's creditors offered in June 2015. A key distinction in this new blueprint was the inclusion of a call for increased rescue loans as well as debt relief for Greece.</p><p>Finally, on July 13, 2015, a deal to rescue Greece from economic crisis had been reached. The new agreement mandated that the Greek government legislatively ratify and then institute a collection of strict austerity measures. There were also harsh demands by hardliners that were sure to raise the ire of Greek nationalists. It was apparent that Greece's creditors were trying to deliver the message that they now held the power. The good news for Greece was that the full meeting of the European Union was cancelled, making it clear that no vote on a \"Grexit\" would be held immediately. But while Greece could sigh with proverbial relief over this economic lifeline, the fact of the matter was that the country would have to chart a difficult path forward -- and one that was likely to be unpopular with the Greece citizenry.</p><p>To that end, by August 2015, the Greek prime minister had carried out a cabinet shuffle to purge the government of disloyal Syriza members; he was also trying to assuage his party regarding the unpalatable reformist path it has taken. That attempt was not yielding desired results. Instead hardliners within Syriza split from the party to form their own breakaway group and Prime Minister Tspiras resigned as the head of government given his loss of a parliamentary majority. While rival parties tried to establish a replacement coalition government, the fact of the matter was that Greek citizens were headed back to the polls later in the year 2015 for repeat parliamentary elections. It was to be seen if Tspiras' popularity would be enough to return him to power.</p><p>Background:</p><p>The radical left wing and anti-bailout party, Syriza, won the January 2015 parliamentary elections in Greece. In the aftermath of those polls, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras then formed a new hardline, anti-bailout government with a fringe party, Independent Greeks, which has opposed the European Union/International Monetary Fund rescue program.</p><p>At the top of the agenda for the new government of Greece would be the matter of attending to the bailout packages. With Greece's arrangement with the euro zone set to expire on Feb. 28, 2015, even with continued support from the International Monetary Fund, Greece would have to be part of a European treaty organization to procure the remaining rescue loans and to be positioned to receive future support from the European Central Bank. Thus, Greece would essentially have to retain its position as a euro zone country within the European Union. However, Syriza leader Tsipras was showing no urgency on the matter of negotiating an agreement to address these collective concerns, insisting that he had at least half a year to negotiate a deal with Greece's creditors.</p><p>Going back to 2010, Greece was in the midst of a debt-to-GDP crisis and at risk of sovereign default. As a result of that crisis, and with the contagion effect on other euro zone countries in the European Union at stake, Greece was the recipient of a rescue package from the European Union (EU) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). That package was dependent on Greece's agreement to implement austerity measures and other structural reforms, and ultimately repay its bailout funds. These terms have long been regarded as harsh by the Greek citizenry, giving rise to the popularity of Syriza, the anti-bailout party, which emerged as a protest movement in response to the dictates of the global financial system. Worth noting, however, is the fact that as painful as most countries tend to find austerity measures characteristic of structural adjustment programs, Greece's debt problems have at least partially been due to the fact that a wide swath of the Greek population does not pay its taxes. Without taxes, a country simply does not have sufficient funds in its coffers to service its debts. Also contributing to Greece's debt crisis has been its bloated public sector -- an area targeted for reform to the great consternation of Greeks.</p><p>But for the incoming leader of Greece, the focus was not so much on continuing the work of the previous New Democracy government and reforming the economy; instead, it was on delivering a message of defiance to Greece's creditors. The keystone of Alex Tsipras' victory speech as follows:</p><p>\"Our victory is of all the peoples of Europe who are struggling. I would like to assure you the new Greek government will be ready to co-operate and negotiate with our friends, with a just and useful solution so that Greece will return Europe to development and social stability and values like democracy and solidarity. In this sincere dialogue, Greece will come with its own proposals, its own national plan of reforms and radical changes with a four-year plan, without shortages, without unrealistic proposals about our debt. The new Greek government will prove the Cassandras wrong. No mutual conflict but no continuation of our submission in front of us. We have a great opportunity for a new beginning a new Europe.\"</p><p>On Jan. 26, 2015, Tsipras was sworn into power as the new Greek prime minister without the traditional accompaniment of a Bible and blessing of basil and water from the Greek Archbishop, opting instead for a secular ceremony in which he promised to uphold the constitution.</p><p>Tsipras then formed a new hardline, anti-bailout government with a fringe party, Independent Greeks, which has opposed the European Union/International Monetary Fund rescue program. That shared opposition to the bailout package was likely the beginning and end of the compatibility between Syriza and the Independent Greeks, given the two parties' divergent views on immigration. In fact, it was the Independent Greeks' \"far-right\" views on immigration that repelled the centrist group, Potami (River), and convinced that party's leader, Stavros Theodorakis, to stay out of the new coalition government.</p><p>Nevertheless, Syriza's 149 seats, in combination with the Independent Greeks' 13 seats, would give the coalition a majority in the 300-seat parliament. Their ideological alliance opposed to austerity and bailouts would likely provide a shared policy vision for moving forward in the immediate future.</p><p>Greek seeks rescue funds; Greece's creditors seek reform commitments --</p><p>In his first major act as prime minister, Tsipras unveiled his cabinet. The ministerial portfolios were to be held by no shortage of anti-austerity veterans, making clear that he was moving forward with an anti-austerity agenda and his plan to renegotiate Greece's massive debts. Of note was the inclusion in government of the academic economist, Yanis Varoufakis, as the new finance minister. Also of note was the inclusion of Panos Kammenos, the leader of the right-wing Independent Greeks (the junior coalition partner to Syriza), as defense minister.</p><p>Varoufakis, who was a professor at the University of Texas, gained notoriety due to his vociferous excoriation of the bailout regime, referring to it as \"fiscal waterboarding\" while warning that it was transforming Europe into a \"Victorian workhouse.\" But it was apparent that he was prepared to moderate such language as finance minister, saying to media that he had participated in an \"encouraging and inspiring\" conversation with Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the euro zone's finance ministers. However, Varoufakis insisted that he would not negotiate with the so-called \"troika\" of global institutions overseeing Greek debt (i.e. the European Commission, the European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund). Instead, he suggested that he would look to negotiating with individual European countries and organizations. It was to be seen if such a path was even feasible.</p><p>For his part, Dijsselbloem said that Greeks should not hold on to unrealistic expectations, and that the act of electing Syriza did not change the realities that Greek debt would have to be repaid. He said, \"We all have to realize and the Greek people have to realize that the major problems in the Greek economy have not disappeared and haven't even changed overnight because of the simple fact that an election took place.\"</p><p>Nevertheless, the new Greek government had high hopes that its debt obligations would be forgiven. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, who warned Greece that its tactics would not be indulged, including its demands to have its debt written off, quickly dissolved those high hopes. He said, \"There's no arguing with us about this, and what's more we are difficult to blackmail.\"</p><p>Likewise, German Chancellor Angela Merkel made clear the European Union would not be renegotiating the terms of the Greek rescue package. In an interview with the newspaper, Die Welt, Merkel said, \"I do not envisage fresh debt cancellation. There has already been voluntary debt forgiveness by private creditors, banks have already slashed billions from Greece's debt.\" That being said, Merkel added that she hoped Greece would remain in the euro zone. She said, \"The aim of our policy was and is that Greece remains permanently part of the euro community. Europe will continue to show its solidarity with Greece, as with other countries hard hit by the crisis, if these countries carry out reforms and cost-saving measures.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Athens was showcasing its defiance as it moved forward with its anti-austerity agenda. Prime Minister Tsipras soon halted privatization plans for the Port of Piraeus that had been agreed under the country's rescue package, and said that similar moves were in place as regards the privatization of Public Power Corporation of Greece, Greece's biggest utility company, as well as the refiner, Hellenic Petroleum. In truth, Greece's privatization program had, thus far, yielded far les revenue than had originally been envisioned; thus, a halt in this arena was to be expected.</p><p>In the offing, however, were further measures aimed at reconstituting the welfare state, such as free electrical power and food stamps for Greeks, as well as labor changes, including the reversal of the reduced minimum wage and the restoration of collective bargaining rights for unions. These moves, along with Tsipras' promise to abolish the higher \"crisis\u201d taxes that were implemented in the midst of the Greek debt fracas, have spurred questions as to how exactly the Greek government intended to pay for all the programs mentioned above.</p><p>One measure of funding for Greece was through Germany -- but not via the contemporary European Union channels; instead, it relied on history and the notion of historic debt. Greek Prime Minister Tsipras demanded that Germany pay reparations for World War Two, including the repayment of a loan that the Nazis forced the Bank of Greece to pay when they occupied Greece. According to the Greek prime minister, there was an outstanding \"moral obligation to our people, to history, to all European peoples who fought and gave their blood against Nazism.\" It was to be seen if, in 2015, this argument would be regarded as valid.</p><p>German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier acknowledged the political and moral responsibilities of his country for the \"terrible events\" in Greece during the Nazi occupation from 1941 to 1944. However, he made clear that Germany had already addressed those responsibilities, saying, \"We are firmly convinced that all reparations issues, including forced loans, are judicially settled once-and-for-all.\"</p><p>In February 2015, weeks after coming to power, Prime Minister Tsipras made clear that his newly-elected government was committed to moving forward with its pre-election promises, irrespective of the questions as to how those social programs would be paid for. In a speech before parliament on Feb. 8, 2015, Tsipras declared that the government's \"irreversible decision is to implement in full our pre-elections pledges.\"</p><p>The prime minister also said that his country was seeking a bridge loan rather than an extension of its current rescue package to service its massive debt. In a speech to parliament, he said, \"The bailout failed. The new government is not justified in asking for an extension... because it cannot ask for an extension of mistakes.\"</p><p>Of course, the European Union had a different view. Already the European Union had made it clear that it was not prepared to renegotiate Greece's bailout terms. Now, in response to Prime Minister Tsipras' call for a loan rather than an extension of the existing bailout package, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the euro zone's finance ministers, said that the only option on the table was for Greece to apply for a bailout extension. Dijsselbloem said, \"We don't do bridging loans.\" Placing more pressure on the new Greek government was the move by the European Central Bank making it clear that Greek banks could no longer access ECB credit by using Greek government bonds.</p><p>For its part, Germany, the euro zone's main player and Greece's biggest creditor, maintained its strict stance that Greece would have to go forward with its structural reforms if it wished to have continued support. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble made a point of noting that Greece had lived beyond its means for far too long time. Left unsaid was the reality that German taxpayers should not have to pay for Greek social programs when that country refused to attend to its unsustainable financial regime.</p><p>At home in Greece, the new anti-bailout and anti-austerity government had popular backing for its stance at home. Greeks were taking to the streets to rally in support of the Syriza-led government's position, and polling data showed that as many as 75 percent of Greeks supported the hardline policies of the prime minister. That position was ratified in parliament in the second week of February 2015 when Tsipras won a confidence vote, paving the way for the cancellation of the rescue program discussed here. In an address to parliament, he declared: \"We are not negotiating the bailout; it was cancelled by its own failure.\" He continued, \"I want to assure you that there is no going back. Greece cannot return to the era of bailouts.\"</p><p>In mid-February, Greek Finance Minister said in an article in the New York Times that his country would not be treated as a \"debt colony\" subjected to \"the greatest austerity for the most depressed economy.\" Meanwhile, Greek Defense Minister Panos Kammenos also indicated that if the European Union was unwilling to bow to its demands, then it would look to Russia or China for funding. Seemingly, Greece preferred to become a client state of one of the eastern powers -- Russia or China -- rather than seek a compromise with the West in the form of the European Union.</p><p>By Feb. 16, 2015, talks between Greece and the euro zone finance group collapsed when the government of Greece rejected a proposal by the Euro bloc that would entail a request for a six-month extension to the existing bailout package. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the euro zone's finance ministers, said that Greece would have until Feb. 20, 2015, to apply for an extension or the rescue program would expire, on schedule, at the end of February 2015. But the government of Greece rejected the proposal, casting it as unacceptable. With the extension now off the proverbial table, and with the new government committed to reversing austerity measures, it was unclear how Greece intended to service its debt and pay for its social welfare programs.</p><p>A new attempt to address Greece's debt woes was expected to take place on Feb. 18, 2015, when Greece would apparently seek an extension on a loan -- but not one coinciding with the current rescue regime. Stated differently, the \"extension\" would have to be crafted in such a way as to maintain the appearance of continuity while also ending the current austerity programs demanded by Greece. It was to be seen if such a creative resolution could be forged -- and accepted -- by all key parties.</p><p>After days of contentious and intense negotiations, it was announced that an agreement had been reached to extend Greece's bailout package for four months. The deal, which was reached during emergency talks between the Greek government and euro zone finance ministers, would allow Greece to access US$271 billion in rescue funds (roughly 240 billion euro).</p><p>While this agreement would give Greece some time to address its economic woes, it was hardly an enduring resolution for the debt-stricken country. Nevertheless, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the euro zone's finance ministers, hailed the agreement, saying, \u201cI\u2019m glad to report to you that the work has paid off. We have established common ground again.\u201d He continued, \"I think tonight was a first step in this process of rebuilding trust. As you know trust leaves quicker than it comes. Tonight was a very important, I think, step in that process.\" Greek Finance Minister Varoufakis signaled a similar message, as he said, \"The four-month period will be a time to rebuild new relations with Europe and the IMF.\"</p><p>Central to the deal was Greece's commitment to honor its debt obligations, and its vow to unveil a list of economic reform measures aimed at addressing its debt woes. Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis said he would be working hard in the following days to come up with a new plan aimed at introducing reforms, presumably not of the type the Greek people would view as harsh austerity measures. That list was presented late on Feb. 23, 2015, and included measures such as combating tax evasion, tacking corruption, pausing on a reversal of the privatization process, eliminating incentives for early retirement, reducing the number of government ministries, and reforming the public sector.</p><p>The European Commission and the European Central Bank (ECB) responded to the Greek reform proposal by noting that it was a \"valid starting point.\" However, they were still looking for further measures to be implemented. The head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, said that the Greek proposal \"differs from existing programme commitments in a number of areas.\" He added that there would have to be an assessment process by which some listed reforms were \"replaced with measures of equal or better quality.\" The head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Christine Lagarde, struck a similar tone saying, \"In some areas like combating tax evasion and corruption, I am encouraged by what appears to be a stronger resolve on the part of the new authorities in Athens. In quite a few areas, however, including perhaps the most important ones, the letter is not conveying clear assurances that the government intends to undertake the reforms envisaged.\"</p><p>Greece seeks external support -</p><p>In the first part of April 2015, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras traveled to the Russian capital of Moscow for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russia had been one of Greece's leading trading partners; however, bilateral trade between the two countries had decreased due to sanctions on Russia for its military engagement in Ukraine, and also because of the Greece's own existing economic challenges.</p><p>Tsipras's meeting in Russia sparked speculation about a potential bid by Greece to curry favor with alternative global powers, given its strained relations with the European Union over a financial rescue package. For some time, Greece has argued that it should not be burdened by strenuous structural adjustment and debt reform programs required by a prevailing bailout regime. This position was not shared by Greece's rescue funding creditors at the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, who have insisted that Greece meet its financial obligations. Given this climate of dissonance, in February 2015, Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis warned that his country would not bend to the will of the so-called \"troika\" of global institutions overseeing Greek debt (i.e. the European Commission, the European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund). Instead, he said Greece would look to other countries for support. The April 2015 trip by Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to Russia was thus being viewed as a means to cultivate relations with new international partners.</p><p>Reports from Russia indicated that while Russian President Putin offered moral support to Greece, there was no significant financial aid coming from Moscow. Putin said that Russia would entertain granting Greece loans for join projects, likely in the energy sector, which might be mutually beneficial. To this end, Putin explained, \"We discussed cooperation in various sectors of the economy, including the possibility of developing major energy projects.\" He continued, \"Under these plans, we could provide loans for certain projects.\" One possible arena for energy cooperation could be the extension to the Turkish Stream pipeline, which would transport Russian gas from Turkey to Europe via Greece. Putin also said that bilateral trade relations with Greece should be restored. While Putin might be interested in bringing Western countries into its orbit, the fact of the matter was that Russia had its own financial woes to confront, thus limiting its own capacity to extend a more direct financial hand in Greece.</p><p>Nevertheless, the trip marked a strengthening of overall relations between the two countries. Indeed, Greek Prime Minister Tsipras distanced his country from the rest of Europe in its stance towards Russia, which had become something of a global pariah after the annexation of Crimea and ongoing intervention into the Ukrainian crisis. Tspiras insisted, \"Greece is a sovereign state with an indisputable right to its own foreign policy.\" He then broke ranks with the European Union, condemning the punitive measures imposed by the West on Russia and urging an end to the \"vicious cycle of sanctions.\" Tsipras was also anxious to dismiss suggestions that he had flown to Moscow to ask for financial aid. He said, \"Greece is not a beggar going around to countries asking them to solve its economic problem, an economic crisis that doesn't only concern Greece but is a European crisis.\"</p><p>Negotiating Rollercoaster --</p><p>Greece has insisted that Germany -- the most powerful player in the euro bloc -- should pay war reparations for the Nazi occupation during World War Two, when the Bank of Greece was forced to pay loans to the Nazi-led government of Germany at the time. Greek Prime Minister Tsipras was on the record declaring that there was an outstanding \"moral obligation\" by Germany to address this debt. But German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier had already acknowledged the political and moral responsibilities of his country for the \"terrible events\" in Greece during the Nazi occupation from 1941 to 1944, and he had already reminded Greece that Germany had addressed those war reparations responsibilities. For his part, German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel referred to this ongoing argument by Greece as \"dumb.\"</p><p>Mid-April 2015 was the stated schedule for Greece to produce a revised list of reforms that would be needed to secure forthcoming rescue funds. While Greece managed to meet a deadline to repay 460 million euros to the International Monetary Fund earlier in the month, the country would be faced with larger and more pressing debt repayments (to renew Treasury bonds and to repay loans). It was to be seen if it would be able to meet those obligations.</p><p>Following talks in Belgium in mid-April 2015, Euro zone officials were shocked that Greece did not meet this requirement. Instead, Greece produced no serious structural reform plan, and refused to discuss reductions of civil service pensions or any other expensive aspects of the welfare state. Making matter worse, one source said in an interview with the German publication, Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, that the Greek representative demanded rescue funds \"like a taxi driver.\" Greece was given a deadline of April 24, 2015, to produce a revised economic reform plan. Euro zone officials warned that the new plan would have to be ambitious. It was to be seen if that deadline would be met and if the proposal would be deemed acceptable by Greece's European creditors.</p><p>In the third week of April 2015, with a loan repayment due the following month, Greece was under pressure to pay its bills. In its desperation to find available cash to pay its bills (public wages and pensions), Greece was tapping into public cash reserves from municipalities. Local governments and opposition parties railed against the move, with local officials threatening to ignore the demand for funds, and with opposition politicians accusing the Syrize government of acting arbitrarily and not respecting the constitution.</p><p>Pressure was also coming from outside Greek borders, with Euro bloc powers demanding that the Greek government submit a substantive reform plan in order to secure future rescue funds, and with a significant repayment to the International Monetary Fund due. There were challenges on both fronts. First, as discussed here, Greece was not actively pursuing a structural reform agenda of the type needed to satisfy the country's creditors. Second, it was reported by the Financial Times that Greece had asked for a delay its loan repayment to the International Monetary Fund but was rebuffed. In truth, a delay in a repayment to a developed country like Greece would be unprecedented, while delays of this sort to developing countries in the past had not yielded positive results. As such, the International Monetary Fund was not inclined to move in this direction.</p><p>Euro bloc powers were eager to remind Greece that it was not likely to find creditors elsewhere, with German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble noting that while the Greek government could try to curry favor -- and funding -- from Russia or China, the reality was that it would be difficult to actually secure other creditors. He said, \"The Europeans have said, OK, we are ready to do it [lend money] until 2020... If you find someone else, whether it's in Beijing, in Moscow, in Washington D.C., or in New York who will lend you money, ok, fine, we would be happy. But it's difficult to find someone who is lending you in this situation amounts [of] 200 billion euros.\"</p><p>For his part, Greek Prime Minister Tsipras seemed determined to project an image of optimism as he insisted that the Greek government would reach a deal with its creditors. He said, \"Despite the cacophony and erratic leaks and statements in recent days from the other side, I remain firmly optimistic that there will be an agreement by the end of the month.\" He said that progress had been made in the arenas of tax collection, tax distribution, and corruption. However, he admitted that there remained disagreements in certain arenas, such as privatization, labor and pension reforms, and value-added taxes. Of course, those were the very arenas that the Euro bloc was targeting for Greek structural adjustment.</p><p>It should be noted that Euro zone finance ministers had a completely different tone from the optimism imbued in Prime Minister Tsipras' claims discussed above. Instead, during a meeting with Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, Euro zone officials characterized the talks as \"going nowhere.\" Some even suggested that as Greece moved close to the precipice of bankruptcy, it was time to prepare for default, believing that the effort to try to save Greece had gone on long enough. They indicated that Greece's refusal to get serious with a reform agenda made it clear that Greece did not want to be \"saved\" in the first place.</p><p>As April 2015 came to a close, finance ministers from the Euro zone warned Greece that no further financial aid would be advanced without the submission of a comprehensive economic reform and restructuring plan. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the finance minister from the Netherlands, said: \"A comprehensive and detailed list of reforms is needed.\" Dijsselbloem also warned that funds to Greece would be frozen until Greece presented a complete reform proposal as he added, \"A comprehensive deal is necessary before any disbursement can take place ... We are all aware that time is running out.\"</p><p>No further meetings between the Greek government and Euro zone officials were scheduled until the second week of May 2015 -- the very deadline when Greece would be expected to make a large repayment to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p><p>Ahead of that meeting between the Greek government and Euro zone officials in mid-May 2015, Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis acknowledged that an agreement to abate Greece's money woes was not going to be reached easily. In an interview with Greek media, Varoufakis said, \"The Greek government is struggling in a very tough negotiating fight to achieve an agreement that will not only be an agreement to have a disbursement but one that will deliver a substantive hit to the crisis.\" He continued. \"I think the solution will be given in the coming days and not necessarily today. We will do whatever we can to achieve [re: liquidity] relief today.</p><p>But officials of the Euro zone warned that they did not foresee any moves that would allow the European Central Bank to raise the limit on short-term Treasury bills that Greek banks could buy. That was the measure Greece was hoping to achieve in order to avert bankruptcy. Not surprisingly, Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis thusly warned that his country's financial situation was \"terribly urgent\" with a liquidity crisis in the offing. He added, \"The liquidity issue is a terribly urgent issue. It's common knowledge, let's not beat around the bush.\" Indeed, Greece's financial coffers were so low that the government was raiding public funds to pay for its commitments.</p><p>To that end, reports from Greece indicated that the country did indeed meet its obligations by the mid-May 2015 deadline for repayment of 750 million euros (approximately US$834 million) to the International Monetary Fund. The Greek finance ministry reported that the order for repayment was executed on May 11, 2015. According to the mayor of the Greek city of Thessaloniki, the funds came from his country's cash reserves. However, some of the money also ironically came from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) itself.</p><p>Deadlines and Default --</p><p>The end of May 2015 would see Greece needing about 2.5 billion euros funds to pay for its salary and pension obligations. The next major deadline would come in late May-early June 2015 when Greece would be expected to submit a comprehensive reform deal in concert with its international creditors, in order to secure a tranche of rescue funds. That would also be the period when European powers, particularly Germany, would need a viable agreement on the table to be approved in parliament before moving forward one way or another. Increasingly, German lawmakers were turning sour on the idea of saving an unwilling Greece from its own economic perils. As such, sufficient time was needed to persuade a majority of members of parliament to approve the deal. Also of significance was the fact that the actual bailout agreement between Athens and the Euro zone was set to expire at the close of June 2015.</p><p>Speaking on behalf of Euro zone finance ministers, Chairman Jeroen Dijsselbloem warned that any further disbursements of funds to Greece would be contingent on the formation of a complete agreement. He said, \"There are time constraints and liquidity constraints and hopefully we will reach an agreement before time runs out and before money runs out.\"</p><p>In the streets of Greece, the Greek people have made it clear that the radical Syriza government they elected had to keep its election promises, which included an end to austerity measures and the safeguarding of the social welfare state. However, those demands were in diametric opposition to the imperatives of Greece's international creditors, who require a comprehensive structural adjustment program to be implemented in Greece before it will provide further rescue funds. Faced with the impossibility of the situation, the Syriza government has said that it might have to hold a referendum in order to ratify any agreement forged with European finance ministers.</p><p>It was an idea that was gaining resonance across the European Union. Euro zone authorities were realizing that Greece -- and specifically the Greek government operating on behalf of the people -- needed a mandate to move forward, while the Greek people themselves had to be committed to its continued participation in the regional monetary body. That commitment required a reshaping of Greek economic behavior, and specifically, required Greece to live within its means rather than repeatedly violating the financial rules set for all Euro zone countries.</p><p>Accordingly, Germany Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaueble said of the referendum idea, \"Maybe this would be the right measure to let the Greek people decide if it is ready to accept what is necessary.\" He expanded on his stance saying, \"If the Greek government thinks it must hold a referendum, then let it hold a referendum. That might even be a helpful measure for the Greek people to decide whether it is ready to accept what is necessary, or whether it wants something different.\"</p><p>But the chairman of the Euro bloc, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, was not so sanguine on the notion of a referendum, warning that the schedule of such an endeavor would slow down the entire process, including the disbursement of billion euros in frozen bailout funds. He said, \"Presumably if you have a referendum you will not start implementing before you have done it and then it doesn't seem to make sense.\"</p><p>It should be noted that polling data by Marc pollsters for the Ton Syntakton newspaper in mid-May 2015 showed that the vast majority of Greeks wished to stay in the Euro zone. Indeed, 76.9 percent of Greeks expressed that view with only 19.2 percent favoring a return to the Drachma. Polling data also indicated some breathing room for the radical Syriza government, with 51.1 percent of respondents saying that the government should continue to govern from the helm even if negotiations with international creditors arrive at an impasse; only 22.8 percent actually favored a referendum on Greece's future in the euro zone, while a small minority -- 16.6 percent -- favored fresh elections.</p><p>Another option available to Greece would be default and a Greek exit from the Euro zone, known colloquially as \"Grexit.\" Some Greek politicians were calling for a default and the withdrawal from the Euro zone, insisting that the terms for continued participation were too onerous for the Greek people. Left unstated by these individuals was the likely catastrophic consequences of this path, which would very likely include capital controls on banks, the collapse of some financial entities, inflation particularly on imports, and the complete collapse of investment.</p><p>Of note was the fact that the year 2015 was quite different from the 2011 period when the notion of a Greek default fueled fears of contagion across the southern countries of the Euro bloc. Since 2011, a bailout fund had been established in the Euro zone, and other banking protections had been introduced. As such, the Euro zone was now better positioned to withstand a theoretical Greek default. Moreover, with other Southern European countries on the brink, such as Spain, where the populist party, Podemas, was gaining steam, a more unwieldy economic crisis was looming ahead with a much bigger economy to consider. For some European countries, a Greek refusal to reform, followed by inevitable default, could function as an economic cautionary tale of sorts.</p><p>As May 2015 came to an end, Greece was in a financially perilous position with no deal on the horizon to be forged with its international creditors. Moreover, Greek Interior Minister Nikos Voutsis admitted that his country had \u201cno money\u201d to fund scheduled repayments to the International Monetary Fund , which were set to commence on June 5, 2015. Ahead of that first repayment deadline, a spokesperson for the International Monetary Fund, William Murray, warned that Greece would be denied additional financing if it missed a loan payment. Murray noted: \u201cAny country that doesn\u2019t meet its commitment with the [International Monetary] Fund... is declared in arrears and they have no access to IMF funding.\"</p><p>In a statement, the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, acknowledged that no agreement was imminent; she said, \u201cIt is very unlikely that we\u2019ll reach a comprehensive solution in the coming days.\" Despite some encouraging expositions of rhetoric from various parties following a series of meetings, Lagarde archly noted, \u201cWe\u2019ve been sobered again in the last week.\" Lagarde also admitted that a Greek exit from the euro zone was a real possibility as she said \u201cIt\u2019s a complicated issue and it\u2019s one that I hope the Europeans will not have to face because hopefully they will find a path to agree with the future of Greece within the eurozone.\"</p><p>Lagarde foreclosed any kind of preferential agreement for Greece, fueling speculation that the European Union's euro zone and the International Monetary Fund intended to showcase Athens as a cautionary example for other euro zone countries on the brink and vulnerable to populist notions of opposing austerity measures, economic reforms, and programs of structural readjustment. Reminding all countries that have sought assistance that loans and rescue packages comes with obligations, Lagarde declared: \u201cWe have rules. We have principles. There will be no half-baked program review.\"</p><p>Just ahead of the June 5, 2015, deadline when Greece was due to dispatch its first repayment to the International Monetary Fund, Greek Prime Minister Tsipras angrily rejected what he cast as the \"absurd\" terms of proposed aid from the European bloc. During a speech to the Greek parliament, he said, \"The Greek government cannot consent to absurd proposals. I want to believe that this proposal was a bad moment for Europe or at the very least a bad negotiating trick and will soon be withdrawn by the masterminds themselves.\" The Greek finance minister had an even more vituperative response to the terms proposed by European bloc creditors. In an interview with a Greek newspaper, Finance Minister Varoufakis characterized the reform proposal plan as \"an aggressive move designed to terrorize the Greek government\" and declared that \"this Greek government cannot be terrorized.\"</p><p>Soon thereafter, Prime Minister Tsipras' government in Athens informed the International Monetary Fund that it would delay the 300 million euros due at that time. Instead, Greece would bundle all four of its June repayments to the International Monetary Fund -- totaling 1.5 billion euros in all -- and dispatch the funds on June 30, 2015. Of course, there was no actual understanding of where Greece would procure this money since on the very same day -- June 30, 2015 -- the rescue deal with the International Monetary Fund and the European Union was set to expire. As discussed here, there was no viable deal on the table to provide additional bailout funds.</p><p>As unorthodox as the delaying+bundling tactic might have been, and as unpalatable a prolonged impasse might be, there was, in fact, a precedent dating back to the 1970s. That precedent made it possible for governments to bundle together multiple principal payments due in a calendar month and thus simplfy the process of making multiple payments in a short period. Indeed, in the mid-1980s, the African country of Zambia used the bundling option to repay the International Monetary Fund. Still, the prevailing problem remained at hand for Greece: Even if the schedule of repayment was adjusted, was it even possible for Greece to cobble together the necessary funds?</p><p>The negotiations aimed at staving off default continued to be characterized by conflicting reports of progress. Greek Prime Minister Tsipras insisted that an agreement with his country's international creditors was \"in sight,\" while the finance ministers of the Euro Zone made clear that concurrence was a significant distance away. Indeed, Greece remained unprepared to assent to its international creditors' demands for a reform plan including want pension cuts, reforms to the value added tax (VAT), labor reforms, increased private sector investment, and structural changes to the civil service. In fact, Greece had its own long list of demands that include highly generous debt relief and threats to re-impose collective bargaining rights for Greek workers.</p><p>Suddenly, snap elections were being considered as a possible option as the Greek government might need to gain the public's approval of the difficult path forward. To this end, Greece's Deputy Social Security Minister Dimitris Stratoulis was quoted as declaring: \"The lenders want to impose hard measures. If they do not back down from this package of blackmail, the government ... will have to seek alternative solutions, elections.\" Stratoulis also indicated that the postponement and bundling of the repayment to the International Monetary Fund was a negotiating tactic as he declared, \"The government's move is a message that it wants to wait and see how far they (lenders) will take it, if they will back off from this unreasonable, inhumane, colonialist package they are proposing.\" If Stratoulis was correct, then the response of Greece's international creditors would certainly be instructive.</p><p>With the June 30, 2015, deadline looming ahead for both the repayment bundle due to the International Monetary Fund, as well as the presentation of a comprehensive economic reform plan, German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed cautious hopes that Greece would remain in the euro zone, while warning that Athens would have to seriously address the concerns of its creditors. She said, \"We want Greece to stay in the euro but in order to achieve that, Greece has to make the necessary efforts, and these are the subject of our ongoing discussions, and I want to see them come to a positive result.\"</p><p>Germany's vice-chancellor Sigmar Gabriel offered a more harsh assessment as he noted that other countries in Europe were losing patience with Greece. In an article in the German Bild magazine, Gabriel said that while Germany ideally would prefer to see Greece remain in the Euro zone, \"not only is time running out, but so too is patience across Europe.\" In something of a warning to Greece, he added, \"Everywhere in Europe, the sentiment is growing that enough is enough.\"</p><p>As before, Greece appeared unprepared to heed that warning and instead lashed out at its creditors -- presumably in an effort to redirect the blame for its own economic woes. In fact, Greek Prime Minister Tsipras accused creditors of issuing unreasonable demands as he said, \"One can only see a political purposefulness in the insistence of creditors on new cuts in pensions after five years of looting under the bailouts.\" He continued by suggesting that Greece would wait until the rest of Europe zone acquiesced to his country's demands for funds. To this end, Tspiras said, \"We will await patiently until the institutions accede to realism. We do not have the right to bury European democracy at the place where it was born.\"</p><p>By mid-June 2015, the European Commission had dismissed Greece's proposal to address its debt and repayment woes, saying sharply that the Greek government failed to produce any new and serious plan that would secure the funding needed to repay the International Monetary Fund by the June 30, 2015, deadline. As talks with the Euro zone and the International Monetary Fund hit this fresh impasse, speculation about either snap elections or painful compromises began to surface, along with continued rumination over a Greek exit from the Euro zone. However, Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis foreclosed the possibility of a \"Grexit,\" asserting that it would not be a sensible solution to the Greek debt crisis. Instead, he was demanding an \"extension\" of the existing bailout terms as as a generous debt forgiveness package. Of note was the fact that Greece's creditors have long said these options were not on the table.</p><p>In the third week of June 2015, Greek said it would default on the 1.6 billion euro debt repayment to the International Monetary Fund due on June 30, 2015, unless it garnered fresh rescue funds from its creditors. But if Greece thought its warning of a possible default would work to its benefit, it was quickly reminded that the pressure was actually on Greece and not its creditor institutions. To that end, the head of the International Money Fund, Christine Lagarde, reminded Greece that there would be \"no period of grace\" related to the debt repayment deadline.</p><p>With the possibility of default looming, a meeting was convened between envoys from the Greek government and European finance ministers but ended in failure with no progress made on a plausible path forward. German media sources indicated that Greece wanted to present its existing reform proposal, which creditors had already said was a \"non-starter.\" Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the chairman of the Euro group, explained the situation, saying, \"Regrettably ... too little progress has been made. No agreement is in sight.\" Accordingly, he indicated that it would be incumbent on Greece to advance a new set of proposals.</p><p>The urgency of the situation was laid bare in an address by German Chancellor Merkel to the German parliament in which she said her country would do its part to retain Greece as part of the Euro Zone, but that Greece would have to do its part and make good on its reform obligations. To this end, she said, \"There was an agreement -- the Greek government pledged to carry out structural reforms, and that must be done.\"</p><p>Another emergency meeting was scheduled to be held on June 22, 2015, in an effort to reach an agreement and avert a Greek default. The scene was now at a new level of urgency due to a spate of bank withdrawals (generally referred to as a \"run on the banks\") in conjunction with lowered government revenues. If those withdrawals continued, Greece would be forced to implement capital controls to prevent the flight of cash from the country. Of course, those very conditions were placing pressure on the Greek government to be more agreeable in these latest negotiations.</p><p>To that end, as of June 22, 2015, the government of Greece had advanced a new proposal for reform, which included fresh taxes on businesses and the wealthy, and an increase in the value added tax (VAT) rate in some arenas. But as before, the Syriza-led government insisted that there would be no curbs on pensions or public-sector wages, and maintained that there would be no VAT on electricity and medicine. These issues continued to be sticking points in the negotiations. Nevertheless, the new proposal for reform was being welcomed by Greece's creditors as a step in the right direction. Indeed, European Council President Donald Tusk said the new Greek plan constituted the \"first real proposals in many weeks.\"</p><p>It was thus still possible that a reform deal with Greece's creditors could be forged at the last minute, thus averting default and preserving Greece's place in the Euro Zone. Another option might be an interim agreement that would smooth over the differences, delay default, and keep Greece within the Euro Zone for the immediate future, with a hazier longer term horizon ahead. But the fact of the matter was that there was also a third possibility -- Greece was at serious risk of default and a \"Grexit\" from the Euro zone. What had been unfathomable and unpalatable several years prior was now becoming a real possibility as the clock ticked ever so close to the June 30, 2015, deadline.</p><p>Greece rejects rescue proposal and ensures default; Greeks go to polls to vote in referendum --</p><p>On June 26, 2015 -- just days ahead of the June 30 deadline, the European Commission advanced a rescue proposal to Greece, with an eye on averting a default and preserving Greece's participation in the euro zone. The 10-point plan was released by the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in the interests of transparency, and was endorsed by both the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Included in the plan were reforms to the sales tax regime, such as adjustments to the value added tax (VAT) and an increased corporate tax rate, significant labor reforms, and fundamental changes to the pension system, which was described as \"unsustainable.\" To this particular end, early retirement would become a thing of the past. The proposal would require Greece to commit to these measures in order to secure further releases of aid funding -- an amount totaling 15.5 billion euros, 1.8 billion euros of which would be made immediately available. German Chancellor Angela Merkel urged Greece to accept the \"extraordinarily generous offer,\" which would rescue that country from certain default.</p><p>Greece's Prime Minister Tsipras, however, made a difference assessment, unilaterally rejecting the deal and withdrawing from the negotiations process. In a nationally televised address, Prime Minister Tspiras described the plan as \"an insulting ultimatum,\" imbued by \"humiliation,\" and one that would bedevil Greece with \"unbearable\" austerity measures. He said, \"I call on you to decide -- with sovereignty and dignity as Greek history demands -- whether we should accept the extortionate ultimatum that calls for strict and humiliating austerity without end, and without the prospect of ever standing on our own two feet, socially and financially.\" He added, \"The people must decide free of any blackmail.\"</p><p>The Greek leader then announced a referendum, arguing that the public's ratification would be needed to accept the proposal. However, he made it clear that the exercise of ratification was just a performance of sorts since (1) he had already rejected the deal, and (2) he was actually urging Greek citizens to deliver a resounding \"no\" vote. The Greek parliament quickly supported Tspiras' stance by overwhelmingly voting to approve the referendum and a date of July 5, 2015, was scheduled for the vote.</p><p>At the heart of Tspiras' maneuver was his expressed suggestion that a \"no\" vote would bolster Greece's negotiating position, presumably forcing creditor institutions to acquiesce to some of his demands, such as debt forgiveness and leaving the pension system untouched. It appeared that Tsipras believed that by displaying a defiant stance, Greece would gain further time, power, and leverage to pressure creditor institutions to not only extend rescue funding, but also assent to a more favorable deal.</p><p>Throughout, Greece has been convinced that its creditors in Europe would do whatever necessary to prevent a default, due to fears of a contagion spreading across vulnerable southern European countries. However, such anxieties have decreased in recent times. The landscape in 2015 was not the same as 2011; now, with the European Central Bank (ECB) establishing stopgaps measures and emergency funds, the Euro zone was far better positioned to confront a default and even a \"Grexit.\" As well, for some European players, a default by Greece -- as difficult as it might be -- would function as a cautionary tale for other southern European countries also confronting debt-to-GDP crises. Furthermore, there were some voices suggesting that a Euro zone without its weak link -- Greece -- might mean a stronger currency value for the euro.</p><p>Given this background, Greece's creditors quickly made it clear that they would not be manipulated by Greece's \"pretend and extend\" scheme. In fact, they criticized Prime Minister Tspiras' referendum announcement, and warned that there would be no extension to the bailout program past the June 30, 2015, deadline when Greece was due to repay the IMF. Christine Lagarde, the head of the IMF, explained the scenario in an interview with BBC news. Lagarde said that because the prevailing bailout program would expire on June 30, 2015, a referendum five days later would be an irrelevant exercise since any existing proposals and arrangements would no longer be valid. Without settling that IMF obligation, Greece would face default, and an exit from the euro bloc and other catastrophic economic consequences could be in the offing.</p><p>The head of the Euro group, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, essentially washed his hands of the situation, indicating that it would be up to the European Central Bank (ECB) to decide whether or not it would provide emergency liquidity funding to Greece's banking and financial system. But such a move -- should it come -- would be subject to criticism from other European countries. Of note was the call by some German politicians for the ECB to stop bailing out Greece's economy with emergency support, which could be a violation of the body's own central banking regulations. Finally, on June 28, 2015, ECB President Mario Draghi convened an emergency meeting, which concluded with the decision to freeze the level of emergency aid available to Greek banks.</p><p>The news that negotiations had ended in failure triggered some panic from among the Greek citizenry, with long lines reported at banks as people tried to withdraw as much money as possible ahead of anticipated restrictions. Lines were also long at petrol (gas) stations and at grocery stores as Greeks stocked up on fuel and food supplies. In response to the rising tide of anxiety and to prevent a continued \"run of the banks,\" it was soon announced that Greece's beleaguered financial institutions would be closed from June 29, 2015. Meanwhile, the Greek authorities moved to implement capital controls making Greece the second European country since Cyprus to follow this path. Aiming to minimize the sense of panic, Prime Minister Tsipras urged calm, saying in a national address: \"The more calmly we deal with difficulties, the sooner we can overcome them and the milder their consequences will be.\" The prime minister's political cachet meanwhile did not seem to be hurt with Greeks placing the blame on the European creditors and not Tspiras for Greece's plight.</p><p>Nevertheless, Tspiras found himself to be the subject of a scathing editorial by the Financial Times on June 28, 2015. In that editorial, the Financial Times accused the Greek leader of misleading the Greek people about just what was at stake in the referendum set for July 5, 2015. A key point made by the Financial Times was as follows: \"His [Tspiras'] tactic has already come unstuck because the eurozone has refused to consider extending their bailout offer to the date of the poll. By Sunday, when the referendum votes are due to be cast, there may be no deal on the table to discuss.\" The Financial Times also accused the Greek leader of being deceptive about the goal of the referendum; the newspaper argued that a \"resounding no vote\" called for by Tsipras would not be a rejection of the rescue proposal by the European Commission but, instead, \"a vote for the euro or the drachma \u2014 no more, no less.\" The Financial Times' conclusion was that while Prime Minister Tspiras had presented the July 5, 2015, as a referendum on the rescue plan, with a fresh (and better) deal to come as a result, in actuality, the referendum was about the so-called \"Grexit.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, European finance ministers declined to extend the existing bailout for Greece, with Dutch Finance Minster and the president of the Euro group, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, saying that \"it would be crazy to extend the program.\" An extension would have permitted Greece to meet its obligation; without it, Greece would not have the requisite funds at its disposal. As a result, Greece officially defaulted on its scheduled repayment to the International Monetary Fund on June 30, 2015.</p><p>Now, attention was on the July 5, 2015, date when the Greek citizenry was scheduled to vote in a referendum on the very rescue package that the Greek prime minister had already rejected.</p><p>Ahead of the vote, Prime Minister Tsipras showed interest in restarting the negotiations process with creditor institutions by dispatching a letter to European leaders. In that missive, he suggested that his government was prepared to accept most -- but not all -- of the terms of the now-expired rescue package. This perplexing move was met with disinterest in Europe where leaders were clearly wary of dealing with Tsipras and the radical Syriza government. Speaking to the German parliament in Berlin, Chancellor Merkel said, \"We will wait for the referendum. There can be no negotiations on a new aid program before the referendum.\" Dijsselbloem, the head of the Euro group, issued a similar response, noting that new rescue package terms could only be discussed \"after and on the basis of the outcome of\" the referendum.</p><p>Rather than tempering the Greek stance ahead of the vote and certainly ahead of a fresh slate of negotiations, Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis lashed out at his country's creditors, accusing them of blackmail. In an interview with the media, Varoufakis: \"This is a very dark moment for Europe. They have closed our banks for the sole purpose of blackmailing what? Getting a \"yes\" vote on a non-sustainable solution that would be bad for Europe.\"</p><p>This tone held resonance among many Greeks who were now blaming creditor institutions for capital controls at banks and other hardships, which were sure to get worse should the \"no\" vote prevail. Long lines of pensioners at banks, limits on cash withdawals, stalled commercial activity, and a sense of confusion began to permeate the Greek landscape, even as ratings agencies downgraded Greek banks to almost junk status. Still, the political power of resistance and rhetoric was strong as angry Greeks took to the streets in mass protests to blame Europe for its financial woes and to call for a strong rejection of the rescue package.</p><p>On the other side of the equation, European leaders were wasting no opportunity to remind the Greek people that despite Prime Minister Tspiras' claims that a strong \"no\" vote would bolster the country's bargaining power, it was actually a vote against participation in the Euro zone. They were essentially redefining the referendum terms so it was instead a ratification or a rejection of the Euro zone -- and a choice between keeping the Euro and returning to the Drachma. Not surprisingly, that message also held resonance, and counter-demonstrations sprouted in the streets of Greece, with people calling for ratification of the bailout terms, and thus a \"yes\" vote.</p><p>In truth, creditor institutions were likely making the calculation that either a \"no\" or a \"yes\" vote would lead to a better outcome. Despite the gamble of the radical Syriza government, a \"no\" vote would augur an exit of Greece from the Euro zone, and while that end would be painful and difficult, it might also be therapeutic. Much as the removal of a malignant tumor could help in the body's recover from cancerous toxins, so too might excising problematic Greece prove to be helpful; indeed, it might very well heal the debt-to-GDP woes infecting the regional body. On the other hand, a \"yes\" vote could potentially be viewed as a vote of non-confidence in Prime Minister Tspiras' government, and could lead to its downfall. European leaders, then, would then have the opportunity to negotiate with another slate of players -- most of whom were guaranteed to be less intransigent than Syriza. As such, there was no reason for creditor institutions to do anything at this point but wait for the referendum to play out.</p><p>For his part, the Greek leadership was in no mood to back down. Prime Minister Tspiras instead delivered a vociferous rallying call for Greeks to vote on the side of democracy and reject the bailout proposal as he declared: \u201cTurn your backs on those who terrorize you daily.\u201d He continued, \u201cOn Sunday, we are not just deciding that we are staying in Europe, but that we are deciding to live with dignity in Europe.\" Prime Minister Tspiras was not the only member of the Syriza government willing to deploy heavily loaded rhetoric. Greek Finance Minister Varoufakis also accused his country's creditors of terrorism. In an interview with the media, he posedthe following question: \"Why did they force us to close the banks? To instil fear in people. And spreading fear is called terrorism.\"</p><p>It should be noted that polling data on the eve of the referendum suggested a close vote. While support for the pro-Tsipras/Syriza \"no\" vote was initially stronger, congnizance of the consequences of such a path was beginning to circulate through the Greek citizenry. As such, the \"yes\" vote was gaining steam and by July 3, 2015, some polling outfits were showing a slight lead for the \"yes\" contingent. While there remained a significant undecided faction, with Greeks overwhelmingly favoring continued participation in the Euro zone, the advantage was certainly not with the Syriza government of Prime Minister Tspiras.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Germany, frustration over being Greece's financial scapegoat was reaching new heights. Already, Germans were growing increasingly outraged over the prospect of working longer to fund a bailout package that might preserve early retirement for Greek pensioners. But that outrage reached new heights as Greeks demonized Germany for the harsh austerity terms attached to the proposed rescue package. Now, Germans were starting to warm to the notion of a Greek exit from the Euro zone, while the German newspaper, Bild, suggested that Germany should hold a referendum of its own, in which continued financial funding of Greece would have to be ratified. The hypothetical referendum would ask the question: \"Should we support Greece with more billions -- yes or no?\" For now, however, the focus would remain on Greece's referendum on July 5, 2015, with its future in the Euro zone at stake.</p><p>On July 5, 2015, Greeks went to the polls to cast their votes in a referendum intended to either ratify the rescue package or to reject it. As suggested here, the vote was widely regarded as a vote on the future of Greece in the Euro zone. After the votes were counted -- and despite pre-referendum polling data indicating a close result -- it was clear that the people of Greece had decisively voted \"no\" vote and rejected the rescue package by European creditors. With almost all the ballots counted, 61 percent of Greeks voted \"no\" while 39 percent voted \"yes.\"</p><p>Greeks, it seemed, had accepted the argument by Prime Minister Tsipras that a strong \"no\" vote would improve Greece's leverage and bargaining power, and thus position the Syriza government to negotiate a better deal. Of course \"better\" by Greek standards was not necessarily better in the minds of Greece's creditor institutions. For Greece's creditor institutions, and certainly for finance ministers across Europe, the \"no\" vote signaled an exit from the Euro zone.</p><p>For his part, Prime Minister Tspiras declared victory and declared in a national address that his fellow Greeks had voted for a \"Europe of solidarity and democracy.\" He signaled a return to negotiations with a strengthened hand as he said, \"As of tomorrow, Greece will go back to the negotiating table and our primary priority is to reinstate the financial stability of the country.\" But Greece's creditors were not necessarily in the mood for that return to negotiations in short order. Certainly, it was hard to envision Greek Finance Minister Varoufakis sitting across the table from other European leaders days after he labeled the Euro zone strategy as \"terrorism\" for productive talks.</p><p>Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the Euro group, signaled disapproval -- and a tacit warning -- over the referendum result, which he characterized as \"very regrettable for the future of Greece.\" German Deputy Chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel, poured metaphoric cold water on the Greek government's plans for fresh deal-making, noting that negotiations with Greece were now \"difficult to imagine.\" The German deputy leader also excoriated Greek Prime Minister Tsipras and the Syriza government for leading the Greek people along \"a path of bitter abandonment and hopelessness.\"</p><p>The night of July 5, 2015, in Greece was marked by a mix of jubilation and defiance. But even as the Syriza government of Greece and its supporters celebrated their referendum triumph, the reality was that there were serious and pressing financial challenges to be addressed. Of significance was the fact that the Greek banking and financial system was in dire need of an infusion of emergency funds -- and it was not clear that those funds would be available from the European Central Bank. Greece's banks have for some time been insolvent and reliant on the European Central Bank's emergency liquidity assistance program, but it was to be seen if on July 6, 2015, the European Central Bank would provide enough liquidity to rescue the Greek banking system from collapse, or, if it would simply hold emergency funding at the existing restricted level. Should Greece seek funding from an external entity outside the domain of the European Central Bank, Greece would be delivering the message that it was exiting the Euro zone. Another option would be the creation of a parallel currency at an unknown conversation rate, which would be used to get the banking sector and economy moving again, and to pay salaries and pensions. But that path would ultimately come with extraordinarily high cost of living perils -- quite likely in the form of expensive and even unaffordable imported food, medicine, oil products, and other such vital items.</p><p>In the hours following the overwhelming \"no\" vote, it was clear that Greece was effectively wading into uncharted territory. A meeting of the European Commision was scheduled to take place on July 6, 2015, to consider immediate actions.</p><p>Post-Referendum Developments --</p><p>In the immediate aftermath of the referendum, Greece was eager to return to the negotiating table with a strengthened hand. To that end, the Greek government insisted that it was ready to talk to creditor institutions the day after the referendum. But Germany was in no mood to be responsive. Indeed, Greece made it clear that there was no basis for moving forward with talks in the immediate future, and instead indicated that it would be up to Greece to advance a new proposal. German Chancellor Angela Mekel said, \"It will be important tomorrow that the Greek prime minister tells us how things should proceed and what precise suggestions he can submit to us for a medium-term program that will lead Greece to prosperity and growth again.\"</p><p>Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the Euro group of finance ministers, warned that any proposal from Greece would have to include serious reforms as he said, \"For recovery of the Greek economy, difficult measures and reforms are inevitable. We will now wait for the initiatives of the Greek authorities.\" French President Fracois Hollande issued a similar message, as follows: \"It is now up to the government of Alexis Tsipras to make serious, credible proposals so that this willingness to stay in the eurozone can translate into a lasting program.\" That message even emanated from the Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, whose own country was suffering from a debt crisis, as he said that assistance for Greece \"has to be accompanied by responsibility.\" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte issued the sharpest warning, as he declared that Greece would have to implement \"deep reforms\" if it wanted to remain in the Euro zone.</p><p>Meanwhile, German Chancellor Merkel was set to meet with French President Hollande to discuss the Greek conundrum on July 6, 2015, with meetings between Euro zone finance leaders the day after, and a full summit of all Euro zone leaders later in the same week. For the German government, there was a political consideration to be made as Germans grew increasingly frustrated by Greek leaders who had demanded rescue funds while insulting Germany. For the German citizenry, the message was clear: Europe was not just about Greece.</p><p>Perhaps congnizant of the previous poisonous negotiating climate, Greece moved to make some changes in government. Significantly, the controversial Finance Minister Varoufakis resigned and was replaced by Euclid Tsakalotos, a British-educated professor of economics. While this change would likely be welcomed by negotiators who found Varoufakis difficult and, at times, bombastic, it should yet be regarded as a change in style and not substance. Tsakalotos was restrained in manner and thus a contrast to the flamboyant motorcyclist, Varoufakis, on the issues; however, there was little daylight between the two men. In fact, Tsakalotos has been regarded as the intellectual \"grandfather\" of Syriza's radical lefitst policies, which embrace inclusion in the European body while eshewing capitalism.</p><p>Meanwhile, despite claims from the Greek Syriza government that banks would open after the referendum, in fact, banks in Greece remained closed in the days after, and capital controls remained in place. With Greek banks running out of money, the European Central Bank (ECB) announced that it would maintain emergency support at existing levels; however, with more collateral needed to secure that emergency lending, the actual amount of money available to the banks remained quite limited.</p><p>For its part, the government of Greece was yet to advance a formal slate of proposals as the first week of July 2015 came to a close, and just ahead of the European zone summit in Brussels (Belgium). In the hours prior to that summit, Greek Prime Minister Tsipras met German Chancellor Merkel and French President Hollande, but after that meeting, there was no change in the negotiating landscape despite the urgency for Greece to strike a deal. As noted by Merkel, \"We still do not have the basis for negotiations... it is not a question of weeks anymore, but a question of a few days.\"</p><p>Note: On July 7, 2015, the Euro zone issued a deadline for Greece to present fresh proposals needed to secure a rescue deal with creditor institutions. The Euro zone also announced that a full European Union summit including all 28 member states would be held on July 12, 2015.</p><p>\"Grexit\" avoided with new deal; new agreement filled with harsh austerity measures and major compromises for Greece --</p><p>Ahead of the July 11, 2015, meeting of Euro zone finance minister and the July 12, 2015, summit of the European Union, Greece put forth a new proposal aimed at garnering rescue funds and averting a \"Grexit.\" That new proposal essentially sought 53.5 billion euro (just over US$50 billion) in loans as part of a three-year bailout package. Additional rescue funds brought the total package to least 74 billion euros in value (US$83 billion). In return, Greece would move forward with reforms, including spending cuts, sales tax increases, unified VAT rates, privatization measures, and controversial changes to Greece's ultra-generous pension program, which has been considered \"off the table\" for the Greek government until this time.</p><p>In many senses, the Greek proposal was not particularly different from the package Greece's creditors offered in June 2015, which Prime Minister Tspiras rejected and responded to by calling a referendum, as discussed above. The main difference was that this new blueprint called for increased rescue loans as well as debt relief for Greece. As such, Greece was insisting that its new proposal could not be understood as capitulation to creditor institutions. For his part, Greek Prime MInister -- for now -- was sounding the right tone. He said, \u201cI am ready for an honest compromise. We owe it to the people of Europe that want a united, not divided, Europe. We can reach an agreement tonight if the parties involved want it.\u201d</p><p>It was to be determined whether or not Greek Prime Minister Tspiras could garner parliamentary support at home to move forward with negotiating the agreement. It was also to be seen if Greece's creditor institutions would be amenable to this proposal, especially as regards debt forgiveness.</p><p>The answer to the first question came on July 10, 2015, when a majority of the members of the Greek parliament voted in support of the deal. Prime Minister Tspiras actually lost the support of several members of his own Syriza party, who refused to back the plan, denouncing it as further austerity. Prime Minister Tspiras nonetheless gained a majority parliamentary mandate in support of the proposal.</p><p>The answer to the second question was yet to be determined with many European governments at odds on the issue of how to deal with Greece. France and Italy appeared committed to doing what was necessary to keep Greece in the Euro zone. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Rienzi said, \"Now that Tsipras has made proposals substantially in line with the European requests, an agreement absolutely has to be reached.\" He added, \u201cYou can\u2019t humiliate a European partner.\u201d But the hardline wing, led by Germany, had a different view. In fact, Germany was not keen to extend debt relief to Greece. As plainly stated by German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble: \u201cDebt relief is impossible.\" Debt relief was not the only area of contention. Some countries appeared ready to accept a \"Grexit\" if only on a temporary basis. To this end, there were reports from Germany suggesting that the government of that country wanted to see Greece suspended from the Euro zone for a period of five years. While the five year \"time out\" was not expressly addressed by German Chancellor Merkel, she did make clear that her country was not prepared to accept \u201cany price\u201d to ensure that an agreement was made. Meanwhile, still other countries were hostile to the idea of negotiating with Greece. One example was Finland, which was reported to be completely opposed to the notion of a bailout for Greece. Another example was Slovakia, with Prime Minister Robert Fico advocating that Greece leave the Euro bloc. He said, \u201cThe Greeks would do best if they left the euro zone on their own, did their homework and then tried to come back. This is just torture for everybody.\"</p><p>The usual issues aside, there was an additional consideration -- the continuing deterioration of the Greek economy. Greece's decision to walk away from an almost identical deal in June 2015 resulted in default, the closure of banks, capital controls, and the stalling of commercial activity. The result has been the exacerbation of an already-dire economic crisis. As noted by Edward Scicluna, the finance minister of Malta, \u201cWe were told that Greek debt was at 125 percent but we are now being told that this debt has spiraled to 200 percent and that is alarming, raising even more questions about its sustainability and a solution.\"</p><p>There was also widespread concern and skepticism over Greece's commitment to moving forward with required reforms, with some finance ministers suggesting that the real problem was the \"trust deficit\" which had only widened since Greece walked away from the negotiating table in late June 2015. To this end, Finnish Finance Minister Alexander Stubb said, \"We need to have clear commitments, clear conditionality, and clear proof that those conditions will be implemented at the end of the day.\" He added, \"The conditionality presented by the Greeks is simply not enough.\" Regardless, the discussions prevailed with all parties trying to find common ground. As noted by Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the Euro group, \u201cIt\u2019s still very difficult, but work is still in progress. The issue of credibility and trust was discussed and also, of course, the financial issues.\u201d</p><p>In what could be regarded as a positive development, the full summit of all 28 European Union member states set for July 12, 2015 was cancelled. Since sanction by all 28 member states would be needed to force a \"Grexit,\" the decision to continue negotiations among Euro zone leaders only was being seen as a reprieve of sorts for Greece. Still, all parties remained quite distant in their positions and an actual deal remained elusive on July 12, 2015. Time was running out and Greece was increasingly desperate for an infusion of cash.</p><p>In addition to austerity measures, which were expected to be included in any new deal, there were other areas of consideration. Some of these demands were as follows: the Greek parliament would also have to pass legislation aimed at ameliorating the bankruptcy code, protecting the autonomy of the statistics office, and automating spending cuts if the budget did not hit its intended targets. It was to be seen if these elements would make it into a final deal.</p><p>Making matters more difficult was the fact that hardliners had been issuing additional demands. Of note was the call for veto power for creditor institutions over relevant legislation, the transfer of approximately 50 billion euros (US$56 billion) of state assets to an independent company for sale, and the firing of workers hired in violation of previous bailout commitments. For the hardliners, only with these provisions could there by a foundation for a fresh bailout; however, it was unclear if these particular -- and controversial -- provisions would make it into a final deal.</p><p>Finally, on July 13, 2015, following marathon talks in Belgium, Euro zone leaders agreed to provide Greece with a new bailout package to rescue that country from economic crisis. As stated by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker: \"The agreement was laborious, but it has been concluded. There is no Grexit.\"</p><p>The new agreement mandated that the Greek government legislatively authorize and then institute a collection of strict austerity measures by July 15, 2015. These measures included - but were not limited to - increased taxation, ameliorating the value added tax system, ameliorating the sustanability of the pension system, protecting the legal independence of government fiscal data, and creating a mechanism to automatically reduce spending if budget targets are missed. In the long-term, Greece would have to substantially address pension reforms, enact market reforms and labor reforms including the modernization of collective bargaining rights, and privatize the electrical power network. A particularly controversial measure that made it into the deal was a demand that all draft legislation related to Greece's economic health be reviewed by Greece's creditor institutions in what could only be understood as external oversight.</p><p>Of significance was the fact that the Greek deal was contigent upon the activation of all these measures. A tranche of rescue funds would only be released if Greece passed the required legislation -- and the schedule for that release of funds would be aggressive since Greece was set to make a payment to the European Central Bank on July 20, 2015. Without a doubt, this long list of measures, and in particular, the hardline demands related to external oversight that made it into the final agreement, were likely to be regarded as an affront to Greek sovereignty by nationalists. It was abundantly clear that creditor institutions were intent on delivering the message that they now held the power.</p><p>For his part, Greek Prime MInister Tsipras suggested that the agreement foreclosed the possibility of an exit from the Euro zone, saying that \"the possibility of Grexit is in the past.\" Tsipras admittted that the deal was not optimal but nonetheless excluded a controversial proposal to transfer of approximately 50 billion euros ($56 billion) of state assets to an independent fund. However, that amount would be managed and used to recapitalized Greek banks. To this end, Tsipras latched on to the fact that the fund would not be housed in Luxembourg as originally envisioned, as he said, \"The deal is difficult but we averted the pursuit to move state assets abroad.\" He added, \"We averted the plan for a financial strangulation and for the collapse of the banking system.\" Tspiras also acknowledged that the negotiations constituted a \"tough battle,\" but his country had secured a \"growth package.\"</p><p>In fact, the European bloc would offer Greece 86 billion euros in financing over a period of three years -- an amount exceeding the total called for in the Greek proposal. But the rescue funds would be contingent upon the long list of tough austerity measures, including pension program reforms and increased taxation, discussed above. As well, although Greece had sought debt relief, this agreement would consider -- but not guarantee -- the rescheduling of debt payments, while stopping short of actual debt forgiveness or reduction.</p><p>Greeks at home soon railed in outrage against these harsh conditions, with some characterizing the proposed measures as \"punitive,\" and others casting them as the \"humiliation\" of Greece. People took to the social media outlet, Twitter, to express their anger using the hashtag \"#thisisacoup.\"</p><p>But Germany's leader reminded the world that Greece's standing was deeply tarnished not only by its poor economic stewardship, but also its irresponsible negotiating stances ranging from insults to inconsistency. As noted by Chancellor Merkel, \u201cThe situation is extremely difficult if you consider the economic situation in Greece and the worsening in the last few months, but what has been lost also in terms of trust and reliability.\" Meanwhile, Irish Prime Minister Edna Kenny reminded Greece of the urgency of the situation as he declared, \u201cI\u2019d like to see them [the Greeks] demonstrating starting tomorrow in their parliament they\u2019re serious about implementing the changes, legislative and structural, that need to be put in place. Every day that this goes on, the eventual solutions are more costly.\u201d</p><p>Greek policymakers themselves were cognizant of those costs. Daniel Munevar, an adviser to former Greek Finance Minister Varoufakis, said, \u201cThe costs for Greece of staying in the euro are reaching a point where the balance could favor Grexit.\" He added, \u201cThe costs being demanded of Greece are so punitive that they are almost impossible to meet.\u201d Nevertheless, Greece signed onto the deal with an eye on averting economic crisis and a forced exit from the Euro zone. While Greece could be sigh with proverbial relief over this economic lifeline, the fact of the matter was that the country would have to chart a difficult path forward -- and one that was likely to be unpopular with the Greece citizenry. Prime Minister Tspiras would have difficult task of selling the terms of the agreement to the rest of the Greek government as well as the Greek citizenry as something other than surrender.</p><p>Nevertheless, by mid-July 2015, the Greek parliament had approved the austerity measures imposed by Greece's creditor institutions despite the prime minister's own objections to the terms. As stated by Prime Minister Tsipras ahead of the vote in parliament, \"I acknowledge the fiscal measures are harsh, that they won't benefit the Greek economy, but I'm forced to accept them.\" Apparently, the vast majority of Greek members of parlaiment agreed with him.</p><p>While this outcome could only be understood as a \"win\" for Prime Minister Tsipras, it should be noted that he lost the support of dozens of members of parliament from his own Syriza party, and was instead supported by several opposition parties including the the center-right New Democracy party, the centrist To Potami party and the center-left party, Pasok. Among the Syriza defections were former Finance Minister Varoufakis, who condemned the bailout package, calling it as \"a new Versailles Treaty,\" and also Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis and Deputy Labor Minister Dimitris Stratoulis.</p><p>It should be noted that Prime Minister Tsipras soon enacted a cabinet shuffle, which included the sacking of all recalictrant members of his party serving in cabinet and replacing them with more pragmatic individuals. Among those retaining a portfolio was Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos. There were also suggestions of early elections to be held later in 2015 -- presumably in response to the friction and divisions now emerging within Syriza.</p><p>Outside parliament, violent clashes broke out between police and protesters who were angered by the notion that Greece would have to assent to the harsh reform agenda outlined by creditors. As well, civil servants went on a 24-hour strike. With some demonstrators using petrol bombs to attack police, security forces responded with arrests and tear gas in an attempt to quell the unrest. To that end, the scene in Athens calmed down although the national mood remained sour.</p><p>Meanwhile, people in other Euro zone countries were themselves skeptical of a continuing relationship with Greece. To this end, there were ratification votes in the offing for the parliaments of several Euro zone member states. But at the end of the day, even the most hardline players such as Germany, Lithuania and Finland, ratified the move. As such, the stage was set for Greece to commence talks aimed at securing a new rescue package via the European Stability Mechanism.</p><p>As well, Europe re-opened the door to funds for Greece. While capital controls would have to be retained to prevent a so-called \"run on the banks,\" the scene in Greece improved as the European Central Bank increased emergency funding via its Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) program for the banks. As well, European Union finance ministers approved bridging loans aimed at keeping Greece's finances afloat and thus able to make pending payments to the ECB and the IMF.</p><p>Political Ramifications of the Rescue Deal --</p><p>In August 2015, the domestic political landscape in Greece was fractious as Prime Minister Tspiras attempted to limit the fallout within his Syriza party rising from the unpopular debt deal with creditors. Tspiras assured his party that he would go no further than the reform measures expressly agreed to with the Euro zone. As noted by Tsipras, \"I know well the framework of the deal we signed at the euro zone summit on July 12. We will implement these commitments, irrespective of whether we agree with it or not. Nothing beyond that.\"</p><p>Of course, for many Syriza members, those very measures were bad enough and a betrayal of the party's anti-austerity platform and core principles. For the far-left flank, a bad deal was worse than no deal, and rather than surrender to the harsh terms dictated by creditors for Greece to remain in the Euro zone, they preferred an exit from the bloc and a return to Greece's drachma currency. Of particular note was the vociferous denunciation of the bailout agreement by former Finance Minister Varoufakis, who has repeatedly accused Greece's creditors of violating Greece's sovereignty. In an interview with the German publication, Stern, Varoufakis said, \"It was a financial war. Today you don't need tanks to beat someone. You've got your banks.\"</p><p>For his part, at a meeting of Syriza's central committee, Prime Minister Tsipras made clear that the deal that was forged in mid-July 2015 was the best possible and was taken in order to avert a national catastrophe. He said, \"We are telling the Greek people, loud and clear and with no remorse, that this is the deal we managed to bring to them and if there is someone who thinks that they could have achieved a better deal, let them come out and say that.\"</p><p>With the far-left hardliners continuing to make clear their objections to the rescue deal, it was clear that a chasm was growing within Syriza and one that could well grow into an ideological civil war of sorts. With an eye on containing the dissention, the prime minister called for an emergency Syriza summit to debate a strategy for the party going forward. He also warned recalcitrant Syriza members of parliament that if he could no longer hold a parliamentary majority, he would be forced to call snap elections. That theoretical poll could yield unpredictable results.</p><p>Technical deal made as new deadline looms --</p><p>By mid- August 2015 a technical deal was arranged with the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank, and the European Stability Mechanism, which would secure for Greece 85 billion euro in funding, and thus enable that country to make its public payments now in arrears. Most crucially, it would permit Greece to make a payment of three billion euros to the European Central Bank on Aug. 20, 2015. In exchange, Greece would have to implement significant structural reforms to the Greek entitlement system, tax hikes, and spending cuts.</p><p>The proposed agreement would have to be debated and approved by the Greece parliament. With the Aug. 20, 2015, deadline in the offing when the European Central Bank payment would have to be made, Prime Minister Tsipras urged members of parliament to approve the technical agreement, stating in a letter: \"The crucial nature of the situation requires the immediate convening of parliament to proceed with the deal's approval and allow the disbursement of the first installment.\"</p><p>But even with the vote on the deal with creditor institutions hanging in the balance, Prime Minister Tsipras's Syriza party was ensconced in an acrimonious power struggle between the hardline anti-austerity advocates and the pragmatists in the party not wanting to be responsible for taking the country into bankruptcy.</p><p>The dissonance was yielding consequences as Parliamentary Speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou -- a Syriza member hostile to the deal -- ignored Prime Minister Tsipras' call for an accelerated schedule to vote on the bill ahead of a meeting of euro zone finance ministers. Instead, Konstantopoulou appeared intent on belaboring the legislative process by advancing no shortage of procedural objections. Those objections, however, could not stop the vote from happening and ending favorable for the head of government. Indeed, despite defections from within his own Syriza party, Prime Minister Tsipras won a political victory with support from the pro-Euro opposition parties. As such, the necessary legislation was passed to approve the deal.</p><p>For his part, Prime Minister Tspiras has steadfastly defended his decisions, including his resolution to compromise with creditor institutions. To this end, he said, \"I do not regret my decision to compromise. We undertook the responsibility to stay alive over choosing suicide.\"</p><p>Political dissonance gives way to fresh elections --</p><p>While Greece had secured rescue funds in mid-2015, the terms of the deal were not acceptable to Syriza hardliners, who blasted Tspiras for accepting the conditions. As a result, a breakaway contingent of Syriza members of parliament was growing with former Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis urging that a new radical movement be formed. A statement by Lafazanis and several other Syriza members read as follows: \"The fight against the new bailout starts today, by mobilizing people in every corner of the country.\" While the statement did no expressly call for a party split, it nonetheless included the call for a \"united movement that will justify people's desire for democracy and social justice.\" The Syriza government interpreted the statement as a de facto declaration of independence and cast the move as the final step in Lafazanis' decision \"to choose a different path from that of the government and Syriza.\"</p><p>For his part, Prime Minister Tspiras defended the deal, arguing that he had no choice but to go down this road since the Greek people made it clear that they wished to remain in the Euro zone -- a goal that could not be achieved in any other way. Acknowledging the rebellion present within his own Syriza party, Prime Minister Tsipras indicated that he would seek a confidence vote later in August 2015 when the scheduled debt repayment to the European Central Bank was made. But the confidence vote could augur the end of Tsipras' tenure at the helm of this particular government, as both the conservative opposition New Democracy party as well as the opposition Socialists (known by the acronym PASOK) respectively made clear that they would not back the head of government. While opposition parties gave support to Tspiras to pass the bill needed to ratify the aforementioned deal for the sake of Greece, that goodwill did not extend to the political fortune of a rival.</p><p>By Aug. 20, 2015, with a rebellion brewing within the Syriza party, Prime Minister Tspiras by-passed the confidence motion and instead tendered his resignation, effectively paving the way for fresh elections. In a nationally-broadcast speech, he said, \"The political mandate of the January 25 elections has exhausted its limits and now the Greek people have to have their say.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, the hard-left radical members of parliament from Syriza formed a breakaway group. That group soon established its own political party named Laiki Enotita (or Popular Unity in English) and was composed of 25 members of parliament. In this way, it was to be understood as the third largest bloc in the Greek legislative body -- ahead of both the centrist To Potami and the far-right Golden Dawn, which hold 17 seat respectively. Popular Unity was led by former Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis, who was conspicuously at odds with Tspiras over the terms of the rescue agreement and famously declared his desire to \"smash the Euro zone dictatorship.\"</p><p>Since Tspiras' Syriza government had been in power less than a year, constitutional provisions required that the second-largest party in parliament be given the mandate to try to form a government. With the conservative New Democracy occupying the second most seats in parliament, they would likely be given that opportunity; however, it was not clear they would be able to actually cobble together a coalition. Ultimately, the mandate for forming a government could be returned to the Greek president, who would then call for snap elections to be held.</p><p>Assuming that an alternative government could not be forged, then Sept. 20, 2015, was the likely date expected for fresh elections to be held in Greece. That outcome loomed when both the conservative flank and the hard-left flank parties attempted to form new governments and failed. As such, with Prime Minister Tspiras having resigned, Vassiliki Thanou, an anti-austerity advocate and a Supreme Court judge, was named as the country's caretaker prime minister. Greece's first female prime minister would administer the country on an interim basis until elections could be held a month later in September 2015.</p><p>Rival parties were now refocusing their hopes, and looking at the elections as a new opportunity that would end with them taking the reins of power. But the outgoing prime minister's rivals would have to contend with the fact that Tspiras remained politically popular and could well win re-election, effectively giving him a fresh leadership mandate.</p><p>For now, however, Greece had at least secured funding for the immediate future. This agreement, in truth, was just a start to a difficult period of negotiations on how to deal with Greece's debt. That debt agenda, realistically, could not substantially be addressed without some degree of debt forgiveness -- but that was a bridge many of Greece's creditors were not yet ready to cross. Indeed, debt relief would not be entertained until October 2015 when Greece's creditor institutions -- the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund -- would review the implementation of the Tsipras government's reforms.</p><p>Primer on second slate of 2015 parliamentary elections in Greece</p><p>Voters go to polls in Greece in second parliamentary elections in 2015; will PM Tspiras and anti-austerity party Syriza be re-elected or will Greeks opt for another path forward? Election results indicate decisive win for Tspiras and Syriza; coalition building to be the focus going forward: --</p><p>Summary of Greek Landscape</p><p>The spring of 2015 saw Greece under pressure as it suffered a \"liquidity crunch\" at a time when several bills and debt obligations were due to be paid. That liquidity crunch could be alleviated by the release of a tranche of rescue funds from Greece's international creditors; however, those creditors - including the finance officials of the Euro zone and the International Monetary Fund - were looking for a comprehensive structural reform plan from Greece to be submitted for approval. In that plan, Greece's creditors were looking for serious austerity measures intended to rein in its social welfare spending, such as reductions of civil service pensions. However, the Greek people have made clear that the radical Syriza government they elected to power at the start of 2015 had to keep its election promises, which included an end to austerity measures and the safeguarding of the social welfare state. Clearly, those demands were in diametric opposition to the imperatives of Greece's international creditors.</p><p>Faced with the impossibility of the situation, the Syriza government was considering a referendum, which if ratified, would give the government a mandate to move forward with a plan that could meet the demands of other European finance ministers. The referendum idea aside, another option for Greece would be to default on its payments, exit the Euro zone, and re-adopt the Drachma as its currency. Such a path would likely be catastrophic for Greece; however, the Euro bloc was increasingly frustrated by Greece's failure to meet its reform demands and thus concomitantly accepting of the idea of a \"Grexit\" from the Euro zone. What had been unfathomable and unpalatable several years prior was now becoming a real possibility on the Euro zone landscape as the clock ticked ever so close to the June 2015 deadline. That deadline would mark the time when Greece would have to advance its reform agenda in order to secure rescue funding.</p><p>As talks with the Euro zone and the International Monetary Fund hit an impasse in mid-June 2015, speculation about either snap elections or painful compromises began to surface, along with continued rumination over a Greek exit from the Euro zone. Finally, on the eve of the highly anticipated June 30, 2015, deadline, Greece rejected a rescue proposal set forth by the European Commission intended to prevent a Greek default. Instead, Greek Prime Minister Tsipras said his country would hold a referendum to seek public ratification on the proposal although he urged fellow citizens to vote against it. His government's position was that a strong national \"no\" vote would add to Greece's leverage against its creditors. Those creditors, however, reminded Greece that a failure to forge a deal with them on structural reforms prior to that June 30, 2015, deadline would essentially result in default and augur catastrophic consequences for Greece.</p><p>Greeks were thus set to go to the polls on July 5, 2015, to vote in a referendum on the very rescue package that the Greek prime minister had already rejected. After the votes were counted, the result showed a decisive \"no\" vote as Greeks overwhelmingly rejected the rescue package by European creditors. This result meant that Greece was now effectively wading into uncharted territory.</p><p>With a sense of urgency at stake and the clock ticking, the Euro zone issued a deadline for Greece to present new proposals for consideration. With two hours to spare, Greece met that deadline although the new slate of proposals from Greece were essentially a repeat of the package Greece's creditors offered in June 2015. A key distinction in this new blueprint was the inclusion of a call for increased rescue loans as well as debt relief for Greece.</p><p>Finally, on July 13, 2015, a deal to rescue Greece from economic crisis had been reached. The new agreement mandated that the Greek government legislatively ratify and then institute a collection of strict austerity measures. There were also harsh demands by hardliners that were sure to raise the ire of Greek nationalists. It was apparent that Greece's creditors were trying to deliver the message that they now held the power. The good news for Greece was that the full meeting of the European Union was cancelled, making it clear that no vote on a \"Grexit\" would be held immediately. But while Greece could sigh with proverbial relief over this economic lifeline, the fact of the matter was that the country would have to chart a difficult path forward -- and one that was likely to be unpopular with the Greece citizenry.</p><p>To that end, by August 2015, the Greek prime minister had carried out a cabinet shuffle to purge the government of disloyal Syriza members; he was also trying to assuage his party regarding the unpalatable reformist path it has taken. That attempt was not yielding desired results. Instead hardliners within Syriza split from the party to form their own breakaway group and Prime Minister Tspiras resigned as the head of government given his loss of a parliamentary majority. While rival parties tried to establish a replacement coalition government, the fact of the matter was that Greek citizens were headed back to the polls later in the year 2015 for repeat parliamentary elections. It was to be seen if Tspiras' popularity would be enough to return him to power.</p><p>Political dissonance gives way to fresh elections --</p><p>While Greece had secured rescue funds in mid-2015, the terms of the deal were not acceptable to Syriza hardliners, who blasted Tspiras for accepting the conditions.

With the conservative New Democracy occupying the second most seats in parliament, they would likely be given that opportunity; however, it was not clear they would be able to actually cobble together a coalition. Ultimately, the mandate for forming a government could be returned to the Greek president, who would then call for snap elections to be held.</p><p>Assuming that an alternative government could not be forged, then Sept. 20, 2015, was the likely date expected for fresh elections to be held in Greece. That outcome loomed when both the conservative flank and the hard-left flank parties attempted to form new governments and failed. As such, with Prime Minister Tspiras having resigned, Vassiliki Thanou, an anti-austerity advocate and a Supreme Court judge, was named as the country's caretaker prime minister. Greece's first female prime minister would administer the country on an interim basis until elections could be held a month later in September 2015.</p><p>Rival parties were now refocusing their hopes, and looking at the elections as a new opportunity that would end with them taking the reins of power. But the outgoing prime minister's rivals would have to contend with the fact that Tspiras remained politically popular and could well win re-election, effectively giving him a fresh leadership mandate.</p><p>For now, however, Greece had at least secured funding for the immediate future. This agreement, in truth, was just a start to a difficult period of negotiations on how to deal with Greece's debt. That debt agenda, realistically, could not substantially be addressed without some degree of debt forgiveness -- but that was a bridge many of Greece's creditors were not yet ready to cross. Indeed, debt relief would not be entertained until October 2015 when Greece's creditor institutions -- the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund -- would review the implementation of the Tsipras government's reforms.</p><p>Greek voters set to decide which party to reward with new mandate for government --</p><p>Parliamentary elections were to be held in Greece on or around Sept. 20, 2015. Of note was the fact that parliamentary elections had actually been held at the start of the year on Jan. 25, 2015, and new elections were not due until 2019. As such, this early polling exercise should be understood as a snap election. Also of note was the fact that this would be the fourth Greek election to be held in less than three and a half years.</p><p>At stake would be the composition of the legislative branch of government. In Greece, the unicameral \"Vouli ton Ellinon\" (Parliament) was made up of 300 members who are elected by a system of reinforced proportional representation from 51 multi-seat constituencies and five single-seat constituencies; there is a three percent threshold to obtain seats. Members of parliament are elected to serve maximum four-year terms although elections may be called early.</p><p>The initial slate of parliamentary elections in January 2015 were dominated by the debt crisis rocking the country and were won by the anti-austerity and anti-bailout radical leftist party, Syriza, and led to Alexis Tsipras becoming the new prime minister. Despite the anti-austerity platform of Syriza, Prime Minister Tspiras was forced to compromise with Greece's creditor institutions in order to secure rescue funding needed to keep the country financially afloat, while also maintaining Greece's membership in the Euro zone. This second slate of 2015 parliamentary elections were expected to be dominated by the debt crisis solution -- specifically, the rescue deal and all of its difficult provisions, which left anti-austerity absolutists in the Syriza government in a state of revolt.</p><p>In fact, hardline rebels from Syriza soon formed a breakaway group and established their own political party named Laiki Enotita (or Popular Unity in English). Composed of 25 members of parliament, Popular Unity held the distinction of being the third largest bloc in the Greek legislative body -- ahead of both the centrist To Potami and the far-right Golden Dawn, which hold 17 seat respectively. Popular Unity was led by former Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis, who was conspicuously at odds with Tspiras over the terms of the rescue agreement and famously declared his desire to \"smash the Euro zone dictatorship.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, with hardliners within Syriza splintering away from the party to form their own breakaway group, and with a parliamentary majority now gone, Prime Minister Tspiras had resigned as the head of government and called for fresh elections to be held. Rival parties, including the conservative New Democracy and the newly-formed hard-leftist Popular Unity, tried to cobble together a replacement coalition government -- and respectively failed at that task. Ultimately, the mandate for forming a government was returned to the Greek president, who then dissolved parliament and called for snap elections to be held on Sept. 20, 2015.</p><p>With fresh elections ahead and Prime Minister Tspiras having resigned, Vassiliki Thanou, an anti-austerity advocate and a Supreme Court judge was named as the country's caretaker prime minister. Greece's first female prime minister would administer the country on an interim basis until the snap elections were held.</p><p>Now, the rival parties were refocusing their goals and hoping that they would have a new opportunity at the polls to take the reins of power. But the outgoing prime minister's rivals would have to contend with the fact that Tspiras remained politically popular and could well win re-election, effectively giving him a fresh leadership mandate. It was to be seen if Tspiras' popularity -- over 60 percent according to polls in mid-2015 -- would be enough to return him to power.</p><p>Polling data at the end of August 2015 indicated that Syriza -- even with the defections from hardliners -- would likely attract the most votes, although not quite enough to secure a parliamentary majority. For his part, Prime Minister Tspiras made clear that if he had to form a future coalition government, he would not be looking to either of the main etsablishment parties -- conservative New Democracy or the social-democratic Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) -- as likely partners. New Democracy was on track to attract the second most votes, and would thus be in place to form a government if Syriza failed at that task. As before, the far-right and neo-Nazi Golden Dawn as well as the centrist To Potami were attracting the middle tier of votes. The newly-formed Popular Unity was in that middle tier. On the other hand, the Independent Greeks were at the bottom of the pack and were at risk of not meeting the three percent threshold needed to enter parliament. But a large segment of the Greek electorate remained undecided, meaning that the outcome of the elections promised to be a mystery to the end.</p><p>By the start of September 2015, the political landscape had changed and Syriza's advantage had eroded. Most polling data showed Syriza sporting only a neglible lead over the center-right New Democracy party. A survey of several polls showed Syriza hovering around 26 percent with New Democracy close behing with 25 percent. Other polls showed the two parties in a dead heat at 25 percent, while at least one poll gave New Democracy the lead. With at least 10 percent of the Greek electorate undecided, the race could go either way.</p><p>By the second week of September, these types of polling numbers remained in place, showing Syriza in a statistical tie with New Democracy.</p><p>In mid-September 2015, with only days to go until election day, there was a host of polling data -- none of it predictive of a conclusive election outcome. Several polls showed Syriza with a small lead over New Democracy; a handful of polls reversed the dynamic with New Democracy slightly leading Syriza. The data collectively presented the picture of a close and competitive race with no one party likely to win a majority.</p><p>But of significance was the addition of new survey data showing that New Democracy's leader , Vangelis Meimarakis, was gaining on Tspiras in terms of popularity. Analysts were suggesting that his forthright persona was resonating well with Greek voters eager for stability. Not one to squander this advantage, Meimarakis displayed his pragmatism when he declared that he was open to an alliance with Syriza in the interests of national unity. By contrast, Tsipras has foreclosed such an alliance. Since the majority of Greeks -- now weary from divisive politics and socio-economic drama -- were actually looking for cooperation, Meimarakis' stance was gaining him additional support. It was to be seen if it would be enough on election day.</p><p>It should be noted that the leaders of both the center-right New Democracy and the radical leftist Syriza were indicating that they would both make good on the commitments by Greece to secure rescue funds, and move forward with the necessary structural reforms.</p><p>Note: The main parties expected to contest the elections were as follows: anti-austerity and radical leftist Syriza; center-right (sometime referred to as conservative) New Democracy; newly-formed, hard leftist, and anti-bailout Laiki Enotita (or Popular Unity in English); ultra-right and neo-Nazi aligned Golden Dawn; centrist To Potami (or The River in English); leftist Communist Party of Greece; right wing populist and nationalist conservative Independent Greeks; leftist and social-democratic Panhellenic Socialist Movement (known mostly by its acronym PASOK).</p><p>Election results --</p><p>Voters in Greece went to the polls for the second time in 2015 to vote in parliamentary elections. As discussed above, polling data predicted a close race; however, the outcome of this election would serve as a reminder that polls were not guaranteed forecasts. When the ballots were counted, it was clear that Prime Minister Tsipras and his radical leftist Syriza party were on track for victory. Indeed, Syriza had outperformed the polling forecast and secured close to 36 percent of the vote and around 144 seats. The center-right New Democracy party was set to garner 28 percent and about 75 seats. In third place was the xenophobic neo-Nazi entity, Golden Dawn, which took seven percent. The rest of the votes went to other parties.</p><p>As expected, no one party won an outright majority. That being said, the party with the plurality of the vote share -- Syriza in this case -- would be positioned to form a coalition government. Having foreclosed the notion of a grand coalition that would include the center-right New Democracy, Syriza would be looking to other smaller parties, such as the centrist To Potami, the socialist PASOK, or their former partners, the right-wing Independent Greeks, to control a majority of seats in parliament. With the Independent Greeks on track to garner about 10 seats, Syriza could very well reconstitute the same coalition it formed after the previous phase of parliamentary elections in 2015. Such a coalition would now be more stable, given the defection of the most hardline and radical anti-austerity players from Syriza.</p><p>Vangelis Meimarakis, the leader of New Democracy, conceded defeat gracefully and urged Tspiras to form a government. He said, \"The electoral result appears to be concluding with Syriza and Mr. Tspiras in the lead. I congratulate him and urge him to create the government which is needed and come to parliament.\"</p><p>For his part, Prime Minister Tsipras' victory at the polls for a second time in less than a year stood as a vindication of his anti-austerity stance, and a national ratification of his pragmatic decision to accept the harsh terms of the bailout in order to keep Greece solvent and in the Euro bloc. Moreover, Tspiras' victory at the helm of Syriza also signaled a renewed mandate for his leadership.</p><p>In his victory speech before cheering crowds in Athens, Prime Minister Tspiras said, \"In Europe today, Greece and the Greek people are synonymous with resistance and dignity, and this struggle will be continued together for another four years. We have difficulties ahead, but we are also on firm ground. We wont recover from the struggle by magic, but it can happen with hard work.\" He added, \"Together we will continue the struggle we began seven months ago.\"</p><p>Going forward, Greece would not only have to fulfill its obligations to international creditors, it would also have to deal with the unfolding refugee crisis affecting all of Europe.</p><p>Long-standing naming dispute resolved when Greece agrees to recognize \"Republic of North Macedonia\"</p><p>After years of a long-standing dispute in which Greece refused to recognize the name Macedonia of the country claiming that designation, a resolution was reached in June 2018. To that end, Greece said it would recognize Macedonia as \"Republic of North Macedonia\" or \"Severna Macedonja.\u201d </p><p>At the heart of the dispute was the distinction between the larger historical region referred to as Macedonia and the contemporary country -- a successor state following the fragmentation of the former Yugoslavia -- claiming the same name. As a result of this dispute, the country was admitted to the United Nations in 1993 using the temporary designation \"Former YugoslavRepublic of Macedonia\" (FYROM) until a permanent resolution could be reached. That United Nations decision, at the time, made clear that the contemporary FYROM was also to be distinguished from the Greek area of Macedonia. In 2018, the Greek and Macedonian leadership reached concurrence and agreed that the country would be referred to as \"Republic of North Macedonia\" or \"Severna Macedonja.\u201d </p><p>The concurrence between Athens and Skopje effectively ended the symbolic conflict between the two countries that had lasted more than quarter of a century. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras made the announcement following a meeting with President Prokopis Pavlopoulos.</p><p>Primer on 2019 parliamentary elections in Greece</p><p>(July 7, 2019)</p><p>Snap parliamentary elections in Greece were held in July 2019. Since the previous elections of 2015, Greece was governed by Prime Minister Alexis Tspiras and the left-wing populist Syriza party. It was to be seen if Tspiras and Syriza would be able to hold onto power after governing on an anti-austerity platform.</p><p>Once Greek citizens went to the polls and cast their ballots, it was clear that Greece was following a trend of Europe moving in a rightward direction. To this end, the conservative New Democracy party won Greece's snap general election, handing a defeat to leftist Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who conceded defeat.</p><p>Factoring in the fact that Greece gives the winner 50 extra seats in parliament, projections on election night had New Democracy winning an outright majority. New Democracy captured approximately 39.8 percent of the vote with Tsipras's leftist party, Syriza, coming in second with 31.6 percent.</p><p>New Democracy's pro-business leader, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, was set to be the next prime minister. The party ran on lowering taxes, generating economic growth, and privatizing services throughout the country.</p><p>Tsipras came to power in 2015 by campaigning on a platform to end austerity and Greece's international bailout agreement, although he was ultimately forced to accept a bailout worth $100 billion as a result of pressure from the European Union, the International Monetary Fund, and the prospect of \"Grexit\" (i.e. leaving the Euro currency). Ever since then, support for Syriza had gradually waned since. Combined with rising unemployment and the economy being a fraction of its former size when the debt crisis began, the conditions were ripe for Syriza's ouster.</p><p>The international bailout program for Greece ended in August of 2018, which meant Greece could self-finance again and use financial markets to fund its activities.</p><p>2020 Coronavirus Pandemic Note</p><p>Note that the year 2020 was marked by the coronavirus pandemic across the world. In mid-2020 in Greece, there were 4,193 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 202 deaths. It was evident that Greece was weathering the coronavirus storm better than many other European countries.</p><p>Note on the presidency of Greece</p><p>An indirect presidential election was held in Greece on Jan. 22 2020 to determine the country's new president. Incumbent President Prokopis Pavlopoulos had been elected by the Hellenic Parliament in 2015 and was eligible for re&amp;; however, the government was not advocating his re-election.</p><p>Instead, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced that the government was nominating Ekaterina Sakellaropoulou for the presidency. Sakellaropoulou had served as the President of the Council of State -- the Supreme Administrative Court of Greece -- since 2018.[</p><p>Ultimately, Sakellaropoulou won 261 of 300 votes within parliament and the presidency. She made history as the first female President of Greece. She was inaugurated into power in March 2020.</p><p>-- January 2022</p><p>Written by Dr. Denise Youngblood Coleman, Editor in Chief, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.countrywatch.com\">www.countrywatch.com</url> .

As the vehicle snakes through the Montana wilderness, she deploys her gear and lifts off, laughing as she glides back down. Hannah's a smoke jumper-a trained firefighter who drops into wildfires from above-and she's clearly tough as hell.</p><p><br/>Yet that's about as much excitement as she gets in the film, which debuted yesterday on HBO Max and in theaters. Those Who Wish Me Dead, based on the 2014 Michael Koryta novel and directed by Taylor Sheridan, marks Jolie's return to the action genre after more than a decade away. At first glance, the film seems fit for the actor's reentry. The story follows Connor (played by Finn Little), a boy on the run from assassins, who encounters Hannah after he witnesses his father's murder. Hannah, still traumatized from her failure to stop a blaze that killed a group of hikers, vows to get him to safety before a forest fire wipes out the area. From the posters and trailers, Jolie appears to be the star, with Hannah serving as the emotional center of the ludicrous but propulsive story.<br/>Instead, Jolie's more of an ensemble player; for an action star, she sees little action. While other characters fight and show off their survival skills, Jolie spends most of her screen time hiking or crouching in the shadows with her pint-size companion. It's a letdown to see Jolie limited by the thin role, and to see the film continue a Hollywood trend of diminishing her, and other older female action performers', potential in the genre.<br/>Jolie <url normalizedValue=\"https://ew.com/movies/angelina-jolie-those-who-wish-me-dead-interview/\">has said</url> that she resumed taking onscreen jobs-she will also play an otherworldly superhero in the upcoming Eternals-partly because of \"a change in my family situation,\" referring to her ongoing divorce proceedings from Brad Pitt. For the past decade, the 45-year-old Jolie has mostly been behind the camera, directing dramas and documentaries while occasionally doing voice-over work (the Kung Fu Panda sequels, The One and Only Ivan). Her most visible acting role has been playing the Disney villain Maleficent; otherwise, she's been pursuing humanitarian work or staying home. So it's easy to see why Jolie chose Those Who Wish Me Dead: Hannah's role doesn't involve much martial-arts training, the movie is 100 minutes long, and the set pieces occur within a radius of only a few miles. Given Jolie's long hiatus from action films, Those Who Wish Me Dead offers reliably low-stakes work.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2014/08/heres-why-angelina-jolie-is-a-movie-star/379318/?utm_source=feed\">Read: Here's why Angelina Jolie is a movie star</url>]<br/>Still, to see Jolie return to the genre at this stage in her career is unusual. Such movies used to dominate her filmography, but many of them restricted her performance while capitalizing on her stardom to sell tickets. Wanted, from 2008, featured Jolie prominently in marketing materials, but she was third-billed in the cast. Meanwhile, Salt, a 2010 spy caper led by Jolie, ended on a cliff-hanger but failed to yield sequels, despite the film <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1651475969/\">raking in healthy box-office returns</url>. And Jolie has been replaced by Alicia Vikander as the tomb raider Lara Croft, in Jolie's most well-known action franchise.<br/>Besides, 40-something actresses rarely lead action films-even though Jolie is 13 years younger than Tom Cruise, and 23 years younger than Liam Neeson. She is also the same age as Charlize Theron, one of the few female A-listers who's managed to maintain a steady presence in the genre, yet who <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/news/mad-max-furiosa-prequel-anya-taylor-joy-chris-hemsworth-1234802781/\">still got replaced</url> in her career-defining role as Furiosa in the upcoming Mad Max prequel. (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/12/irishman-gemini-man-and-rise-de-aging/603130/?utm_source=feed\">De-aging technology</url>, it seems, is available only for the likes of Will Smith.)<br/>A movie star of Jolie's caliber could choose any project she wants, and as someone who's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/11/angelina-jolie-absolutely-quitting-acting\">confessed to having grown uncomfortable with acting</url>, Jolie chooses carefully. In Those Who Wish Me Dead, she has <url normalizedValue=\"https://ew.com/movies/angelina-jolie-those-who-wish-me-dead-interview/\">said she saw a challenge</url> in playing against her maternal instincts. In a scene where Connor finally reveals why he's being hunted, Jolie's face doesn't soften around the boy; it hardens. Even as the script apparently forgets to explore Hannah's personal trauma, Jolie maintains the emotional through line, capturing a fragile toughness to the character-her instincts are not to embrace Connor, but to avoid feeling anything that might shatter her. Her lines are brusque but lively, leaning into the film's inherent ridiculousness and contributing a playfulness that the overly serious tone lacks.<br/>Those Who Wish Me Dead could have risen to meet Jolie's ability. But the film reflects the industry's lack of imagination for an older female action star. Hannah's arc is tired: a woman realizing the strength of her maternal instincts, the same arc given to a surfeit of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6850820/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\">other actors recently</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1458169/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\">pursuing action</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7137846/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0\">after a</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2737304/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\">certain age</url>. She gets beaten up relentlessly by the elements and her enemies, to the point of being tortured by one of the assassins, as if the writers believed viewers needed additional proof of Hannah's toughness. (She does get to swing a pickax, but that's not even the film's money shot; that honor belongs to a scene led by Medina Senghore, who plays the pregnant wife of the deputy sheriff and wields a shotgun while on horseback.) And of course, while Hannah is cleaning her wounds, there's an extraneous shot of her undressing. Though Sheridan has a track record of creating nuanced neo-Western thrillers such as Sicario, Hell or High Water, and Wind River, he has indulged the action genre's worst impulses here-gratuitous violence, black-and-white characterization. He leaves Jolie to do the heavy lifting in a film that, without her, would be destined for TNT.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/09/first-they-killed-my-father-is-a-surprising-devastating-triumph/540018/?utm_source=feed\">Read: ~First They Killed My Father' is a surprising, devastating triumph</url>]<br/>By diminishing Jolie, the film does what Hollywood has always done to her: doubt her abilities. Unlike her superstar peers, she inspires a particular distrust over every aspect of her image and career: whether <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/09/the-reason-for-the-pitt-jolie-divorce/500789/?utm_source=feed\">she's healthy</url>, whether <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/03/their-bodies-ourselves/388583/?utm_source=feed\">she's a role model</url>, whether she should <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2014/08/heres-why-angelina-jolie-is-a-movie-star/379318/?utm_source=feed\">even be considered a movie star</url>. To the general public, she's been a chameleonic and controversial celebrity, the blood-vial-wearing starlet turned Oscar winner turned other woman turned serious filmmaker turned globe-trotting humanitarian. And though she's continually made the case for herself as an action hero, even now, reviews for Those Who Wish Me Dead <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/those-who-wish-me-dead-movie-review/2021/05/11/fd364972-b1c6-11eb-9059-d8176b9e3798_story.html\">question the effect of her \"ice-sculpture perfection\" on the film's believability</url>-as if a film featuring Hannah getting hit by lightning needs to be believable-and whether audiences can \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/those-who-wish-me-dead-1234950061/\">get past the miraculously dewy complexion and on-point smoky-eye look</url>.\" In the past decade, Jolie has used her fame to elevate <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/09/first-they-killed-my-father-is-a-surprising-devastating-triumph/540018/?utm_source=feed\">the story of the Cambodian Civil War</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/10/amnesty-international-angelina-jolie-and-geraldine-van-bueren-partner-to-author-child-rights-book/\">co-author a book on protest rights</url> geared toward teenagers, and even <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/news/article/angelina-jolie-interview\">criticize</url> the United Nations, where she advocates for the rights of refugees. She hasn't played a seductress since Salt. How are her good looks still such a sore spot?<br/>As refreshing as it is to see Jolie return to the action genre, Those Who Wish Me Dead is a muted welcome back. The film stifles Jolie's potential, leans into the skepticism that has dogged her throughout her career, and mishandles her star power. \"There have been times in my life where I have felt-and maybe I've hidden them well from the public-where I have not felt free, I have not felt safe,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eonline.com/ca/news/1078483/angelina-jolie-recalls-not-feeling-safe-and-free-in-recent-years\">she said in 2019</url> of her celebrity. \"I have felt small. I have felt cornered.\" Playing a smoke jumper could have freed her-or at the very least, actually let her fight a fire. But once again, Jolie gets to be larger-than-life only on the billboards.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-thosewhowishmedeadangelinajolie618900</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63JV-7HM1-DYY9-J03H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1260\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (CNN) --  The Trump administration will officially expire when the clock strikes noon on January 20. But weeks before that, millions of Americans will face a humanitarian catastrophe that rivals any earthquake, hurricane, flood or forest fire -- unless Congress quits dithering and approves a relief bill. There has been news that Democrats and Republicans have decided to resume talks after stalled negotiations. More than ever, many Americans are in desperate need for those talks to lead to meaningful action.</p><p>Even as the stock market edges toward new highs, we still have 10 million fewer people working than in February, when the virus hit America. In every corner of the country, mandatory shutdowns, limits on capacity and social distancing measures caused by the coronavirus pandemic have forced the closure of businesses and triggered high unemployment and mass hunger.</p><p>In Massachusetts, authorities estimate that 1 million people are going hungry. Texas saw thousands of cars recently lined up for meals at a Dallas-area food pantry. New York City's network of public and private food pantries are giving out more than 1 million free meals per day. </p><p>Nationwide, an estimated 22.5% of all households were food insecure each week during the spring and early summer, according to a study from the Northwestern University's Institute for Policy Research. And that's not the economic emergency threatening working families. </p><p>Millions have been surviving on social safety-net benefits that are set to expire between now and the end of the year. </p><p>An estimated 9.4 million gig workers -- people who work temporary jobs and aren't eligible for regular unemployment insurance programs -- have been surviving on Pandemic Unemployment Assistance. The funding runs out in late December.</p><p>Another 4.1 million jobless Americans are getting Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation, which adds a 13-week extension to whatever state unemployment benefits they might be receiving. Different states offer different benefits, but few run longer than 26 weeks, so even with a 13-week extension, many will be left without much-needed payments.</p><p>These severe money troubles never stay confined to households. Many people have been unable to pay their rent, a fact temporarily disguised by a national moratorium on evictions ordered by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the moratorium, which doesn't address the back payment that renters will be responsible for, will be over at the end of December, at which point as many as 40 million families could face eviction proceedings. </p><p>A similar mortgage forbearance order has allowed as many as 2.7 million homeowners a temporary break on mortgage payments they can't make for up to a year. That program, too, is set to terminate on December 31. And like the moratorium for renters, homeowners will have to figure out how to pay off the mortgage payments they've skipped. </p><p>Student loan debt has added even more difficulties to many American families. Congress approved relief that suspended payments and the accumulation of interest on student loans, and stopped the collection of defaulted debts. It's another form of relief due to expire at the end of the year -- at which point as much as $7 billion a month in payments will be due.</p><p>Any way you look at it, American households will be expected to produce billions of dollars in just a few weeks -- and with Covid-19 cases rising to record high levels, it's unrealistic to expect the money will be available. A wave of evictions and loan defaults could throttle the nation's economic recovery before it even gets started. </p><p>Providing immediate relief is essential and not optional -- and it's not the job of the incoming Biden administration, which won't be sworn in until well into January. It's Congress that has the power of the purse, and Congress alone that can appropriate the trillions of dollars needed to tide American families over when benefits expire on New Year's Day. </p><p>Democratic legislative leaders -- Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer -- have been calling on the Republicans who control the Senate to hammer out a relief bill. Before Thursday, they haven't met with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell since Election Day to discuss a Covid-19 relief bill. </p><p>President Donald Trump, who could convene the parties and help negotiate a deal, has made few public appearances and said almost nothing about the looming crisis. </p><p>While Pelosi and Schumer have been criticized for not wanting to compromise on a relief bill leading up to the 2020 presidential election, there's an air of unreality about the indifference being displayed by Trump and McConnell as tens of millions of Americans teeter on the verge of bankruptcy, eviction or outright starvation. Pelosi and Schumer have both claimed that the GOP has been pushing a bill that doesn't adequately address the needs of millions of Americans. Looking at the toll that this pandemic has already taken on many Americans and what is to come as cases increase throughout the country, struggling Americans do indeed need a plan that is more robust than what Senate Republicans have offered. </p><p>If a flood or hurricane caused the damage, even the most hard-hearted politicians would feel compelled to act. But the looming, virus-driven catastrophe is creeping up silently. It will strike not with the roar of a hurricane but the quiet delivery of an eviction notice or student loan bill. </p><p>Members of Congress, who swore an oath to serve the public, must take immediate action before the disaster strikes.

So we're able to get in front of the fire now, get on the offensive.\"</p><p> Other workers echoed McLean's comments, saying cooler temperatures and mild winds have finally offered them a chance to make progress. The weather is expected to remain benign for the next week, although any deterioration in conditions after that could see the wildfires flare up again.</p><p> While battling the blazes, volunteer firefighting veteran Mick Stain found some moth larvae, or \"witchetty grubs,\" and turned them into what's known in Australia as bush tucker by roasting them directly on the fire's burning coals.</p><p> \"Bit creamy and nutty, but they're all right,\" Stain said. \"They're not spew-worthy, so they're pretty good.\"</p><p> Meanwhile, U.S. tennis star Serena Williams donated her $43,000 winner's check from New Zealand's ASB Classic to the fundraising appeal for victims of the wildfires, joining many other tennis stars to pledge money, including Ash Barty, Nick Kygrios, Novak Djokovic and Maria Sharapova.</p><p> Also on Sunday, news came that another firefighter had been killed. Bill Slade - one of the few professionals among mainly volunteer brigades battling blazes across southeast Australia - died after being hit by a falling tree on Saturday near Omeo in eastern Victoria state, Forest Fire Management Victoria Executive Director Chris Hardman said.</p><p> The 60-year-old married father of two was commended in November for 40 years of service with the forestry agency.</p><p> \"Although we do have enormous experience in identifying hazardous trees, sometimes these tree failures can't be predicted,\" Hardman said. \"Working on the fire ground in a forest environment is a dynamic, high-risk environment and it carries with it significant risk.\"</p><p> The tragedy brings the death toll to at least 27 in a crisis that has destroyed more than 2,000 homes and scorched an area larger than the U.S. state of Indiana since September. Four of the casualties have been firefighters.</p><p> The crisis has brought accusations that Prime Minister Scott Morrison's conservative government needs to take more action to counter climate change, which experts say has worsened the blazes. Thousands of protesters rallied Friday in Sydney and Melbourne, calling for Morrison to be fired and for Australia to take tougher action on global warming.</p><p> The prime minister said Sunday that his government was building resilience to the fire danger posed by climate change.</p><p> He said the government was developing a national disaster risk reduction framework within the Department of Home Affairs that will deal with wildfires, cyclones, floods and drought.</p><p> \"This is a longer-term risk framework model which deals with one of the big issues in response to the climate changing,\" Morrison said.</p><p> He said his government accepted that climate change was leading to longer, hotter and drier summers, despite junior government lawmaker George Christensen posting on social media over the weekend that the cause of the latest fires was arson rather than man-made climate change. Another junior lawmaker, Craig Kelly, has also publicly denied any link between climate change and fire crisis.</p><p> State authorities have said a minority of fires are deliberately lit.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPOKSR-36136968</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPOKSR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XYV-NMB1-JC0C-J0GR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">157554</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"641\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Spokane Spokesman-Review</copyright><publicationName>Spokesman Review (Spokane, WA)</publicationName><edition>Main Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 13, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>AS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Vayu builds high-performance vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) hybrid propulsion-based, autonomous aircraft. Its customers and partners range from public and private entities in Australia, Canada and sub-Saharan Africa in a variety of sectors \u2013 from critical medical supply transport to infrastructure inspection. Vayu represents Alpine 4's second recent acquisition in the fast-growing UAV space and will serve as a vital addition to the platform capabilities of Impossible Aerospace. The shareholders of Vayu are primarily leading venture capitalists and angel investors, including Tesla Motors founder's Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning and Cosmonaut Esther Dyson, as well as public health experts. Like Impossible Aerospace, the transaction will be completed in a reverse triangular merger with a newly formed subsidiary of Alpine 4. Upon meeting the final closing conditions, Vayu will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Alpine 4.\u00a0Vayu and Alpine 4 expect to have the closing conditions met by January 10th, 2021.\u00a0Daniel Pepper, the current CEO of Vayu, will continue on in his role as CEO.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/663893/Alpine_4_Technologies_Ltd_Logo.jpg\"/></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Strategic Rationale</p><p>Kent Wilson, CEO of Alpine 4, had this to say, \"I cannot say enough about Vayu and why I absolutely love this company. Their mission is resolute and purposeful. Their X5, G1 and G2 aircraft are designed to deliver lifesaving medicine and technology to people within inaccessible areas of developing countries, as well as hard-to-reach and vulnerable communities in the U.S.\u00a0The mission-driven purpose of it alone is even more significant than its dollar value. When you look at the evolving landscape of the commercial UAV industry, you see an abundance of opportunities for Vayu's family of VTOL aircraft. Its seven years of expertise combines not only core technologies advantages but also invaluable market insights.</p><p>Wilson added: \"Vayu's platforms complement the multicopters from Impossible Aerospace. Both Vayu and Impossible Aerospace have unique qualities that make their respective platforms advantageous and complementary, depending on the requirements of the end-user.\u00a0Combining these two companies into the Alpine 4 portfolio of subsidiaries gives us a wider and larger scope of commercial clients and positions the company to capture a large market share of the commercial drone industry.\"</p><p>Daniel Pepper, CEO of Vayu, said, \"This represents the beginning of a new chapter in Vayu's story. The company began in response to an acute need of tremendous magnitude: solving some of the hardest logistical challenges for delivering medical care, anywhere in the world. Over the years Vayu's capabilities have grown in size and capability, and in direct response to an enormous amount of customer and stakeholder engagement. Platforms such as the G1 and the G2 are virtually unmatched in the civilian market, yet their demand is as critical as ever. Whether it is for maritime surveillance, forest fire monitoring, linear asset inspection, or the primary and core use case of medical delivery, Vayu's opportunity set is wide, diverse, and growing. In the years to come, Vayu will further expand its offerings to a range of customers, ever expanding its payload and range capabilities, while further investing in its autopilot and avionics expertise to further safety, reliability, and autonomy.\"</p><p>Transaction highlights include:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Advanced UAV autopilot software: The acquisition of Vayu will allow Alpine 4 to incorporate Vayu's highly advanced and rugged autopilot company-wide for other applications such as with Impossible Aerospace's US-1 drone. Large Medical Market Opportunities: The rural medical markets of 'last mile' and 'middle mile' delivery that can be supported by Vayu's drone technology are large and growing. Vayu's G1 has a payload of 12lb while its G2 aircraft has a payload capacity of up to 44lbs. Vertical Manufacturing: Having Vayu within the portfolio of Alpine 4 companies will add more integration opportunities with our subsidiary Quality Circuit Assembly and have cross-pollination manufacturing opportunities for the team at Vayu.</emphasis></p><p>Vayu builds high-performance gas/electric VTOL aircraft that save lives. Founded in 2014 by Daniel Pepper, the company unveiled its X5 in 2016, and its G1 and G2 aircraft in 2020. Vayu's mission is to solve the hardest and most critical logistics challenges, anywhere in the world, aiming to set the standard and lead the market in safe, reliable, and autonomous VTOL aircraft.</p><p>ABC News:<url normalizedValue=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/video/doctors-drones-drop-medical-supplies-madagascar-46880863\">https://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/video/doctors-drones-drop-medical-supplies-madagascar-46880863</url></p><p>X5 Vayu:\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-Z0x0ZekTQ&amp;lc=z13hjp1x2zf1hntfw22mxpfaknz4fdcpu04\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-Z0x0ZekTQ&amp;lc=z13hjp1x2zf1hntfw22mxpfaknz4fdcpu04</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vayu.us\">https://www.vayu.us</url>/</p><p>Alpine 4:\u00a0 Four principles at the core of our business areSynergy.

I'd put the odds against Rushing (capital R) at about 3-1, and I've got Barbara Lagoa at 2-1 and Amy Coney Barrett as the favorite at 3-2.</p><p>This must have been a killer week for Mr. Trump, poring over the voluminous and nuanced legal opinions of up to a dozen candidates, then analyzing their additional legal writings and scholarly articles to fully inform this difficult, generational decision.</p><p>HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!</p><p>Poor man, he barely had time to stage pep rallies and events in five states and threaten the foundations of democracy.</p><p>Helpfully today, I'm posting odds on some other prominent women within the Trump orbit, owing both to the potential pitfalls of the president's hurry-up offense on this vacancy and in part due to something he told Bob Woodward for \"Rage,\" the book that sold some 600,000 copies on the first day it was released.</p><p>\"I had an uncle who was a professor at [the Massachusetts Institute of Technology] for 40 years, one of the most respected in the history of the school,\" Mr. Trump offered Mr. Woodward as the reason he was able to tell North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un he understands more about that country's nuclear sites than anyone in the United States. \"He was [a physicist] at MIT for 42 years or something. He was great, so I understand that stuff. You know, genetically.\"</p><p>Since Mr. Trump is able to absorb so much complex information just by having the same surname as someone, you have to wonder what astounding knowledge he's drawn from those even closer to him, you know, genetically, and how that knowledge might have impacted Mr. Trump's decision.</p><p>How about Maryanne Trump Barry, who I've got at 50-1 in the morning line.</p><p>She's an attorney, a retired federal judge and the president's sister. Let's take a look at some of her opinions.</p><p>\"He has no principles, none, none,\" she said of the president in Mary Trump's book \"Too Much and Never Enough.\" Also, \"My God, the tweeting and the lying, the change of stories, the lack of preparation, holy [expletive] - what they're doing with kids at the border.\" She guessed that \"he hasn't read my immigration opinions.\"</p><p>Well, he doesn't read, but he doesn't have to - his uncle went to MIT.</p><p>What might Mr. Trump know genetically from Mary Trump, the niece who is suing the family and will doubtless be countersued (it's what they do), she of my 55-1 morning line? Does he understand the following, from Mary's book?</p><p>\"By continuing to enable Donald, my grandfather kept making him worse: more needy for media attention and free money, more self-aggrandizing and delusional about his 'greatness.' Nobody has failed upward as consistently and spectacularly as the ostensible leader of the shrinking free world.\"</p><p>OK, make Mary Trump 155-1, and let's steer back toward the more likely candidates from whom the president might know something intuitively, genetically, like Ivanka Trump. If you think this president is incapable of nominating his daughter to the Supreme Court, there's no way you'd have read this far into this column. I've got Ivanka at 5-1. Here are some of her thoughts.</p><p>\"I am almost always, when I'm at home in the evening after work, in a silk bathrobe I got from India. Like, I never take off this bathrobe. I have a series of Indian silk bathrobes that I love, and that's what I rock all the time.\"</p><p>Likes robes? Make Ivanka 4-1.</p><p>Judge Jeanine Pirro is 4-1 too. A former New York state prosecutor and judge, Ms. Pirro has major curriculum vitae as a Trump favorite. With opinions so deep in the reactionary right nutbag that she once got herself suspended from Fox News for them (talk about accomplishments), Ms. Pirro can draw presidential support in her darkest hours.</p><p>\"Bring back @JudgeJeanine Pirro,\" Mr. Trump raged on Twitter. \"Stop working soooo hard on being politically correct, which will only bring you down, and continue to fight for our Country.\" She was back two weeks later.</p><p>I've got Laura Ingraham at 6-1.

Amid the excitement \u2014 those bugs, a pack of wild horses, a looming forest fire \u2014 the film finds room to explore bigger issues, like living life to the fullest even when death is inevitable, and the fact that the toughest-acting kids are often the most vulnerable. As a Navy kid whose father Amos (Oyelowo) was often stationed overseas, young Gunner (Lonnie Chavis, 'This Is Us') is a sensitive boy who's very close to his mom Mary (Rosario Dawson). Now that Amos is back home, father and son find it difficult to find common ground, and when Gunner realizes Mary has leukemia, he begins devouring medical textbooks. </p><p>Before the movie can slide into 'The Book of Henry' territory, thankfully, Gunner changes tactics, seeking instead to find the 'Water Man' of local legend, who has managed to cheat death and achieve immortality. Watch Video: David Oyelowo Chose 'The Water Man' as His Directorial Debut Because of His Love for 'The Goonies'[1] Armed with a map and some intel from mortician Jim (Alfred Molina, having a very good time here), Gunner hires Jo (Amiah Miller, 'War for the Planet of the Apes') to be his guide into the woods. Jo claims that she has encountered the Water Man and charges the local kids to hear her story. Although the quiet, bookish Gunner initially has nothing in common with this tough-talking, blue-haired runaway, they soon form a friendship while navigating the delights and the terrors of the deep woods. Despite a few moments in which cell phones play into the plot, there's a timelessness to the story here. (Assuming you don't count Gunner's 'E.T.' lunchbox.) It's a tale of two outsiders forming a bond and learning life lessons under extreme circumstances. Oyelowo and Needell subtly but skillfully keep everything analog, from Gunner's friendship with the local bookstore owner to the pen-and-ink he uses to create the graphic novel he's been working on. See Photos: Regina King, Viggo Mortensen and More Portraits From TheWrap's Virtual Toronto Studio[2] Chavis and Miller are seasoned enough young actors that they don't come off as first-timers, but then they also don't have that hardened kid-star patter, either. As a character who is herself throwing up walls and performing a more worldly version of herself, Miller takes us through Jo's various layers of protection, while Chavis cuts to the heart of Gunner's heartbreak over his mother and how it drives him to go on this treacherous trek. Among the adults, Dawson is all warmth as the dying mom, and Oyelowo finds the sensitivity lurking within his gung-ho Naval officer. (His American accent feels a little less focused than his skillful summoning of Martin Luther King Jr.'s distinctive voice in 'Selma.' Also Read: 'City Hall' Film Review: Frederick Wiseman Celebrates the Power of Civic Engagement[3] Director of photography Matthew J. Lloyd ('Spider-Man: Far From Home') captures the many facets of this tale, from the coziness of a small-town to sun-dappled sylvan beauty to more haunting images, particularly one in which Gunner ventures into the dark of the forest late at night, lit only by the lantern strapped to his forehead, with his breath in the cold air shrouding his head in fog. 'The Water Man' affirms the strength of families, be they logical or chosen, and it's a grand outdoor adventure aimed at kids who are probably spending too much time staring at a small screen in the palms of their hands. It also affirms Oyelowo as a filmmaker who understands the various pieces that go into the craft \u2014 it's a well-acted, great-looking movie, paced well by editor Blu Murray ('Glass'). Both Oyelowo and Regina King, another actor premiering her directorial debut at the 2020 fall festivals, make us eager to see what they do next.

Now is not the time to further strain relationships, she added.</p><p>\"The race to develop a vaccine illustrates a [tension] between the impulse to withdraw from the world and the impulse to cooperate with like-minded countries,\" Donfried said. \"The competitor of the United States and Europe in the vaccine space [is] China, and we need to foster cooperation on the vaccine between the U.S. and Europe to allow for more effective competition.\"</p><p>Donfried told lawmakers there's a great deal of cooperation around COVID-19 research happening within the scientific community, but there have been some significant political disconnects that are contributing to \"vaccine nationalism.\"</p><p>As an example, she pointed to reports that Germany paid 300 million euros to purchase 23% of a German biopharmaceutical company, CureVac, after President Donald Trump said he was thinking about paying CureVac to relocate to the United States.</p><p>\"And so around vaccine production, we've seen countries increasingly be concerned that a different country will be the first one to get a vaccine. They'll then hoard that vaccine at least initially,\" Donfried said.</p><p>Rachel Ellehuus, deputy director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Europe Program, also pointed out that the United States has declined to participate in international efforts to pool resources and risk to develop vaccines.</p><p>Lawmakers previously questioned why the United States has not participated in global efforts to fund and develop a vaccine. Senate Democrats in May introduced a resolution to urge the United States to get involved with global organizations, such as the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, Gavi and WHO's Solidarity clinical trial.</p><p>More recently, though, health leaders and lawmakers have criticized the White House's decision to formally withdraw from WHO. Throughout the hearing last Tuesday, lawmakers and experts discussed the withdrawal, which will go into effect next year, and some said the United States should instead work with its allies to help reform WHO.</p><p>\"Our competitive go-it-alone approach to handling the pandemic will have costs with our allies,\" Ellehuus said on Tuesday.</p><p>Public health and infectious disease experts from Harvard have expressed similar sentiments. In a Wednesday (July 15) New England Journal of Medicine article, the experts acknowledged WHO \"is not perfect,\" but said that's in large part because it lacks adequate funding to investigate disease outbreaks. The organization's role is a hybrid of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, FDA and other U.S. health agencies, and it needs authority and funding to fulfill its role, according to Harvard's Barry Bloom, research professor of public health; Paul Farmer, professor of global health and medicine; and Eric Rubin, adjunct professor of immunology and infectious disease.</p><p>While the full implications of U.S. withdrawal are not yet clear, Bloom, Farmer and Rubin noted the United States is responsible for the largest amount of funding for WHO and provides the largest voluntary contributions.</p><p>On Tuesday, Donfried said that government cooperation is the antidote to vaccine nationalism.</p><p>If the United States were to work with Europe, it would be a powerful move that could affect the United States' global reputation, Donfried said. Donfried pointed out that China's chief virologist earlier this year said that if China is the first to develop a vaccine with its own intellectual property rights, it will demonstrate China's advanced science and technology capabilities and establish the country as a major world power.</p><p>\"It is clear that China sees this race to a vaccine as a very important step in the way China is viewed globally,\" Donfried said. \"And so, I do think for the U.S., together with its allies, to be the ones who develop the vaccine will have an impact as to how we're seen in the world and how we manage the COVID-19 pandemic [and] gets [it] to where we're seen as competent.\"</p><p>James Carafano, vice president of the Heritage Foundation's Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy, said the United States and Europe need to work together to make better, more resilient health policy and economic policy.</p><p>\"This is the first global health crisis which we have actually seen have widescale economic impact at the same time. . . . we have to be able to deal with these complicated factors simultaneously and many of them have an EU competency,\" he told members of the Foreign Affairs Committee. \"So, the reality is U.S.-EU cooperation simply has to be more constructive and productive if we're going to deal with this in the future.\" -- Beth Wang (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:bwang@iwpnews.com\">bwang@iwpnews.com</email>)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDRPR-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDRPR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FW-11Y1-JBHM-S1XJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465471</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"912\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Inside Washington Publishers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Inside Drug Pricing</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 27, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Public Health &amp;

That\u2019s already 65,000 more acres than have burned in the average fire year since 2002, with an estimated million acres still categorized as high risk and weeks, if not months, left in the fire season.</p><p>As with everything, COVID-19 has played a role. Cottam said people are looking for an escape and heading to the forests more often, many of them are inexperienced and unaware of how to prevent fires. More of the fires have also been started by target shooting and fireworks than in years past, he said.</p><p>It\u2019s also changed how crews fight fire. The strategy coming into the year was to attack quickly and suppress fires before they spread. That avoids a situation in which large firefighting crews get packed into areas where the virus might be able to spread.</p><p>It\u2019s also been expensive. We\u2019ve already spent $28 million more than we anticipated.</p><p>But at a time when we should be looking for a unified response, our fire-prone forests are being turned into yet another political flashpoint.</p><p>At a briefing on wildfires earlier this week in California, the state\u2019s Secretary for Natural Resources Wade Crowfoot said there is agreement that forest management is needed, but urged the president to \u201crecognize the changing climate and what it means for our forest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we ignore that science and sort of put our head in the sand and think it\u2019s all about vegetation management, we\u2019re not going to succeed together protecting Californians,\u201d Crowfoot said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll start getting cooler, you just watch,\u201d Trump responded.</p><p>\u201cI wish science agreed with you,\u201d Crowfoot said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think science knows, actually,\u201d the president said.</p><p>In Trump\u2019s eyes, the blame for forest fires lies with inadequate logging leaving what he bizarrely referred to as \u201cexplosive trees.\u201d</p><p>Sen. Mike Lee, naturally, falls into that camp. At a Senate hearing Wednesday he, too, blamed forest mismanagement for wildfires.</p><p>\u201cCycles of burning and regrowth are completely natural. They aren\u2019t a new feature of current climate conditions as some would have us believe,\u201d Lee said. In his view, it is government regulations and environmental litigation that is to blame.</p><p>He later tweeted that the \u201cCalifornia wildfires [are] caused by bad management, not climate change.\u201d</p><p>We hear the same thing every time the forests burn. And even if we accept that more could be done to manage the forests, it ignores a critical piece of the puzzle.</p><p>\u201cThere is no denying that the fire season has prolonged and is almost year-round in some parts of the West,\u201d Simon Wang, a professor of climate dynamics at Utah State University, told me Wednesday. \u201cClimate change is making this so-called fire weather occur more frequently, to last long, and each week it prolongs it stretches the forest [making it] easier to burn.\u201d</p><p>A 2016 study reported that human-caused climate change has resulted in higher temperatures, less rainfall and a longer fire season which, as a result made the forests drier, \u201cand doubled the cumulative forest fire area since 1984.\"</p><p>The average temperature across the West has climbed 2 degrees since the 1970s, and the fire season is now six weeks longer than it was a few decades ago, something that Cottam and his crews are witnessing during this grueling year.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had an ignition every day since April 18, and that will probably continue to November,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will have six to seven months of continuous fire response, and that\u2019s just crazy. It wears people out.\u201d</p><p>As much as he can, Utah\u2019s forester tries to focus his effort on controlling the things he can control \u2014 helping communities butting up against the forest lands brace for fire and create emergency plans; training locals partnering to fight fires when they happen; and fostering a \u201cresilient landscape,\u201d those forest management projects that include eliminating dead or overgrown areas, although he adds that we can never \u201ccut our way out\u201d of the problem.</p><p>All of this makes sense and these important efforts on the front end can pay big dividends on the back end.</p><p>But it only addresses part of the problem. If we continue to do nothing about the changing climate, or worse, continue to exacerbate the problem, we\u2019ll be fighting a losing battle. This should not \u2014 and cannot, really \u2014 be a partisan issue. We know those fights end in a stalemate.</p><p>We need a holistic approach and we need real leadership. We need a president \u2014 and senators \u2014 whose response to the overwhelming evidence that our planet is warming is far more substantive than a simple, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think science knows, actually.\u201d</p><p>As Wang explained, if he had a chance to deliver a message to our government officials, \u201cI\u2019d ask them Do you want to see Utah\u2019s mountains burn like Oregon\u2019s with those fire losses? If not, do something. Because it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SLTRIB-httpswwwsltribcomnews20200917robertgehrkechanging</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SLTRIB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60VS-K8V1-JCB3-X4FF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144579</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"895\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Salt Lake Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Salt Lake Tribune</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 17, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

The Letter invites Aries to withdraw all of its claims of patent infringement made on 9 July 2020 (the \"Complaint\"). EQTEC reiterates its absolute rejection of those claims and of Aries' anti-competitive application of legal threat to achieve undue commercial ends.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">EQTEC has been advised that Aries has yet to legally serve its Complaint on EQTEC. As a result, EQTEC has not formally responded to Aries' lawsuit. Nonetheless, the Letter has been sent in order to correct misinformation in Aries' Complaint and to put Aries on notice of its potential liability and legal obligations if it does not withdraw the Complaint immediately.</p><p>The Letter explains that Aries' entire Complaint relies on infringement theories that would prove the asserted patents held by Aries are invalid. EQTECIberia, wholly owned subsidiary of EQTEC plc, itself developed prior art gasifiers over 15 years ago. The exact EQTEC gasifier pictured and discussed throughout the infringement claims in Aries' Complaint was first sold by EQTECIberia in 2008 and is virtually identical to an even earlier EQTEC gasifier, originally sold in 2005. The Letter also discusses evidence that Aries did not invent any of the asserted patents but instead acquired them in a bankruptcy auction for US$140,000, a package that also included other plant and equipment. That bankruptcy auction was in 2014, nine years after EQTECIberia sold gasifiers that predate all of the asserted Aries patents.</p><p>As the Letter also explains, months before Aries filed its suit, EQTEC demonstrated to Aries, with supporting evidence, that the asserted patents are not infringed and are irrelevant to EQTEC's far different, and far superior, technology. Despite knowing this, and after initially agreeing to business discussions to resolve these issues, Aries abruptly filed suit on the same day that EQTEC announced its institutional fundraising effort. EQTEC continues to refute every element of Aries' allegations. Further, having reviewed the claims in detail, EQTEC believes it has a strong case to invalidate all four of the asserted patents held by Aries.</p><p>The Letter further notifies Aries regarding the substantial liability Aries may incur for pursuing patent infringement claims in bad faith. If Aries persists in its suit, EQTEC intends to pursue its available claims and defences to protect the market from the invalid patents that Aries acquired, bring Aries' unfair competition to an end, and prevent Aries from further interfering with EQTEC's contracts and business relations. EQTEC further intends to ask the court to declare the case exceptional and award EQTEC all of its attorneys' fees and costs incurred in defending against Aries' claims.</p><p>EQTEC reaffirms its commitment to the North Fork Community Power (\"NFCP\") development in North Fork, California, USA, to the State of California and the interests of its residents in California's Sierra. The NFCP development is a pioneering project to reduce forest fire hazard while producing clean, renewable energy and creating permanent rural employment in the Sierra Foothill community. Investment from the State of California and the continuing support and dedication of the local community will result in the construction and operation of a 2MW biomass plant in California's Sierra. EQTEC is proud to support the NFCP project and more committed than ever to providing leading clean energy technologies to California and wider international markets.</p><p>EQTEC has received legal counsel from Isern Patentes y Marcas of Spain and from Kilpatrick, Townsend &amp; Stockton LLP and Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP, both of the USA.</p><p>Further announcements will be made in due course as appropriate.</p><p>About EQTEC plc</p><p>EQTEC is a technology partner with proven proprietary and patented technology for waste-to-value applications.</p><p>EQTEC designs and supplies advanced gasification solutions that have a higher efficiency product offering and are modular and scalable from 2MW to 30MW.

However, before we can propose listing, we must focus resources on our higher-priority listing actions,\" said U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director Aurelia Skipwith in a news release.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The announcement highlights the severity of the ongoing extinction crisis, said Sarina Jepsen, the director of endangered species and aquatic programs for the Portland-based Xerces Society. The Xerces Society is a nonprofit environmental organization that focuses on the conservation of invertebrates. It is named after the first butterfly to go extinct due to human activity in North America.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I think this really underscores how poorly funded the Fish and Wildlife Service is for the job they have in this age where we have so many species of animals and plants facing extinction,\" she said.</p><p>Although the once-common butterflies are a \"candidate\" for threatened or endangered listing, they won't receive that level of protection this year. Instead, the service intends to propose to list the butterfly in 2024 for either threatened or endangered status, \"if it still warrants\" listing, said Lori Nordstrom, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife assistant director in the Midwest Region. Until then, Fish and Wildlife will review the butterfly's status.</p><p>\"We have to work within the resources that we have,\" Nordstrom said on a Tuesday conference call with reporters.</p><p>The service opted not to upgrade the Northern spotted owl's protection status for the same reason Monday.</p><p>For the western population of butterflies, which spend the winters nesting in California, the delay could be a finishing stroke.</p><p>\"The western population can't necessarily wait five years,\" Jepsen said. \"We're witnessing the collapse of the western population this year.\"</p><p>During the Xerces Society's 2020 Thanksgiving count, volunteers found fewer than 2,000 monarchs nesting in California. The two years prior, volunteers counted around 30,000, a paltry ghost compared to the millions that used to overwinter in California. Or, the hundreds of thousands of butterflies documented along California's coast as recently as the mid-2010s.</p><p>The minimum number of individuals needed for the species to survive locally is about 30,000, according to a 2017 Washington State University study.</p><p>\"We're really looking at a future where monarchs don't exist in the western U.S,\" Jepsen said. \"We don't have much time to save monarchs, especially in the West.\"</p><p>The eastern monarch population, which winters in Mexico, is doing slightly better than the western one. Scientists estimate it's only declined by 75% since the 1990s.</p><p>However, insects (unlike vertebrates) can't be broken into distinct population segments under the endangered species act. If they could, it's possible the western population would have qualified for federal protections.</p><p>Although the butterfly's situation is dire, Jepsen said Tuesday's news could have been worse.</p><p>\"This is not a bad outcome, but it could have been better,\" she said. \"They could have made a decision that listing is not warranted. And they didn't.\"</p><p>The ruling won't immediately impact Washington State's monarch butterfly work, said Taylor Cotten, a manager for the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife's wildlife diversity division. WDFW will continue to monitor breeding habitat, he said, although precious few butterflies are coming to the Evergreen State.</p><p>\"Unfortunately monarch butterfly populations have declined so much that Washington isn't getting a whole lot of monarchs at this point,\" he said.</p><p>In 2020, volunteers sighted a single wild monarch in the entire state. WDFW staff tasked with surveying the population found none.</p><p>\"Most of the recovery actions that need to happen right now aren't needed in Washington,\" he said.</p><p>Monarch butterflies used to be common throughout the western and eastern United States. Each year, millions of the brightly colored insects with paper-thin, gossamer wings, migrate up to 3,000 miles to spend the winter in California and Mexico. There, they bundle together, tens of thousands clustering onto a single tree, to stay warm.</p><p>In California, they spend the winters along the Pacific coast near Santa Cruz and San Diego roosting in eucalyptus, Monterey pines and Monterey cypresses.</p><p>Twenty years ago, it's estimated there were 1 million or 2 million monarchs west of the Rockies, said David James, a professor of entomology at Washington State University's Extension Service location in Prosser.</p><p>Nationwide, monarch populations have declined by 80% to 90% in many areas, according to recent studies. The reasons behind the precipitous drop aren't entirely clear. However, loss of habitat, the widespread use of insecticides and herbicides, and climate change are all likely culprits.</p><p>This year's dramatic drop in California may be due to widespread forest fire throughout the state, Jepsen said.</p><p>Still, despite their fragile appearance, monarch butterflies are tough and James isn't ready to write them off.</p><p>Nor is he unhappy that the Fish and Wildlife Service opted not to list them.</p><p>Since 2014, when the service was first asked to add the butterfly to the endangered species list, public awareness and conservation have exploded. Citizens started planting milkweed, the butterfly's food source, in their yards and apartments. Conservation groups worked with farmers to reduce the use of herbicides and pesticides, which can hurt milkweed and monarchs, respectively.</p><p>\"A huge amount has been done in the last six years,\" James said. \"In my view, it being listed, a lot of that would have to have gone away because listed species become something the average person can't touch or interfere with.\"</p><p>Instead he called Tuesday's news the \"appropriate decision,\" although he's quick to emphasize that monarch butterflies are still in dire trouble.</p><p>That's even if he's not so sure they're on the edge of extinction.</p><p>That conviction comes from his work in Australia, where he first studied the butterfly in the late 1970s and early 1980s. At that time, the monarch butterfly population had suddenly and inexplicably crashed like a \"mirror image of California,\" he said. The population fell well below what scientists believed was the minimum number of individuals needed for the species to survive. Because monarchs are a nonnative species in Australia, no one did anything.</p><p>And yet, decades later, there are still some monarch butterflies in Australia.</p><p>\"They haven't gone extinct. That's what makes me more optimistic,\" James said. \"They are tough. It takes a lot to extinguish them completely, and certainly they are suffering and we are responsible for that. But we have the capacity and capability to bring them back.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPOKSR-38528478</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPOKSR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61HX-TVK1-DYFF-81B6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">157554</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1165\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Spokane Spokesman-Review</copyright><publicationName>Spokesman Review (Spokane, WA)</publicationName><edition>MAIN Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"12\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>December 16, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>US FISH &amp;

Most commonly known as drones, they have been used since the 1900s, initially by the US military for target practice.</p><p>Military applications still dominate the global UAV market, but the achievements of UAVs in military operations have boosted demand for drones in North America, Middle East and the Asia-Pacific. UAVs are becoming a key element in the intelligence and surveillance operations of military and fast expanding in other combative areas as well.</p><p>The fast development of the UAV global market is having a big impact on a range of mainstream industries. Apart from defense, applications also include environmental management, crisis management, agriculture, policing and crowd monitoring, civil engineering, fisheries protection, disaster management, telecommunications maintenance, oil and gas exploration, mineral exploration, mine safety, geophysical surveys and mapping.</p><p>The UAV market has traditionally been narrowly focused but it is rapidly diversifying. Given the pace at which technology and the effectiveness of aircraft are improving, and as sensor and automation technologies mature, commercial applications will rapidly grow over the next ten years. According to report by the Teal Group, by 2020 UAV military market will account for 72% of the entire market followed by consumers at 23% and civil at 5%.</p><p>1.2 Market Scope</p><p>The UAV sector is set to be the sector with the most dynamic growth in the aerospace industry globally in this decade. According to the Teal Group, global spending on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) programs is expected to more than triple over the next decade in military, commercial, and consumer markets.</p><p>In light of solid growth rates, the Teal Group forecasts global spending is expected to touch $20.3 billion by 2025. The civil UAS market is expected to grow faster than the military market over the next decade. The worldwide military UAS spending over the next decade is estimated to be US$216.5 billion. Of which, procurement spending will amount to US$162.2 billion and research spending will amount to US$72.5 billion. The US is expected to account for about 81% of the total military R&amp;D spending and about 48% of military procurement through to 2030.</p><p>The high level of military R&amp;D spending is forecast to be due to the bigger and higher-value systems procured by the US. The military UAS market growth will be led by unmanned combat aerial vehicles and high-altitude long endurance UAVs. The largest market segment over the next decade will be High Altitude Long Endurance UAVs, which will account for a third of the period's sales.</p><p>The civil UAS will be the most attractive market this decade as commercial applications take off and governments adopt UAVs for new roles in border security and public safety. The worldwide civil UAS market is expected to reach US$19.8 billion by 2031, from US$7.2 billion in 2022, according to the Teal Group. Over the coming decade, the civil market will grow at a CAGR of 9.1% and will generate US$139 billion in revenues. Civil UAS promises to be the most dynamic growth sector with commercial segment expected to lead the growth.</p><p>The worldwide commercial UAS market is projected to reach $9.5 billion by 2028. Delivery is likely to emerge as the leading sector for commercial UAS market in the US by 2030. Globally, Agriculture will be the largest sector by 2030 led by more affordable UAS and heavy Chinese investments. This is also supported by UN projections which suggests world's population to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, causing significant growth in agricultural consumption. Another key sector that will drive growth of the commercial UAS market is Industrial Inspection. Construction will be the largest portion of the Industrial Inspection market. All ten of the largest worldwide construction firms are deploying or experimenting with UAS fleets.</p><p>China has a clear leadership in the consumer UAS manufacturing and is now seeking to expand its capabilities to commercial UAS manufacturing. The aggressive growth of the UAV industry in China is attributable to the policy and regulatory support as well as significant investments from the Chinese government.</p><p>Currently, Sichuan, Hunan, Hainan and Jiangxi provinces in China are pushing forward the reform of low-altitude airspace management, giving support to the commercialization of drone application. The value of China's drone market is expected to reach $15.6 billion in 2022, according to Shenzhen UAV Industry Association. Shenzhen has more than 1,500 drone companies with civilian UAV business licenses.</p><p>Data from the Civil Aviation Administration of China showed that by the end of 2021, there are 781,000 registered drone users, and the number of registered drones totaled 832,000 in China. The Civil Aviation Administration of China released a plan that outlined several targets for the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) business in China by the years 2025, 2030, and 2035. These goals included the enhancement of rules and the expansion of airspace capacity for civilian UAVs.</p><p>Europe has fallen behind in the civil UAS market. It is now trying to catch up by enacting standardized airspace rules that will create a single market. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has established rules for small UAS across the European Union.</p><p>The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has become the first air transport safety regulator in the world to offer technical design guidance to urban planners and eVTOL manufacturers looking to build drone taxi vertiports across Europe.</p><p>Governments around the world are deploying an increasing number of military UAV systems. The US and European governments have already begun new programs using UAVs for protecting land and sea borders. Many other international agencies including the UN and other peacekeeping agencies are also deploying unmanned aerial protection systems.</p><p>The United States is not the only nation that is increasing defense spending on unmanned aerial vehicles. Earlier this year, Germany approved major uptick in defense spending on armed drones. German military will purchase ammunitions worth EUR152 million to arm German drones. This will be the first deployment of weaponized UAVs in German military.</p><p>In August 2022, Japan announced a record $40.7 billion defense budget for fiscal 2023, which will include significant spending on armed drones. The Japanese defense ministry aims to introduce unmanned vehicles that can be used directly in combat, rather than just for surveillance and intelligence gathering.</p><p>According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), military expenditures are on the rise around the globe. Over the next decade, growth in military market will increasingly shift towards international markets as more militaries incorporate UAVs into their forces. Major drone providers from China and Israel have increased the manufacture and export of defense drones for foreign militaries.</p><p>The introduction of specially built unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) also promises to drive growth over the next decade. The emergence of the commercial UAS market, growing demand from governments to better patrol borders, and continued consumer drone growth all promise to drive more than a quadrupling of the non-military market over the next decade.</p><p>With increasing UAV installations across the globe, there is rising need to defend against such systems as well. In May 2022, South Korea approved a project to install uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) defense systems at 45 bases across the nation to neutralize hostile drones. South Korean government will spend NT$4.3 billion (US$144.45 million) to purchase the UAV defense systems.</p><p>Market Share</p><p>The world UAV sector is highly concentrated with a small number of companies holding most of the market share compared to other industries. Our estimates show there are more than 500 companies globally, with more than 200 commercial UAV companies, while the other 300 develop UAV for the military industry. AeroVironment, BAE Systems, Elbit Systems, Finmeccanica, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Navmar Applied Sciences, Northrop Grumman, Safran, Textron, Thales, Boeing, Tital Aerospace, TAI, AIA and Aviation Industry Corporation of China are among the biggest players in the UAV market.</p><p>A number of start-ups have made their mark on the market in recent years, however, and are challenging the dominance of the incumbent players. Technology companies like Intel, Qualcomm, Microsoft, Apple as well as venture capitalists have poured more millions of dollars into startup investments.</p><p>Impact of COVID-19 on the UAV Sector</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every industry, although not in an equal way. Some industries have felt the impact very differently to others. The effect on the UAV market especially commercial drones have been on the positive side. According to Drone Industry Insights, drone companies are on a path towards steady growth over the next many years. Global drone market size is forecast to reach US$55.8 billion by 2030, from US$30.6 billion in 2022, implying a CAGR of 7.8%. The services sector will remain the biggest segment, while hardware segment will be the fastest growing.</p><p>As the global economies were forced to shut down and implement strict shelter-in-place restrictions, the demand for unmanned aerial systems became higher. Further, the use of drones for transporting medical supplies proved a boon for the sector. Cargo, courier and warehousing are the sectors with the fastest adoption of drones. Many drone companies including Wingcopter, Zipline and Wing have been able to deliver and scale their solutions quicker than previously expected.</p><p>England's National Health Service (NHS) is among those trailing the vehicles to deliver fragile medicines to cancer patients living on the Isle of Wight. Chemotherapy drugs can have short shelf lives and thus quick delivery by drones is a boon for patients.</p><p>In June 2022, Zipline launched drone medical deliveries in Nigeria. Zipline will initially deliver over 200 different medical products, including medicines and vaccines, with plans to expand in the near future. This will enable Nigeria to create a strong and smart health system. In May 2022, Wingcopter announced a partnership with Continental Drones to develop a massive delivery network spanning 49 countries across Sub-Saharan Africa. The deal aims to deploy 12,000 of Wingcopter's 198 drone systems over the course of the next 5 years. In February 2022, Zipline announced launching operations in another African Nation with on-demand drone deliveries of medical supplies in Kenya. The company is already operating in Ghana, Nigeria, and Ivory Coast. In January 2022, Germany drone delivery company Wingcopter entered into an agreement with US-based Spright for medical drone delivery in the US. This includes on-demand delivery of vital medical supplies, medications, vaccines, blood, and lab samples.</p><p>US-based Walgreens in partnership with Alphabet's Wing is targeting the drone delivery market. In April 2022, Walgreens announced that it will begin flying packages by drone to residents of Texas cities in partnership with Google's drone subsidiary, Wing.</p><p>US-based Matternet is another player targeting the medical delivery market. In September 2021, it launched the world's first city-wide drone delivery network for the rapid transport of medical goods in Abu Dhabi. The company will use drones to transport urgent, high-value goods such as COVID-19 vaccines, blood, and lab samples across the Abu Dhabi's health system.</p><p>LEK Consulting notes that drones could account for a large portion of package delivery market by 2040. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a rapid and more expansive testing of drone delivery systems. The technology has been able to accelerate its growth and development over the past 12 months or so.</p><p>To further assist the sector, the UK government announced new funding program for drone companies developing methods to deliver COVID-19 tests and personal protective equipment (PPE) to hospitals and rural communities. The government has announced ~\u00a37 million funding package for the sector.</p><p>According to research published in journal Patterns, drone deliveries could help reduce greenhouse emissions significantly. The paper states that greenhouse-gas emissions per parcel were 84% lower for drones than for diesel trucks. Companies such as Amazon have been testing the use of drones to deliver packages with an eye to reducing their environmental impact.</p><p>1.3 Market Trends</p><p>Start-ups Threaten Larger Incumbents</p><p>Over the past 20 years, the UAV sector has expanded and opened up to a whole new level of competition and innovation that had not been seen in the market. While large incumbents, especially the Big Three - Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman - have won a big slice of the available UAV deals, new and smaller entrants are increasingly winning against the big companies for UAV contracts, thus challenging their respective market positions.</p><p>A number of smaller start-up companies have burst onto the scene in recent years, threatening the market positions of the larger incumbents. Non-defense companies eager to diversify and get a slice of the fast-growing market have funded some start-ups.</p><p>The funding from Drone startups continues to remain strong in 2022 after a robust 2021. In November 2022, India-based drone delivery platform Skye Air Mobility raised $1.7 million. Skye Air Mobility is currently operating in eight cities across India and plans to expand to 16 cities in the next 24 months. In October 2022, Australian drone logistics service provider Swoop Aero landed a new investment round for its first and last mile airborne delivery network, bringing its total backing to $26 million to date. Swoop Aero plans to use the funds to enter new markets, scale its integrated logistics networks, and expand its manufacturing capabilities. In September 2022, Japanese flying car and cargo drone developer SkyDrive Inc. raised 9.6 billion yen in its Series C funding round, bringing the company's total funding to date to 14.7 billion yen. The same month, Flyability, the leading indoor inspection drone company, raised CHF15 million in Series C funding for its collision-tolerant drone, Elios 3. Elios 3 allows inspectors to visualize their assets in 3D models created in real-time as the drone flies. In August 2022, drone delivery company Windracers landed a third round of funding from the Future Flight challenge at UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), a government-backed organization. The funding amount was not disclosed.</p><p>In June 2022, Detroit-based drone software provider Airspace Link raised $23 million at a valuation of nearly $200 million. The company aims to build highways in the sky for the unmanned aircrafts. In June 2022, Indoor Robotics, an indoor drone technology company raised $15 million in Series A funding. This round will enable Indoor Robotics to push product development and expand in new geographies. In May 2022, US-based drone software company SkySpecs raised $80 million in Series D funding. The company works with wind farms to monitor the health of turbine blades.</p><p>In April 2022, solar drone inspection provider Raptor Maps raised $22 million in funding. Using drone aircraft, Raptor Maps captures images, including thermal imagery, of both potential PV sites and installed facilities. In March 2022, advanced air mobility leader Skyports raised $23 million in Series B funding. The funding will allow the company to strengthen its status as a global leader in the advanced air mobility infrastructure and drone operations sectors. Another startup, Terra Drone Corp raised $70 million in Series B funding in March 2022. The funding will be used to scale up operations and invest in innovation.</p><p>Regulatory Uncertainties Overshadow the Segment</p><p>UAV vehicles have evolved swiftly in recent years, particularly since making the leap from military technology to consumer gadgetry. The technology they use could be useful for myriad business opportunities. For example, UAVs are being used in many sectors, like the agriculture, construction, energy, mining and entertainment, as well as geological surveys and, utility safety and maintenance, thanks to their ability to shoot aerial photos and video, as well as collect other data cheaply.</p><p>The growth of the UAV market, however, has drawn considerable attention from regulators and legislators eager to mitigate the complexities involved in the growth of the number of aeronautical vehicles in the skies. For instance, in the US there has been delays and confusion regarding the rules set by FAA. With the courts and Congress getting involved in regulation, clarity around the regulatory landscape is yet to emerge.</p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued new rules for the commercial drone industry. Under the new rules, the FAA will allow small drones to operate at night and over people and will require remote identification of the drones. The new rules went into effect on 21 April 2021. Remote ID will be required for all drones weighing 0.55 lb (0.25 kg) or more. Remote ID requires identification of drones in flight as well as the location of their control stations or takeoff point.</p><p>Further, in 2022, the FAA will require every new produced drone weighing over 0.55 pounds to broadcast its location. In 2023, it will be illegal to fly drone without this broadcasting capability.</p><p>For fiscal FY 2022, FAA is requesting a total of over $100 million in funding for unmanned aircraft system (UAS) research, development, and integration. This includes $31.3 million for UAS implementation which incorporates FAA Drone Zone. The FAA Drone Zone is a cloud-based information technology platform that includes a UAS registration system, Part 107 authorizations and optional waivers, and UAS accident reporting.</p><p>FAA budget request also includes $24 million for UAS concept validation and requirements development, UAS flight information management, and urban air mobility.</p><p>The FAA plans to launch field tests of unmanned aircraft traffic management capabilities. The Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management (UTM) field test, which is set to launch in the spring 2022 and continue into 2023, is expected to lead to new policies and the development of updated industry standards for drones operating beyond visual line-of-sight (BVLOS).</p><p>The commercial potential of UAV continues to attract big investors and venture capital. For example, Amazon's is investing in its Amazon Prime Air program to create a delivery system utilizing UAVs.</p><p>Alphabet's drone-delivery subsidiary Wing launched a new mobile and web app, OpenSky, which is free to use and informs drone pilots about airspace restrictions, pre-plan flights, and get airspace approvals. Drone flyers can also use the app to check information on areas where they can and cannot fly.</p><p>This is just one of the many proposed uses for UAVs, however. Within the next ten years, it is expected that more than 32,000 drones will be flying for commercial operations worldwide. FAA projects that remote pilot certificates could grow almost 3x to 350,000 over the next five years.</p><p>For the US, the potential economic impact of UAVs, according to the Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, could reach approximately US$13.7 billion within the next three years and create more than 100,000 employment opportunities once the FAA drafts comprehensive drone regulations.</p><p>What is needed for instance is rules that limit flights to daylight and visual-line-of-sight operations, height restrictions, operator certification, optional use of a visual observer, aircraft registration and marking, and operational limits.</p><p>The Buzz from Parcel-Toting Drones</p><p>In a few decades from now, we may look back and remember a time before flying robots delivered consumer orders. At least this might be the case if delivery drones turn out the way most retailers \u2014 as well as service providers - envision them. A delivery drone, or also known as a parcelcopter, is an UAV utilized to transport goods, packages, and foodstuffs, and recently, the delivery systems have been a hot future state plans among vendors.</p><p>By 2023, Statista projects global drone delivery market to touch $1.6 billion. Asia-Pacific will be the largest market accounting for nearly 39% of the total, followed by North America (31%) and Europe (22%).</p><p>McKinsey notes that as of early 2022, more than 2,000 drone deliveries are occurring each day worldwide. The growth rate is accelerating, and it projects that there will be close to 1.5 million deliveries in 2022 in total, up from just under half a million in 2021.</p><p>Drone Industry Insights noted that services such as cargo, courier, intralogistics and warehousing were the fastest-growing drone market in 2021 and are likely to continue to remain so till 2026 with a CAGR of 24.3%. This is due to the increased popularity and demand of drone deliveries for both internal (intralogistics and warehousing) as well as external services.</p><p>Drone deliveries can cut emissions and reduce congestion on roads. According to Virginia Tech University, drone delivery could save the average consumer up to 56 hours per year, reduce vehicle traffic by 294 million miles per year and displace up to 113,900 tons of CO2 per year.</p><p>In October 2022, Alphabet's drone delivery service Wing announced the launch of its operations in Ireland. Initially, Wing will focus on delivering small, light parcels ordered to vendors close to the buyers' homes, mostly containing food or medicines. In October 2022, Zipline announced the launch of drone delivery of prescriptions and other medicines to the households of Salt Lake City in the US. This move follows similar service launched in North Carolina last year.</p><p>In September 2022, Africa-focused e-commerce firm Jumia Technologies partnered with drone-delivery startup Zipline to deliver household items to remote areas of Ghana. This will enable customers from remote and rural areas to order and receive electronics, cosmetics, fashion and other products.</p><p>In June 2022, Walmart announced same day drone deliveries in six US states. The move follows years of small scale testing and now customers will be able to get the goods delivered in as little as 30 minutes. The six states include Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Texas, Utah and Virginia, with the potential to reach up to four million homes, according to Walmart.</p><p>Given the large opportunity in the drone delivery market, the space is witnessing new entrants. The latest is Mesa Air Group, which in October 2021, announced partnership with aerospace technology company, Flirtey to launch last-mile food delivery business using drones in the US. Mesa will first order four delivery drones from Flirtey, with an option to order an additional 500 drones.</p><p>Singapore's civil aviation authority and transport ministry has chosen a private consortium of 13 members to develop the drone program. Under this program, the aim is to use drones for tasks that include delivering parcels, inspecting buildings and providing security. The companies involved in the project have carried our various pilots. These include drone parcel delivery as well as using drones to transport blood samples and specimens between hospitals and central laboratory. Drones are being tested for delivering parts and other materials to factories as well.</p><p>China is not too far behind in this race. DHL in partnership with China-based drone company EHang has launched drone delivery service in China. JD.com and Alibaba have tested the drone delivery system as well.</p><p>Putting the parcelcopter concept into service will take some time because of the many setbacks. The major setback for this concept in the US is that there is no specific flight system where there needs to be a specific path for the drone to travel and deliver in a populated area - and this needs to be solved. Once resolved, the big benefit should be that these delivery-by-drone systems could be commonplace within the next decade. Open season on the open skies could arrive sooner than expected.</p><p>The Obsession with Armed Flying Robots</p><p>The use of a UAV as a weapon first became known in World War II. After the war, little development occurred in drone technology and most remotely piloted vehicles were used for target practice. The US military's first major spending on UAVs began after the Vietnam War, and over the past two decades, the country has become the world's pre-eminent user and supplier.</p><p>Military UAVs in the US have gone through meteoric growth over the past decade. Development has taken a quantum leap \u2014 from lab concept to battle-tested proven technology. Today, America's comparative advantage in UAVs, however, is being battered as technological know-how disseminates throughout the international system. While existing technology has started to lag, global competitors are playing catch up in research and development for drone technology.</p><p>As such, the Pentagon is expected to ramp up its investment in unmanned aerial vehicles in the coming years. The US Defense Department budget request for fiscal year 2023 mentions that unmanned weapons systems, such as drone ships, planes, and ground vehicles, will play an increasing role in future US military planning. The president's fiscal year 2023 defense budget requests new spending on unmanned/autonomous systems technology.</p><p>The Air Force request includes $187 million for enhancements to the MQ-9 Reaper combat drone and $111 million for work on the MQ-4C Triton high-altitude surveillance drone. The Navy and Marine Corps have also requested additional funding for UAVs. The Navy requested $1.2 billion for the MQ-25 Stingray drone, which is to be deployed on carriers and perform aerial refueling and surveillance functions.</p><p>No country has ramped up its UAV research in recent years faster than China, where every major company for the Chinese military has a research and development center and funding allocations dedicated to drones. In recent years, the country has pumped considerable amounts of funds and engineering brainpower into the technology, a field previously dominated by the US and Israel.</p><p>Much of the work done, however, remains secret, but the large number of drones created underlines not only the country's willpower to catch up in the sector by building comparable combat and surveillance models like the Predator and the Global Hawk but also the desire to trade the technologies globally. Its armed UAV CH-4, Wing Loong I and Wing Loong II have been rapidly gaining market share especially in developing countries such as Nigeria, Jordan, Algeria and Middle Eastern countries.</p><p>Israel, second after the US in drone technology, has flown armed UAV models but few details are available. India has also revealed its intention to develop drones that will fire missiles and fly at 30,000 feet, followed by Russia, which has revealed models of UAVs with weapons (although there is little evidence that they are currently operational).</p><p>The Lucrative UAV Micro Segment</p><p>The new generation of UAVs is being developed to improve monitoring of many kinds of systems. From tracking bush fires in Australia to observing traffic in the US, infrared cameras to track missing people at night, and laser spectroscopy used to monitor air pollutions, UAVs are using a lot of the new up-to-date miniature sensor technology.</p><p>All of this requires more focus on the integration of sensor systems in an airborne device that is severely constrained in power and weight. Changing the sensor architecture or even take the control sensors out entirely, allowing the size of the UAV to reduce dramatically. This has created a new class of ultra-small UAV sensors.</p><p>Lockheed Martin's Lockheed Sanders MicroSTAR series of prototypes is one of the many examples of a mini UAV. The battery-operated MicroSTAR designs resembled kid's toys. The device has winglets instead of the single vertical plane tail, and a nose mounted propeller. MicroSTAR featured a five-gram navigation system that could give directions by the ground station but could also automatically keep on a heading or orbit a target.</p><p>The US army has been using mini UAVs for mission in Afghanistan and other areas. These mini UAVs provide near-real time video that allows soldiers to better survey their surroundings and detect enemies in combat. FLIR System's Black Hornet is one such mini UAV which weighs less than two ounces, can be deployed in less than one minute and has a range of over a mile. It is intended to eliminate battlefield blind spots thereby saving lives.</p><p>French drone maker Parrot is also an established player in micro UAV space. It has been selected by Swiss army to develop and supply micro-drones as part of the Swiss Mini UAV Program.</p><p>Despite the advancements, the current micro UAV market remains constrained, largely due to regulatory frameworks on unmanned operations in airspace. But once regulatory restraints are loosened and clarified, the potential of this technology will be unlocked. Mini UAVs are set to become one of the major contributors to both the economy and technology. Market growth, however, still very much depends on the pace of UAV development in different countries, thanks to the wide range of applications and the added value related to these unmanned machines.</p><p>1.4 Applications</p><p>Defense</p><p>Defense will continue to the largest market for UAVs for the foreseeable future. UAVs can play an important role in counter terrorism and counter insurgency activities. They can be deployed in highly dangerous missions thereby saving personnel lives. The UAVs are also being used in difficult terrains for intelligence gathering and surveillance. They provide high resolution images and videos which can significantly help ground troops. Drones have been used by militaries of many countries to conduct strikes against terrorists.</p><p>Transport</p><p>UAVs are increasingly used in transport activities such as e-commerce parcel delivery, food delivery and medicine delivery. Of these, e-commerce delivery is getting the maximum attention with large companies such as Amazon already doing pilot tests.</p><p>Another promising area for UAVs is the delivery of food. It could be used in heavily populated urban areas for food delivery by restaurants and also could be used to deliver foods to difficult terrains including oil rigs and remote islands. Medical logistics is another area where UAVs can be used to transport medicines and can also be used as flying defibrillators.</p><p>Infrastructure</p><p>UAVs can assist in the management of various kinds of infrastructure, specifically construction sites. In the pre- construction phase, drones can survey the land and provide accurate field data and images. They are able to capture high-resolution videos and images, which can significantly improve the speed and quality of the design process. In the construction phase, drones can inspect the sites and provide accurate information regarding the progress of the construction.</p><p>The data received could be used by investors and property owners to monitor if the project is progressing as per original schedule or not. Abu Dhabi has launched the trial stage of implementing drones as aerial monitoring and inspection tools for the city's engineering projects and construction sites.</p><p>US state of Arizona is mulling the use drones to inspect roads, bridges and other infrastructure. The state has introduced Drone Infrastructure Inspection Grant Act, that would dispense about $200 million to purchase drones and the other half to train pilots to fly them.</p><p>The FAA's rollout of the Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC) has helped standardize and expand the use of drones in construction. LAANC automates the application and approval process for airspace authorizations and is currently available at near 500 airports across the country. LAANC is currently in beta and will be tested further before nationwide rollout.</p><p>An increasing number of construction firms and real estate developers in the Middle East are turning to drones amid the COVID-19 crisis. Drones are being used for progress monitoring and site mapping as companies try to speed up delivery of projects. In November 2020, New York's Department of Finance's property division said that it is looking into the use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems for tasks such as surveying tax lots, geographic information system (GIS) mapping and aerial photography.</p><p>Agriculture</p><p>One of the largest projected applications of UAVs in in agriculture. Drones can be used by farmers to monitor their crops. UAVs can survey a farmland faster and at a lower cost than airplanes/satellites and also provide better data and images to farmers. The current altitude restrictions for UAVs limit the area that it can survey, but if the altitude restrictions ease a little, the area could expand and provide greater benefits to farmers.</p><p>Japan has been using UAVs for crop dusting for more than 20 years now and drones account for more than 90% of crop dusters. In the US as well, the adoption of drones in agriculture is increasing due to exemption from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) under the part 107 rule.</p><p>China's largest agriculture drone maker XAG is trying to automate rice farming in China with the launch of its drone-based direct seeding system called JetSeed. It could replace manual seed planting and raise efficiency amid a labor shortage due to COVID-19.</p><p>The German chemical company Basf in partnership with the Spanish research center Tecnalia, has developed a technology whereby drones can be used to see which diseases and/or pests a farmer is dealing with on their fields. This could significantly improve the crop yield.</p><p>Public Safety</p><p>This area again presents huge opportunities for UAVs. Drones can be used for law enforcement, search and rescue missions, firefighting and medical services. Civil governments are deploying an increasing number of unmanned systems.</p><p>The US and European governments have launched many new pilot programs to deploy UAV systems to protect borders. The United Nations and other peacekeepers are also deploying unmanned aerial systems to provide protection.</p><p>In the US, many agencies have acquired drones. Most of these agencies are police/sheriff departments followed by fire departments. In October 2022, the sheriff department of Las Vegas announced plans to deploy 400 drones as responders to rising gun violence. In Indiana and Maryland, police have successfully used drones to catch suspects and thieves. In Oakland, the fire department used drones to hot spots, which were not extinguished during a firefighting mission. The Los Angeles Fire Department has been using drones to make hot-spot identification and aerial mapping for wildfire response, as well as incident response for other search and rescue missions.</p><p>Further, drones can collect information, data and images on natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes and wildfires. UAVs have great potential for surveying storm damage and locating people after natural disasters. The US National Guard is using AI-powered drones to track wildfires in real time. The AI-backed drones can predict the area where fire is most likely to spread based on previous fires.</p><p>The US is using drones for border security as well. The drones support the border patrol team by providing enhanced intelligence, surveillance capabilities and reducing the risk to human operators on the ground.</p><p>Inspections</p><p>UAVs can be used for inspections in areas such as wind turbines, oil pipelines, power lines, railroads and more. Oil and gas companies can use a drone to conduct the required monthly inspection of their pipelines. Instead of hiring a helicopter, which is costly, companies can use drones to do the same at lower cost. Drone inspections can survey hundreds of miles of pipeline and pinpoint the location of the leaks, thereby reducing traditional surveilling costs by nearly 90%.</p><p>In November 2021, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines announced plans to use of drones for passenger aircraft inspection. The drones can inspect the aircraft for minor damage inflicted by events like hailstorms and lightning strikes.</p><p>Similarly, UAVs can inspect wind turbines, several hundred feet in the air, removing the need for an individual to physically reach the place. Netherlands-based wind energy company Vestas is using drones to conduct inspection of its 1,250 wind turbines. Archaeologists can use UAVs to inspect the sites and also patrol for looters. The city of London is using drones for surveys which are used for repairing and maintaining assets across the underground rail network.</p><p>1.5 Regulatory Environment</p><p>Drones are taking off in a big way. Once the preserve of the military, UAVs are now widely popular in the commercial sector, thanks to consumer-grade UAVs that become increasingly sophisticated and cheaper. Though regulatory obstacles could hinder growth prospects.</p><p>Currently, there are different sets of rules governing the uses of commercial UAVs around the world. In December 2020, the US FAA approved a new set of regulations governing commercial UAVs. The FAA will allow small drones to operate at night and over people and will require remote identification of the drones. This new regulation will bring a step closer to commercial drone use for agriculture, infrastructure repair, and eventually, even deliveries from companies such as Amazon.</p><p>Canada has had safety regulations in place that govern the use of UAVs. A recreational pilot operating a drone weighing less than 35kgs does not currently require either a license or a special flying permit. It, however, must follow a list of Transport Canada safety guidelines, such as staying nine kilometers from an airport, flying under 90 meters and always keeping the craft within eyesight.</p><p>Australia requires no registration of recreational drones. Recreational drone operators must comply with Civil Aviation and Safety Authority (CASA) rules that allow drones to be flown only within a visual line of sight. There are other restrictions on the maximum altitude, vicinity near airports and flying over crowded places.</p><p>The regulations allow commercial operators to fly drones weighing less than 2kg without a license. Operators must still adhere to all the existing rules for recreational drone use such as not to fly within 5.5km of an airport, above 400 feet or within 30m of buildings, railways or vehicles, and always to have line of sight of the drone.</p><p>Drones that weigh less than 20kgs in the UK can fly in normal airspace for private use as long as the operator is not planning to use data or images from the flight acquired by flying close to people or objects. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) requires all UAVs to remain 150 meters from crowded events or large assemblies, 50m from an individual or building, and stay within line of sight, which is 500m horizontally and 122m vertically. Drones that weigh more than 20kgs are currently banned from flying in civilian airspace.</p><p>The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has established new rules on drones. Under the rules, drone operators will have to be registered with their national authority and the drones will need to have a direct remote identification system in place. The regulatory framework will ensure the protection of citizens' privacy rights while addressing security issues as well.</p><p>China is moving rapidly to establish regulatory framework for drones. In October 2020, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) announced the first Unmanned Civil Aviation Experimental Zones (UCAEZs) to help accelerate the drone industry in China. The new experimental zones are designed to not only offer the airspace for testing innovative drone applications, but to ease the process of developing drone businesses.</p><p>1.6 Challenges and Opportunities</p><p>Opportunities</p><p>UAV industry presents tremendous opportunities for investors, companies as well as government. UAV technology has reached a maturity point that has placed it at the forefront of aerospace manufacturing. As UAV companies around the world make drones more accessible, the UAV sector despite the undeveloped regulatory framework, is set to develop into one of the most dynamic growth industries this decade. There are some 450 UAV companies worldwide behind this growing multibillion-dollar industry, with the number growing.</p><p>Both the military and commercial markets are set to grow rapidly in the next few years, as the US economy continues to recover, technology continues to diffuse around the world, as designs become more streamlined and efficient and as more industries adopt existing business processes for UAV use.</p><p>The non-military, especially the commercial drone segment, is set to grow the fastest with projections of mid to high teens growth over the next the next decade. The latest developments in computer vision, machine learning, cloud and data analytics are expected to push drone deployment in the mainstream commercial sector. In the US and many other places around the world, the regulations either remain too restrictive or are yet to be given a final shape, which has been a deterrent in the pace of UAV adoption.</p><p>With the explosion of interest in building and operating unmanned aircraft systems, the use of UAV technology is set to generate more high-tech jobs, with millions in tax revenues and tens of billions in economic impact.</p><p>UAV technology is moving ever faster forward as the market continues to flourish. Industry will need to consider how to best to integrate UAVs into their businesses.</p><p>Challenges</p><p>Safety, privacy and regulatory barriers remain key challenges for the rapid adoption of UAVs. The most urgent challenge for the governments is to ensure that the drone operations remain safe.</p><p>Privacy is another key concern that needs to be addressed. UAVs collect massive amounts of data including video and images, which sometimes could result in the invasion of personal privacy. A livestream or a recording of individuals or buildings can easily be captured without consent. Also, even if the data collected is with consent, the transmission of data itself remains vulnerable to hack. The growth and evolution of the UAV industry has outpaced the development of rules and systems to govern their use. This uncertainty weighs on innovation and commercial adoption, unless there is more clarity on the rules.</p><p>Illegal use of UAVs for criminal activities is another big challenge. For instance, drug cartels have used drones to transfer illegal drugs in the US. These vehicles tend to fly for short periods at very low altitudes. This makes it very difficult to detect using conventional sensor systems. Also, UASs or drones in particular could be a source of public nuisance. If a drone flying over a public place loses control and falls, it could cause substantial damage to the property as well as endanger lives.</p><p>In conclusion, the UAVs have raised a lot of concerns and it is up to policymakers to design and create laws that facilitate the good use of the technology while discouraging its harmful use.</p><p>2.

Now is not the time to further strain relationships, she added.</p><p>\"The race to develop a vaccine illustrates a [tension] between the impulse to withdraw from the world and the impulse to cooperate with like-minded countries,\" Donfried said. \"The competitor of the United States and Europe in the vaccine space [is] China, and we need to foster cooperation on the vaccine between the U.S. and Europe to allow for more effective competition.\"</p><p>Donfried told lawmakers there's a great deal of cooperation around COVID-19 research happening within the scientific community, but there have been some significant political disconnects that are contributing to \"vaccine nationalism.\"</p><p>As an example, she pointed to reports that Germany paid 300 million euros to purchase 23% of a German biopharmaceutical company, CureVac, after President Donald Trump said he was thinking about paying CureVac to relocate to the United States.</p><p>\"And so around vaccine production, we've seen countries increasingly be concerned that a different country will be the first one to get a vaccine. They'll then hoard that vaccine at least initially,\" Donfried said.</p><p>Rachel Ellehuus, deputy director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Europe Program, also pointed out that the United States has declined to participate in international efforts to pool resources and risk to develop vaccines.</p><p>Lawmakers previously questioned why the United States has not participated in global efforts to fund and develop a vaccine. Senate Democrats in May introduced a resolution to urge the United States to get involved with global organizations, such as the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, Gavi and WHO's Solidarity clinical trial.</p><p>More recently, though, health leaders and lawmakers have criticized the White House's decision to formally withdraw from WHO. Throughout the hearing last Tuesday, lawmakers and experts discussed the withdrawal, which will go into effect next year, and some said the United States should instead work with its allies to help reform WHO.</p><p>\"Our competitive go-it-alone approach to handling the pandemic will have costs with our allies,\" Ellehuus said on Tuesday.</p><p>Public health and infectious disease experts from Harvard have expressed similar sentiments. In a Wednesday (July 15) New England Journal of Medicine article, the experts acknowledged WHO \"is not perfect,\" but said that's in large part because it lacks adequate funding to investigate disease outbreaks. The organization's role is a hybrid of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, FDA and other U.S. health agencies, and it needs authority and funding to fulfill its role, according to Harvard's Barry Bloom, research professor of public health; Paul Farmer, professor of global health and medicine; and Eric Rubin, adjunct professor of immunology and infectious disease.</p><p>While the full implications of U.S. withdrawal are not yet clear, Bloom, Farmer and Rubin noted the United States is responsible for the largest amount of funding for WHO and provides the largest voluntary contributions.</p><p>On Tuesday, Donfried said that government cooperation is the antidote to vaccine nationalism.</p><p>If the United States were to work with Europe, it would be a powerful move that could affect the United States' global reputation, Donfried said. Donfried pointed out that China's chief virologist earlier this year said that if China is the first to develop a vaccine with its own intellectual property rights, it will demonstrate China's advanced science and technology capabilities and establish the country as a major world power.</p><p>\"It is clear that China sees this race to a vaccine as a very important step in the way China is viewed globally,\" Donfried said. \"And so, I do think for the U.S., together with its allies, to be the ones who develop the vaccine will have an impact as to how we're seen in the world and how we manage the COVID-19 pandemic [and] gets [it] to where we're seen as competent.\"</p><p>James Carafano, vice president of the Heritage Foundation's Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy, said the United States and Europe need to work together to make better, more resilient health policy and economic policy.</p><p>\"This is the first global health crisis which we have actually seen have widescale economic impact at the same time. . . . we have to be able to deal with these complicated factors simultaneously and many of them have an EU competency,\" he told members of the Foreign Affairs Committee. \"So, the reality is U.S.-EU cooperation simply has to be more constructive and productive if we're going to deal with this in the future.\" -- Beth Wang (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:bwang@iwpnews.com\">bwang@iwpnews.com</email>)   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FDAWK-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FDAWK2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60F1-3HB1-DY0P-G01P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">285560</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"913\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Inside Washington Publishers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>FDA Week</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 24, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FOREST SERVICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>GERMAN MARSHALL FUND OF THE US</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Public Health &amp;

The memory took me back to when they were children, and we lived in the foothills of the Colorado mountains. I was driving home from an end-of-the season youth soccer picnic when I saw the massive plume of smoke rising south of Conifer. It was the beginning stages of the Buffalo Creek Fire, and I stopped at the grocery store, loaded up on bottled water and film for my camera, and drove to the smoke to cover what, at the time, would become one of the largest forest fires in Colorado history.</p><p>That was in 1996. I made it to base camp and was there for several days, as roads leading in and out were cut off. A Salvation Army food truck arrived to provide meals to the firefighters and the few reporters who made it there. Cell service was spotty and we had to stand on the roof of a car and hold our phones in the air to try to get reception.</p><p>More than two decades later, the Buffalo Creek fire doesn't even register on a top 20 list in Colorado forest fire history. Every year, it seems, some new blaze, started by lightning, an unattended fire, or arson, adds to a growing list. So it is, also, in California, and in Oregon, where multiple blazes last week forced the evacuations of tens of thousands of people. The fires out West have led to more than a dozen deaths so far. More are on the way.</p><p>In California, the three pandemics have merged. Climate change fuels the record blazes, aided by drought and wind; COVID-19 makes the firefighting harder, as traditional base camps are spread out to avoid transmission of the deadly virus, and because traditionally the state draws from the prison population for firefighting labor. Many of the men who had been behind bars, who had trained to fight fires, have been released from prison to reduce the spread of the virus. But outside of prison, those men, many of whom are Black or Hispanic, haven't been allowed into the traditional fire service, despite their training and experience, because of the nation's third pandemic that fuels mass incarceration and limits opportunities for people with crimes on their records. This week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill making it easier for former prison detainees to have their records expunged so they can get jobs as firefighters.</p><p>There is a common thread in all three pandemics that the nation must come to terms with if it wants to win the battle against any of them: Dishonesty.</p><p>This week, closer to home, for instance, a group of political leaders and environmental activists urged Ameren Missouri to accelerate the retirement of its coal plants, which long have been identified as contributing to man-made climate change. For decades, even while it told its shareholders it was investing hundreds of millions of dollars to prepare for climate change, the investor-owned utility joined in with other big corporations in the coal and gas industries to fund massive disinformation campaigns intended to diminish the reality of climate change.</p><p>The efforts were successful in slowing public policy that would have prepared the nation for what is already happening before our very eyes, with fires out West, floods in the Midwest, rolling blackouts becoming a norm, and not just in California.</p><p>Climate change is real and it's deadly. Just like COVID-19, and, as Bowman calls it, COVID-1619. But in an era in which disinformation has become the norm, where Republicans actually send QAnon conspiracy theorists to Congress, there are those among us who still think one, or the other, or all three of the raging pandemics are a hoax.</p><p>Fires so massive that they spew ash hundreds or thousands of miles away, are not a hoax. A death toll that will soon top 200,000 is not a hoax. Black men dying with knees on their necks or bullets in their backs is not a hoax.</p><p>Three pandemics rage in America. Only honest reflection and a sense of shared purpose can limit their damage.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p> Buildings are engulfed in flames as a wildfire ravages the central Oregon town of Talent near Medford late Tuesday, Sept. 8, 2020.

We succeed when we look out for and care for one another.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That\u2019s the message he hopes the youngsters on UGA\u2019s campus take from the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks this year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trevor, the University of Georgia\u2019s associate vice president for marketing and communications, is a 9/11 survivor and frequently shares his story with UGA students and other groups around the country. In past years, he\u2019s spent the anniversary speaking at and attending remembrance events and has given tours at ground zero. He has also proposed making 9/11 a national day of discussion where people can come together across their various divides and attempt to find common ground.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On this milestone anniversary, Trevor plans to get off the grid and go on a vacation with his wife and two dogs in the Shenandoah Valley.</p><p>\u201cI recognize that PTSD and survivor\u2019s guilt will be with me for the rest of my life,\u201d Trevor told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. \u201cI try to deal with it on a daily basis. There is still a lot of sadness and a lot of loss from that day.\u201d</p><p>On Sundays at church, he prays this prayer for the victims of Sept. 11, 2001, as well as the victims of the Sept. 11, 2012, attack in Benghazi. He\u2019ll be adding to his prayer list the victims of the recent attack on the airport in Afghanistan.</p><p>\u201cMay their bodies find eternal rest, their souls find eternal joy and salvation, and their families find eternal comfort.\u201d</p><p>What follows is an excerpt from an essay Trevor wrote soon after the 9/11 attacks as part of his therapy for PTSD. Versions of the essay have been previously published.On Sept. 11, my co-workers and I escaped One World Trade Center at 10:18 a.m. The building collapsed seconds before 10:29 a.m.</p><p>I owe my life to three things: a knit tie; a quick-thinking Port Authority Police officer; and the foresight of the architects and engineers who designed the World Trade Center strong enough to withstand direct hits from jets \u2014 and enable an estimated 25,000 people to escape.</p><p>When the first of two 767s hit the Twin Towers at 8:46 a.m., I was standing behind my desk on the south side of the 68th floor of One World Trade Center, in the Public Affairs Department of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.</p><p>I was nearly knocked to the floor by the impact of the first plane, which slammed into the north side of Tower One more than 20 floors above me. I heard a loud thud, followed by an explosion.</p><p>The building felt like it swayed about 10 feet to the south. It shuddered back to the north, then shimmied back and forth.</p><p>Out the window I saw a parabola of flame fall toward the street, followed by a blizzard of paper and glass. Then I heard two sounds: emergency sirens on the street, and phones ringing across the 68th floor \u2014 calls from reporters wondering what had happened.</p><p>Within a few minutes, we (department leaders) gathered the staff, threw files and notepads into our bags, and prepared to evacuate the floor. It began to fill with grainy smoke.</p><p>For more than an hour, we joined thousands of fellow World Trade Center workers who patiently descended the emergency stairwells.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t scared at first. My initial feelings were disorientation and disbelief. When we entered the stairwell, all we knew was that a plane had struck the building. It didn\u2019t make sense. (How could a plane hit a 110-story building on such a clear day?) Because we were in the stairwell, we didn\u2019t feel the impact of the second plane hitting Two World Trade Center.</p><p>I tried to call my wife, Allison, several times by cellphone, but couldn\u2019t get through. Fortunately, I reached my colleague, Pasquale DiFulco, through my interactive pager.</p><p>Pasquale, who began the day on vacation and was watching CNN, called Allison to let her know I was safe. He also used his pager to tell us what was really going on.</p><p>Despite this news, our long walk in search of safety remained calm and orderly. We had conducted regular fire drills, so we knew what to do. Every few floors, we would stop, move to the right of the stairwell and make room for injured people walking down \u2014 and firefighters and Port Authority Police officers running up.</p><p>Then we reached the fifth floor just before 10 a.m.</p><p>We heard a loud rumble. The building shook violently. I was thrown from one side of the stairwell to the other.</p><p>We didn\u2019t know it at the time, but Tower Two had just collapsed.</p><p>Our stairwell filled with smoke and concrete dust. Breathing became difficult. The lights died.</p><p>A steady stream of water, about 4 inches deep, began running down the stairs. It felt like we were wading through a dark, dirty, rapid river \u2014 at night in the middle of a forest fire.</p><p>The smartest decision I made that day was to wear a knit tie to work. I put the blue tie over my nose and mouth to block the smoke and dust.</p><p>To keep from hyperventilating, I remembered the breathing exercises my wife and I learned in our Lamaze classes.</p><p>We descended one more flight, to the fourth floor, when I heard someone say: \u201cOh (expletive), the door\u2019s blocked.\u201d</p><p>The force from the collapse of Tower Two had apparently jammed the emergency exit.</p><p>We were ordered to turn around and head back up the stairs, to see if we could transfer to another stairwell.</p><p>For the first time, I was afraid we wouldn\u2019t make it. I whispered a quick prayer: \u201cLord, please let me see my family again.\u201d</p><p>Then I closed my eyes, and made mental pictures of my family\u2019s faces: Allison\u2019s beautiful brown eyes; our 5-year-old son Gabriel\u2019s deep blue eyes and dimples; our 2-year-old son Lucas\u2019 blond ringlets.</p><p>I remember thinking: Their faces will keep me calm. And if I die, they will be the last thing on my mind.</p><p>During this ordeal, Pasquale sent me a series of frantic pages that didn\u2019t go through.</p><p>10 a.m. page from Pasquale:</p><p>Please tel me u r ok</p><p>Please respond. Another explosion at wtc</p><p>10:02 a.m.:</p><p>Part of 2 wtc has collapsed. Is evryone ok???</p><p>10:06 a.m.:</p><p>Plwesse repsond</p><p>10:12 a.m.:</p><p>Where are you? 2 wtc just collapsed???</p><p>I don\u2019t know how many minutes it took for emergency workers to clear the exit. But when they did, thank God that Port Authority Police Officer David Lim was there.</p><p>David is a K-9 officer whose partner, Sirius, was killed in the attacks. He was later trapped in the rubble for nearly five hours. David had the presence of mind to figure out a way to get us all turned around and headed back downstairs. Over and over, he shouted: \u201cDown is good! Down is good!\u201d</p><p>The emergency exit led to the mezzanine level of Tower One.</p><p>The mezzanine was filled with dull-beige concrete dust \u2014 on the floor, in the air, caked against the floor-to-ceiling windows. It felt like we were walking through a huge, dirty snow globe that had just been shaken.</p><p>It was even worse when we walked outside, near Six World Trade Center. The plaza was a minefield of twisted metal, covered by a layer of concrete dust several inches thick. I am grateful for that dust, because it means I didn\u2019t see any bodies.</p><p>As we were leaving the building, my pager buzzed with a message from Al Frank, a reporter with the Newark Star-Ledger who has covered the Port Authority for years.</p><p>10:17 a.m. page from Al Frank: are you okay? I replied a minute later, as we were walking along the outside of Six World Trade: We\u2019ere out of the building. Everyone is fine.</p><p>Relieved but fatigued, we sprinted down the stairs between Six and Five World Trade, then turned up Church Street and headed north.</p><p>I looked back at the Trade Center. The upper third of Tower One was on fire. There was so much smoke and dust, I couldn\u2019t tell that Tower Two had collapsed.</p><p>We continued walking north toward the Holland (Tunnel). A few minutes later, we heard an NYPD officer shout: \u201cRun for your lives!\u201d</p><p>We ran north for several blocks. We felt a deafening rumble, followed by a thick cloud of black smoke and brown dust. One World Trade Center had stayed up for more than 1 hour and 40 minutes after the first attack, enabling thousands of us to escape.</p><p>We walked the remaining blocks to the mouth of the Holland Tunnel. Military jets flew overhead.</p><p>Our clothes, hair and faces still covered with dust, we crammed into Port Authority Police cars, which took us to our temporary offices in Jersey City.</p><p>About an hour later, I wrote the first draft of our first statement after the attacks on the only form of communication I had left \u2014 my interactive pager.</p><p>Our hearts and our prayers go out to the families of the countless people \u2014 including many members of the Port Authority family \u2014 who were killed today in this brutal and cowardly attack. All PA facilities are closed until further notice. We at the PA are doing everything within our power to assist the families of the victims, and to co-operate with federal, state and local authorities to capture the perpetrators of this attack and bring them to justice.</p><p>Our department worked out of Jersey City for more than two months \u2014 at first, in rotating 12-hour shifts.</p><p>I returned to ground zero four days after the attacks. The experience was unnerving and humbling \u2014 not because of what\u2019s there, but what used to be there. I looked up at the hole in the sky where our offices used to be, and thought about how easily we could have been trapped up there.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLJNL-20933434</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLJNL2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63J1-7SB1-JC85-V3K2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8379</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1541\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</copyright><publicationName>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1203\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Main Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 5, 2021 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>CC0004JOZ</classCode><className>ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC0002R94</classCode><className>PORT AUTHORITY OF NEW YORK &amp;

There, he learned that Annie Schmidt, a biologist at Point Blue Conservation Science, was seeking a better way to image a large penguin colony in Antarctica. Schwager, who is an assistant professor of aeronautics and astronautics, saw an opportunity to collaborate, given his work on controlling swarms of autonomous flying robots.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's how, three-and-a-half years later, Schwager's graduate student, Kunal Shah, found himself at the famous McMurdo Station, ready for the first Antarctic test flight of their new multi-drone imaging system, which coordinates the flight of multiple high-end autonomous drones - but can also work with hobby drones.</p><p>The project did not have an auspicious start. \"My hands were freezing. The drone batteries were too cold to work. The drone remote control was too cold. My phone was too cold and was flashing warnings,\" recalled Shah. \"I just thought, 'I'm down here for two-and-a-half months and this is day one.'\"</p><p>Undeterred, Shah and his colleagues quickly adapted and their system, which is the subject of a paper published Oct. 28 in Science Robotics, repeatedly produced detailed visual surveys of approximately 300,000 nesting pairs of Adelie penguins over a 2-square-kilometer area at Cape Crozier - roughly equivalent to the size of the country of Monaco - and another smaller colony of about 3,000 nesting pairs at Cape Royds. Whereas previous human-piloted drone surveys of the Cape Crozier colony took two days, each round of the new survey, completed in collaboration with National Science Foundation (NSF) and U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP), was completed in about two-and-a-half hours, thanks to a route planning algorithm that coordinated two to four autonomous drones and prioritized efficient coverage of the colony.</p><p>\"Just moving all of that equipment down to a remote site and being able to prepare it, field it and deploy it with nothing other than tents and a small warming hut at your disposal, that's really phenomenal,\" said Schwager, who is senior author of the paper but, to his disappointment, was not able to join the field team. \"It really goes to show how practical autonomous robotic systems can be in remote environments.\"</p><p>Speed is essential</p><p>Aerial surveys of penguin colonies have been conducted before, usually with helicopters or a single drone. The helicopter method produces great image quality but is expensive, fuel-inefficient and risks disturbing the birds. The single drone survey is time-consuming and - because the drones must be launched from a safe distance, about five kilometers (three miles) from the colony - difficult to navigate. Another shortcoming of drones is that they must fly to, over and back from the colony with only 12-15 minutes of battery life. The continuous threat of sudden changes in flying conditions further adds to the importance of a fast survey.</p><p>The use of multiple drones circumvents these challenges, and it was made possible by a unique route planning algorithm developed by the Stanford researchers. Given a survey space, the algorithm partitioned the space, assigned destination points to each drone and figured out how to move the drones through those points in the most efficient way, limiting backtracking and redundant travel. One crucial additional requirement was that each drone exit the space at the same place where it entered, which saves precious flight time. The algorithm also maintained a safe, constant, distance from the ground despite the changes in elevation, and had a tunable image overlap percentage to assure a complete survey. Unlike the back-and-forth action of a robotic vacuum, Schwager described the algorithm's paths as \"organic and spidery.\"</p><p>\"The process was quick. What had been just the algorithm's squiggles on a screen the day before turned into a massive image of all the penguins in the colonies,\" said Shah, who is lead author of the paper. \"We could see people walking around the colonies and all the individual birds that were nesting and coming to and from the ocean. It was incredible.\"</p><p>Eyes in the sky</p><p>The researchers envision other uses for their multi-drone system, such as traffic monitoring and tracking wildfires. They've already performed tests in some varied settings. They have flown over a large ranch in Marin, California, to assess the vegetation available for livestock grazing. They also took their drones out to Mono Lake near the California-Nevada border to survey the California gull population that lives near Paoha Island in the lake's center. Like Antarctica, the Mono Lake test had its own challenges - the birds were smaller, the researchers had to boat out to the site before releasing the drones and there was a risk of losing drones in the water (which, fortunately, did not happen).</p><p>For their part, the penguin biologists remain focused on measuring population size, birth rates and nesting density and will conduct a second round of penguin observation this year. Due to the pandemic, however, the Point Blue Conservation Science team will be on their own this time.</p><p>Thinking about the big picture - in the figurative sense - the researchers hope their system stands as evidence for the positive potential of autonomous robots and systems.</p><p>\"Humans could never leap into the sky and count 300,000 penguins or track a forest fire,\" said Schwager. \"I think that teams of autonomous robots can really be powerful in helping us manage our changing world, our changing environment, at a scale that we never could before.\"</p><p>The researchers from Point Blue Conservation Science are also co-authors of the paper.

A California family set off a \"smoke-generating pyrotechnic device,\" causing a fire that is raging through the San Bernardino National Forest. The fire has burned thousands of acres, destroyed countless wildlife and may potentially cause a lot more devastation as the uncontrolled fire continues to burn.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even Jenna Karvunidis, the blogger widely credited with popularizing gender reveal parties, has had enough, writing on Facebook this week: \"Stop having these stupid parties. For the love of God, stop burning things down to tell everyone about your kid's penis. No one cares but you.\"</p><p>In a time of sadness, here's another very sad part of this: The disastrous fire in California is far from the only tragedy that's accompanied the relatively new and perpetually harmful trend of holding such parties.</p><p>We've seen time and again why this practice is pointless at best and dangerous at worst. An Arizona gender reveal party in 2017, in which the expecting father shot an explosive substance at a target, started a wildfire that destroyed 47,000 acres. He was charged and ordered to repay some $8 million in damages. There goes the kid's college fund (and possibly its home and any semblance of nature to play in).</p><p>A gender reveal party in Iowa last year that essentially involved the detonation of a pipe bomb killed a grandmother-to-be. Then there was the guy in 2018 who used his pet alligator to announce the gender of his child by placing a watermelon filled with blue jelly in the creature's mouth, causing a perilous stir and questions about animal abuse.</p><p>Even when gender reveal parties don't cause this kind of overt harm, these examples of death and destruction are still an apt metaphor for the detrimental effects of their deeper cultural message. A pyrotechnical display of pink or blue reflects a toxic glee at boxing our babies into binary gender categories that may not reflect who they are. By slapping a color code on our little ones (and plastering it all over the internet) before they even enter the birth canal, we are removing entirely their sense of agency to develop their own gender identities and to control that identity online. We are completely erasing the spectrum of social and biological diversity when it comes to gender.</p><p>Those who do not fit into the binary gender categories ? whether they are transgender, nonbinary or simply don't fit the stereotypes (I am a perfect example of someone with female genitalia who doesn't feel particularly female and who loathes the color pink, anything frilly, and who will never feel right being addressed as \"ma'am\") ? already face an uphill battle when it comes to navigating the world and finding acceptance and fair treatment. Transgender people are particularly vulnerable to discrimination and violence, and rituals like gender reveal parties only reinforce a system of inequity that marginalizes the trans community.</p><p>Emphasizing the importance of gender assignment at the earliest stages of our lives drives home an assertion that everyone is either male or female and that identity is fixed before you are even born and unalterable from that point on. In truth, both sex and gender are complex. We are a sum total of a matrix of internal and external organs, chromosomes, hormones and cranial makeup. The net result is a much more nuanced, diverse and malleable spectrum than the limited two gender categories we cram everyone into.</p><p>Perhaps the growing pattern of catastrophes surrounding gender reveal parties is a sign from the universe that parents and families ought not to burden our unborn children with binary gender labels before they've even had a chance to take an actual breath of real air.</p><p>Still, if \"this might be a sign\" doesn't do it for you, remember Karvunidis. She's not just telling people to stop throwing these parties now, she regrets having done so herself ? she has compared herself to the \"guy who invented gunpowder.\" Karvunidis, who became famous for inviting friends and family over to unveil a pink cake, has declared that she \"didn't know what we know now? ? that assigning focus on gender at birth leaves out so much of their potential and talents that have nothing to do with what's between their legs.\"</p><p>Celebrating an impending birth can be a blessing and a joy. Why not throw a \"my baby is healthy in the womb reveal party!\" or a \"I am just so excited to be pregnant that I would like to eat cake and celebrate with my nearest and dearest party!\" or a \"I am shamelessly asking everyone for gifts again even though I already hit you up for my engagement party, bridal shower, my wedding, and will again for my baby shower party!\" There is no viable reason why you need to focus solely on your unborn child's genitalia and share that news with the world through stereotypically assigned colors displayed via confetti, surprise cakes or in the worst-case scenario ? fireworks or pyrotechnics.</p><p>Leave our gametes, our fetuses, our growing babies alone. Let them develop their secondary sex characteristics before we try to label them. Hell, here's a novel idea: Let our children enter into the physical world and get to know them a bit before we check boxes and point fingers and order color-coded cakes and tell them who they are. We'd be a richer world for it. Plus, we'd prevent some forest fires.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNCOM-20200908genderrevealpartycaliforniafiredestructionhope1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60SW-64P1-DY60-M02X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266325</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"914\"/><timeReceived>4:40 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNN.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15303\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 8, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Read the original story <url normalizedValue=\"https://e360.yale.edu/features/finding-bright-spots-in-the-global-coral-reef-catastrophe\">here</url>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When ecological genomicist Christian Voolstra started work on corals in Saudi Arabia in 2009, one of the biggest bonuses to his job was scuba diving on the gorgeous reefs. Things have changed. \"I was just back in September and I was shocked,\" says Voolstra, now at the University of Konstanz in Germany. \"There's a lot of rubble. The fish are missing. The colors are missing.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's a sad but now familiar story. In October, the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network released the first-ever <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.unep.org/resources/status-coral-reefs-world-2020\">report collating global statistics on corals</url>, documenting the status of reefs across 12,000 sites in 73 countries over 40 years. Overall, they report, the world has lost 14 percent of its corals from 2009 to 2018 - that's about 11,700 square kilometers of coral wiped out.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"If this had happened to the Amazon, if overnight it had turned white or black, it would be in the news everywhere,\" says Voolstra. \"Because it's underwater, no one notices.\"</p><p>Corals are facing tough times from global warming: Prolonged marine heat waves, which are <url normalizedValue=\"https://e360.yale.edu/features/as-waters-warm-ocean-heatwaves-are-growing-more-severe\">on the rise</url>, cause corals to expel their symbiotic algae (called zooxanthellae), leaving the bleached corals weak and vulnerable. Local pollution continues to be a problem for corals, but global warming is emerging as the predominant threat. In 2018, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/2018/10/08/summary-for-policymakers-of-ipcc-special-report-on-global-warming-of-1-5c-approved-by-governments/\">International Panel on Climate Change</url> reported that 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming would cause global coral reefs to decline by 70-90 percent (warming <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature\">currently stands</url> at 1.2 degrees C). A 2-degree C warmer world would lose more than 99 percent of its corals.</p><p>There are some hints of hope. The Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network report shows that corals can recover globally if given about a decade of reprieve from hot waters. Some spots - particularly the Coral Triangle in East Asia, which hosts nearly a third of global corals - have bucked the trend and seen coral growth. There are hints that corals might be adapting to warmer conditions. And research is burgeoning on creative ways to improve coral restoration, from selectively breeding super corals to spreading probiotics on stressed reefs.</p><p>\"I'm hopeful,\" says Voolstra. But it's going to take a lot of quick action, he says, and even then we won't be able to save all reefs. \"That's impossible. The point is you save some reefs so they can go through the dark ages of climate change.\"</p><p>From 1978, when the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network's data collection began, hard coral on the world's reefs held relatively steady for decades. That changed dramatically in 1998 with the first global mass bleaching event. Warm waters around the world caused in large part by a powerful El Ni\u00f1o wiped out about 8 percent of living coral globally, equivalent to a grand total of 6,500 square kilometers. \"All the drama started in 1998,\" says David Souter, coordinator of the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network and a researcher at the Australian Institute of Marine Science in Townsville. \"Corals are actually pretty good at sustaining short, sharp temperature increases, but when it starts to last months, we see real issues.\"</p><p>Astonishingly, however, by 2010 global coral coverage was roughly back to pre-1998 levels. \"That's good news,\" says Souter. \"Even though reefs got knocked down, they got back up again.\" When \"old growth\" corals are wiped out, the new ones that move in are often faster-growing, weedier species (just as with trees after a forest fire), says Souter. It's great to have this growth, he says, but these opportunistic corals are often more vulnerable to disease, heat, and storms.</p><p>A global decline has largely been the trend since 2010, plunging corals back below 1998 levels. That's due in large part to two more global bleaching events, in 2010 and 2015-2017, from which corals haven't been given enough reprieve. There has been a tiny, 2 percent uptick in live coral since 2019, though it's too soon to say if that might continue. \"If you were a really optimistic person you might say that this occurred even while temperatures are high, so maybe we're seeing adaptation,\" says Souter.</p><p>During the long, relatively stable and healthy period for corals in the 1990s and early 2000s, the average reef was about 30 percent live hard coral and 15 percent macroalgae like seaweeds and turf. That's twice as much coral as algae. Since 2009, that ratio has slipped to about 1.5 as reef macroalgae has boomed by 20 percent. While seaweed also makes for a productive ecosystem, it's not the same as the complex architecture made by reefs, and it supports different fish.</p><p>Encouragingly, the so-called Coral Triangle of the East Asian Seas stands out as a bold exception. This region holds almost a third of the world's coral reefs - and it anomalously hosts more live hard coral and less macroalgae today than in the early 1980s, despite rising water temperatures. That's thought to be thanks to <url normalizedValue=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00227-020-03813-8\">genetic diversity</url> among the region's 600 species of coral, which is allowing corals to adapt to warm waters. \"Perhaps diversity has provided some protection,\" says Souter, while a healthy population of herbivorous fish and urchins are keeping seaweeds down.</p><p>The other three main global regions for coral - the Pacific, holding more than a quarter of the global total; Australia, with 16 percent; and the Caribbean, with 10 percent - all host less coral today than when measurements started. \"The Caribbean is a really tragic and desperate case,\" says Voolstra, with only 50 or so species of coral and a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.agrra.org/coral-disease-outbreak/\">new disease</url> wiping them out.</p><p>It could all be worse, notes Souter. \"Reefs are probably, on average, better off than I thought,\" he says. \"The fact that the reefs retain the ability to bounce back, that's amazing.\"</p><p>In the face of punishing conditions, coral conservationists globally are working to protect corals from pollution and actively restore them. One <url normalizedValue=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0226631\">recent study</url>, led by Lisa Bostr\u00f6m-Einarsson of James Cook University in Australia, trawled through the literature and found more than 360 coral restoration projects across 56 countries. Most are focused on transplanting bits of coral from a flourishing spot to a struggling one, or \"gardening\" baby corals in nurseries and planting them out. They also include innovative efforts like <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263534591_Oyster_Recruitment_and_Growth_on_an_Electrified_Artificial_Reef_Structure_in_Grand_Isle_Louisiana\">using electricity</url> to prompt calcification on artificial reefs (an old but still-controversial idea), and using a diamond blade saw to slice tiny, fast-growing microfragments off slow-growing corals.</p><p>Other researchers are piloting projects to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1qtR2OAVDM\">spray coral larvae</url> onto reefs that need it most - this should be faster and easier than hand-planting corals, but it's unclear yet how many of the larvae survive. \"If it works, it will produce much greater gains more rapidly,\" says Souter.</p><p>Bostr\u00f6m-Einarsson and colleagues found an encouragingly high average survival rate of 66 percent for the restored corals in these 362 projects. But these happy numbers mask more sobering facts. Almost half of the projects were in just a handful of countries; most lasted less than 18 months; and the median size was a tiny 100 square meters. Worse, the coral gains were often temporary. In one case in Indonesia, a three-year project dramatically increased coral cover and fish - which were then decimated by a heat wave six months after the project ended.</p><p>Such efforts are still worthwhile and raise awareness about corals, says Voolstra. But there are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-021-00214-3\">some techniques</url> that could make them far more effective and far bigger in scale.</p><p>One bold strategy is to selectively breed corals to create <url normalizedValue=\"https://e360.yale.edu/features/as_ocean_waters_heat_up_a_quest_to_create_super_corals\">super-strains</url> best adapted to a warmer world - but this work is still very preliminary. \"Corals take longer to breed and raise up than cows, so we have been betting more on finding heat-resistant individuals that are already out there than on making new ones in the lab,\" says Stephen Palumbi at Stanford University, a marine biologist who focuses on corals around the Pacific Island nation of Palau. Palumbi has developed a tank that runs small samples of coral through a heat test on site, and is now working to make it cheaper - in part, he says, by borrowing components from the home brewing industry. Voolstra, too, has developed a tool for on-site stress testing; he was this summer granted $4 million from the <url normalizedValue=\"https://pgafamilyfoundation.org/News/2021/new-coral-grants.aspx\">Paul Allen Foundation</url> to take his effort global.</p><p>Heat tolerance, though, isn't the only thing that corals need. Selecting the ones that can survive the heat might also inadvertently select ones that are less resistant to disease, for example, or slower growing. \"We need to understand this better,\" says Voolstra.</p><p>A different strategy is to tweak the organisms that live in and around corals and help them to grow, including the symbiotic zooxanthellae and bacteria. Getting corals to adopt heat-tolerant zooxanthellae is a great idea that could theoretically have a huge impact, says Voolstra, but it's hard to do. The union is like an intimate marriage, and it's difficult to shift. Changing corals' bacteria, which tend to live on a mucous layer on the outside of the corals, is easier, and seems to boost overall coral health. \"They bleach the same way but recover better,\" says Voolstra. One recent study led by microbiologist Raquel Peixoto from King Abdulla University showed that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abg3088\">lathering corals in probiotics</url> could improve coral survival after a heat wave by 40 percent. \"It's still experimental and proof of concept,\" says Peixoto, who is experimenting with robotic submarines that could drop slow-release probiotic pills onto reefs to release bacteria slowly over weeks.</p><p>A further-flung option being toyed with in Australia is the idea of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.savingthegreatbarrierreef.org/\">brightening clouds</url> over a reef in an attempt to shield them from extreme heat. \"It's totally left field,\" laughs Souter, but should work the same way as cloud seeding for agriculture: A sprayed mist of seawater encourages clouds to form and shields the ground from direct light. This year researchers trialed the idea; they haven't yet published their results. If it works, scaling up would be a massive project: they anticipate they would need a thousand stations with hundreds of sprayers each to lower solar radiation by about <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02290-3\">6.5 percent</url> over the Great Barrier Reef during a heat wave. Questions remain about whether the effort would be worth the energy cost, and what the net effects would be on ecosystems throughout the region.</p><p>A lot more work needs to be done on the real-world utility of these strategies, says Voolstra, to see what actually works. \"Then you put truckloads of money into whatever really makes a difference,\" he says. Different reefs will require different solutions, making all these strategies important, says Peixoto. \"It's all hands on deck.</p><p>In the meantime, Voolstra supports the idea of investing heavily in sanctuaries: spots, like the Northern Red Sea, where corals are already adapted to handling hot waters but are threatened by other factors, like sewage, pollution, construction, and fish farms. Local efforts to tackle non-climate-related hazards for corals can be very effective. The Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System was <url normalizedValue=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/1839/\">taken off</url> the list of World Heritage sites in danger in 2018, for example, after a push to protect that ecosystem and ban oil development.</p><p>If protecting a handful of refugia from humans doesn't seem like a big enough effort, last year researchers also <url normalizedValue=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000823\">launched a project</url> to build an emergency \"Noah's Ark\" for corals across global aquaria, keeping their genetic diversity alive in tanks on land.</p><p>When the IPCC declared in 2018 that 99 percent of corals would be lost in a 2-degree C warmer world, says Voolstra, that was really shocking. The goal now is to whittle that 99 percent down to 90 percent or less, he says, so that reefs have at least a chance of bouncing back. \"Whatever we do, it gets much worse before it gets better.\"</p><p>Nicola Jones is a freelance journalist based in Pemberton, British Columbia, just outside of Vancouver.

Chan School of Public Health.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The U.S. saw a spike in cases last spring, mainly in the Northeast, last summer in the South, and November through January pretty much everywhere. As the nation's death toll from COVID-19 approaches half a million people, public health experts said they dread the possibility of a fourth wave.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We are done with it, but it is not done with us,\" said Luciana Borio, former acting chief scientist of the Food and Drug Administration.</p><p>Three state legislatures lifted mask mandates in recent days, and New York and Massachusetts eased restrictions on restaurant seating in time for Valentine's Day.</p><p>\"It's like we're trying our best to help the virus rather than stopping it,\" said Theodora Hatziioannou, a virologist and research associate professor at the Rockefeller University in New York City.</p><p>More contagious variants of the virus have raced across Europe, South Africa and Latin America. They have all arrived in the U.S., and one first identified in the United Kingdom is likely to be dominant here by the end of next month, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>Peter Hotez, dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said that if the infectiousness and case fatality rate for the variant known as B.1.1.7, turns out to be the same in the U.S. as it is in the U.K., \"I worry we could reach a staggering death toll by the summer and fall.\"</p><p>Another variant, which originated in Southern California, has spread rapidly, although it's not clear whether it's more contagious or more dangerous.</p><p>The two vaccines available, one by Pfizer-BioNTech and the other by Moderna, appear to be effective against these variants, said Hatziioannou, who published a study on the subject.</p><p>But these variants are likely to make targeted drugs such as monoclonal antibodies less effective. They will continue to change and eventually will evade vaccines and diagnostic tests if they keep spreading, she said.</p><p>Now is the time, she and others said, to double-down on precautions, to avoid a deadly fourth wave and finally bring the virus under control.</p><p>\"The best way to mitigate the threat of the strains is to control the virus,\" Borio said. And the best way to control the virus is through the public health tools we have,\" like mask-wearing, hand-washing, avoiding crowds, and vaccination.</p><p>Next few months 'very murky'</p><p>It's difficult to predict what the virus will do over the next few months, said Samuel Scarpino, who conducts infectious disease forecasting at Northeastern University in Boston.</p><p>The variants make estimates more difficult, he said, as do the rising rate of vaccination, the relaxation of some COVID-19 public health measures, the lack of demographic information on who's getting vaccinated and the limited genetic surveillance. \"All those meet together to make it a very murky picture over the next few months,\" he said.</p><p>Under the Biden administration, officials are increasing gene sequencing of virus samples tenfold, hoping to better track the variants.</p><p>More extensive sequencing should give the United States a better sense of where the variants are, how fast they spread and what to do about them, said Gigi Gronvall, a senior scholar and associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.</p><p>Viruses mutate as they reproduce within a person. Some mutations do nothing for the virus, and others lead to its demise. A few improve the virus's ability to reproduce and get rapidly passed through a population.</p><p>Public health officials predicted that but haven't been able to convince leaders or the public to change the trajectory of the pandemic. \"It is so disappointing because it didn't have to be this way,\" said Gronvall, an immunologist.</p><p>She  said that if people give the virus an opportunity, it will take it.</p><p>Double-down on stopping spread</p><p>Legislatures in North Dakota, Iowa and Wisconsin rolled back mask requirements. (Wisconsin's governor reinstated them, but the Legislature promised to remove them again when it meets next week.)</p><p>Gawande said people should wear medical-grade masks instead of often-ill-fitting homemade ones, and he criticized decisions by state legislators to lift requirements.</p><p>\"The mask mandate is the last thing you remove, not the first when your hospitalizations go down,\" he said.</p><p>\"It's just ridiculous,\" Hatziioannou said about allowing restaurants to open for Valentine's Day. COVID-19 cases spiked after every major holiday over the past year.</p><p>Lifting the restrictions sends the signal that if it's OK to eat at a restaurant, it must be OK to eat at grandma's house, she said, but  neither is safe.</p><p>Slightly easing regulations - allowing restaurants to be 40% full instead of 25% - won't change the nation's quality of life, Scarpino said.</p><p>A fourth wave would be far less likely, he said, if people get vaccinated when they become eligible and carefully follow public health measures such as mask-wearing and avoiding crowds.</p><p>\"Then,\" he said, \"we can imagine a scenario in which this is all behind us.\"</p><p>There's a chance to end the outbreak, Scarpino said, if people double-down.</p><p>If restrictions are lifted too early, the virus will bounce back. Vaccines offer a way out of that scenario but only if people take them and can get them in time to prevent a fourth wave, Scarpino said.</p><p>Thomas Balcezak, chief medical officer of Yale New Haven Health in Connecticut, views the virus like a forest fire and every tree/person as potential fuel for the flames. \"Every time you vaccinate someone, you remove that potential fuel,\" he said. \"If you vaccinate enough people, you can create a fire break, where there just isn't any more fuel for that fire.\"</p><p>The faster the population is vaccinated, \"the faster we can reduce the possibility of new strains emerging,\" he said. \"This has been a marathon, and now it's kind of a race to the finish.\"</p><p>Eric Topol, founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in California, said coping with the variants could be the last major challenge of the pandemic. \"If we get through this intact, we're looking good, unless a new freak of nature comes up,\" he said. \"We've got this if we can get through this potential onslaught. But (the virus) needs to be fully respected.\"</p><p>Health and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.
