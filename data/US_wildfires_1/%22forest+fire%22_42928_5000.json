So there isn\u2019t this historic knowledge of how to deal with drought situations that you could find in countries further south in Europe.\u201d</p><p>SMHI says southern Sweden received very little rain in May and not a single drop so far in June, leaving the soil exceptionally dry. The agency says the risk of wildfires is now \u201cextremely high\u201d in the southern half of the country, including the Stockholm region, and even though there\u2019s some rain in the forecast this weekend, it\u2019s unlikely enough to have a significant impact, Hjerdt said.</p><p>In neighboring Finland, the Finnish Meteorological Institute this week warned of dry terrain and a \u201chigh risk\u201d of forest fires in most of the country, with a \u201cvery high risk\u201d in southwestern Finland and the Aaland islands in the Baltic Sea. Both Sweden and Finland are mostly covered by forests.</p><p>Similar warnings have been issued in Norway, Denmark and the Baltic countries while Scotland has put in place its fourth wildfire warning in three weeks. Campfires are banned or discouraged in affected areas.</p><p>Experts say the drought could be related to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/el-nino-climate-global-warming-world-weather-6eb70f36ce098d931cfcdb82590c4066\">transition of La Nina to El Nino</url> climatic conditions in the Pacific, which shifts weather patterns across the world, and often leads to dry summers in northern Europe.</p><p>Hjerdt said it's too early to draw any <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/climate-change-carbon-dioxide-hawaii-warming-194da356db37ff4d465c6ffebdf0e3fb\">link to climate change</url> but added that in general, a warming climate is making the Nordic region more vulnerable to forest fires by making summers longer and winters shorter, prolonging the \u201cvegetative\u201d season when most precipitation evaporates or transpires rather than sinking deeper into the ground.</p><p>Temperatures are heating up in the region and are expected to hit 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit) in coming days in Finland \u2014 rare for a country straddling the Arctic Circle.</p><p>\u201cThe heat wave can stay on the surface for next week as well and spread all the way to Lapland,\u201d said the Finnish institute\u2019s meteorologist Tuomo Bergman, referring to Finland\u2019s northernmost area. No substantial rain was expected in Finland until around Midsummer, June 24, he said, when traditional bonfires will be banned.</p><p>Denmark\u2019s farming minister, Jacob Jensen, said that \u201cthe drought has already had a major impact on our agriculture in the past few weeks, and with the prospect of a summer without rain, we will have to have a clear plan for how we can help agriculture in the best possible way.\u201d</p><p>The Federation of Swedish Farmers said the drought had already affected grassland crops and could have an impact on cereals.</p><p>\u201cIf there is no rain soon, future harvests will suffer,\u201d the industry group said in a statement. It noted that due to the hot and dry summer of 2018, the industry lost almost the entire grain harvest at a cost of approximately 10 billion Swedish kronor ($1.2 billion).</p><p>Globally, the month of May was a joint-second warmest May on record, according to the European Commission\u2019s Copernicus Climate Change Service, with temperatures in Canada and the northern United States particularly warm. Canada saw major wildfires that <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/wildfires-new-york-air-quality-india-china-3cd09fe655838c0890e9395de8900f3f\">sent hazardous haze deep into the U.S</url>.</p><p>In Europe, May was drier than average in southern Scandinavia, the Baltic countries and western Russia, Copernicus said. Meanwhile, most of Southern Europe except Spain and Portugal saw wetter than average conditions, with <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/italy-floods-rain-climate-alps-drought-393406ca037aef08faf0733604d93965\">severe floods in northern Italy.</url></p><p>Parts of the Balkans are now experiencing heavy floods caused by strong and persistent rain. Highways and roads have been closed in Serbia and Montenegro due to landslides, some bridges have collapsed and hundreds of people have been rescued from flooded homes and cars.</p><p>The southwestern part of Europe has been much drier. <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/spain-portugal-north-africa-heat-wave-climate-change-df1acded341ca106af0877e4b9a33a82\">This spring in Spain was the hottest</url> \u2013 and the second-driest \u2013 on record for the country. That has created conditions for wildfires breaking out early this year and the need for restrictions on water for agriculture, industry and filling private swimming pools in the hardest-hit areas.</p><p>In mainland France, the water resources are still feeling the effects of a drought last summer, with two-thirds of the national water tables below normal levels. Localized forest fires have broken out in parts of France including regions such as Lorraine and Vosges where extreme heat and forest fires are rare.</p><p>Sweden saw the worst forest fires in its modern history <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/5eb7cc43f3d6427291c84dc3b11365b3\">in 2018</url> during an unusually dry and warm summer. The wildfires also affected Denmark, Finland and Norway.</p><p>\u201dWe are currently in a serious situation, it is similar to the one that prevailed before the summer of 2018,\u201d Sweden's Civil Defense Minister Carl-Oskar Bohlin said Thursday, adding airborne firefighting units were on standby.</p><p>___</p><p>Ritter reported from Stockholm.

While she\u2019ll continue to develop and measure the impact of wellness programs for clients, she\u2019ll also manage emission-reduction strategies for the company and work with clients on their sustainability efforts around events. Riggs serves on the Net-Zero Carbon Events Measurement Working Group, the Events Industry Council APEX Commission, and the Global Wellness Institute\u2019s Workplace Wellbeing Working Group.We asked Riggs about her new role and where Maritz stands in its efforts to reach net-zero emissions over the coming decades.MeetingsNet:   In December 2021, Maritz Global Events signed the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.meetingsnet.com/sustainability/next-steps-net-zero-carbon-events-campaign\">Net-Zero Carbon Events Pledge</url> . As a company, what areas have seen the most progress toward sustainability since that time?</p><p> And do you have a particular focus for 2023?Rachel Riggs: Our Net-Zero Pledge gave us the opportunity to create awareness within our company and plan what we need to do move down the path to Net Zero.   There is a lot of work to be done, and it all starts with awareness and education.   In 2022, we measured our own carbon footprint and now with that baseline; our focus in 2023 is developing specific strategies for reduction.   MN:   For Maritz Global Events clients who want to design more sustainable meetings, what do you see as the biggest roadblocks?Rachel Riggs: I think the biggest roadblock is the lack of education in our industry. We need to share more of the big picture on why everyone needs to fully embrace these efforts.   While we understand the ultimate \u201cwhy\" is for our planet, we need to share more of the reasons for eliminating certain elements or doing things differently.   We all need to do this together, and if people have a full understanding, they will be more motivated to act.MN:   Before taking the job of   general manager, environmental strategy, your focus was on wellbeing at events. Is there a connection between the two roles?Rachel Riggs: Yes,   in my role as wellbeing leader, we brought to life the five dimensions of wellbeing   (read the ebook   <url normalizedValue=\"https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/ysTdCOYEZru50ppQ2HEKnT8?domain=info.maritzglobalevents.com\">here</url> ), and one of the dimensions is environmental wellbeing.   For humans to perform at their peak,   they need to have all five dimensions in balance.   If we don\u2019t have a healthy planet,   then none of it really works.   Think about this example:   if your house   burns   down because of   a forest fire, can you operate at your fullest potential and care for the rest of your wellbeing?   No,   because   you are worried about how to   find shelter and   live. So,   we need   our   environmental wellbeing first.   MN:   What would someone be surprised to learn about you?   Rachel Riggs: I have run five   half marathons and one triathlon.   When I was 17,   I was in a car accident and   was subsequently   told I could not have children or run again.   Fast forward to today:   I have two amazing daughters. When they were about   five years   old,   I started thinking about   accomplishing a run.   So, I decided to run a half marathon\u2014why not?   At the time,   I worked for the Vancouver DMO and Lululemon   sponsored   a half marathon   there.   I asked my boss if I could create an experience around it and invited   clients to run/walk with me. Happy to report   that   I recruited over 70 people to walk/run with me over six years of hosting this experience.   Not only did I do it (which was awesome), I had friends that crushed their life goals as well. I will forever be connected with these people,   as many of us did not think we could do this,   but we did!</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTGNET-689869</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTGNET2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67FK-0JT1-DY2V-D00N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">371242</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-02-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"606\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Informa Business Media, Inc.

Bell Textron Inc. model 212 helicopter was conducting operations in support of forest fire fighting efforts near Evansburg, Alberta. The helicopter was approaching the landing area to pick up a group of firefighters when one of the main rotor blades separated from the rotor head assembly. The second rotor blade and rotor head assembly then broke free from the helicopter and the helicopter crashed. The pilot, the sole occupant on board, was fatally injured. There was a post-impact fire that destroyed the helicopter.</p><p>The investigation determined that one of the main rotor hub strap retaining pins--a flight safety-critical aircraft part--was manufactured from a type of steel that was weaker than the steel required by design. As a result, the pin failed in flight and the associated main rotor blade separated from the helicopter. For undetermined reasons, the quality control systems in place at the pin's manufacturer did not identify the non-conforming main rotor hub strap retaining pins; consequently, the pins were not removed from the supply chain.</p><p>After the occurrence, Bell Textron Inc. issued four alert service bulletins requiring the review of the aircraft's technical record to determine if any non-conforming main rotor hub strap retaining pins were installed on model 204B, 205, 205B, and 212 helicopter fleets. If non-conforming pins were installed, they were to be replaced with conforming pins. Transport Canada issued an emergency airworthiness directive (CF-2021-23) mandating compliance with the Bell Textron Inc. alert service bulletins, as did the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the European Aviation Safety Administration.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tsb.gc.ca/eng/medias-media/communiques/aviation/2022/a21w0045-20220907.html\">https://www.tsb.gc.ca/eng/medias-media/communiques/aviation/2022/a21w0045-20220907.html</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7938461 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7938461</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66BG-KKF1-JC11-11JR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"372\"/><timeReceived>8:51 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"09\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>September 8, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news reporting from Beijing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"The suppression of forest wood burning has been one of the important research directions in the field of solid combustible fire safety. The process of forest wood flame propagation is a coupled process of solid-phase pyrolysis and gas-phase combustion chemical reactions; therefore, as long as the solid-phase pyrolysis or gas-phase combustion can be suppressed, the forest wood flame propagation can be suppressed and an important contribution can be made to the subsequent suppression of forest wood fires.\" </p><p><br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from the Beijing Institute of Technology, \"Previous studies have focused on the inhibition of solid-phase pyrolysis of forest wood, so this paper examines the effectiveness of several common fire suppressants for suppressing forest wood gas-phase flames, starting with the inhibition of forest wood gas-phase combustion. In this paper, for the convenience of the study, we narrowed the scope of the research object to the previous research ideas for gas fires, established a simplified small-scale flame model for forest wood fire suppression, took red pine wood as the research object, analyzed the pyrolysis gas components after high-temperature pyrolysis, and constructed a Cup burner suitable for N2, CO2, fine water mist, and NH4H2PO4 powder to extinguish the pyrolysis gas flame of red pine wood, respectively. The experimental system, together with the 9306 fogging system and the improved powder delivery control system, shows the process of extinguishing fuel flames such as red pine pyrolysis gas at 350, 450, and 550 degrees C with various types of fire-extinguishing agents on this device. It was found that the flame morphology was related to the composition of the gas and the type of extinguishing agent. At the same time, NH4H2PO4 powder appeared to burn above the cup mouth when pyrolysis gas interacted with it at 450 degrees C, but this phenomenon did not occur when other extinguishing agents interacted with it and only appeared when pyrolysis gas interacted with it at 450 degrees C, so it was judged that this phenomenon was related to the CO2 content of the gas component and the type of extinguishing agent. The study found that the four extinguishing agents extinguish red pine pyrolysis gas flame MEC value. There's a big difference. The worst performance is N2. Compared with N2 suppression of red pine pyrolysis gas flame, CO2 suppression effectiveness is 60% higher, but compared to the suppression effectiveness of fine water mist and far away, the suppression effectiveness of fine water mist is much higher than the suppression effectiveness of CO2. However, the difference in effectiveness between fine water mist and NH4H2PO4 powder is almost double. In summary, in the suppression of red pine gas-phase flame, four kinds of fire-extinguishing agents are ranked as follows: N2 &lt; CO2 &lt; fine water mist &lt; NH4H2PO4 powder. Finally, the suppression mechanism of each type of extinguishing agent was analyzed.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The study of this paper can provide some data to support the extinguishing of open fires in forest fires or suppressing the rate of forest fire spread.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Study On the Minimum Fire-extinguishing Concentration of Several Commonly Used Extinguishing Agents To Suppress Pyrolysis Gas of Red Pine Wood.

We have a number of them here with us today.</p><p>\"I also do have some significant concerns.</p><p>\"In the last two years, Congress has provided over 10 billion additional dollars to the Forest Service.</p><p>\"The budget proposes massive increases in new spending.</p><p>\"Your request for $7.4 billion in discretionary appropriations would amount to a 52 percent increase over current funding levels.</p><p>\"In an era of historic budget deficits, the Forest Service really needs to prioritize.</p><p>\"To be clear, the Forest Service faces enormous challenges in the fight against wildfires.</p><p>\"One-third of our National Forests are at serious risk to being consumed by catastrophic fires.</p><p>\"There is broad agreement among members of this committee - both sides of the aisle - that the historic forest fire treatment levels are totally inadequate to meet the challenge.</p><p>\"While I support robust funding for the efforts, I'm not convinced that we can simply just spend our way out of problems that have plagued our forests for decades.</p><p>\"The Forest Service needs to fully embrace efforts to streamline its processes for approving projects that improve forest health.</p><p>\"The agency needs to more aggressively defend against harmful litigation that prevents projects from moving forward.</p><p>\"Far too often, when extreme environmental groups sue, vital wildfire reduction projects get tied up in the court and don't get accomplished.</p><p>\"I'm also deeply troubled by what appears to be the intentional exclusion of Wyoming from major Forest Service initiatives aimed at reducing wildfire risk.</p><p>\"In its 10-year strategy to combat the wildfire crisis, the agency has announced significant spending across 21 designated areas.</p><p>\"These dollars fund projects that are critical for reducing wildfire risk, and defending America's forests.</p><p>\"They're going to protect people's lives and livelihoods.</p><p>\"Inexplicably, Wyoming is the only state located on or west of the Rocky Mountains that has not received funding under this strategy - the only state of all of those.</p><p>\"Further, Wyoming is the only western state to be excluded from the Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management Commission.</p><p>\"This is a commission created by Congress to help improve strategies to prevent, to manage, to suppress, and to recover from wildfires.</p><p>\"That's why in March of last year, I, along with the rest of the Wyoming delegation, sent a letter specifically requesting that Wyoming be represented on the Commission.</p><p>\"Here we are, a year later, Wyoming is still not represented.</p><p>\"This is a pattern of neglect that simply must change.</p><p>\"Much like other western states, Wyoming is highly vulnerable to wildfires.</p><p>\"According to the Forest Service estimates, more than four million acres of Wyoming's forests are at either high or very high risk to catastrophic wildfires.</p><p>\"And we've seen the tragic results of the failure to properly manage these acres.</p><p>\"In four of the past five years, Wyoming has been hit by numerous destructive fires.</p><p>\"In 2020 alone, we experienced nearly 340 thousand burned acres.... We're talking about a large area of land.</p><p>\"Today, our communities remain in harm's way.</p><p>\"According to the Forest Service's website WildfireRisk.org, towns in Wyoming, like Dubois, Jackson, Buffalo, Lander, and Saratoga are all at high risk to destructive wildfires.</p><p>\"I believe the people of Wyoming deserve better protection.</p><p>\"And, at the very least, they deserve the same protections that every other western state is getting.</p><p>\"Thanks so much, Madame Chairman, and I look forward to the questions and hearing today.\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.energy.senate.gov/2023/4/barrasso-the-people-of-wyoming-deserve-better-wildfire-protection\">https://www.energy.senate.gov/2023/4/barrasso-the-people-of-wyoming-deserve-better-wildfire-protection</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-8131068 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8131068</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6822-8361-JC11-119S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"795\"/><timeReceived>9:40 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"04\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>April 19, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

(Mike De Sisti/Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel via AP)  </p><p><br/>In Detroit, where air pollution was worse than any other city in the world Thursday, a basement coffee shop became a bunker from the smoke. One Washington summer camp forbade children from an outdoor pool and kept them inside. On a third-straight day of heavy haze in Chicago, an improvement in air quality meant it was merely 'unhealthy' to venture outside, rather than 'very unhealthy.' <br/>The latest disruptions made it all the more clear: Record-setting, out-of-control Canadian wildfires will not be put out any time soon, meaning more Americans than ever face continuing threats of dangerously poor air quality this summer. <br/>Put differently: The United States could be in for a summer of smoke. <br/>'The number of people that are exposed is unprecedented in the modern era,' said Michael Wara, an energy and climate policy expert at Stanford University. <br/>Air quality alerts covered all or parts of 23 U.S. states Thursday, from Colorado to Vermont, Wisconsin to Georgia. And while residents of Western states have grown accustomed to adjusting their lives to wildfire smoke, Easterners are still adapting to the reality that sooty skies can be a repeated hazard. <br/>As climate change increases the frequency and intensity of wildfires worldwide, unrelenting spring heat and dry weather have fueled Canada's worst fire season ever observed. That means northerly summer breezes that would normally bring a break from heat waves will carry noxious smoke across the northern U.S.border as long as the fires continue to burn. <br/>'The air quality is worse than Beijing,' said Liz Alford, 36, a federal worker who found refuge in Coffee Down Under, a basement coffee shop in downtown Detroit. 'On my way in, I couldn't even see the cell towers.' <br/>ADVERTISEMENT <br/>Aboveground, the air was dark and thick, and many older residents wore N95 masks. In Cadillac Square, the giant touch screens that usually help tourists find fun events instead displayed air warnings and notices that outdoor movies, children's events and yoga classes might be canceled. <br/>The Capitol dome is a hazy shape as smoke from Canadian wildfires descends on the region. (Washington Post photo by Bill O'Leary)  <br/>Code Red air quality spread across the D.C. area Thursday for the second time this month. Unlike an intrusion of wildfire smoke that hit in early June, which occurred toward the end of the school year, the latest episode coincides with summer camps now underway. <br/>'It's such a challenge because so much of camp is about the outdoors and getting kids outside,' said Drew Mackay, director of the summer program at Beauvoir, an elementary school at Washington National Cathedral. Mackay said that on Code Red days, campers are limited to no more than 10 minutes outside at a time and outdoor swimming is canceled. <br/>'This seems new and I'm afraid it might become the new normal,' Mackay said. <br/>Washington's air quality was among the worst for major cities around the world Thursday, along with Detroit, Chicago, Minneapolis and New York. The air was worse in Detroit and Washington than in Lahore, Pakistan; Dubai; and Shenyang, China, according to IQAir. <br/>Air quality reached Code Purple, considered 'very unhealthy' for the general public, in places such as Canton, Ohio; Pittsburgh; and Madison, Wis.<br/>The smoke was so far-reaching and concentrated simply because of the volume emanating from Canada - and because summer weather patterns prevent it from dissipating quickly. <br/>Hundreds of large fires are burning, half of which the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre lists as 'out of control,' with 31,000 square miles already torched this year, an area larger than South Carolina. <br/>Together, a high pressure system swirling clockwise over the Tennessee Valley and remnants of an area of low pressure circulating counterclockwise over the Great Lakes were acting like a conveyor belt, pumping from Canada into the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic. Such weather patterns can act 'just like a funnel' for smoke, said Christine Wiedinmyer, an atmospheric chemist at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences at the University of Colorado at Boulder. <br/>The Chicago skyline view from a South Side beach on Thursday. The city has been under air quality alerts for days as fires burn in Canada. (Washington Post photo by Joshua Lott)  <br/>And with so much smoke, it can be slow to clear up quickly, Wiedinmyer said. Major differences in temperature and pressure are needed to fuel strong winds, but at this time of year, with summer in full swing in the Northern Hemisphere, that sort of rapid flow is missing, <br/>'You need a lot of mixing and time for the plumes to spread out and to diffuse,' she said. <br/>Greg Carbin, chief of forecast operations for the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center, said that while air quality conditions are forecast to improve by the weekend in the eastern part of the country, more smoke incursions will be ahead. The next one could target New England after the Fourth of July, he said. <br/>'Smoke is going to continue to be around in the atmosphere,' Carbin said. 'The Northern states are far more likely to be influenced by occasional bouts of poor air quality.' <br/>Air quality is forecast to begin to improve for most of the country Friday and into the weekend, as the flow of smoky air into the eastern U.S. from the north and northwest is replaced by cleaner air coming from the south and southwest. With that will also come increased humidity and daily thunderstorm chances. <br/>Heavy rainfall can help 'mop up' smoke from the air, dramatically improving air quality by removing particles that stick to water droplets as they condense, Wara said. <br/>But more smoke could blow in before long, and there is no sign that Canadian wildfires will let up before snow arrives, he said. <br/>'There could be some very smoky days ahead,' he said. 'This is the future, unfortunately.' <br/>ADVERTISEMENT <br/>- - - <br/>The Washington Post's Emily Wax-Thibodeaux, Kim Bellware, Justine McDaniel and Dan Stillman contributed to this report. <br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.adn.com/nation-world/2023/06/29/millions-face-a-relentless-summer-of-smoke-that-wont-end-anytime-soon/\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-AKDP122734168808954249525876100124</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AKDP-122734</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68KB-C9F1-JCMN-Y2JW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1056\"/><timeReceived>1:45 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

Invest Alberta will provide Steeper with support to build connections with project stakeholders, optimize potential incentives, advise regarding regulatory requirements, and communicate the impact that this project will have on Alberta's ever-expanding renewable energy landscape. It is anticipated that the project will spur economic growth, create high-quality and sustainable job opportunities within local and Indigenous communities, and further diversify Alberta's renewable technologies sector, reinforcing its status as a global innovation hub. <br/>Next steps <br/>Steeper's first commercial plant will focus on the use of third generation biomass, which is the most prolifically available on the planet and includes wastes that have no or little commercial value, are not used as a food, and do not displace food-growing land. Examples of this are non-commercial forestry waste such as treetops, limbs, bark and sawdust, bagasse (sugar-cane waste) the biogenic portion of urban waste, and corn stover (all the non-kernel portion of corn production). In Alberta, Steeper's first plant will specifically focus on the large volumes of forestry waste that would otherwise need to be burned to manage forest fire risk. <br/>Steeper is actively identifying potential commercial partners and evaluating sites for construction of this project. This MOU aligns with efforts already underway in relation to activity under Emissions Reduction Alberta (ERA) where Steeper was awarded $5 million in funding in 2021 focused on establishing a first commercial scale plant in Alberta. <br/>The Steeper backstory <br/>Steeper's Hydrofaction technology is a proprietary form of Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL) which over Steeper's 12-year history has been proven capable of converting a wide range of biowaste feedstocks to flexible renewable biocrude. Hydrofaction biocrude can be used directly or upgraded for use as a renewable marine, diesel, or aviation fuel <br/>Over the past 12 years, Steeper's Hydrofaction has undergone extensive validation through various stages of continuous pilot and demonstration-scale plant operations. The renewable fuels produced aligns with global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and further solidifies Alberta's commitment to advancing the clean technology sector. <br/>Reaction from the stakeholders <br/>Rick Christiaanse, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Invest Alberta, said:'Steeper's technology represents an innovative way to transform biomass into usable, renewable biocrude, which can then be used as a clean fuel source. The commercialization of this technology within Alberta could help diversify the province's energy sector and strengthen our position as an international leader in responsible energy production.' <br/>Bevan May, President, Steeper Energy, said:'Steeper Energy looks forward to working with Invest Alberta, as their support will be important to expedite the pathway to a first commercial project. Alberta is globally an ideal location for a first-of-kind Hydrofaction commercial project due to the availability of biomass feedstocks, and Alberta's deep talent pool and pedigree in energy processing technologies and markets. Alberta's clear desire to be a leader in energy transition combined with federal Clean Fuels Regulations and recent investments all are catalysts to help Steeper achieve our broader goals.' <br/>What is Hydrothermal liquefaction <br/>Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) applies supercritical water as a reaction medium for the conversion of biomass directly into a high-energy density renewable biocrude oil. Steeper's unique Hydrofaction process mimics and accelerates nature by subjecting wet biomass to heat and high pressure. The process conditions are carefully chosen to promote reaction pathways that favor high yields of high-quality renewable oil. With Steeper's Hydrofaction technology it is possible to convert up to 85% of incoming biomass on an energy basis, making it one of the most effective conversion technologies available. <br/>About Steeper Energy <br/>To learn more about Steeper Energy or TOM Capital, visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.steeperenergy.com\">www.steeperenergy.com</url>[1] or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.tomcapital.com\">www.tomcapital.com</url>[2] respectively. <br/>About Invest Alberta <br/>Invest Alberta is engaging the world and providing high-end tailored support to companies, investors, and major new projects.

A bold accusation, I realize, but nobody makes that many paintings, drawings, and photographs of fire without some buried lust for the real deal. By the time I left \"Ed Ruscha / Now Then,\" an XXL retrospective at MOMA comprising some two hundred works produced between the Eisenhower years and the present, I had lost count of the burning things, which are as lowbrow as a diner and as la-di-da as the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The title of Ruscha's 1964 photo series, \"Various Small Fires and Milk,\" could have been, minus the milk, a reasonable title for the exhibition itself, if he hadn't painted various large ones, too.</p><p>The strangest thing about these fires, other than their quantity, is their calm. There are no people running out of LACMA, and if there were you get the feeling they'd be fine. Tranquillity, often simple but rarely simpleminded, may be Ruscha's essential quality as an artist. His work-preoccupied with mass media, the mother tongue of the twentieth century-is universal yet cozily regional, a trick he pulls off because the region in question is Los Angeles, where much of the world's mass media is born. Other postwar artists spoke a similar dialect, but Ruscha's best work has a coiled concision that makes Andy Warhol, Jasper Johns, and Robert Rauschenberg seem heavy-handed. \"Large Trademark with Eight Spotlights\" (1962), a half painting, half drawing of the Twentieth Century Fox logo, is as flashy as the film industry but as devil-may-care as a shrug; everything flows from (and back to) the half-assed pencil scrawls in the lower right corner. You're charmed by something you see straight through.</p><p>Like many notable Angelenos, Ruscha (pronounced \"rew-shay\") comes from somewhere else: Omaha, in this case, though he spent most of his childhood in Oklahoma City. An acceptance letter from the Chouinard Art Institute brought him West in 1956, when he was a teen-ager. By the sixties, he had assembled the tool kit he still uses today: bright colors, logos recognizable even when fragmented, language that could mean any number of things but is also a thing itself. For a while, he had a job as a sign painter, and it shows: sometimes his early work contains familiar pop-culture artifacts and sometimes it doesn't, but it always speaks in the booming voice of the billboard. Communication-usually represented by a single, titular word in a monochrome field-is a physical act. Whether the word is bluntly English (\"Boss,\" 1961) or fancily French (\"Metropolitain,\" from the same year) or slyly allusive (\"Annie,\" from 1962, featuring the typeface of the \"Little Orphan Annie\" comic), the paint is slopped or scratched across the picture plane. Words signify the wrong thing, or nothing in particular. \"Annie\" is orphaned from the rest of its title. \"Boss\" presides over an office of zero.</p><p>Language, for Ruscha, isn't sacred; it's just another glitchy technology. This might explain his tranquillity-if something as simple as the alphabet is prone to error, why expect perfection from anything? What many artists claim, with a big to-do, to \"interrogate\"-namely, the fact that American consumer culture is a flimsy lie, forever breaking down in big and little ways-Ruscha accepts with a wave of his hand. In \"Norm's, La Cienega, on Fire\" (1964), the orange-on-white letters of the famous roadside chain smile their endless smile, oblivious of the rather abnormal flames below. Language and, indeed, the entire national order seem perpetually on the verge of collapse, yet never actually collapse. We might as well enjoy them, glitches and all.</p><p>If you think you hate conceptual art, see this show. Chances are you hate bad conceptual art. Ruscha made drawings using gunpowder and paintings of maple syrup and beans, but few image-makers have so rarely lapsed into gimmickry, and even fewer have got such consistent laughs. My favorite Ruscha, \"America's Future\" (1979), looks like a cheesy, State of the Union-ready metaphor: a painting of a molten sunrise over a sleepy landscape. It's actually seven or eight cheesy metaphors, with a sprinkling of puns on top. The sunrise might be a sunset, or, California being California and Ruscha being Ruscha, a forest fire. The fire might advertise purity, or excitement (\"America's on fire!\u00a0\"), or vulgar spectacle-this was the seventies, the golden age of disaster movies. At the center of the picture, the small white letters of \"AMERICA'S FUTURE\" stare down at the world like the Hollywood sign, or a shining city on a hill. The line isn't a caption, exactly, nor is it at one with the scenery; it's awkwardly in-between, a phrase without a country.</p><p>I could gnaw on this image, and at least a dozen others on display, all day. Like Magritte, Ruscha delights in posing riddles using the most unpretentious material, daring you to solve them and teasing you for trying. (His opposite in this sense is Johns, whose reputation as a Very Intellectual Artist is partly due to a willingness to make critic-pandering homages to Duchamp, Leonardo, and Picasso.) Ruscha's photographs-deliberately graceless taxonomies of parking lots, swimming pools, palm trees, and the like-seem thin by comparison, lacking the paintings' dialectic of innocence and wit. \"Royal Road Test\" (1967), arguably his most famous photo series, is a kind of forensic investigation into the murder of a typewriter thrown from a car on Interstate 15. Instead of staring out to the mountains or up at the big, glorious sky, Ruscha and his friends look down, searching for fragments of the ruined machine. The great novelist Tom McCarthy would have you believe that the series represents \"a 'primal scene' of modern writing,\" but it strikes me as a dated and largely negative achievement, more interesting for what it rejects-the romance of the West and the shiny new highway-than for what it represents. \"On the Road\" isn't the succulent prey that it once was.</p><p>Conceptual art has a bad habit of bloating with fame. You can see it in Warhol, Rauschenberg, and Dan Flavin: the showmanship soars but the ideas stagnate. Whatever the flaws in his later work, Ruscha refused to let this happen. He looked like a movie star and dated a few, including Diane Keaton, but he never clouded the viewer's gaze with charisma. With the obvious exception of \"Chocolate Room\" (1970)-a candy-coated installation that is the biggest, and worst, piece in this show-he never uses scale as a proxy for importance, either. Language remains a bottomless well of inspiration, keeping the work impressively lean. In recent years, his wordplay has become more enigmatic and less overtly tied to mass media. Still, in the small acrylic painting \"Metro, Petro, Neuro, Psycho\" (2022), featuring those words superimposed on a grassy view near Ruscha's studio, you can detect the same sphinxlike intelligence that brought you \"Annie\" sixty years earlier.</p><p>And yet \"Now Then\" does fall off in its second half-it doesn't bloat, but entire rooms stall. Sentimentality, usually pleasantly repressed in Ruscha's work, is always threatening to burst through. Sometimes (as in \"America's Future\") he cancels out one cloying feeling with an equal but opposite one; elsewhere, he fights feeling with form (photographing big, sunny California in banal black-and-white). When he loses, it can be good news: in the exhibition's most moving work, the tersely bleak words \"Wen out for cigrets n never came back\" float over a glowing nighttime city. But for every image like this there's a wall of gloom or schlock. Beginning in the Reagan years, Ruscha made a series of airbrushed, mostly black-and-white paintings of dour subjects: a clock, a pair of ships rolling in the ocean, a silhouetted elephant, the words \"the end.\" I'd trade them all for a giant neon sign that reads \"MEMENTO MORI.\" And there's simply nothing good to say about \"Our Flag,\" Ruscha's 2017 painting of a tattered Stars and Stripes fluttering in the breeze. (For once, his pyromania deserts him.) Sometimes a cheesy metaphor is just a cheesy metaphor.</p><p>What happened? Part of the problem is that almost no one made good political art the year Trump was inaugurated. As for the rest, I yield the floor to Ruscha's sharpest critic, the late Dave Hickey: \"Ruscha is not really 'behind' his work at all. In a rhetorical sense he's standing right beside us, gazing at his findings as quizzically as we are, occasionally glancing over and raising an eyebrow, going, 'Huh? Whadda ya think?' So to participate we need only feel that he is playing fair with us, that the language which informs the work is presented and not asserted, not fashioned but found.\"</p><p>When Hickey wrote those words, in 1988, both he and Ruscha could take for granted the existence of a rich American mass culture: comic books and blockbusters and jingles that everyone knew by heart because they couldn't skip the commercials. Even when Ruscha didn't explicitly acknowledge this stuff, he knew how to mimic its voice and trusted his audience to follow along. In the past thirty-five years, America's monoculture has shattered into a thousand subcultures, putting Ruscha in a bind. When he tries to respond to the shattering (\"Our Flag\"), his art smacks of meek desperation; when he doesn't (\"Metro, Petro, Neuro, Psycho\"), his art feels too fashioned, a private murmur instead of the roar of the billboard. He turns eighty-six this December. The talent hasn't gone anywhere, but the monoculture-his theme, his muse, and his one true medium-played a nasty trick on us all. First it got us hooked, then it wen out for cigrets n never came back.\u00a0 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWYRK-0028792X_1023_25</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWYRK2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69GC-HJK1-JCDF-K35R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">237442</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1601\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Conde Nast Publications, Inc.

After exhaustive searches for other fires which included crews on the ground and aerial detection flights no other fires have been discovered. The crew will continue to mop up the Hound Dog fire this morning and are expected to begin the hike out later today.</p><p>On the morning of July 31, responding resources were able to gain access into Incident 281, located in the Thielsen Wilderness, and began work. The Incident Commander for Incident 281 requested aviation assistance and a type 2 helicopter was dispatched to assist firefighters with bucket drops and a sling load of supplies. Fire crews were able to contain 281 on July 31. The crew remained in place overnight and will reengage in this morning.</p><p>The remainder of North Zone fire resources patrolled the district and assisted in helicopter support while remaining ready for Initial Attack response. No new fires were reported by end of the day.</p><p>The Umpqua will be conducting additional detection flights today seeking any new starts.</p><p>The Northwest Fire Potential Summary (<url normalizedValue=\"https://gacc.nifc.gov/nwcc/content/products/fwx/guidance/DL.pdf?2020-07-31%2011:11:44\">https://gacc.nifc.gov/nwcc/content/products/fwx/guidance/DL.pdf?2020-07-31%2011:11:44</url>) Hot, dry, unstable weather conditions will diminish east of the Cascades as a cooling trend sets in. The loss of lightning potential means human-caused fires are the main threat. Westerly winds at times in the basins east of the Cascades will continue to create a moderate threat of wind driven fires in light fuels. Overall, large fire risk is near normal levels for early August.</p><p>Fire managers would like to remind the public as the high temperatures in the area continue, fuels such as grass and forest duff will continue to dry and be receptive to any ember or spark to start a new fire so use caution while working or recreating outdoors.</p><p>The forest remains at a MODERATE fire danger rating today and will be raised to HIGH beginning Sunday morning at 12:01 a.m. Public Use Restriction (PUR) level remains at 1.

Please refer to Note 4 - Acquisition of Sawmills and Paper Mill, in the Company's Annual Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 for further information.  2Certain prior period amounts have been restated as a result of a change in presentation of the Company's Financial Statements for continuing and discontinued operations under IFRS. Please refer to Note 4 - Discontinued Operations, in the Company's Financial Statements for the third quarter and three quarters ended September 30, 2023 for further information.  3Adjusted EBITDA is a Non-GAAP measure and does not have standardized meaning under GAAP or IFRS. As a result, it may not be comparable to information presented by other companies. For an explanation and reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to related comparable financial information presented in the Financial Statements prepared in accordance with IFRS, refer to the Non-GAAP Measures section in the MD&amp;A for the third quarter and three quarters ended September 30, 2023.  4Includes net sales to external parties only.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><p>The Company reported net sales from continuing operations of $95.7 million during Q3 2023, a decrease of $15.9 million or 14%, compared to Q2 2023. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to lower volumes shipped as a result of reduced demand driven by increasing economic uncertainty coupled with high interest rates. Favourable pricing momentum increased toward the end of the second quarter, primarily as a result of forest fire related disruptions, provided some benefits early in the third quarter but subsided toward the latter half of the period.</p><p>The Company reported cost of sales of $89.7 million during Q3 2023, a decrease of $20.1 million or 18%, compared to Q2 2023. This decrease reflected the impact of lower lumber and paper shipments in the third quarter, partially offset by a lower recovery related to inventory net realizable value recorded and higher maintenance costs at the Kapuskasing paper mill. Additionally, the Company had lower lumber production in the third quarter due to scheduled maintenance downtime.</p><p>The initial duty deposit rate, totaling 20.23%, had remained in effect since the Company's acquisition of its sawmill and paper mill assets and has resulted in a higher payment in relation to our Canadian peers as at September 30, 2023, totaling US$22 million. The Company became eligible for the rate applied to all other lumber exporters from August 1, 2023 onwards, calculated by the US DOC to be 8.05%, following the results of the US DOC's Fourth Administrative Review.</p><p>The Company reported selling, general and administration expenses for continuing operations of $5.2 million during Q3 2023 which was an increase of $0.3 million compared to Q2 2023. The prior quarter benefited from a recovery on a previously written-off accounts receivable balance related to discontinued operations. Partially offsetting the increase were reduced salaries and benefits and facility related costs in the third quarter.</p><p>Turnaround of the Paper Mill and Move for Operational Decentralization</p><p>GreenFirst has benefited from improving results at its paper mill during 2023, compared to the prior year in which the mill's contribution remained negative for all four quarters. For the three quarters ended September 30, 2023, the operating income from the paper products segment was $1.8 million compared to an operating loss of $11.6 million in the prior year three quarters ended September 24, 2022. This turnaround is primarily driven by the restart and efficiency gains of the second paper machine. However, the paper mill faces many headwinds, including pricing pressures, related to the secular decline of its paper products along with incremental supply pressures relating to wood chips.</p><p>GreenFirst's paper mill operation has key operational and performance metrics that are very different from the lumber mill operations. The Board of Directors has determined to separate the lumber mill assets from the paper mill assets. It is believed that this separation of businesses and decentralization of management will provide for more expedient decision-making, better alignment of incentives and more entrepreneurialism. This corporate decentralization has been initiated and it will also result in further reductions of overhead and operating costs.</p><p>Liquidity and Borrowings</p><p>At September 30, 2023, the Company had $50.7 million, less $5.4 million for standby letters of credit, of excess availability under the revolving portion of the Credit Facility. The Company has made net repayments of $36.0 million against the Credit Facility during the first three quarters of 2023 and the Company is no longer subject a minimum fixed-charge coverage ratio. Subsequent to Q3 2023 the Company made net borrowings of $3.0 million against the Credit Facility.</p><p>Outlook</p><p>High interest rates and overall macroeconomic concerns continue to negatively impact lumber demand and pricing. There are indications that the US Federal Reserve and Bank of Canada may pause on any further interest rate increases. In the near term, pricing will continue to face headwinds and remain volatile. In the longer-term, record levels of immigration in Canada, aging of homes in the US and demographic driven demand are expected to positively impact lumber markets.</p><p>Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA</p><p>References to EBITDA in this document are measures of earnings (loss) before interest and finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, while references to Adjusted EBITDA reflect EBITDA plus other non-operating costs such as acquisition and transaction-related costs, impact of valuation changes on the Company's investments, the impact of foreign exchange on the Company's long-term debt, loss on extinguishment of debt, gain on sale of assets and other non-operating losses. Management believes that certain lenders, investors, and analysts use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a common valuation measurement and to measure the Company's ability to service debt and meet other payment obligations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to replace net earnings (loss), or other measures of financial performance and liquidity reported in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to the Company's MD&amp;A for further information on non-GAAP measures.</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"9\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"376\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"40\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"48\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col7\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col8\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col9\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"16\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">(In thousands of CAD)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\" nameend=\"col3\" namest=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col4\" nameend=\"col6\" namest=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col7\" nameend=\"col9\" namest=\"col7\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">For the quarter ended</entry><entry colname=\"col2\" nameend=\"col3\" namest=\"col2\">September 30,   2023</entry><entry colname=\"col4\" nameend=\"col6\" namest=\"col4\">July 1,  2023</entry><entry colname=\"col7\" nameend=\"col9\" namest=\"col7\">September 24,  2022(1)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Net earnings (loss) from continuing operations</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">$</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2,657</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">$</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">(9,671</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">)</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">$</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">(16,257</entry><entry colname=\"col9\">)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Adjustments:</entry><entry colname=\"col2\" nameend=\"col3\" namest=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col4\" nameend=\"col6\" namest=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col7\" nameend=\"col9\" namest=\"col7\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Finance costs, net</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\">125</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\">478</entry><entry colname=\"col6\"/><entry colname=\"col7\"/><entry colname=\"col8\">3,986</entry><entry colname=\"col9\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Income taxes</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\">1,082</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\">(260</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">)</entry><entry colname=\"col7\"/><entry colname=\"col8\">(14,918</entry><entry colname=\"col9\">)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Depreciation and amortization</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\">4,132</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\">4,441</entry><entry colname=\"col6\"/><entry colname=\"col7\"/><entry colname=\"col8\">3,327</entry><entry colname=\"col9\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">EBITDA</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\">7,996</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\">(5,012</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">)</entry><entry colname=\"col7\"/><entry colname=\"col8\">(23,862</entry><entry colname=\"col9\">)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Foreign exchange on long-term debt</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col6\"/><entry colname=\"col7\"/><entry colname=\"col8\">5,311</entry><entry colname=\"col9\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Loss on extinguishment of debt</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col6\"/><entry colname=\"col7\"/><entry colname=\"col8\">11,187</entry><entry colname=\"col9\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Other non-operating losses</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col6\"/><entry colname=\"col7\"/><entry colname=\"col8\">5,320</entry><entry colname=\"col9\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations(2)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">$</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">7,996</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">$</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">(5,012</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">)</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">$</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">(2,044</entry><entry colname=\"col9\">)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\" nameend=\"col9\" namest=\"col1\">1Certain prior period amounts have been restated as a result of a change in presentation of the Company's Financial Statements for continuing and discontinued operations under IFRS.

Its water levels are hurtling toward deadpool level.</p><p>Robert Glennon water policy and law expert and emeritus professor at the University of Arizona told <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Newsweek</emphasis> that if it did indeed reach dead pool level, it could be a catastrophe.</p><p>So what is the story of Lake Mead, and why is it so important?</p><h>Construction</h><p>The construction of<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/lake-mead-bodies-may-turned-soapy-substance-forensic-scientist-1732121?utm_source=Synacor&amp;utm_medium=Attnet&amp;utm_campaign=Partnerships\">Lake Mead</url>, and Hoover Dam began in 1931, and finished in 1936.</p><p>Before it was built, the land was scarcely visited by anyone because of its extreme temperatures and harsh landscape.</p><p>Glennon said that the Hoover Dam was first approved by congress in 1928.</p><p>\"The initial purpose for it was flood control. Because before then, whatever Mother Nature doled out into the mountains of Colorado and to some extent Wyoming, all that water came down which is roaring down the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon and then when it got through the Grand Canyon, it's spread out and it just wiped out all the farms along the river for hundreds of miles,\" he said. \"So the farmers on both side and also Mexico, are begging us to see if they can create some sort of a dam and create flood control. So, flood control was the first reason, irrigation was second and then hydroelectric power, these were the main purposes.\"</p><p>When it came to actually constructing Hoover Dam, and subsequently Lake Mead, Glennon said it was a \"feat of engineering.\"</p><p>\"No one had ever done this sort of Dam. And it was built right in the middle of the Great Depression. And it came in, under budget and before the deadline. On the other hand, 112 men lost their lives building Hoover Dam and what the engineers who designed Hoover Dam did was really a feat of engineering,\" he said. \"They drilled through the canyon walls on either side of the river, diversion tunnels... to divert the water around Boulder Canyon and back into the channel of the Colorado River. So they dynamited it and dug and moved everything and then when it was finally ready, they blew up the entrance to these tunnels and worked feverishly to get the water out of the main channel and into these diversion channels.\"</p><p>According to Glennon, completing the crucial reservoir was not an easy feat.</p><p>The men employed to build the dam came from all around the country during the Great Depression.</p><p>\"They literally built a town to house these people. They needed a railroad to move parts. They needed incredible excavation equipment to get all of the silver that was in the muddy bed out because they got down to bedrock. They needed hard bedrock to start drilling,\" Glennon said.</p><p>Glennon said there are videos still circulating of the workers creating Hoover Dam.</p><p>\"[You can see] these workers on the side of the cliffs, just kind of bouncing around. inserting these big long drills and then plugging them with dynamite and you know; they're hanging off a cliff by a rope, and then they bounce away and the dynamite goes off. It's crazy kind of stuff,\" he said.</p><h>Completion</h><p>When Hoover Dam and Lake Mead were finished, it became an integral water storage system for the lower basin states of California, Nevada and Arizona.</p><p>From<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/lake-mead-latest-everything-we-know-so-far-1731629?utm_source=Synacor&amp;utm_medium=Attnet&amp;utm_campaign=Partnerships\">Lake Mead</url>, water is distributed widely across these states.</p><p>The lake began to fill in 1935. The water levels at this time were around 708.70 feet, according to data from the National Park Service. Water levels fluctuate over the years, until 1983, when it reached its highest point.</p><p>Since then, the levels have receded, as the Lake is drying up faster then it can replenish itself.</p><p>Glennon noted that one of the main reasons for this is the megadrought gripping the western United States. He said another is climate change.</p><p>\"Lower precipitation, increased evaporation, forest fires and a longer forest fire season that's become a forest fire year. They impair water supplies in a whole bunch of ways,\" he said.</p><p>Many experts have warned that now, as the lake's levels reach the lowest they've been since 1937\u2014just a few years after it was constructed\u2014it could reach a dead pool.</p><p>\"[Dead pool] would be a catastrophe. It could happened, but there's no reason to to allow it to happen. We have the tools we have the skill set to to act to avoid that catastrophe,\" Glennon said. \"There's still a heck of a lot more conservation that can be done, and that is the low hanging fruit.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2095310/lake-mead.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Lake mead</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Bob Riha Jr/Getty</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>A picture shows Lake Mead in 2022, at an area that once would have been covered with water.

After signing with ARK Music Factory in 2011, the \"Friday\" star first reached hundreds of millions of listeners as an internet joke. Replete with preteens and green-screened shots, her music video was once the most-disliked on Youtube, dethroning Justin Bieber's \"Baby\" for the title.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 2023, the winds have changed. ARK Music Factory is defunct; Black is on the right side of history. In fact, \"Friday\" has had a major resurgence - and a hyperpop remix to boot. Even today, the infamous track still sits luminously at the top of her Spotify profile, with a cool 17 million streams.\u00a0</p><p>After 12 years and a string of singles comes Black's debut album. Released Feb. 9, 2023, Let Her Burn seemed poised to kick ass and take no prisoners. The title reads as a command to the listener: the Rebecca Black you know? Let her burn. The promise is tantalizing.\u00a0</p><p>As far as genre-bending it-girls go, Black should fit right in. Leading up to the release of Let Her Burn, Black took to Instagram in a PVC leotard and microbangs befitting a pop girlie du jour. In time, she will undoubtedly cement her place among them: Let Her Burn is not that admittatur. Instead, the styles Black draws from read like a series of impressions.</p><p>To their credit, the producers - primarily Micah Jasper - keep well abreast with each stylistic shift. Black's backtracks lean into a hyper-electronic, artifacting quality; meanwhile, her ethereal whisperings permeate the tracklist like a thin fog. This kind of high-fructose pop, shot through with distorted electric guitars, defines the sound palate of Let Her Burn. Halfway through the A-side, the album hits its stride - from here, the tracks do more to stand out. It's no wonder that \"Crumbs,\" the lead single, gained such notoriety. Riding a house beat with SOPHIE-esque industrial scrapings, Black's self-assured delivery meshes well. By the tracklist's back half, Black gains increasing momentum: combined with its lovelorn lyrics, \"Sick To My Stomach\" is true-blue, the 808-ridden beat gets across a distinctly '80s ethos. \"What Am I Gonna Do With You\" is a sleeper hit; Black's delivery is downright cutting over the pounding guitar line. Even at its most maximalist, the production makes her voice the crown jewel of the mix.</p><p>When Black misses, it's because she tries on shoes she simply cannot fill. Uncharitable reads have even called her presence on Let Her Burn like a second-rate Sawayama. While this particular comparison would be difficult - Rina Sawayama is a tough act to crack - Black routinely promises more than she can deliver. On \"Cry Hard Enough,\" she coasts over the roaring cut-ins like a butterfly over a forest fire. When the drum-and-bass drop comes, though, that energy is deflated - an experience that's replicated all over Let Her Burn.</p><p>At worst, Black's choice of pastiche is a flawed premise. \"Doe Eyed,\" for example, is a modern take on a slightly tired style of pop song, the kind Ariana Grande might have written five years ago. The beat is cloyingly quirky; when it's not buried under overbearing hi-hats, the sparse synth line is bright and grating. Way over the mix, Black sings hyper-tuned trills and whines about \"(fucking) you 'til sunrise.\" Society has moved on for a reason. Thank u, next.</p><p>A decade into her career, it would be strange to describe this project as \"early work.\" For all it purports to emerge fully formed, Black's new project betrays an insecurity in her personal voice. From song to song, she wears each influence on her sleeve like a temporary tattoo. Nevertheless, Black turns out a batch of catchy tunes.</p><p>Let Her Burn is the new Black, but her sound is nothing new. Herald it as her Gaga era, her SOPHIE era, whatever avant-popstar comes to mind, but for now, \"derivative\" is a good problem to have.</p><p>Daily Arts Contributor Amina Cattaui can be reached at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:aminacat@umich.edu\">aminacat@umich.edu</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5485146</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67N6-RM81-DY7P-T2TY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"653\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Michigan Daily: University of Michigan-Ann Arbor</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"02\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>February 27, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Ann Arbor</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>MI</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009UHV</classCode><className>MUSIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009UV1</classCode><className>FILM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009VC1</classCode><className>STRINGED INSTRUMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RO6</classCode><className>STREAMING MEDIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009UV1</classCode><className>FILM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001184</classCode><className>MUSIC INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001070</classCode><className>RECORD RELEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009VC1</classCode><className>STRINGED INSTRUMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000CZWX</classCode><className>JUSTIN BIEBER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS138</classCode><className>MICHIGAN, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

By ensuring community resupply, air ambulance, search and rescue, and forest fire response, airports contribute to keeping Canadians safe and connected from coast to coast to coast.</p><p>Today, the Minister of Transport, the Honourable Omar Alghabra, announced that the Government of Canada is making important safety investments at two Saskatchewan Airports.</p><p>Through Transport Canada's Airports Capital Assistance Program, two airports in Saskatchewan will receive over $1.7 million from the Government of Canada for projects and equipment that will help maintain safe airport operations for passengers, crews, and airport workers. The airports receiving funding are:</p><p>La Ronge</p><p>* to purchase a loader - $424,990</p><p>* to purchase a sweeper - $391,600</p><p>* to purchase a 4x4 snowplow - $444,600</p><p>Prince Albert</p><p>* to purchase a 4x4 snowplow - $420,000</p><p>* to purchase material spreader, wet/dry combination - $105,000</p><p>The equipment will be used in maintaining aircraft movement surfaces and the removal and control of ice and snow from airside surfaces such as runways, taxiways and the apron.</p><p>This funding is in addition to the May 2021 announcement under the program to provide the La Ronge Airport with $110,000 for a material spreader and more than $3.2 million to the Prince Albert Airport for the rehabilitation of airfield electrical systems and for airfield drainage improvements.</p><p>Quotes</p><p>\"Airports play a crucial role in keeping Canadians connected across our vast country, and the last two and a half years have only underscored this. Today's investment of over $1.7 million in the La Ronge and Prince Albert airports is great news for the region's air sector and for all the communities these airports serve. Investments like these will ensure that our air sector comes out strong as we enter post-pandemic recovery, and help us keep our commitment to building safer, stronger communities.\"</p><p>The Honourable Omar Alghabra, Minister of Transport</p><p>Quick facts</p><p>* As announced in the Fall Economic Statement 2020, the Airports Capital Assistance Program received a one-time funding top-up of $186 million over two years.</p><p>* The Fall Economic Statement 2020 also announced the temporary expansion of eligibility for the Airports Capital Assistance Program to allow National Airports System airports with less than one million annual passengers in 2019 to apply for funding under the Program in 2021-2022 and 2022-2023.</p><p>* Since the Airports Capital Assistance Program started in 1995, the Government of Canada has invested over $1.2 billion for 1,215 projects at 199 local, regional and National Airports System airports across the country. Funded projects include runway and taxiway repairs/rehabilitation, lighting enhancements, purchasing snow clearing equipment and firefighting vehicles as well as installing wildlife control fencing.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/transport-canada/news/2022/12/government-of-canada-makes-important-investments-at-two-saskatchewan-airports.html\">https://www.canada.ca/en/transport-canada/news/2022/12/government-of-canada-makes-important-investments-at-two-saskatchewan-airports.html</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-8014600 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8014600</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:671P-99H1-DYG2-R44M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-12-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"532\"/><timeReceived>9:40 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"12\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>December 7, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The transfer was made possible through the Federal Excess Personal Property program (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/fire/fepp\">https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/fire/fepp</url>) that allows Forest Service-owned property to be transferred to State Foresters for the purpose of wildland and rural firefighting.</p><p>\"Federal, state and local fire departments in West Virginia have pledged to help each other fight wildfires through the Mid-Atlantic Fire Compact (<url normalizedValue=\"http://midatlanticfirecompact.com/home/\">http://midatlanticfirecompact.com/home/</url>),\" said Aaron Kendall, Monongahela National Forest Fire Management Officer. \"I'm glad that this engine will continue to be used for fighting wildfires here in West Virginia with the Belington Volunteer Fire Department.\"</p><p>The engine comes from the Monongahela National Forest's White Sulphur Springs Ranger Station. It was used on prescribed burns and wildfires on the Monongahela and other national forests. \"In fact, this engine has been driven cross-country several times to aid in some of the big wildfires out west,\" said Kendall.

According to news reporting from Abha, Saudi Arabia, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"As a result of technological advancements and the need for continuous reduction in manufacturing costs, the concept of Internet of Things (IoT), consisting of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), has entered the industrial production units. IoT devices have not only pene-trated the day-to-day activities of human beings, but also in defence.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include King Khalid University, Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Umm Al-Qura University. <br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from King Khalid University, \"In recent years, there is a widespread application of Internet of Drones (IoD) in areas such as television and film shooting, meteorological monitoring, forest fire detection, agricultural monitoring, emergency rescue, etc. In this background, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) plays an important role to effectually secure the IoD network. The current research work develops an Opposition Poor and Rich Optimization -based Feature Selection with Optimal Deep Feed-forward Neural Network (OPRFS-ODFNN) model for intrusion detection in IoD communication system. The aim of the presented OPRFS-ODFNN technique is to accomplish enhanced security in IoD communication system. In order to achieve the objective, OPRFS-ODFNN model initially executes feature scaling as a pre-processing step. Then, OPRFS technique is applied for effective selection of the features. More-over, Improved Mayfly Optimization (IMFO) is applied with ODFNN model for intrusion detec-tion and classification processes.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"In order to validate the enhanced performance of the proposed OPRFS-ODFNN method, extensive simulations were conducted.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Oppositional Poor and Rich Optimization With Deep Learning Enabled Secure Internet of Drone Communication System.

Michigan's Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy issued an air quality alert for the entire state. Wisconsin's Department of Natural Resources also issued an air quality advisory for the state.</p><p>In Chicago, officials urged young people, older adults and residents with health issues to spend more time indoors.</p><p>\u201cJust driving into the zoo ... you could just see around the buildings, kind of just haze,\" said Shelly Woinowski, who was visiting the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago.</p><p>Some day care centers in the Chicago area have told parents that their children will remain indoors Tuesday due to the poor air quality, while one youth sports club says it adjusted its activities to add more time indoors.</p><p>\u201cAs these unsafe conditions continue, the city will continue to provide updates and take swift action to ensure that vulnerable individuals have the resources they need to protect themselves and their families,\" Mayor Brandon Johnson said in a release.</p><p>In the Milwaukee area, Flight for Life Wisconsin was unable to respond to a motorcycle-van crash because the Federal Aviation Administration requires 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) visibility, and the visibility was reduced to three-quarters to 1.5 miles (1.2-2.4 kilometers) because of the hazy skies, Executive Director Leif Erickson said.</p><p>Fires in northern Quebec and low pressure over the eastern Great Lakes are sending smoke through northern Michigan, and across southern Wisconsin and Chicago, said Bryan Jackson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.</p><p>Jackson added that a north wind would push the smoke further south, moving into Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky later Tuesday and overnight.</p><p>The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre reported Monday that 76,129 square kilometers (29,393 square miles) of land including <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/canada-wildfires-smoke-quebec-rain-a0e287ea5117cccadb9e6917304635ea\">forests has burned across Canada</url> since Jan. 1. That exceeds the previous record set in 1989 of 75,596 square kilometers (29,187 square miles), according to the National Forestry Database.</p><p>Nationally, there are currently 490 fires burning, with 255 of them considered to be out of control.</p><p>Even recent rainfall in Quebec likely won\u2019t be enough to extinguish the wildfires ravaging the northern part of that province, but the wet weather could give firefighters a chance to get ahead of the flames, officials said Tuesday.</p><p>Nearly a quarter of the fires burning in Canada are in Quebec. Environment Canada meteorologist Simon Legault said he expects rain to stop falling by Wednesday morning in the regions most affected by forest fires.</p><p>Earlier this month, <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/canada-wildfires-air-quality-8af805b127ba4d4f5933463cf8fdc746\">massive fires burning stretches of Canadian forests</url> blanketed the northeastern United States and the Great Lakes region, turning the air yellowish gray, and prompting warnings for people to stay inside and keep windows closed.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/canada-wildfires-smoke-health-fd87c108963639b3be16a059598f8bbf\">The small particles in wildfire smoke</url> can irritate the eyes, nose and throat, and can affect the heart and lungs, making it harder to breathe. Health officials say it\u2019s important to limit outdoor activities as much as possible to avoid breathing in these particles.</p><p>\u201cUntil the fires are out, there\u2019s a risk,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cIf there\u2019s any north component to the wind, there\u2019s a chance it\u2019ll be smoky.\u201d</p><p>In early June, U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement that hundreds of American firefighters and support personnel have been in Canada since May, and called attention to the fires as a reminder of the impacts of climate change.</p><p>The warming planet will produce hotter and longer heat waves, making for bigger, smokier fires, according to Joel Thornton, professor and chair of the department of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington.</p><p>Priti Marwah, who was beginning a run along the city's lakefront, describes the haze in Chicago Tuesday as \u201cbad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike, you can smell it bad,\" she said. \"I run a hundred miles a week, so this is going to be dangerous today. You can feel it ... just even parking right there and coming out, I can feel it in my lungs.\u201d</p><p>Smoke from the wildfires moved into Minnesota late Monday, and ground-level smoke is expected to linger across southern, east-central and northeastern Minnesota. That includes the Twin Cities area, up to the northeast corner of the state and down to the southwest and southeast corners.</p><p>The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency tweeted that Tuesday marked the 23rd air quality alert in Minnesota this year, breaking the previous record of 21 in 2021. Minnesota usually averages two or three alerts in a season.</p><p>St. Paul recorded the worst air quality in the United States two weeks ago due to smoke from Canadian wildfires. As of midday Tuesday, the air quality was rated \u201cunhealthy\u201d across eastern Minnesota from the Canadian border to the Iowa border.</p><p>The MPCA said a cold front will move across Minnesota on Wednesday, bringing cleaner air from the west across the region by early Thursday.</p><p>But on Tuesday, the coming respite meant little to Dan Daley, a resident of St. Louis Park, Minnesota.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of miserable some days because you can\u2019t spend a lot of time outside,\u201d he said.</p><p>Daley said he smelled \u2013 and tasted \u2013 smoke in the air when he left the house this morning. He saw a hazy sky and wondered if that will be the norm for future summers in the area. When the air quality makes it unhealthy to be outside, Daley struggles to do the things he enjoys like hiking, camping and walking around town.</p><p>He worries that people in other parts of the country who haven\u2019t experienced days of bad air quality will think it\u2019s not a big deal. \u201cIf they think the smoke\u2019s not that bad, they should come up here and see it for themselves\u201d Daley said.</p><p>_____</p><p>Ahmed reported from Minneapolis. AP reporter Steve Karnowski in Minneapolis, Corey Williams in Detroit and Ken Kusmer in Indianapolis contributed to the story.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-e120fa48b44e6c8560b13712ba76ee1d20230628</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68JX-04K1-DYMD-61VD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304479</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1067\"/><timeReceived>12:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

This was a record high for any time of the year, Kapikian reported via Twitter. All-time and monthly records were set elsewhere across Greece and in Turkey, where fires are also raging[3] amid searing, prolonged heat.Some locations also set records for the highest overnight temperatures seen for the entire European continent, though Europe's all-time high-temperature record of 48C (118.4F) remains intact.Thousands of people across Greece have been forced to evacuate due to the raging wildfires, while some in Athens are being advised to stay indoors.The extreme heat prompted the Ministry of Culture to close the Acropolis and other ancient sites during the afternoons this week, CNN reports[4]. Context: The heat wave can be traced to persistent winds from the southwest, transporting air from Africa across the mild waters of the Mediterranean, along with a high-pressure area, or \"heat dome,\" sitting over southeastern Europe. Extreme heat waves are also among the clearest manifestations[5] of human-caused global warming, studies show.In photos: A firefighter battles against a wildfire in Acharnes, Greece, on Aug. 3.

Eleven-year-old Virgil, 15-year-old Kaitlyn, and 19-year-old Joshua Pepper are taking <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Rusty</emphasis>, their family's old camper van, to Little Lost Lake, miles into the Pacific Northwest wilderness, to scatter their mother's ashes. It is a place filled with special memories for Virgil, as it's where his beloved science teacher mother taught him wilderness skills like using the stars as a compass and building a fire without matches. Thirty-three miles into the trip on the cratered dirt road known as the Boneyard, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Rusty</emphasis> breaks down. There is no cellphone signal, and the siblings discover they have forgotten the food and water. The only nearby dwelling is a creepy so-called Sasquatch museum-a run-down trailer, its fence decorated with animal skulls and antlers-that their mother hated. To make things worse, a lightning strike has started a forest fire. Kaitlyn is injured while climbing a tree as a lookout, and the siblings plan a course of action-Joshua will go off for help, and Virgil decides to try to fix <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Rusty</emphasis>. But their plans go awry, and Virgil becomes lost and separated from the others as the fire rages closer. </p><p>Clutching the box with his mother's ashes, he must remember everything she has taught him in order to survive. This page-turning and atmospheric adventure story also teaches fascinating science skills. Characters read as White.

Michigan's Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy issued an air quality alert for the entire state. Wisconsin's Department of Natural Resources also issued an air quality advisory for the state.</p><p>In Chicago, officials urged young people, older adults and residents with health issues to spend more time indoors.</p><p>\u201cJust driving into the zoo ... you could just see around the buildings, kind of just haze,\" said Shelly Woinowski, who was visiting the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago.</p><p>Some day care centers in the Chicago area have told parents that their children will remain indoors Tuesday due to the poor air quality, while one youth sports club says it adjusted its activities to add more time indoors.</p><p>\u201cAs these unsafe conditions continue, the city will continue to provide updates and take swift action to ensure that vulnerable individuals have the resources they need to protect themselves and their families,\" Mayor Brandon Johnson said in a release.</p><p>In the Milwaukee area, Flight for Life Wisconsin was unable to respond to a motorcycle-van crash because the Federal Aviation Administration requires 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) visibility, and the visibility was reduced to three-quarters to 1.5 miles (1.2-2.4 kilometers) because of the hazy skies, Executive Director Leif Erickson said.</p><p>Fires in northern Quebec and low pressure over the eastern Great Lakes are sending smoke through northern Michigan, and across southern Wisconsin and Chicago, said Bryan Jackson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.</p><p>Jackson added that a north wind would push the smoke further south, moving into Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky later Tuesday and overnight.</p><p>The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre reported Monday that 76,129 square kilometers (29,393 square miles) of land including <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/canada-wildfires-smoke-quebec-rain-a0e287ea5117cccadb9e6917304635ea\">forests has burned across Canada</url> since Jan. 1. That exceeds the previous record set in 1989 of 75,596 square kilometers (29,187 square miles), according to the National Forestry Database.</p><p>Nationally, there are currently 490 fires burning, with 255 of them considered to be out of control.</p><p>Even recent rainfall in Quebec likely won\u2019t be enough to extinguish the wildfires ravaging the northern part of that province, but the wet weather could give firefighters a chance to get ahead of the flames, officials said Tuesday.</p><p>Nearly a quarter of the fires burning in Canada are in Quebec. Environment Canada meteorologist Simon Legault said he expects rain to stop falling by Wednesday morning in the regions most affected by forest fires.</p><p>Earlier this month, <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/canada-wildfires-air-quality-8af805b127ba4d4f5933463cf8fdc746\">massive fires burning stretches of Canadian forests</url> blanketed the northeastern United States and the Great Lakes region, turning the air yellowish gray, and prompting warnings for people to stay inside and keep windows closed.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/canada-wildfires-smoke-health-fd87c108963639b3be16a059598f8bbf\">The small particles in wildfire smoke</url> can irritate the eyes, nose and throat, and can affect the heart and lungs, making it harder to breathe. Health officials say it\u2019s important to limit outdoor activities as much as possible to avoid breathing in these particles.</p><p>\u201cUntil the fires are out, there\u2019s a risk,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cIf there\u2019s any north component to the wind, there\u2019s a chance it\u2019ll be smoky.\u201d</p><p>In early June, U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement that hundreds of American firefighters and support personnel have been in Canada since May, and called attention to the fires as a reminder of the impacts of climate change.</p><p>The warming planet will produce hotter and longer heat waves, making for bigger, smokier fires, according to Joel Thornton, professor and chair of the department of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington.</p><p>Priti Marwah, who was beginning a run along the city's lakefront, describes the haze in Chicago Tuesday as \u201cbad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike, you can smell it bad,\" she said. \"I run a hundred miles a week, so this is going to be dangerous today. You can feel it ... just even parking right there and coming out, I can feel it in my lungs.\u201d</p><p>Smoke from the wildfires moved into Minnesota late Monday, and ground-level smoke is expected to linger across southern, east-central and northeastern Minnesota. That includes the Twin Cities area, up to the northeast corner of the state and down to the southwest and southeast corners.</p><p>The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency tweeted that Tuesday marked the 23rd air quality alert in Minnesota this year, breaking the previous record of 21 in 2021. Minnesota usually averages two or three alerts in a season.</p><p>St. Paul recorded the worst air quality in the United States two weeks ago due to smoke from Canadian wildfires. As of midday Tuesday, the air quality was rated \u201cunhealthy\u201d across eastern Minnesota from the Canadian border to the Iowa border.</p><p>The MPCA said a cold front will move across Minnesota on Wednesday, bringing cleaner air from the west across the region by early Thursday.</p><p>But on Tuesday, the coming respite meant little to Dan Daley, a resident of St. Louis Park, Minnesota.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of miserable some days because you can\u2019t spend a lot of time outside,\u201d he said.</p><p>Daley said he smelled \u2013 and tasted \u2013 smoke in the air when he left the house this morning. He saw a hazy sky and wondered if that will be the norm for future summers in the area. When the air quality makes it unhealthy to be outside, Daley struggles to do the things he enjoys like hiking, camping and walking around town.</p><p>He worries that people in other parts of the country who haven\u2019t experienced days of bad air quality will think it\u2019s not a big deal. \u201cIf they think the smoke\u2019s not that bad, they should come up here and see it for themselves\u201d Daley said.</p><p>_____</p><p>Ahmed reported from Minneapolis. AP reporter Steve Karnowski in Minneapolis, Corey Williams in Detroit and Ken Kusmer in Indianapolis contributed to the story.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-e120fa48b44e6c8560b13712ba76ee1d20230627</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68JT-1X71-DYMD-618N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1067\"/><timeReceived>11:15 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 27, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Michigan's Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy issued an air quality alert for the entire state. Wisconsin's Department of Natural Resources also issued an air quality advisory for the state.</p><p>In Chicago, officials urged young people, older adults and residents with health issues to spend more time indoors.</p><p>\u201cJust driving into the zoo ... you could just see around the buildings, kind of just haze,\" said Shelly Woinowski, who was visiting the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago.</p><p>Some day care centers in the Chicago area have told parents that their children will remain indoors Tuesday due to the poor air quality, while one youth sports club says it adjusted its activities to add more time indoors.</p><p>\u201cAs these unsafe conditions continue, the city will continue to provide updates and take swift action to ensure that vulnerable individuals have the resources they need to protect themselves and their families,\" Mayor Brandon Johnson said in a release.</p><p>In the Milwaukee area, Flight for Life Wisconsin was unable to respond to a motorcycle-van crash because the Federal Aviation Administration requires 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) visibility, and the visibility was reduced to three-quarters to 1.5 miles (1.2-2.4 kilometers) because of the hazy skies, Executive Director Leif Erickson said.</p><p>Fires in northern Quebec and low pressure over the eastern Great Lakes are sending smoke through northern Michigan, and across southern Wisconsin and Chicago, said Bryan Jackson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.</p><p>Jackson added that a north wind would push the smoke further south, moving into Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky later Tuesday and overnight.</p><p>The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre reported Monday that 76,129 square kilometers (29,393 square miles) of land including <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/canada-wildfires-smoke-quebec-rain-a0e287ea5117cccadb9e6917304635ea\">forests has burned across Canada</url> since Jan. 1. That exceeds the previous record set in 1989 of 75,596 square kilometers (29,187 square miles), according to the National Forestry Database.</p><p>Nationally, there are currently 490 fires burning, with 255 of them considered to be out of control.</p><p>Even recent rainfall in Quebec likely won\u2019t be enough to extinguish the wildfires ravaging the northern part of that province, but the wet weather could give firefighters a chance to get ahead of the flames, officials said Tuesday.</p><p>Nearly a quarter of the fires burning in Canada are in Quebec. Environment Canada meteorologist Simon Legault said he expects rain to stop falling by Wednesday morning in the regions most affected by forest fires.</p><p>Earlier this month, <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/canada-wildfires-air-quality-8af805b127ba4d4f5933463cf8fdc746\">massive fires burning stretches of Canadian forests</url> blanketed the northeastern United States and the Great Lakes region, turning the air yellowish gray, and prompting warnings for people to stay inside and keep windows closed.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/canada-wildfires-smoke-health-fd87c108963639b3be16a059598f8bbf\">The small particles in wildfire smoke</url> can irritate the eyes, nose and throat, and can affect the heart and lungs, making it harder to breathe. Health officials say it\u2019s important to limit outdoor activities as much as possible to avoid breathing in these particles.</p><p>\u201cUntil the fires are out, there\u2019s a risk,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cIf there\u2019s any north component to the wind, there\u2019s a chance it\u2019ll be smoky.\u201d</p><p>In early June, U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement that hundreds of American firefighters and support personnel have been in Canada since May, and called attention to the fires as a reminder of the impacts of climate change.</p><p>The warming planet will produce hotter and longer heat waves, making for bigger, smokier fires, according to Joel Thornton, professor and chair of the department of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington.</p><p>Priti Marwah, who was beginning a run along the city's lakefront, describes the haze in Chicago Tuesday as \u201cbad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike, you can smell it bad,\" she said. \"I run a hundred miles a week, so this is going to be dangerous today. You can feel it ... just even parking right there and coming out, I can feel it in my lungs.\u201d</p><p>Smoke from the wildfires moved into Minnesota late Monday, and ground-level smoke is expected to linger across southern, east-central and northeastern Minnesota. That includes the Twin Cities area, up to the northeast corner of the state and down to the southwest and southeast corners.</p><p>The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency tweeted that Tuesday marked the 23rd air quality alert in Minnesota this year, breaking the previous record of 21 in 2021. Minnesota usually averages two or three alerts in a season.</p><p>St. Paul recorded the worst air quality in the United States two weeks ago due to smoke from Canadian wildfires. As of midday Tuesday, the air quality was rated \u201cunhealthy\u201d across eastern Minnesota from the Canadian border to the Iowa border.</p><p>The MPCA said a cold front will move across Minnesota on Wednesday, bringing cleaner air from the west across the region by early Thursday.</p><p>But on Tuesday, the coming respite meant little to Dan Daley, a resident of St. Louis Park, Minnesota.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of miserable some days because you can\u2019t spend a lot of time outside,\u201d he said.</p><p>Daley said he smelled \u2013 and tasted \u2013 smoke in the air when he left the house this morning. He saw a hazy sky and wondered if that will be the norm for future summers in the area. When the air quality makes it unhealthy to be outside, Daley struggles to do the things he enjoys like hiking, camping and walking around town.</p><p>He worries that people in other parts of the country who haven\u2019t experienced days of bad air quality will think it\u2019s not a big deal. \u201cIf they think the smoke\u2019s not that bad, they should come up here and see it for themselves\u201d Daley said.</p><p>_____</p><p>Ahmed reported from Minneapolis.

Hill was selected after a rigorous interview process whittled down a pool of candidates to three interviewees and conducted subsequent assessments.</p><p>Hill began his firefighting career volunteering with the Carolina Beach Fire Department in 2005. Two years later, he started as a firefighter for the Wake Forest Fire Department and was promoted to fire lieutenant just one year later. In 2014, he joined New Hanover County Fire Rescue where he worked his way up to his current position of fire training captain.</p><p>The former fire chief, Stephen Lovette, announced his resignation in July after less than four years in office. Lovette had 32 years of experience and, upon leaving, had increased the city's fire ratings, particularly in rural areas with more obstacles such as limited water access. In the city ratings scheme, the lower the number rating from one to 10, the better. Right now, the city district rating is a 3, and the rural district rating is a 5 for most areas.</p><p>Hill previously told The Independent that he is looking to build upon that success.</p><p>\"It's great that they were able to improve it. I would love to improve it further,\" he asserted. \"It would be nice to get the rural down just a little more for the residential members. Once you hit that four mark, it's the lowest score you can get for it. Anything lower than that helps industrial or commercial members.\"</p><p>Hill earned associate degrees in both fire protection technology and emergency management from Fayetteville Technical Community College in December of 2020 and has nearly completed his bachelor's degree in fire and emergency administration at Fayetteville State University.</p><p>\"I don't see the transition being too tough,\" Hill attested earlier this month. \"It's just one of those things you have to have a lot of patience with. I'm very thankful for the city giving me the opportunity to join them and to try to provide some of the best services we can to the whole community.\"</p><p>___ (c)2022 The Sampson Independent (Clinton, N.C.)

Michigan's Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy issued an air quality alert for the entire state. Wisconsin's Department of Natural Resources also issued an air quality advisory for the state.</p><p>In Chicago, officials urged young people, older adults and residents with health issues to spend more time indoors.</p><p>\u201cJust driving into the zoo ... you could just see around the buildings, kind of just haze,\" said Shelly Woinowski, who was visiting the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago.</p><p>Some day care centers in the Chicago area have told parents that their children will remain indoors Tuesday due to the poor air quality, while one youth sports club says it adjusted its activities to add more time indoors.</p><p>\u201cAs these unsafe conditions continue, the city will continue to provide updates and take swift action to ensure that vulnerable individuals have the resources they need to protect themselves and their families,\" Mayor Brandon Johnson said in a release.</p><p>In the Milwaukee area, Flight for Life Wisconsin was unable to respond to a motorcycle-van crash because the Federal Aviation Administration requires 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) visibility, and the visibility was reduced to three-quarters to 1.5 miles (1.2-2.4 kilometers) because of the hazy skies, Executive Director Leif Erickson said.</p><p>Fires in northern Quebec and low pressure over the eastern Great Lakes are sending smoke through northern Michigan, and across southern Wisconsin and Chicago, said Bryan Jackson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.</p><p>Jackson added that a north wind would push the smoke further south, moving into Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky later Tuesday and overnight.</p><p>The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre reported Monday that 76,129 square kilometers (29,393 square miles) of land including <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/canada-wildfires-smoke-quebec-rain-a0e287ea5117cccadb9e6917304635ea\">forests has burned across Canada</url> since Jan. 1. That exceeds the previous record set in 1989 of 75,596 square kilometers (29,187 square miles), according to the National Forestry Database.</p><p>Nationally, there are currently 490 fires burning, with 255 of them considered to be out of control.</p><p>Even recent rainfall in Quebec likely won\u2019t be enough to extinguish the wildfires ravaging the northern part of that province, but the wet weather could give firefighters a chance to get ahead of the flames, officials said Tuesday.</p><p>Nearly a quarter of the fires burning in Canada are in Quebec. Environment Canada meteorologist Simon Legault said he expects rain to stop falling by Wednesday morning in the regions most affected by forest fires.</p><p>Earlier this month, <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/canada-wildfires-air-quality-8af805b127ba4d4f5933463cf8fdc746\">massive fires burning stretches of Canadian forests</url> blanketed the northeastern United States and the Great Lakes region, turning the air yellowish gray, and prompting warnings for people to stay inside and keep windows closed.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/canada-wildfires-smoke-health-fd87c108963639b3be16a059598f8bbf\">The small particles in wildfire smoke</url> can irritate the eyes, nose and throat, and can affect the heart and lungs, making it harder to breathe. Health officials say it\u2019s important to limit outdoor activities as much as possible to avoid breathing in these particles.</p><p>\u201cUntil the fires are out, there\u2019s a risk,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cIf there\u2019s any north component to the wind, there\u2019s a chance it\u2019ll be smoky.\u201d</p><p>In early June, U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement that hundreds of American firefighters and support personnel have been in Canada since May, and called attention to the fires as a reminder of the impacts of climate change.</p><p>The warming planet will produce hotter and longer heat waves, making for bigger, smokier fires, according to Joel Thornton, professor and chair of the department of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington.</p><p>Priti Marwah, who was beginning a run along the city's lakefront, describes the haze in Chicago Tuesday as \u201cbad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike, you can smell it bad,\" she said. \"I run a hundred miles a week, so this is going to be dangerous today. You can feel it ... just even parking right there and coming out, I can feel it in my lungs.\u201d</p><p>Smoke from the wildfires moved into Minnesota late Monday, and ground-level smoke is expected to linger across southern, east-central and northeastern Minnesota. That includes the Twin Cities area, up to the northeast corner of the state and down to the southwest and southeast corners.</p><p>The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency tweeted that Tuesday marked the 23rd air quality alert in Minnesota this year, breaking the previous record of 21 in 2021. Minnesota usually averages two or three alerts in a season.</p><p>St. Paul recorded the worst air quality in the United States two weeks ago due to smoke from Canadian wildfires. As of midday Tuesday, the air quality was rated \u201cunhealthy\u201d across eastern Minnesota from the Canadian border to the Iowa border.</p><p>The MPCA said a cold front will move across Minnesota on Wednesday, bringing cleaner air from the west across the region by early Thursday.</p><p>But on Tuesday, the coming respite meant little to Dan Daley, a resident of St. Louis Park, Minnesota.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of miserable some days because you can\u2019t spend a lot of time outside,\u201d he said.</p><p>Daley said he smelled \u2013 and tasted \u2013 smoke in the air when he left the house this morning. He saw a hazy sky and wondered if that will be the norm for future summers in the area. When the air quality makes it unhealthy to be outside, Daley struggles to do the things he enjoys like hiking, camping and walking around town.</p><p>He worries that people in other parts of the country who haven\u2019t experienced days of bad air quality will think it\u2019s not a big deal. \u201cIf they think the smoke\u2019s not that bad, they should come up here and see it for themselves\u201d Daley said.</p><p>_____</p><p>Ahmed reported from Minneapolis.

Drought Response Committee, meeting via conference call June 30, upgraded the drought designation for all counties in South Carolina.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thirteen counties were upgraded from incipient to moderate drought, including Beaufort, Charleston, Colleton, Darlington, Dillon, Dorchester, Florence, Georgetown, Horry, Jasper, Marlboro, Marion, and Williamsburg. The remaining counties were upgraded to the first level of drought, incipient (see map).</p><p>As designated by the South Carolina Drought Response Act, incipient is the first level of drought followed by moderate, severe and extreme. There was support from all drought indicators to upgrade the drought status, with some indicators already showing more advanced stages of drought. One of the seven primary indicators evaluated by the Drought Response Committee, the U.S. Drought Monitor, is already showing 52 percent of the state in moderate drought and 10 percent in severe.</p><p>Elliot Wickham, S.C. Department of Natural Resources water resources climatologist, explained that areas in moderate and severe drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, have been dealing with dry conditions since May. Sixty-day precipitation deficits, along with above-normal temperatures in June, have caused intense soil moisture deficits to develop in those areas.</p><p>Evaporation rates have also been elevated, and areas need more frequent rain and rainfall totals just to keep up with water lost to evaporation. There were multiple reports of 100-degree temperatures, with several locations reaching 103 F. Not only were the daytime temperatures elevated, the nighttime lows were much higher than normal.</p><p>The Drought Committee is tasked with working to agree on a drought declaration for each county that takes into consideration multiple factors, including agriculture, forest fire risk, water supply and water quality. That can be a challenge, S.C. State Climatologist Hope Mizell said, as conditions for each of these factors can vary widely across a particular county. For example, rainfall for portions of Lexington County over the last 30 days ranged from only 0.84 inches to 5.08 inches.</p><p>The committee also tries to avoid a two-level increase in the drought designation unless there is overwhelming consensus among all the indicators.</p><p>The primary drought impacts being reported at this time are to agriculture, and for some counties those impacts are variable and may be significant. Forest fire conditions are also a concern.</p><p>Farmers and agricultural representatives reported impacts across the state.</p><p>\"Rainfall totals have been sporadic,\" said Kayla Stroman, agricultural program specialist with the Farm Service Agency Office, \"Corn and tobacco crops are suffering. Hay production is low, and many producers are already feeding their winter hay and selling cows. Ponds and creeks are much lower than they were a few weeks ago.\"</p><p>In addition to the effect on crops, worsening drought conditions in recent weeks have led to more wildfires in the state, according to the S.C. Forestry Commission.</p><p>In June, the Forestry Commission responded to 196 wildfires that burned more than 1,157 acres. Compared to the 10-year average, that's an increase of more than 172 percent for the number of fires, and an increase of more than 231 percent in the amount of acres burned for the month.</p><p>The long-term drying combined with high temperatures have kept fine fuels such as straw and grasses dry, making it easier for wildfire to ignite. Larger limbs and debris have also dried significantly, resulting in additional fuel available on the ground and leading to more intense wildfires.</p><p>\"These conditions increase the risk of damaging wildfires that can threaten the public, homes and developed areas,\" said Darryl Jones, forest protection chief for the S.C. Forestry Commission. \"And it makes it more challenging and increases safety concerns for firefighters on the ground.\"</p><p>Priyanka More, SCDNR hydrologist, provided an overview of lake, streamflow and groundwater levels, with the majority of the streams and groundwater levels declining due to the lack of beneficial rain and high temperatures. With the drought conditions intensifying, all water systems are asked to review their drought response plans and ordinances and implement as needed.</p><p>Even though the state has received some rainfall relief in areas this week, with more rain in the forecast, the potential rainfall is highly variable. The committee will reconvene in two weeks to review indicators and impacts.</p><p>Media Contact:</p><p>Hope Mizzell, SCDNR State Climatology Office, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:MizzellH@dnr.sc.gov\">MizzellH@dnr.sc.gov</email></p><p>Priyanka More, SCDNR Hydrology, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:morep@dnr.sc.gov\">morep@dnr.sc.gov</email></p><p>Joe Koon, SCDHEC, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:KoonJm@dhec.sc.gov\">KoonJm@dhec.sc.gov</email></p><p>Darryl Jones, S.C.

Gov. Mike Dunleavy is proposing a major push to make Alaska a sequestration capital of the world. There's demand - I've heard it myself at the global meeting on climate change, COP 27, where carbon sequestration was a major talking point with many new and excited players in the space. However, sequestration doesn't matter if we are still burning gas, coal and oil while emitting far more carbon than we can hope to capture with existing methods and technology. When you have a leak on the boat, you plug the leak before bailing out the water. Government action promoting renewable energy is what we need to do to plug the leak that is carbon emissions, and this should be prioritized over sequestration.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Direct Air Capture (DAC), the best hope at massive reduction in carbon that will stay in the ground, is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/direct-air-capture\">still in its infancy</url> and likely decades away from storing even a sizable fraction of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-much-carbon-dioxide-does-united-states-and-world-emit-each-year-energy-sources\">33 billion metric tons</url> of carbon globally emitted per year. Importantly, DAC takes a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/direct-air-capture-energy-use#:~:text=It%20takes%20around%201%2C200%20kilowatt,sky%20using%20direct%20air%20capture.\">massive amount of energy to capture</url> and store carbon in the air. That <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eia.gov/state/?sid=AK\">energy in Alaska</url> right now comes primarily from natural gas, coal and hydropower. We'd be burning and emitting carbon to store carbon, moving dirt within a hole without actually climbing out.</p><p>Natural sequestration - growing trees, kelp and other plants that naturally breath in and build themselves out of the carbon dioxide in the air - is another method of storing carbon. It is simply <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nrdc.org/stories/why-forest-carbon-offsets-arent-substitute-slashing-emissions\">not the solution</url>. Measuring the amount of carbon stored, important to do if we plan to put a price tag on it, is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.unm.edu/~jbrink/365/Documents/Calculating_tree_carbon.pdf\">difficult to do</url> for a single tree, never mind an entire forest. One forest fire and years of carbon storage literally <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-34966-3\">goes up in the air</url>. In addition, forest fires and cutting down trees for firewood are both parts of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/fire-in-ecosystems-boreal-forest.htm\">healthy ecosystems for our forests</url>. Poor policy incentives could encourage or even require forest management for natural sequestration that leaves our forests completely untouched for decades in a way that is shown to be unhealthy by scientists and any Alaskan who's been in the woods.</p><p>Transitioning our state to renewable energy must come first. Sequestration will be incredibly important in the future, and I encourage Dunleavy and the Alaska Legislature to set ground rules for future Alaskans to benefit from this. However, it should not distract from the real goal of transitioning to renewable energy. Alaska has some of the largest sources of <url normalizedValue=\"https://acep.uaf.edu/media/50786/ACEP_Research-Briefing_StrandedResources.pdf\">renewable energy</url> in the nation, which can serve as the foundation of a renewable energy economy. Building that economy will take the same collaboration between the state government, private actors and federal government it took to <url normalizedValue=\"https://aoghs.org/transportation/trans-alaska-pipeline/\">build the pipeline</url> that made oil possible. This <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/03/SRREN_Full_Report-1.pdf\">collaboration to develop renewable energy</url> is where the state government needs to put its energy and budget to make this future possible.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Tvetene Carlson</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">was born and raised in Cantwell.

Meeting these challenges requires agility, a commitment to modernization and working with industry partners, said the agency's director.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"First and foremost, DLA is the nation's combat logistics support agency, which means we're very much in the mix when it comes to our nation's integrated deterrence strategy,\" said Navy Vice Adm. Michelle Skubic at the DLA Supply Chain Alliance Conference and Exhibition held May 3-4 at the Greater Richmond Convention Center in Richmond, Virginia.</p><p>The conference focused on building resilient supply chains, revitalizing domestic manufacturing and fostering growth.</p><p>DLA is working with other Defense Department agencies to stay responsive and enable the military services as well as federal partners and allies, Skubic said.</p><p>In fiscal 2023, DLA obligated over $48 billion in contracts for goods and services. The agency awards between 9,000 and 10,000 contracts every day, 94% of which are automated.</p><p>\"We rely heavily on our partnerships with industry to provide the support needed to maintain warfighter readiness,\" Skubic said.</p><p>DLA is continually transforming to support the National Defense Strategy and build a resilient joint force ecosystem, she added. Part of that effort includes modernizing the agency's business systems and processes.</p><p>\"We, like so many in this room, want to continue to leverage more sophisticated applications of artificial intelligence, machine learning and robotics in our procurement process as well as other processes,\" she said.</p><p>The Warehouse Management System is one example of DLA's modernization and will provide better asset visibility while allowing the agency to become more auditable.</p><p>\"WMS ensures we know what we have, where it is and what condition it's in, which is so crucial in supporting our warfighters every day,\" she said.</p><p>DLA's whole-of-government support has grown steadily over the last 20 years, she added. After the earthquake that hit Turkey and Syria in February, the agency quickly provided humanitarian assistance and disaster relief because needs were recognized before they were tasked.</p><p>\"We are the go-to for the State Department, for [the U.S. Agency for International Development], and for our allies and partners when it comes to necessary support in the humanitarian assistance/disaster relief space,\" Skubic said.</p><p>DLA also plans logistics support for annual hurricane and forest fire seasons by working with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and U.S. Forest Service. And during the COVID-19 pandemic, DLA provided $6 billion in lifesaving supplies.</p><p>In the face of a shrinking defense industrial base that has numerous challenges, Skubic said DLA is determined to work with its partners to provide the best support possible.</p><p>Of the agency's roughly 9,000 suppliers, about 7,000 are small businesses, Skubic said, adding that there's been a 22% decline in DLA's small business partnerships since 2016.</p><p>\"That trend has our attention,\" she said.</p><p>Despite challenges like inflation, economic instability, supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, DLA is still faring better than others in retaining small businesses, Skubic continued. In fact, DLA exceeded its small business goal for the 10th consecutive year in fiscal 2022 and topped its 3% goal in the historically underutilized business zone category for the second consecutive year.</p><p>DLA was also named Agency of the Year in February by the National 8(a) Association and National HUBZone Council for supporting small businesses.</p><p>Open communication with industry is critical, Skubic said. Data from DLA's recent supplier survey showed the agency is losing small business suppliers at about half the rate of the rest of DOD and less than the rest of the federal government.</p><p>\"While we're not calling that a success, we are just glad to see that there are so many staying with us. We hope to appeal to an even greater industrial base. We want to be a partner of choice for those considering supporting the military and our mission,\" Skubic said.</p><p>The agency saw drops in its survey ratings for timeliness and timely resolutions, while its highest-ranking factor was trustworthiness. Businesses that conducted over $10 million with DLA, non-profits companies and service providers were more positive in their responses. Small businesses were more critical.</p><p>\"It's imperative that we on the DLA side do all we can to retain the existing industry partners that want to keep doing business with us,\" she said.</p><p>She recommended that businesses that want to start working with the federal government reach out to one of the more than 95 APEX Accelerator centers, which offer free support to small businesses looking to compete for federal, state and local government contracts.</p><p>DLA remains committed to being as transparent as possible with its industry partners, she added.</p><p>\"We must work as a team; and good teammates are open, transparent and fair-minded in dealing with one another,\" she said. \"The importance of our partnership has never been more evident than now, as we support various changing missions.\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dla.mil/About-DLA/News/News-Article-View/Article/3384436/conference-highlights-supply-chain-resiliency-modernization/\">https://www.dla.mil/About-DLA/News/News-Article-View/Article/3384436/conference-highlights-supply-chain-resiliency-modernization/</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-8147573 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8147573</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:685F-T5F1-DYG2-R2WY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"915\"/><timeReceived>9:20 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"05\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>May 5, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In a similar direction\u2014although in lower values\u2014the average temperature of the seas at the global level increased. On the other hand, the retraction of Antarctic ice reached a new limit, reaching the historical decrease of 2016, but several months earlier in the middle of the cold season.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The combination of these records has led scientists who follow these processes to warn of the danger of a profound change in the currents that regulate temperature and life in the oceans and globally. The heat waves recorded on the coasts of a large part of the world\u2014in Ireland, Mexico, Ecuador, Japan, Mauritania, and Iceland\u2014may, in turn, be proof of this.</p><p>These phenomena, of course, are not limited to the seas. On Thursday, July 6, the global air temperature (measured at two meters above the ground) reached 17.23 degrees Celsius for the first time in the history of the last centuries, 1.68 degrees Celsius higher than preindustrial values; last June was already the warmest month in history. Meanwhile, temperatures on the continents, particularly in the North, also broke records: 40 degrees Celsius in Siberia, 50 degrees Celsius in Mexico, the warmest June in England in the historical series that began in 1884.</p><p>And its counterpart, droughts, such as the one plaguing Uruguay, where the shortage of fresh water since May has forced the increasing use of brackish water sources, making tap water undrinkable for the inhabitants of the Montevideo metropolitan area, where 60 percent of the country's population is concentrated. This is a drought that, if it continues, could leave this region of the country without drinking water, making it the first city in the world to suffer such a catastrophe.</p><p>But the stifling heat and the droughts also bring with them voracious fires, such as the boreal forest fire that has been raging across Canada for weeks, with more than 500 outbreaks scattered in different regions of the country, many of them uncontrollable, and the widespread images of an apocalyptic New York darkened and stained red under a blanket of ashes.</p><p>This accumulation of tragic evidence, against all the denialist narratives, makes it undeniable that the climate crisis is already here, among us. It also indicates the absolute failure of the policies and initiatives adopted to reduce the emission or presence of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In this direction, in May of 2023, the levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) measured at NOAA's global reference observatory in Hawaii reached an all-time high of 424 parts per million (ppm), becoming more than 50 percent higher than before the beginning of the industrial era and, those of the period January\u2014May 2023, 0.3 percent higher than those of the same period of 2022 and 1.6 percent compared to that of 2019. According to the latest report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the global surface temperature has risen faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period for at least the last 2,000 years, the same period in which international agreements and national initiatives to combat the causes of climate change were deployed. The failure of these policies is also reflected, in our present, in the persistence and strength of a fossil capitalism and its plundering and socio-environmental destruction.</p><p>Not only have these so-called mitigation policies failed, but also the so-called adaptation policies aimed at minimizing the foreseeable impacts of climate change are weak or even absent.</p><p>In the same vein, the annual report of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO, Global Annual to Decadal Climate Update) released in May 2023 warned that it is very likely (66 percent probability) that the annual average global temperature will exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius in at least one year of the next five years (2023-2027), it is possible (32 percent probability) that the average temperature will exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius, and it is almost certain (98 percent probability) that at least one of the next five years, as well as the five-year period as a whole, will be the warmest on record; The IPCC has estimated serious consequences if this temperature is exceeded permanently.</p><p>How close to this point will the arrival of the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon place us this year and possibly in the coming years? El Ni\u00f1o is an event of climatic origin that expresses itself in the warming of the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean and manifests itself in cycles of between three and eight years. With antecedents in the 19th century, in 1924 climatologist Gilbert Walker coined the term \"Southern Oscillation\" to identify it and in 1969 meteorologist Jacob Bjerknes suggested that this unusual warming in the eastern Pacific could unbalance the trade winds and increase the warm waters toward the east, that is, toward the intertropical coasts of South America.</p><p>But this is not simply a traditional meteorological phenomenon that recurs in irregular annual periods. It is not a natural phenomenon; however many attempts are made, time and again, to make invisible or deny its social causes. On the contrary, in recent decades, the dynamics of the climate crisis have increased both in frequency and intensity. Already in early 2023, the third continuous La Ni\u00f1a episode concluded, the third time since 1950 that it has extended over three years and with increasing intensity. Likewise, in 2016, El Ni\u00f1o led to the average temperature record reached by the planet. And different scientists estimate today that this Super El Ni\u00f1o may be repeated today with unknown consequences given the levels of greenhouse gases and the dynamics of the current climate crisis.</p><p>The banners of a change inspired by social and climate justice and the effective paths of this socio-ecological transition raised by popular movements are becoming more imperative and urgent today. It is possible to propose an emergency popular mitigation and adaptation plan. But to make these alternatives socially audible, to break with the ecological blindness that wants to impose itself, it is first necessary to break the epistemological construction that wants to inscribe these catastrophes, repeatedly and persistently, in a world of supposedly pure nature, in a presumably external field, alien and outside human social control.</p><p>This is a matrix of naturalization that, while excluding social groups and the mode of socioeconomic organization from any responsibility for the current crises, wants to turn them into unpredictable and unknowable events that only leave the option of resignation, religious alienation, or individual resilience.

Nearly half of all the wastewater coming out of households from their toilets, sinks, drains and gutters flows back into nature without harmful substances removed.</p><p>About 50 origami birds left Independence Avenue 1and2 Junior High School in Accra, Ghana, carrying the commitments penned by the pupils.</p><p>Jan de Vries Assan, a 13-year-old student, told UN News that he often starts the day by joining a long queue to get water, before school. \"The water crisis has affected my academic performance,\" he said, adding that by the time he finishes domestic chores, morning lessons will have been over.</p><p>Derrick Ofori, a teacher, said that his students lack drinking and handwashing water at school, expressing hope that leaders gathering at the UN conference \"do whatever they can\" to provide his communities with multiple sources of water.</p><p>For his part, he pledged to do whatever he can to conserve the precious resource at home. \"It sometimes feels wrong to use water for scrubbing the washroom or for washing hands, when we don't even have good drinking water at school\" he said.</p><p>Nearly 400 paper hummingbirds departed Japan, where origami, or the art of folding paper into shapes and figures, originates.</p><p>\"I realized that, like 'a drop in the ocean', what makes a big swell worldwide is our small action,\" said a student at Nishi-Uji Junior High School in Kyoto.</p><p>UN News/Grace Barret</p><p>Jean-Yves Vesseau, Principal at The Ecole school in New York.</p><p>Also making their way to the conference venue are thousands of origami birds from other parts of the world, including Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, France, Italy, North Macedonia, Mexico, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden.</p><p>Here in New York, The Ecole, a French-American school, engaged all classes from kindergarten to 8th grade in a World Water Day workshop, in which the students folded pieces of square paper into hummingbirds and wrote their commitments on them.</p><p>UN News/Grace Barret</p><p>LuAnn Adams, a storyteller, introduces the tale of hummingbird at The Ecole school in New York.</p><p>\"It is very important for children to think about water when they're small, because obviously our generation has a lot to answer for, and this is their planet,\" said Jean-Yves Vesseau, Head of School, stressing that they need to start thinking about this problem of water with urgency and be a hummingbird to do their bit for water.</p><p>LuAnn Adams, a storyteller, who performed her hummingbird puppet show at the school, told UN News that a hummingbird doing the right thing, even alone, creates unity of \"many in body and one in mind\", meaning that all the other animals would eventually follow her lead when \"they see the teeny tiny creature is exerting her all.\"</p><p>\"All of a sudden, that unity that spreads like a ripple, you know, gets into a wave, and a huge wave that can do something so masterful for the world.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125792690</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67TF-TJ61-DYTH-G4Y8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"700\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"03\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>March 19, 2023 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The investor community and EV promoters (whom some call EVangelists, which is a fabulously rich descriptor) certainly believe so. I'm not so sure, however - let me tell you why.</p><p>During a conversation onstage at the J.D. Power Auto Summit at the NADA Show in Dallas last month, Toyota sales head Jack Hollis leaned forward, cupped his outstretched hands together as though he were capturing rainwater and explained his company's somewhat controversial EV strategy in a different way.</p><p>\"Imagine,\" the former professional baseball player said softly, that his hands contained enough lithium to build one battery for one BEV. With this amount of the mineral, \"I can build one $68,000 EV. Or I can take this amount and build batteries for seven $48,000 plug-in hybrids,\" he said, keeping his hands still. \"Or I can take this amount and build batteries for 109 $30,000 Priuses with almost identical reductions in emissions.\"</p><p>\"Which should I do?\" Hollis asked the rapt audience rhetorically. \"If the goal is only about making electric vehicles, I make the one BEV. But if the overall goal is to reduce carbon emissions, then the best use of this mineral is to make the hybrids, because that lets more people participate and drives down emissions quicker.\"</p><p>Watching this in real time, and talking to Hollis later, it occurred to me that the longtime Toyota executive had hit on something uncomfortable that typically gets ignored in the industry's ongoing discussions about EVs, especially as it relates to investors.</p><p>Who gets to help fight climate change?</p><p>We all live on the same planet, and we all are beginning to see the weather impacts that science said are attributable to climate change in one form or another. Yet right now, investors and EVangelists on social media want to mandate a kind of purity test on those willing to help.</p><p>It's as though there's a raging forest fire coming up the hill, but the neighborhood watch tells you to go home and put your garden hose away because you're not driving a fire truck, and only fire trucks can fight fires. Your water apparently isn't good enough, and your contributions and those of your similarly equipped neighbors - who collectively can throw a lot of water on the blaze - don't count for spit.</p><p>Cutting carbon emissions by any and every means necessary is the reason this industry has spent hundreds of billions developing hybrids and BEVs in the first place; it certainly wasn't to make money. Yet the key to actual success in cutting emissions requires democratization of the goal and collective actions, especially across the transportation sector.</p><p>Hybrids and plug-in hybrids have had and will continue to have a role to play in reducing transportation emissions, especially in this period when charging infrastructure is not yet sufficient to service a full transition to an all-electric fleet. If fleet dynamics were logical and already based on a goal of ensuring the fastest reduction of carbon emissions possible, hybrids would be standard equipment, regardless of automaker or vehicle line.</p><p>They're not, of course, which is why we are where we are.</p><p>Sato has a huge job ahead navigating Toyota through the next few decades, and he'll no doubt have to make some tough choices that will pit logic and sound business principles against a vocal mob of purists ready to reject anything short of full battery electric, regardless of circumstances.</p><p>I wish him luck, because I think he's going to need it.</p><p>You may email Larry P.

On Thursday morning, the blaze was reportedly one half mile away from the Upper Timberline neighborhood.</p><p>Fortunately, after about two weeks of more than 200 firefighters working the project, fire protection lines are around 85% complete in the neighborhood and the process of moving fuel from nearby structures is finished. Despite the fire now reaching 3,605 acres, these efforts should ensure the highest priority of the crews \u2014 human safety.</p><p>Burning operations on the non-civilized end of the fire are taking place. According to a spokesperson with the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, firefighters are still looking to several weeks out for the blaze to be fully extinguished. It is 0% contained.</p><p>A daily news release from the Forest Service stated: \"The percent of containment on a fire is one measure of progress, but not the only one. Completion of firefighting objectives is</p><p>another measure of progress. These objectives include construction of control lines and protecting highly valued resources such as the Packwood community, sensitive tribal resources, and historic structures at Packwood Lake.\"</p><p>Neighborhoods northeast of Butter Creek and in Lower Timberline and Goat Rocks are still at evacuation level one, \"be ready.\" The Upper Timberline area remains at level two, \"be set.\"</p><p>According to James Donahey with the Cowlitz Valley Ranger District, some stands in the forest fire's track contain trees that are over 600 years old. Through oral history, record-keeping and determining the age of the majority of the trees, Forest Service staff have determined the area hasn't burned since the 1400s.</p><p>\"Back in the day, they would say, 'OK, all these trees are approximately the same height, similar composition on a similar kind of slope feature. We're going to call that a stand,'\" Donahey said. \"They would then go out and measure the trees in that stand, core some, determine the age of those trees. And you can kind of piece together a very visual representation of that fire history based on the ages of the trees within those stands.\"</p><p>To receive alerts from Lewis County in the case of an emergency, people can sign up at <url normalizedValue=\"https://lewiscountywa.gov/departments/emergency-management/lewis-county-alert/\">https://lewiscountywa.gov/departments/emergency-management/lewis-county-alert/</url>.</p><p>___ (c)2022 The Chronicle (Centralia, Wash.)

Whether the medicine, developed by Apellis Pharmaceuticals, can safely help patients maintain their sight for longer isnt yet clear, though, setting up a potential debate among eye doctors about its use.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The regulator cleared the drug, which will be sold as Syfovre, for people with the condition, called geographic atrophy. An eye injection administered once every 25 to 60 days, the drug is meant to slow the progression of the disease, a condition Apellis believes to affect at least 1 million people in the U.S. alone.</p><p>To some experts, the agencys decision is a milestone, marking at long last the availability of a medicine for a progressive and potentially debilitating condition.</p><p>This is the beginning of a new therapeutic era for geographic atrophy, said Eleonora Lad, an associate professor of ophthalmology at Duke University, and the lead investigator for the studies underlying the drugs approval. My patients are desperate for treatments that can slow the disease, she said in a recent interview.</p><p>The FDAs decision also boosts Apellis, a biotechnology company that aims to become profitable after years of losses. The companys only product, Empaveli for a rare blood disease, generated an estimated $65 million in net sales in 2022. Wall Street analysts believe approval of Syfovre could translate into $3 billion in peak yearly sales for the company.</p><p>We have built this company to be a large commercial organization, said CEO Cedric Francois, in a recent interview.</p><p>Apellis priced the drug at $2,190 per vial, according to a company presentation Friday.</p><p>The company could have a difficult time making its case to doctors and patients. In testing, Syfovre slowed the growth of a marker of disease progression, but not the degradation of patients vision. It missed its main goal in one of the two key studies supporting its application, forcing Apellis to ask the FDA to delay its review to incorporate more data. And because the drug doesnt restore lost vision, as medicines for other types of age-related vision loss can, patients may not easily see the treatments impact.</p><p>Treatment was also associated with a small, but increased risk of infections and inflammation, as well as the formation of new blood vessels, which can cause further vision loss and require additional therapy. The FDA placed warnings on the drugs labeling for those side effects.</p><p>The risks of their occurrence appear to grow with time, which has led some retinal specialists to question Syfovres potential.</p><p>In my opinion, this drug is all pain and no gain, said Demetrios Vavvas, an ophthalmology professor at Harvard Medical School and the director of the Retina Service at Massachusetts Eye and Ear, in an interview ahead of the FDAs decision.</p><p>We shouldnt base our decisions on emotions, or [an idea that] we have to do something because we have nothing else. That something may be worse than nothing, he added. Vavvas isnt associated with Apellis.</p><p>Geographic atrophy is triggered by age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, a leading cause of vision loss in the elderly. Damage to the macula the part of the eye responsible for central vision causes progressive deterioration in sight and retinal cell death.</p><p>As a result, patchy lesions form that, under a microscope, look like minute geographic maps. Those lesions get larger with time, creating blind spots.</p><p>Their growth cant be halted. While people with wet AMD, an aggressive form of the disease, have several drugs available that can restore vision, people with geographic atrophy dont.</p><p>Its like a forest fire you cannot stop, Francois said. You start losing retina in a relentless, irreversible process, and theres nothing for these patients.</p><p>Apellis isnt alone in trying to change that. Its medicine and another from a rival drugmaker, Iveric Bio, block activation of the complement system, a part of the bodys innate immune response. Study results from Iveric also showed its drug could slow lesion growth, and the FDA is set to decide on approval by Aug. 19.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHARMO-110261303</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHARMO2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67KN-YCH1-JDJN-61KD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428557</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-02-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"685\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Global Data Point.

The EU is financing purchases by the Swedish government of 2 new firefighting airplanes to add to the reserve. This adds up to a total of 13 airplanes and 6 helicopters that will be part of the rescEU fleet in 2020 and funded by the EU.</p><p>Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarcic said: \"Forest fires can hit at any time and climate change has broadened their range across Europe. We need to be ready this summer. I thank our Swedish friends who are strongly contributing to our rescEU firefighting. I am very proud to see our European forest fire fighting fleet in place to be prepared in the best way possible for this year's fire season.\"</p><p>rescEU Firefighting capacities</p><p>- The EU is funding seven EU Member States for pooling their airplanes and helicopters in the 2020 rescEU firefighting fleet, readily deployable to other countries in times of need.</p><p>- The rescEU firefighting reserve consists of 2 firefighting airplanes from Croatia, 2 firefighting airplanes from Cyprus, 1 firefighting airplane from France, 2 firefighting airplanes from Greece, 2 firefighting airplanes from Italy, 2 firefighting airplanes from Spain, 2 firefighting airplanes and 6 firefighting helicopters from Sweden.</p><p>Preparatory and monitoring measures for the 2020 forest fire season</p><p>The European Commission will continue in monitoring and coordinating to prepare for this year's forest fire season.</p><p>- The ERCC will monitor fires as they develop and maintainclose contactwith the authorities of the affected country.</p><p>- National and European monitoring services and tools such as the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) provide an overview of European data from national forest fire programmes.</p><p>- Regular meetings with EU Member States and Participating States to the EU Civil Protection Mechanism ahead of and during the season to exchange information on their state of preparedness and fire risks.</p><p>- The EU's Copernicus emergency satellite mapping service can be activated to map forest fires.</p><p>Background</p><p>Why was rescEU established?</p><p>The EU's Civil Protection Mechanism was so far based on a system, through which the EU coordinates the voluntary contributions of EU Member States and Participating States to a country that has requested assistance. Offers of assistance are coordinated by the European Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC) based in Brussels. In recent years, extreme weather conditions and new emerging threats have stretched the ability of Member States to help each other, especially when several Member States face the same type of disaster simultaneously. In such cases where there is limited or no availability of assets, rescEU steps in to provide additional capacities to confront disasters in Europe.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7134309 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7134309</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:602S-M9N1-DYG2-R1XT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"499\"/><timeReceived>8:30 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 6, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Kathy Hochul, D-New York, issued the following news release on June 6, 2023:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Governor Kathy Hochul and the New York State Departments of Environmental Conservation and Health provided an update today on the effects of ongoing Canadian wildfires on New York's air quality. More than 100 wildfires currently burning in Quebec are causing hazy conditions across much of the state. An Air Quality Health Advisory is in effect until tomorrow for Long Island, New York City Metro, Lower Hudson Valley, Upper Hudson Valley, Adirondacks, Eastern Lake Ontario, and Central New York regions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"When many New Yorkers walked outside today, the hazy skies caused by wildfire smoke were hard to miss,\" Governor Hochul said. \"New York State experts are monitoring our air quality every day to ensure New Yorkers have the latest information about current air quality in their communities and what they can do to protect themselves. I encourage New Yorkers, especially those sensitive to air quality, to take appropriate steps to help limit risk of exposure.\"</p><p>Earlier today, a media availability was held with DEC and DOH experts to provide updates on the effects of the ongoing wildfires on air quality. Last week, a DEC Forest Ranger and expert wildland firefighter was deployed to assist with efforts to contain wildfires raging in eastern Canada. New York State often deploys highly trained wildland firefighters to help battle fires as part of interstate and international firefighting compacts. The DEC Forest Ranger is serving as the crew boss of an interstate Northeastern Forest Fire Protection Compact crew comprised of firefighters from Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Maine to assist efforts in Nova Scotia. This is the first time a New York State Forest Ranger has been deployed to Canada since wildfires in Quebec in 2005.</p><p>Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Basil Seggos said, \"When these historic wildfires started in Canada, DEC meteorologists were closely monitoring weather patterns and other data to help inform air quality forecasts. DEC and our partners at the Department of Health will continue to keep the public informed with the latest on air quality alerts, and I also continue to hope that all the responding firefighters, including our Forest Ranger, remain safe while working to get these blazes under control.\"</p><p>Acting State Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald said, \"Given the heightened air pollution levels we are seeing across much of the state, the New York State Department of Health recommends that New Yorkers limit strenuous outdoor activity to reduce the risk of adverse health effects. People who are especially sensitive to the effects of elevated levels of pollutants, including the very young and those with pre-existing respiratory problems such as heart disease or asthma, should avoid spending time outdoors, if possible. Those who experience symptoms or have symptoms that worsen should consider consulting their personal physician.\"</p><p>DEC and DOH issue Air Quality Health Advisories when DEC meteorologists predict levels of pollution, either ozone or fine particulate matter are expected to exceed an Air Quality Index (AQI) value of 100. Today's advisory is due to fine particulate matter carried by the wind from the wildfires. The AQI was created as an easy way to correlate levels of different pollutants to one scale, with a higher AQI value indicating a greater health concern.</p><p>Fine Particulate Matter</p><p>Fine particulate matter consists of tiny solid particles or liquid droplets in the air that are 2.5 microns or less in diameter. PM 2.5 can be made of many different types of particles and often come from processes that involve combustion (e.g. vehicle exhaust, power plants, and fires) and from chemical reactions in the atmosphere.</p><p>Exposure can cause short-term health effects, such as irritation to the eyes, nose, and throat, coughing, sneezing, runny nose, and shortness of breath. Exposure to elevated levels of fine particulate matter can also worsen medical conditions such as asthma and heart disease. People with heart or breathing problems, and children and the elderly may be particularly sensitive to PM 2.5.</p><p>When outdoor levels are elevated, going indoors may reduce exposure. If there are significant indoor sources of PM 2.5 (tobacco, candle or incense smoke, or fumes from cooking) levels inside may not be lower than outside. Some ways to reduce exposure are to minimize outdoor and indoor sources and avoid strenuous activities in areas where fine particle concentrations are high. Additional information on ozone and PM 2.5 is available on DEC's website and on DOH's website (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/outdoors/air/ozone.htm\">https://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/outdoors/air/ozone.htm</url>).</p><p>Here in New York, dry conditions along the Lake Ontario Plains, Leatherstocking Region, and Southern Tier are resulting in a \"high\" fire danger rating. A high fire danger means all fine, dead fuels ignite readily and fires start easily from most causes, including unattended brush and campfires. Fires may become serious and controlling them difficult unless attacked successfully while still small. The remainder of New York State is at a moderate level of fire danger. An updated fire danger map is available on the DEC website (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dec.ny.gov/lands/68329.html\">https://www.dec.ny.gov/lands/68329.html</url>). While the statewide burn ban is no longer in effect, brush burning should only be done when absolutely necessary. Burning garbage or leaves is prohibited year-round in New York State.</p><p>Open burning is prohibited in New York, with these exceptions:</p><p>* Campfires or any other outdoor fires less than 3 feet in height and 4 feet in length, width or diameter are allowed.</p><p>* Small cooking fires are allowed.</p><p>* Ceremonial or celebratory bonfires are allowed. Disposal of flags or religious items in a small-sized fire is allowed, if it is not otherwise prohibited by law or regulation.</p><p>* Only charcoal or dry, clean, untreated or unpainted wood can be burned.</p><p>* Fires cannot be left unattended and must be fully extinguished.</p><p>For more information about fire safety and prevention (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dec.ny.gov/lands/42524.html\">https://www.dec.ny.gov/lands/42524.html</url>), go to DEC's FIREWISE New York webpage.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-updates-new-yorkers-canadian-wildfires-impacting-states-air-quality\">https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-updates-new-yorkers-canadian-wildfires-impacting-states-air-quality</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-8178783 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8178783</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DG-NMK1-DYG2-R0YT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1054\"/><timeReceived>9:00 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 7, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Val Demings[2] (D-FL). <br/>On The Lead Wednesday, the host welcomed Frost to discuss his victory, and also discuss President Joe Biden's student debt forgiveness plan. <br/>Tapper[3] noted there is opposition to the plan inside the NAACP, where there are complaints the plan is not audacious enough. <br/>He likened $10,000 in student loan forgiveness for Americans earning less than $125,000 a year to 'pouring a bucket of ice water on a forest fire.' <br/>Tapper asked Frost for this thoughts on student loan forgiveness. <br/>'I think it's a great step forward, but I completely understand what many advocates and the NAACP are saying,' Frost said, before he argued for canceling more debt. He added: <br/>A lot of folks blame our generation and say it's because we're living beyond our means, but we know the truth. It's not because we have lived beyond our means. It's because we have been denied the means to live. <br/>[] <br/>This is a good step forward, and when I'm in Congress, I'm going to fight to ensure we can do even more to ensure that people have relief that they need so they can live their lives without the shackles of debt. <br/>Tapper concluded, 'I don't blame Generation Z. Maxwell, let me just give you a secret: it's all the fault of the Boomers. Let me just tell you that. The Boomers ruined everything. Take it from a member of Generation X.' <br/>Watch above, via CNN. <br/>Have a tip we should know? <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tips@mediaite.com\">tips@mediaite.com</email> [4]; <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/24/politics/gen-z-maxwell-frost-florida-democrat/index.html\">https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/24/politics/gen-z-maxwell-frost-florida-democrat/index.html</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mediaite.com/politics/rubio-and-desantis-have-their-democratic-opponents-heres-what-the-polls-are-saying-about-november/\">https://www.mediaite.com/politics/rubio-and-desantis-have-their-democratic-opponents-heres-what-the-polls-are-saying-about-november/</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mediaite.com/tag/jake-tapper/\">https://www.mediaite.com/tag/jake-tapper/</url> [ 4]: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tips@mediaite.com\">tips@mediaite.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-ABMI110714166138683339825976100147</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABRM-8284</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:667F-F7B1-JCMN-Y18R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"355\"/><timeReceived>12:20 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Mediaite</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 25, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED PEOPLE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>TV</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Baby Boomers</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CNN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Florida</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Gen-Z</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Generation X</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Jake Tapper</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Maxwell Frost</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Val Demings</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000152</classCode><className>BABY BOOMERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D75A</classCode><className>GENERATION Z</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00098PM</classCode><className>STUDENT EXPENSES &amp;

Vladimir Putin winning a sham election and echoing Trump in his victory lap. One of Putin's former officials who's now turned on him is OUITFRONT with details on what Putin is really after when it comes to Donald Trump.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And Trump has one week to come up with nearly half $1 billion. And tonight, his lawyers say he does not have the money. We'll do the math on what properties he might have to sell and how fast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, Princess Kate's reported visit to a farm now raising more questions than answers.</p><p>Let's go OUTFRONT.</p><p>And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett.</p><p>OUTFRONT tonight, Trump wins in Russia. Putin today celebrating his own when of an unprecedented fifth term. By the end of this term, Putin will have ruled Russia longer than even Joseph Stalin. Just think about that, longer than Stalin.</p><p>And as Putin claimed his victory today, he had a message for the United States about Donald Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Can you consider it democratic to use the administrative resources in order to attack one of the presidential candidates in the U.S., using at the same time the judicial system?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURNETT: Putin really word for word echoing Trump's words, returning the favor of the myriad of complements that Trump has said about Putin over the years, like these.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He's taking over a country for $2 worth of sanctions. I'd say that's pretty smart.</p><p>Here's a guy who's very savvy. I know him very well, very, very well.</p><p>Putin respected me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURNETT: Well, Putin does not respect the United States or the very basic freedoms that it stands for that was made clear tonight by Russian state media, which claims that Putin's entire election win is actually a victory over the West.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OLGA SKABEEVA, RUSSIAN STATE TV HOST (through translator): The people showed that the attempts of Kyiv in the West to frighten us with terrorist attacks will not work. And the results of the election will allow Russia to accomplish all its set goals.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURNETT: Now, Putin won with 87.28 percent of the vote. Of course, there was no democracy or freedom of voting. I mean, just, just -- here's an example. Ukrainians and regions occupied by Russia, they actually were forced to vote for Putin. There were armed men in the streets as people vote.</p><p>Like in this picture which was posted by a Ukrainian official. These are images that of course are jarring to Americans, but not to the leaders of the countries that Trump has publicly praised.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Putin, very smart. President Xi is a brilliant man. How smart is Kim Jong Un?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURNETT: Maybe it's not what he says. It's that he's choosing to say those things in public and in such an adulatory fashion.</p><p>North Korea's Kim Jong Un, who was mentioned there was last elected with 100 percent of his country's vote. They didn't even allow the 87.28 percent business. And he just received a luxury limousine from Putin. He said, according to his state controlled media, that the Russian vote is a quote, sign of the Russian people's firms support for Putin.</p><p>And Chinese President Xi Jinping, who was unanimously elected to his third term as president again, no. 87.28 percent there. He sent his congratulations as well. According to she's state-controlled media. He told Putin the vote, fully reflects the support of the Russian people. Support of the people, again, voting under the watch of men with guns.</p><p>Trump, of course, has yet to condemn this. He has been silent today on Putin. So what is the reality of the Putin Trump relationship? Now crucial and front and center in the U.S. election.</p><p>Matthew Chance is OUTFRONT in Moscow.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: As he basks in the glory of a fifth term, President Putin is lashing out at criticism that he's carefully choreographed reelection was neither free nor fair. Instead, taking a swing at the U.S. political system, suggesting court cases involving Donald Trump were politically motivated.</p><p>[19:05:02]</p><p>PUTIN (through translator): Can it be considered democratic to use administrative resources to attack one of the candidates for president of the United States, the use of the judicial system? This has become simply ridiculous and a disgrace in front of the whole world.</p><p>CHANCE: Officially, the Kremlin says it has no preference who's the next U.S. president.</p><p>And amid a costly war in Ukraine, Donald Trump's claims he would end the fighting quickly if elected may play into the Kremlin's hands, pressuring Ukraine and to a piece still favoring Moscow.</p><p>The idea the U.S. and the West should back off military support for Ukraine to prevent escalation is also a theme Putin is pushing, after his recent election win.</p><p>PUTIN (through translator): A conflict between Russia and NATO will be just one step away from a full-scale World War III.</p><p>TRUMP: I will prevent, and very easily, World War Three, very easily.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>CHANCE: That overlapping rhetoric is now fueling concerns among Western officials, a repeat of the damaging Trump-Putin relationship of Trump's first term, which then President Trump backed Putin over his own intelligence services or the issue of Russian election interference.</p><p>More recently, instead of criticizing Putin for the recent death in an arctic penal colony of Alexei Navalny, Russia's most prominent opposition leader, Trump compared it to his own legal battles.</p><p>The sudden death of Alexei Navalny has made me more and more aware of what is happening in our country, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.</p><p>And this was Putin after his election when on Sunday night, mentioning Navalny by name for the first time.</p><p>PUTIN (through translator): As for Mr. Navalny, yes, he passed away. It is always a sad event and there were other cases when people in prisons passed away. Didn't this happen in the United States? CHANCE: In a country shocked by the death and after an election condemned by independent monitors as unfair, it's one comparison with the United States the Kremlin is happy to make.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BURNETT: Amazing seeing that rally, Matthew. So how focused is Putin on the U.S. election right now?</p><p>CHANCE: Well, Erin, he says not very focused, that he's made the point repeatedly that Russia doesn't care who becomes the next American president. But what he said, he will do, he's focused on rebuilding the Russian military and in pressing ahead with the special military operation, what he calls his war in Ukraine.</p><p>So whoever the next U.S. president is, is likely to have a big impact on those Russian ambitions -- Erin.</p><p>BURNETT: All right. Matthew Chance from Moscow, thank you.</p><p>And OUTFRONT now, Vladimir Milov, the former Russian deputy energy minister under Putin, and an advisor to Alexei Navalny.</p><p>Vladimir, I so much appreciate your time when, you know, we hear what Vladimir Putin had to say. What is his opinion of Donald Trump?</p><p>VLADIMIR MILOV, ADVISED ALEXEI NAVALNY: Well, thank you very much for having me.</p><p>Putin likes Trump. They have a lot of common in style, and I actually have to convey a message to the American people because I remember very well how Russian democracy was dismantled, when I wasn't governments more than 20 years ago. They really have a lot in common in terms of authoritarian style and disregard for institutions, rules, checks and balances.</p><p>It's only the messages like it's me and I'm the only fixer of problems. You've got to give it all to me, all the power, the authority, and dismantle everything else. That was really happening in Russia 20 years ago. So Americans should be aware.</p><p>I think he senses a lot of common things in terms of personality with Trump, he really likes him. He expressed that many times.</p><p>BURNETT: And what does that mean for the role that Putin will play or try to play in this U.S. election from here on?</p><p>Well, I think Russia's will be very cautious about directly interfering in the election like they did in 2016, because they got caught and they don't like it. They was a pretty significant aftermath.</p><p>[19:10:01]</p><p>But generally, I think it will be more like a psychological PR message to the undecided American voters pretty similar to what Putin conveyed through his interview with Tucker Carlson. He was actually saying, listen, it's complicated historical stuff that we have with Ukraine. It's no business of yours.</p><p>I mean, just let it go. But also, if you elect Donald Trump will have so much better relations and this Russia problem will disappear and will go on the background. So make your choice.</p><p>I think there will be -- Russia will focus and Putin will focus on messaging to undecided American voters with one simple line, if Trump is elected, all the Russia challenges would disappear. This is obviously false, but this is what Putin wants Americans to hear.</p><p>BURNETT: Putin did something for the first time during his victory speech, Vladimir, he said the name of Alexei Navalny, who died suddenly in a Russian penal colony last month. He said his name and you believe this was an admission of his murder. How come?</p><p>MILOV: Well, absolutely, and he specifically did so because if you look at the more general context of his victory speech, he was obviously telling the Russians that folks, it's over. Resistance is hopeless. I not only won, but I will kill you. I will trample you under food.</p><p>And this is a stark contrast because exactly this is the why he first- time mentioned the name of Alexei Navalny in public because he was attaching the message like this is over. I killed him and I will go after anyone who resist. Resistance is useless, which is the opposition obviously encourages Russia's not to listen to that crap because this is specifically targeted psychological intimidation.</p><p>But he was that was his aim. He was trying to low the morale of the people who resist Putinism and to say to them, listen, I killed Navalny, I will kill you fight is hopeless. And this is over.</p><p>BURNETT: Putin also claimed in the speech Volodymyr that he'd agreed to a prisoner swap that would have freed Navalny for some Western prisoners. Of course, Navalny died and that didn't happen. The White House houses casting doubt that such a deal was under discussion. What do you think happened?</p><p>MILOV: I personally have very strong doubts. As a matter of fact, I do not believe that Putin ever agreed and would have agreed to exchanging Navalny I think it was all some sort of a tricky game.</p><p>And I think -- and I think Putin speech yesterday and his actions and the old circumstances of the murder of Navalny. This essentially proves that Putin was trying to trick everybody and he never intended to Navalny go, which means all please story. Once again, proves that you cannot believe a single word Putin says.</p><p>He breaks his promises at will and this whole situation is a pretty grim proof of that.</p><p>BURNETT: Volodymyr, thank you so much. Really appreciate your taking the time.</p><p>MILOV: Thank you so much. It was a pleasure</p><p>BURNETT: And I want to go now to the former CIA chief of Russia operations, Steve Hall.</p><p>So, Steve, you hear Vladimir there and I know over the years, of course, you may have known him. Obviously, he was in the Russian government.</p><p>Putting now claims that he won 87 -- what I say at 87.28 or 87.38 percent of the vote. What does that mean to you, Steve?</p><p>STEVE HALL, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: The thing that continues to fascinate me, Erin, is this -- is how quickly we sort of, even though we know better, how quickly we allow ourselves to slip into this sort of democratic lingo, democracy lingo that Putin wants us to use.</p><p>I mean, the whole idea that we're talking about percentages on really something that is nothing more than a Potemkin performance on the Kremlin's part is exactly kind of what Putin is hoping for. He hopes it in the West, people say, well, you know, they did have an election and maybe we have some problems with our elections, too. So, you know, it begins to give credence to some sort of believability, which of course, it isn't.</p><p>So I agree 100 percent with Mr. Milov that these elections were not even that and really play insignificant role for Putin or Russia at this point.</p><p>BURNETT: Remember that the anecdote about Basra Al-Assad's father when he got 97 percent and his response was, give me the names of the three.</p><p>All right. So is there any challenge to Putin, Steve, now or is he truly an essential usually a king in the concept of without worry of a coup or being taken out</p><p>HALL: I think he's in a really good position right now, Erin. I mean, look, what look, what's happened, okay? So the early days of the war, I was assessing that it was, there was a likelihood that the his internal circle might turn against him because things were going so badly in Ukraine those first couple of months and the alienation of Russia worldwide where he survived that. The inside advisers didn't -- didn't attempt to coup, or he survived it.</p><p>[19:15:10]</p><p>Then you had the whole Prigozhin thing, which was a mutiny at the least --</p><p>BURNETT: He was marching on Moscow. Yes.</p><p>HALL: He got halfway there, right? And he survived that and now, Prigozhin was dead.</p><p>Navalny, the biggest political threat, also dead. I agree absolutely with your guest that this was absolutely a message to the Russian people and that's why he used Navalny's name after he had killed him is to say, look, you guys want to end up like Prigozhin, like Navalny, like any of the other guys, Litvinenko, you know, the list goes on and on, poisoned, killed, then be an oppositionists and that's what will get you there.</p><p>He has very little to fear internally. Externally, there are some concerns, but internally, he's in a pretty good place.</p><p>BURNETTT: Reminding people of the trail of dead body. And it would be challenger.</p><p>All right. Thank you so much, Steve.</p><p>And next, the half a billion dollars tonight, Trump's lawyer saying he does not have the cash to pay in his Trump work fraud case. So are his properties about to get cease. He's literally just a few days here. Major developments occurring.</p><p>And a failed state. Machete-wielding militias in Haiti, battling gangs for control of the most vulnerable country in the Western hemisphere tonight. And our David Culver is there. He is on the ground and he will be live in Port-au-Prince.</p><p>Plus, Stormy Daniels speaking out even as Trump tries to get the hush money case thrown out and keep her from testifying. A judge, tonight, saying Trump is denied.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[19:20:55]</p><p>BURNETT: Tonight, Donald Trump could be on the verge of being forced to sell his most prized properties or have them seized by the state of New York within days. Trump's lawyers are admitting tonight, but he does not have the $464 million bond which is due by next Monday. He is appealing the judgment of the Trump Org fraud case.</p><p>And they also say that about 30 different insurance companies, 30, said they would not help Trump back the bond unless he had the cash.</p><p>So, now, Trump's pleading with the court to get out of posting the bond until his appeal is over, claiming that being forced to sell his properties now would cause irreversible harm.</p><p>OUTFRONT now, Erik Larson, legal report from \"Bloomberg News\", who has covered Trump and his properties for years, Ryan Goodman, OUTFRONT legal expert, and Stephanie Grisham, who was the White House press secretary for then-President Trump.</p><p>So, Ryan, okay, they're saying he doesn't have the money. 30 insurance companies denied -- denied this. So, now, he's trying to go to the court and get some kind of a delay while the appeal plays itself out.</p><p>Is there any precedent for that? Is there any chance that that Hail Mary of delaying the whole thing via the court works?</p><p>RYAN GOODMAN, FORMER SPECIAL COUNSEL AT THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE: So, I think if it did work, it would be unprecedented. So the court would have to abide by an exceptional circumstance that is not according to the way the system is supposed to work.</p><p>BURNETT: The way the system works, the way you'd be treated like everybody else would be -- no, sorry, pay by Monday.</p><p>GOODMAN: That's right. And if he's claiming irreparable harm from having to put up the bond, then a lot of people suffer irreparable harm in that situation. So that's why you'd be asking for something extraordinary. And that's the only way it gets out of it. So if we were to just try to predict what happens, he's not getting out of it.</p><p>BURNETT: All right. So, Erik, then the New York attorney general, Letitia James, recently had a warning for Trump if he was in a situation like this and did not pay up. Here's what she said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LETITIA JAMES, NEW YORK STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL: We are prepared to make sure that the judgment is paid to New Yorkers. And yes, I look at 40 Wall Street each and every day. If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, and then we will seek judgment enforcement mechanisms in court and we will ask the judge to seize his assets.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURNETT: Okay. Here we are -- ask a judge to seize his assets. I look at 40 Wall Street every day. The day that this all comes due is Monday, 40 Wall Street is one of his most valuable properties in New York at $270 million estimated. And you can go down all of the others that he owns part of. And you can see all the prices there, $160 million, $175 million, $500 million, in part in some of these.</p><p>So what happens now? I mean, do you just suddenly say okay, couldn't get the bond, couldn't get the backing, court doesn't go my way. So, suddenly, I'm selling a $500 million building in five days?</p><p>ERIK LARSON, BLOOMBERG NEWS LEGAL REPORTER: Right. Well I mean, this is this is what the conundrum that he is. And if he does not post this by Monday, he can still appeal. Of course, it's just that this verdict will be enforced immediately on Monday as you just show their with Tish James, saying she's prepared to go to court and do this.</p><p>BURNETT: Literally seize a building.</p><p>LARSON: Exactly, exactly, start a new case to go after it and that she could do that in multiple well states to. It doesn't just have to be in New York where he has properties, but the writing is on the wall that if he hasn't started preparing to sell some assets by now, that it could be pretty difficult to get this process done by Monday and clearly, Letitia James is ready to go to go to court. She's been preparing for this. BURNETT: All right. So, Ryan, quickly, it gets Stephanie in here, what happens then if he can't, he loses in court. It can't sell a building by next Monday, which he can't.</p><p>Then what?</p><p>GOODMAN: Then, Letitia James seizes his property, puts liens on all of his assets, bank accounts. And as Erik said, that doesn't -- it's not restricted to New York. So she probably at this point understands where he has different assets, in Florida, at Mar-a-Lago and elsewhere.</p><p>BURNETT: And what does that mean, he can't go in them or people can't go. What does that mean?</p><p>GOODMAN: Does mean that he would not be able to be fought out in some part in the courts. But for that period of time, its really becomes unusable. And how does he get any additional business going when these are under foreclose are being seized by the courts.</p><p>BURNETT: So, Stephanie, what does this actually mean to him? I mean, in the context of he's now publicly admitting that 30 insurance companies refused backing this bond.</p><p>[19:25:03]</p><p>STEPHANIE GRISHAM, FORMER TRUMP WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Yeah. The fact that this is now being covered by the media, this is going to be very, very hard on his ego and not just Donald Trump, but the entire family. This is going to -- this is going to hurt them. Its going to hurt their egos and I'm sure soon, it'll be tonight, maybe tomorrow, we're going to hear about the left-wing Democrats going after him, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p>You know, listening to you guys talk about his properties, though, I think if it were to happen, 40 Wall Street is probably the one that he would -- I mean, he would hate it. But I think if she tried to seize Mar-a-Lago or Bedminster or Trump Tower even -- I mean, those are his babies. You've got the Sterling golf course in Virginia.</p><p>Any of the properties with golf courses, I think would absolutely devastate him. So it'll be interesting to see what she goes for.</p><p>BURNETT: And how much does she have latitude there, Ryan?</p><p>GOODMAN: She has a lot of latitude. She might just go after those that she thinks are going to be able to be enforced the quickest. And that's up to her.</p><p>BURNETT: And that's -- it would appear 40 Wall Street is going to be on that list from what she said. But it also depends with Stephanie said, a golf course or something like that.</p><p>Irreversible harm when you go through the properties he thinks suddenly having to be able to be being forced in a position to sell building worth hundreds of millions of dollars in a few days, even have such a headline around you.</p><p>LARSON: Yeah.</p><p>BURNETT: It is irreversible harm in some sense, Ryan points out that would be the case for many people having to pay a bond, right. But nobody cares. They sought to do it.</p><p>But is he right when he says irreversible harm?</p><p>LARSON: You know, he may be right because as he said in his filing today, it would be a forest fire sale. It's not a great market for selling some of the types of properties that he has like office buildings, like 40 Wall Street.</p><p>BURNETT: Yeah. So it is possible that he would take a loss -- the idea being that if you won the appeal and overturn the verdict, that even if that were to happen, he would lose whose money from the sale that he would never be able to get back from the state. So, it's just a matter of whether this appeals court has mercy on him and says that's fine.</p><p>Let's -- let you post a smaller bond or no bond at all or treat you like everyone else and make you post the full amount. But it is, as you said, an unprecedented situation is a very large bond. Most surety companies don't do bonds this large.</p><p>BURNETT: Right.</p><p>LARSON: So the courts could look at it that way as well.</p><p>BURNETT: Stephanie, I want to ask you about one other thing. Since were talking Trump and obviously this, the impact, this will have in his campaign. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., we're learning more about his search for a running mate source familiar with conversations telling me that the best-selling author and life coach Tony Robbins was among the first people Kennedy approached late last year about being is running mate. Robbins made it clear he did not believe this was the right time and that in fact, he has political differences that became clear during conversations with Kennedy.</p><p>But we have confirmed that not only it was Robbins on a short list, but Nicole Shanahan, ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin is on a shortlist. Aaron Rodgers, Mike Rowe, Jesse Ventura, former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang. I mean, these are all names and some of them very celebrity like people.</p><p>Does Trump pay attention to that? Do you think looking at RFK Jr. and saying, okay, now, he's going for that celebrity star power that Trump thinks he owns?</p><p>GRISHAM: Absolutely. He's paying attention to anyone who is possibly going to challenge him in any regard, you know?</p><p>But I've got to say and maybe this is an unpopular opinion, I think that matter what that takes votes away from Biden, I think that Trumps base and the Republican Party are so behind him at this point that I honestly think anybody that Robert Kennedy Jr. would choose would take votes away from Biden, who just got -- we've got people that are going to be in the center and I just don't think they're going to go for Trump, I don't.</p><p>BURNETT: All right. Thank you all very much. I appreciate it.</p><p>And next, Haiti on the verge of collapse, violent gangs right now, choking off food and water, trapping more than 11 million people were live in Port-au-Prince on the ground. Our David Culver is there. And Donald Trump wants to get his hush money criminal case thrown out because of this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STORMY DANIELS, ADULT FILM STAR: It was really about two things, trying to keep the story from coming out, so that it would not hurt my husband and my daughter and I wouldn't lose my life.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURNETT: Well, the director of the new Stormy Daniels documentary will share more of those clips with us, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[19:33:50]</p><p>BURNETT: Tonight, Haiti on the verge of collapse, another shooting rampage today, killing at least ten people. Video into CNN showing the aftermath of bodies covered in white sheets lying in the streets. Country, of course, just hundreds of miles from the coast of Florida and is now in utter turmoil, machete wielding malicious, battling gangs for control of the capital.</p><p>The government gone food, water, fuel, cut off. More than 11 million people trapped in this hell, the border is closed. Airports closed. One flight carrying dozens of Americans was allowed to leave about 1,000 are still there.</p><p>Our David Culver is OUTFRONT. He is there in Port-au-Prince where the situation is so incredibly volatile and terrifying.</p><p>David, please just share whatever you can about what you're seeing.</p><p>DAVID CULVER, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hey there, Erin.</p><p>Well, today was a perfect example of just how lawless this situation is here in Haiti's capital city. They were confrontations going on from the early morning hours between police and gangs and even as you and I are talking now, you may hear some of the pops have gunfire that we have been hearing over the past few minutes, more confrontations between the police and those gangs.</p><p>But not just the police, Erin, the community members play a huge role in this.</p><p>[19:35:03]</p><p>Folks who live here essentially have to fend for themselves. And we saw that this morning, there's some of the images that you were talking about with the aftermath of the confrontation that happened starting around 5:00 in the morning, a surprise attack on to affluent neighborhoods and the folks their experience, some of these gang members going door to door, breaking in, opening fire within one house according to one source, and ending up with several people dead.</p><p>Now, it's not clear if those individuals were suspected gang members, if they are community folks. Nonetheless, it just shows how dramatic the situations are and its terrifying for these people, Erin, because they're in their homes and you would think perhaps you'd call for emergency officials to come in.</p><p>Police don't have those resources. We went to one of the police stations. They're overworked. They're strained. They have little to no ammo.</p><p>They say the gangs have more money and resources than they do. And they even showed us there squad cars that are running out of gas. Some of them just sit empty.</p><p>So imagine having to respond to a higher elevation three two miles up. It's not going to happen. So the community members themselves have to build these barricades. They have to set up a situation that they feel is a fortified area that then they can I actually tried to fend off until help comes in.</p><p>BURNETT: I mean, it's just unbelievable. People that are then forced to leave their homes if they deem that safer than hiding, there may be getting killed, hiding. They then have nowhere to leave the country. You're talking about just completely shut down. I mean, now incredibly difficult. It was for you to even get there.</p><p>So where are these people ending up?</p><p>CULVER: This is -- this is a huge issue because you have a lot of people who are moving up elevation, if you will, because in some of the lower parts, that's where the gangs have gone through when you have multiple gangs who are going through and forcing people out of their homes.</p><p>Oftentimes, they will then just torch their homes and loot and take whatever they need and then those people have to go from place to place because they will end up in one camp. That'll be torched. They then have to go to another. We went to one location which is a school and you have to imagine this indoor, outdoor school. We have some of the images.</p><p>And the folks there have been cramming into classrooms. There's only about a dozen and they have an estimated 1,500 plus people who will have made that their makeshift home. And we spoke to one woman who he met in one of the classrooms turned home.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CULVER: Where is all your stuff over here?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Uh-huh.</p><p>CULVER: And this is what you've had to take with you from place to place?</p><p>(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, they have already burned their house. This is stuff that she -- that people handed out to her.</p><p>CULVER: How difficult has it been to get basics like water and food?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: She said, you know, they had been supported for two weeks, but it's been two weeks that they haven't received anything.</p><p>CULVER: How much longer can this go on?</p><p>(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They don't know. Only God knows.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CULVER: So, we were in touch today, Erin, with one director of a local non-profit. He's going to try to get food and water to that location. And who then reached out to say, were also going to empty the septic tanks because they're overflowing. The issue is he found out that the septic tank companies have a backlog. Their trucks are sitting full. They can't get to the dumping site because gangs have blocked off those roadways.</p><p>What does that mean? It puts those folks at greater risk for cholera, which is surging right now. So, the gangs are essentially starving people. They're also attacking and killing them. And now you can see they're doing things like essentially creating an environment for illnesses to fester and ultimately, they're losing their lives to diseases.</p><p>BURNETT: Outbreak. David Culver, thank you very much.</p><p>Fortitude and courage it took for David to be there and to share all this with the world. We thank you.</p><p>And next, we have more breaking news just coming in. A judge has just rejected Trumps request to keep Stormy Daniels from testifying against him in the hush money trial. This is she is now revealing her conversations with Trump amid their alleged affair, and that is all just coming out in a new documentary out today. The director is my guest to share these never before seen clips with you.</p><p>And Princess Kate's reported appearance at a farm, leading to more questions. So what's really going on in the royal family?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [19:43:38]</p><p>BURNETT: Breaking news, a big loss for Trump and the New York hush money criminal case. The judge ruling against Trump's efforts to block testimony from Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels in what is expected to be his first criminal case to go to trial.</p><p>Now that trial was scheduled to start a week from today, the judge has delayed it until at least April 15th at this time though.</p><p>But this decision comes on the same day as the release of a new documentary about Stormy Daniels. In the film, Stormy says she accepted the $130,000 payment in 2016 to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Trump because she was scared for her life.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STORMY DANIELS, ADULT FILM STAR: My friend was like, you might actually have a problem. I don't want to scare you. But based on the things you've told me, now you're the whole Republican Party's problem. And they like to make their problems go away.</p><p>It was really about two things -- trying to keep the story from coming out so that it would not hurt my husband and my daughter. And I wouldn't lose my life, and that there'll be a paper for trail and money trial linking me to Donald Trump, so that he could not have me killed.</p><p>All I had to do is sign this piece of paper and collect $130,000.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURNETT: Of course, Sarah, Trump has denied having an affair with Stormy Daniels and claims he didn't know about the $130,000 payment made by Michael Cohen.</p><p>[19:45:08]</p><p>And Sarah Gibson is OUTFRONT now, the director of \"Stormy\". This is her first television interview since the film's release.</p><p>And, Sarah, I just think everybody should be clear. You've been working on this for a long time. Your documentary tonight officially out for everyone to watch on Peacock. And it happens to come as we have this breaking news, when a judge in New York says Stormy Daniels is able to testify in the criminal trial for Trump. And as I said, you've worked with her for five years on this documentary.</p><p>Do you think she is eager to take the stand? Is she ready to take the stand in this case against Trump?</p><p>SARAH GIBSON, DIRECTOR: I would say absolutely. She has a real fighting spirit and she's looking forward to being able to tell her story on the court and in front of the world, what happened during 2016. BURNETT: So its clear from watching these parts of your documentary, Sarah, that the fear and paranoia that is followed Stormy Daniels since her story first came out in 2018, you know, that that's just so present. You know, in the film, you see you confront someone following her, someone's following her and her daughter who is terrified in their car.</p><p>And then you also show us Stormy's horse shot by somebody with rubber bullets, abusing an animal after the address was leaked online. I mean, these are unbelievable things.</p><p>And I want to play another clip from the film where she describes how all of this intensified after Trump's indictment, and I do want to warn our viewers in this clip, Sarah, some of what Stormy says is graphic.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DANIELS: Back in 2018, that was stuff like liar, slut, gold digger. This time around, it is very different. It is direct threats.</p><p>It is, I'm going to come to your house and slit your throat. Your daughter should be euthanized. They're not even using bot accounts. They're using the real accounts.</p><p>I'm desensitized to some of it, but they've also become more violent with me. I'm more prepared with my legal knowledge, but I'm also tired like my soul is so tired. So I mean and I don't know, if I'm so much a warrior now as far as I'm out of (EXPLETIVE DELETED), man, I'm out of (EXPLETIVE DELETED).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURNETT: How much of the threats against her increased. And also in there we saw her, Sarah, in a way I've never seen her before.</p><p>I've -- you know, you see her as a human being.</p><p>GIBSON: Yeah. And that gets missed a lot. She has been reduced to just a headline for so long. Porn star Stormy Daniels, a one-dimensional person. No one thinks that she might have a family, that she might have a daughter, that she has a career that she is needing to salvage and make a living for families.</p><p>So I would say that the death threats have increased tenfold since the indictment and even more so since 2018 when the news first broke, and I would say that a lot of the trolls online feel very empowered to say whatever they want to her and to threaten her and whatever way they choose.</p><p>BURNETT: Tenfold. That is something just gives me pause. I mean, she gives her most extensive description to you in this film of her meeting with Trump in 2006. That meeting is the meeting that would ultimately turn her entire world upside down. And she tells you, Sarah that you went to a hotel to have dinner with them and then he calls her up to his room and she tells you they spoke about her career as a director and he dangled out potentially having her on \"Celebrity Apprentice\".</p><p>And then this is what she says happened.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DANIELS: He told me I reminded him of his daughter. I felt like he was being sympathetic to me. Ivanka is beautiful and she's blonde and I'm sure that she's had people assume that she's an idiot. But I felt like as the father figure who has watched his daughter be treated a certain way, could identify with me.</p><p>I thought we had this mutual respect, which is why it was so crazy when having no red flags whatsoever in a conversation, I came out of a bathroom to find myself cornered. I don't remember how I got on the beds. It was awful but I didn't say no.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURNETT: She's brutally honest there. And obviously, the former president has brutally attacked her, insulted her appearance, many other insulting things.</p><p>[19:50:01]</p><p>What motivates her to keep speaking out?</p><p>GIBSON: I think Stormy is a person who fought her way out of poverty in the South growing up and worked so hard to find a life for herself a family. And she will do anything for her family and to make sure that all the work, all the hard work that she did over all those years, it was not for nothing.</p><p>And she is a person who will not hesitate to speak up and say, say the truth, even when it's really uncomfortable and really detrimental to her. And she's a very exceptionally unique person in that she really thinks about the greater good and really just wants to make sure that the truth gets out there in this trial.</p><p>BURNETT: All right. Sarah, I'm really looking forward to seeing this and thank you so much. Really appreciate your taking the time and coming on.</p><p>GIBSON: Thank you so much for having me.</p><p>BURNETT: All right. Appreciate it.</p><p>And next, a very rare at this time, really rare sighting of Princess Kate. It comes as new questions swirled about why she is not wearing her wedding ring.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BURNETT: Tonight, Kensington palace finally acknowledging new images of what appears to be Kate Middleton out shopping with Prince William. The images taken on Saturday were obtained by \"The Sun\". This is AFP, one of the world's largest news agencies is publicly saying that Kensington Palace is no longer a, quote/unquote, trusted source.</p><p>Isa Soares is OUTFRONT.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ISA SOARES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The princess of Wales was spotted near our home on Saturday, according to \"The Sun's\" Matt Wilkinson.</p><p>Yet, those details fueled more speculation and conspiracy theories. Another weekend, another series of fake online rumors, this time drawing a firm response from Buckingham Palace.</p><p>[19:55:05]</p><p>A royal source telling CNN that King Charles is continuing with official and private business and the British embassy in Kyiv forced to go as far as saying that online rumors about the king's death are fake.</p><p>It's all adding to an ongoing sense of crises and uncertainty facing the royals. It's been just over a week since this image of Catherine, princess of Wales, and her children was released. The family photo, which was supposed to celebrate Mother's Day in the U.K., quickly became the center of a controversy over trust and image manipulation, with Catherine issuing a personal apology saying she edited the picture herself.</p><p>Speculation also swirling about why she wasn't wearing a wedding ring. Buckingham Palace was already facing at the very least, a health crisis, with King Charles stepping back from many of his royal duties as he fights cancer, and the princess of Wales, taking an extended leave after abdominal surgery. It's meant the royal families perhaps stretch more than there's ever been, with just 11 working royals, and only Queen Camilla and Prince William as senior members representing the king.</p><p>Combine that with questions over why the princess of Wales hasn't been seen in public and calls for more details on Charles' condition, it's perhaps no surprise. It's led to such a dent in public trust.</p><p>BIDISHA MAMATA, BRITISH BROADCASTER AND ROYAL WATCHER: This is the smallest crisis that the royal family has ever faced in the past. The royal family dealt with violent death, abdication, infidelity, all sorts of sins and crimes and scandals. Making your family photos look a tiny bit better is nowhere near anything on the scale of what the royal family have had to deal with before.</p><p>SOARES: While that may be the case, the rumor mill only adds more unnecessary pressure on the princess of Wales ahead of our next public appearance expected around Easter.</p><p>Isa Soares, CNN, London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BURNETT: And OUTFRONT now, royal historian Kate Williams.</p><p>And, Kate, you know, you hear Isa's report. And of course this is the topic you cover. I mean, \"The Sun's\" new images of what appears to be Kate and Prince William shopping this weekend. Of course, in the context here is spread speculation whether the images are real. The palace's response, no comment after they were forced to actually comment on rumors that the king was dead, which is a stunning thing to think they've comment on.</p><p>I mean, does any of this clear anything up for you?</p><p>KATE WILLIAMS, CNN ROYAL HISTORIAN: Yes. This is it, Erin, the royals have been in crisis. The last time we saw Kate, this woman were used to seeing almost immediately after she's given birth, up there in makeup and high heels. We didn't -- haven't seen her since Christmas day and Internet has exploded into rumor. The Mother's Day photo was supposed to stop the rumor. It actually increased the rumors that they intensified.</p><p>And over this weekend, we've seen a flurry of activity, comments from sources saying shed be out and about soon. And then this sighting at the Windsor farm shot and now these photographs which have been published in some publications, and it does look as if there's visit to the Windsor farm shop was real, that Kate is up and about.</p><p>I do think it was to a degree set up, but a way of seeing her, but certainly the fact that now every photo that the royals has put out as being doubted really suggests that problem that they have now with trust.</p><p>BURNETT: And this is the thing. I mean, you know, we live in a world where yes, you talk about infidelities and murders and all these things, but a world of A.I. and uncertainty in Photoshop. And what is real is, what is sparking this crisis?</p><p>The photoshopped image released on Mother's Day is when all -- well, actually not all of this, but a lot of this started right? There have been a lot of speculation before what was wrong with her and why wasn't she talking about it when the king talked about his diagnosis so openly.</p><p>In this image with all the photoshopping, it appears she's not wearing her wedding ring and now all of a sudden something that was completely taboo is now front and center and everywhere, which is the state of their marriage, Stephen Colbert is out publicly resurrecting an old rumor that Prince William had an affair and that is everywhere on social media.</p><p>Here's Stephen Colbert.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEPHEN COLBERT, TV HOST: So I think we all know who the alleged other woman is, say with me, the marchioness of Cholmondeley. What a beautiful name. Now there have been rumors, an affair between William and the marching band of chicanery since 2019. According to tabloids, back then, when Kate supposedly confronted him about it, he laughed it off, saying there was nothing to it. Always a good response when your wife accuses you of cheating.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURNETT: Kate, with all of this now getting such public airing, what is going on?</p><p>WILLIAMS: It's a disaster. It's a PR disaster. The radio silence is a PR disaster into it, conspiracy theories rushed and one of them was that marriage was in trouble.</p><p>These rumors have surfaced before. Everyone ignore them. Now they are being taken to a degree seriously and I just feel so sorry for Kate. She's been through surgery. It must have been tough.</p><p>And now really, it's very clear that they've got to do something to stop these rumors and efficient engagement.

More than 100 wildfires currently burning in Quebec are causing hazy conditions across much of the state. An Air Quality Health Advisory is in effect until tomorrow for Long Island, New York City Metro, Lower Hudson Valley, Upper Hudson Valley, Adirondacks, Eastern Lake Ontario, and Central New York regions.</p><p>\"When many New Yorkers walked outside today, the hazy skies caused by wildfire smoke were hard to miss,\" Governor Hochul said. \"New York State experts are monitoring our air quality every day to ensure New Yorkers have the latest information about current air quality in their communities and what they can do to protect themselves. I encourage New Yorkers, especially those sensitive to air quality, to take appropriate steps to help limit risk of exposure.\"</p><p>Earlier today, a media availability was held with DEC and DOH experts to provide updates on the effects of the ongoing wildfires on air quality. Last week, a DEC Forest Ranger and expert wildland firefighter was deployed to assist with efforts to contain wildfires raging in eastern Canada. New York State often deploys highly trained wildland firefighters to help battle fires as part of interstate and international firefighting compacts. The DEC Forest Ranger is serving as the crew boss of an interstate Northeastern Forest Fire Protection Compact crew comprised of firefighters from Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Maine to assist efforts in Nova Scotia. This is the first time a New York State Forest Ranger has been deployed to Canada since wildfires in Quebec in 2005.</p><p>Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Basil Seggos said, \"When these historic wildfires started in Canada, DEC meteorologists were closely monitoring weather patterns and other data to help inform air quality forecasts. DEC and our partners at the Department of Health will continue to keep the public informed with the latest on air quality alerts, and I also continue to hope that all the responding firefighters, including our Forest Ranger, remain safe while working to get these blazes under control.\"</p><p>Acting State Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald said, \"Given the heightened air pollution levels we are seeing across much of the state, the New York State Department of Health recommends that New Yorkers limit strenuous outdoor activity to reduce the risk of adverse health effects. People who are especially sensitive to the effects of elevated levels of pollutants, including the very young and those with pre-existing respiratory problems such as heart disease or asthma, should avoid spending time outdoors, if possible. Those who experience symptoms or have symptoms that worsen should consider consulting their personal physician.\"</p><p>DEC and DOH issue Air Quality Health Advisories when DEC meteorologists predict levels of pollution, either ozone or fine particulate matter are expected to exceed an Air Quality Index (AQI) value of 100. Today's advisory is due to fine particulate matter carried by the wind from the wildfires. The AQI was created as an easy way to correlate levels of different pollutants to one scale, with a higher AQI value indicating a greater health concern.</p><p>Fine Particulate Matter</p><p>Fine particulate matter consists of tiny solid particles or liquid droplets in the air that are 2.5 microns or less in diameter. PM 2.5 can be made of many different types of particles and often come from processes that involve combustion (e.g. vehicle exhaust, power plants, and fires) and from chemical reactions in the atmosphere.</p><p>Exposure can cause short-term health effects, such as irritation to the eyes, nose, and throat, coughing, sneezing, runny nose, and shortness of breath. Exposure to elevated levels of fine particulate matter can also worsen medical conditions such as asthma and heart disease. People with heart or breathing problems, and children and the elderly may be particularly sensitive to PM 2.5.</p><p>When outdoor levels are elevated, going indoors may reduce exposure. If there are significant indoor sources of PM 2.5 (tobacco, candle or incense smoke, or fumes from cooking) levels inside may not be lower than outside. Some ways to reduce exposure are to minimize outdoor and indoor sources and avoid strenuous activities in areas where fine particle concentrations are high. Additional information on ozone and PM 2.5 is available on DEC's website and on DOH's website.</p><p>Here in New York, dry conditions along the Lake Ontario Plains, Leatherstocking Region, and Southern Tier are resulting in a \"high\" fire danger rating. A high fire danger means all fine, dead fuels ignite readily and fires start easily from most causes, including unattended brush and campfires. Fires may become serious and controlling them difficult unless attacked successfully while still small. The remainder of New York State is at a moderate level of fire danger. An updated fire danger map is available on the DEC website. While the statewide burn ban is no longer in effect, brush burning should only be done when absolutely necessary. Burning garbage or leaves is prohibited year-round in New York State.</p><p>Open burning is prohibited in New York, with these exceptions:</p><p>Campfires or any other outdoor fires less than 3 feet in height and 4 feet in length, width or diameter are allowed.</p><p>Small cooking fires are allowed.</p><p>Ceremonial or celebratory bonfires are allowed. Disposal of flags or religious items in a small-sized fire is allowed, if it is not otherwise prohibited by law or regulation.</p><p>Only charcoal or dry, clean, untreated or unpainted wood can be burned.</p><p>Fires cannot be left unattended and must be fully extinguished.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125945393</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DF-1GB1-JCBF-S09M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1020\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 6, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

A target letter from federal prosecutors to Trump makes clear they are focused on Trump's actions in their probe - and not just on those around him who tried to stop his election loss. The move is a sign Trump may soon be charged again, making it his third indictment. Trump has already been indicted twice this year - first in a New York<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/30/politics/donald-trump-indictment/index.html\">hush money case</url> and again regarding his alleged mishandling of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2023/06/politics/annotated-trump-indictment-dg/\">classified documents</url>.

Covid-19</p><p>It has been more than two and a half years since the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, but the US intelligence community has yet to reach a conclusion about where the virus originated. The Wuhan Institute of Virology is at the center of a theory that Covid-19 escaped from the lab in late 2019, triggering the global pandemic and nearly 7 million recorded deaths. This week, the Biden administration <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/18/politics/biden-admin-suspends-wuhan-lab-funding/index.html\">suspended funding for the Wuhan research lab</url> following a monthslong review that revealed some safety concerns. The virus was first identified in Wuhan, China, but researchers have repeatedly denied that the lab was related to the outbreak. To complicate matters, China has blocked international scientists from freely exploring all <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/26/politics/covid-lab-leak-wuhan-china-intelligence/index.html\">hypotheses for how the virus emerged</url> - hampering research that could have potentially shone a light on the outbreak's origin.</p><p>4.

This comes as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Florida Gov.

North Korea</p><p>For the first time in decades, a US soldier is believed to be in North Korean custody. That is a scenario that could cause a diplomatic headache for the US while it, alongside ally South Korea, tries to keep pressure on Pyongyang as the isolated nation ramps up its ballistic missile tests and hostile rhetoric.

Andrew M. Cuomo issued the following release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Governor Kathy Hochul and the New York State Departments of Environmental Conservation and Health provided an update today on the effects of ongoing Canadian wildfires on New York's air quality. More than 100 wildfires currently burning in Quebec are causing hazy conditions across much of the state. An Air Quality Health Advisory is in effect until tomorrow for Long Island, New York City Metro, Lower Hudson Valley, Upper Hudson Valley, Adirondacks, Eastern Lake Ontario, and Central New York regions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"When many New Yorkers walked outside today, the hazy skies caused by wildfire smoke were hard to miss,\" Governor Hochul said. \"New York State experts are monitoring our air quality every day to ensure New Yorkers have the latest information about current air quality in their communities and what they can do to protect themselves. I encourage New Yorkers, especially those sensitive to air quality, to take appropriate steps to help limit risk of exposure.\"</p><p>Earlier today, a media availability was held with DEC and DOH experts to provide updates on the effects of the ongoing wildfires on air quality. Last week, a DEC Forest Ranger and expert wildland firefighter was deployed to assist with efforts to contain wildfires raging in eastern Canada. New York State often deploys highly trained wildland firefighters to help battle fires as part of interstate and international firefighting compacts. The DEC Forest Ranger is serving as the crew boss of an interstate Northeastern Forest Fire Protection Compact crew comprised of firefighters from Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Maine to assist efforts in Nova Scotia. This is the first time a New York State Forest Ranger has been deployed to Canada since wildfires in Quebec in 2005.</p><p>Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Basil Seggos said, \"When these historic wildfires started in Canada, DEC meteorologists were closely monitoring weather patterns and other data to help inform air quality forecasts. DEC and our partners at the Department of Health will continue to keep the public informed with the latest on air quality alerts, and I also continue to hope that all the responding firefighters, including our Forest Ranger, remain safe while working to get these blazes under control.\"</p><p>Acting State Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald said, \"Given the heightened air pollution levels we are seeing across much of the state, the New York State Department of Health recommends that New Yorkers limit strenuous outdoor activity to reduce the risk of adverse health effects. People who are especially sensitive to the effects of elevated levels of pollutants, including the very young and those with pre-existing respiratory problems such as heart disease or asthma, should avoid spending time outdoors, if possible. Those who experience symptoms or have symptoms that worsen should consider consulting their personal physician.\"</p><p>DEC and DOH issue Air Quality Health Advisories when DEC meteorologists predict levels of pollution, either ozone or fine particulate matter are expected to exceed an Air Quality Index (AQI) value of 100. Today's advisory is due to fine particulate matter carried by the wind from the wildfires. The AQI was created as an easy way to correlate levels of different pollutants to one scale, with a higher AQI value indicating a greater health concern.</p><p>Fine Particulate Matter</p><p>Fine particulate matter consists of tiny solid particles or liquid droplets in the air that are 2.5 microns or less in diameter. PM 2.5 can be made of many different types of particles and often come from processes that involve combustion (e.g. vehicle exhaust, power plants, and fires) and from chemical reactions in the atmosphere.</p><p>Exposure can cause short-term health effects, such as irritation to the eyes, nose, and throat, coughing, sneezing, runny nose, and shortness of breath. Exposure to elevated levels of fine particulate matter can also worsen medical conditions such as asthma and heart disease. People with heart or breathing problems, and children and the elderly may be particularly sensitive to PM 2.5.</p><p>When outdoor levels are elevated, going indoors may reduce exposure. If there are significant indoor sources of PM 2.5 (tobacco, candle or incense smoke, or fumes from cooking) levels inside may not be lower than outside. Some ways to reduce exposure are to minimize outdoor and indoor sources and avoid strenuous activities in areas where fine particle concentrations are high. Additional information on ozone and PM 2.5 is available on DEC's website and on DOH's website.</p><p>Here in New York, dry conditions along the Lake Ontario Plains, Leatherstocking Region, and Southern Tier are resulting in a \"high\" fire danger rating. A high fire danger means all fine, dead fuels ignite readily and fires start easily from most causes, including unattended brush and campfires. Fires may become serious and controlling them difficult unless attacked successfully while still small. The remainder of New York State is at a moderate level of fire danger. An updated fire danger map is available on the DEC website. While the statewide burn ban is no longer in effect, brush burning should only be done when absolutely necessary. Burning garbage or leaves is prohibited year-round in New York State.</p><p>Open burning is prohibited in New York, with these exceptions:</p><p>* Campfires or any other outdoor fires less than 3 feet in height and 4 feet in length, width or diameter are allowed.</p><p>* Small cooking fires are allowed.</p><p>* Ceremonial or celebratory bonfires are allowed. Disposal of flags or religious items in a small-sized fire is allowed, if it is not otherwise prohibited by law or regulation.</p><p>* Only charcoal or dry, clean, untreated or unpainted wood can be burned.</p><p>* Fires cannot be left unattended and must be fully extinguished.</p><p>For more information about fire safety and prevention, go to DEC's FIREWISE New York webpage.

Crews battling the Oak Fire in Mariposa County got a break from increased humidity levels as monsoonal moisture moved through the Sierra Nevada foothills, said a report this morning by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire. After minimal growth yesterday and overnight, the blaze had consumed more than 28 square miles of forestland, with 26 percent containment by today, Cal Fire said. </p><p>The cause was under investigation. \"Fire crews continue providing structure defense, extinguishing hot spots, and building and improving direct fire lines,\" the report said. About 6,000 residents from mountain communities were still under evacuation orders while heavy smoke from the fire drifted more than 200 miles, reaching Lake Tahoe, parts of Nevada and the San Francisco Bay Area, officials said. Nearly 3,000 firefighters with aircraft support were battling the blaze that erupted last Friday southwest of the park, near the town of Midpines. It exploded in size on Saturday as flames churned through tinder-dry brush and trees amid the worst drought in decades. Numerous roads were closed, including a stretch of State Route 140 that's one of the main routes into Yosemite. California has experienced increasingly larger and deadlier wildfires as climate change has made the West much warmer and drier over the past 30 years. Scientists have said weather will continue to be more extreme and wildfires more frequent, destructive and unpredictable. The Oak Fire burned as firefighters also made progress against an earlier blaze that burned to the edge of a grove of giant sequoias in the southernmost part of Yosemite. The Washburn Fire, spanning a 7.6-square-mile area, was 87 percent contained today after burning for more than two weeks and moving into the Sierra National Forest.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EENWPM-000001823bf2d7d7a3c2fbfa4e2f0000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EENWPM2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6674-HSS1-F066-G1MV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">302445</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"341\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>E&amp;E News PM</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"07\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>July 26, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Choking smoke, increasingly common[2] in Western Canada during fire season, blanketed more populous eastern cities[3] and led to more coverage and concern for what's happening when it comes to Canada's wildfires. </p><p><br/>Hot conditions, lightning, human carelessness and forests left cluttered and itching for rebirth have all contributed to the infernos this year. <br/>It's a pattern the country is likely to see repeated in the coming decades. Temperatures are expected to rise with climate change. Precipitation is expected to be erratic. Disease and pests are killing or weakening trees and forests are continuously managed for industry, homes and infrastructure, a practice that has made forests more flammable. <br/>Here's a breakdown of how fires start and why they seem to be getting worse. <br/>What starts wildfires? <br/>Typically, nearly half[4] of all wildfires in Canada are caused by lightning strikes, but that can vary from region to region and from month to month. <br/>The B.C. government says the majority of wildfires each year are caused by lightning[5], while in Alberta, the majority are caused by humans[6] \u2014 including from off-road vehicles, campfires, fireworks, ammunition, industrial activity, agriculture, power lines and some arson. Some years it's not even close. In 2020, 88 per cent[7] of wildfires in Alberta were caused by humans. Between 2017 and 2022, on average 68 per cent[8] of wildfires were human caused in Alberta. <br/>The wildfire that ripped through Fort McMurray in northern Alberta in 2016 decimated the city and sent citizens fleeing. The cause of the fire is still not known, but it was likely human. Photo: Chris Schwarz / Government of Alberta <br/>The National Forest Database[9] shows between 1990 and 2020, 33 per cent of fires in Quebec were caused by lightning, while in Ontario the figure was 50 per cent. <br/>But according to the federal government,[4] fires that start from lightning do the most damage, accounting for 67 per cent of land burned. Lightning-caused fires tend to occur in remote areas and several fires can start at once during a storm. <br/>All of those flash points, like lightning, require a forest dry enough to burn. <br/>What has caused this year's fires? <br/>The great fires that have swallowed large swaths of Canada early this season started before lightning found its yearly footing and for a while there was an outsized number of, mostly accidental, human-caused infernos. <br/>From the beginning of May through to June 19, 2023, an analysis by The Narwhal of data from the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre[10] shows 34 per cent of the fires started in that period were from lightning, 40 per cent from human causes and 26 per cent were still undetermined. <br/>So far this year in Quebec, almost 47 per cent[11] of wildfires with known causes were started by lightning, while in Alberta, that figure is 22 per cent[12]. In B.C., 37 per cent[13] have been from lightning strikes so far this year. <br/>Ignition was driven by forests left parched by a dry spring and unseasonably hot temperatures across much of the country. Vast areas of Canada were experiencing drought conditions[14] as of May 31, with some parts of Alberta classified as extreme. Those conditions are expected to continue[15], despite a recent reprieve in Alberta as much of the province experienced heavy rainfall[16] \u2014 or even snow. <br/>Humans cause plenty of wildfires, whether through industrial activities or recreation. Lightning accounts for almost half of all fires that burn, but that depends on the region and the time of year. Graph: Shawn Parkinson / The Narwhal <br/>As wildfires continue to burn across the country, arson has been a source of debate, driven by misinformation. In Alberta it took on new meaning when it was amplified by Premier Danielle Smith[17]. Turning to conspiracy[18] in the face of anxiety is not an uncommon reaction when faced with the psychological impact[19] of all-consuming smoke. <br/>But the facts don't support the claims. <br/>The RCMP in Alberta said on June 14 that it is investigating 12 suspicious fires, but stresses that doesn't mean those are arson. <br/>What about forest management? <br/>Canada's forests aren't what they used to be. <br/>Decades of forestry and forest management have altered natural cycles and natural growth. An analysis of annual data from the federal government shows more than 930,000 hectares[20] of forest were logged on average in Canada between 1990 and 2020 \u2014 that's just over 1.5 times larger than the Greater Toronto Area. <br/>Historically, the boreal forest, which stretches across Canada, would burn periodically, with species, including black spruce and lodgepole pine, dependent on fire for regeneration. The commercial value of trees for timber changed priorities. <br/><br/><br/> We've tripled our Prairies coverage The Narwhal's Prairies bureau is here to bring you stories on energy and the environment you won't find anywhere else.

We've tripled our Prairies coverage  <br/>Although there has been a shift towards recognizing the ecological importance of fire, governments have invested heavily in fighting fires before they can spread, in part to protect valuable trees destined to be logged. <br/>The federal government says[21] the cost to fight fires over the past decade have ranged between $800 million and $1.5 billion each year. <br/>When fires threaten homes, infrastructure, oil and gas installations and harvest areas for logging companies, firefighters sweep in to do battle \u2014 either fully committed to putting out the flames or letting parts of it burn while managing others. <br/>Logging north of Revelstoke, B.C. Protecting forest resources for timber companies disrupts the natural fire cycle and can lead to a buildup of wood and debris for fuel. Photo: Eddie Petryshen / Wildsight  <br/>Across Canada, fire agencies assess fires on a case-by-case basis while recognizing the ecological role of fire and the high costs of fighting them. <br/>'High-priority areas for protection include residential areas, high-value commercial forests and recreational sites,' according to Natural Resources Canada[22]. 'Low-priority sites are generally wilderness parks and remote forests of limited economic value \u2014 although protection of rare habitat, culturally significant areas and similar values will influence suppression decisions.' <br/>The consequences can be a buildup of fuel \u2014 the accumulation of deadfall, dense brush and more \u2014 that allows fires to burn bigger and stronger when lightning (or a careless human) strikes. <br/>Decades of putting out fires has led to a 'fire paradox' and makes fighting fires in the future more difficult, according to a 2019 paper[23] examining Canada's wildfire management. <br/>In other words, the more you protect a forest from fire, the more likely it is to eventually burn. <br/>Approximately 60 per cent of Canada's 3.47 million square kilometres of forests are 'covered by a management plan that includes production, conservation or other uses,' according to a 2017 Statistics Canada report[24]. <br/>Proponents of logging, often clearcut, argue[25] the practice aims to mimic the sweep of a wildfire, clearing the land in order to help it rejuvenate, but those practices don't necessarily achieve their ends \u2014fire-dependent species like lodgepole pine rely on heat and research suggests[25] logging doesn't reproduce the 'large numbers of small disturbances and the small number of extremely large disturbances created by wildfires.' Research has suggested[26] logged areas of the boreal forest are more susceptible to fires in the decade after harvesting, while areas that were burned are not. <br/>How bad is this year's wildfire season? <br/>In short, it's bad. <br/>There have been 2,727 fires so far this year, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre[10]. That's above the 25-year average of 2,420 fires by this time of year. <br/>But it's not just the number of fires, which can range from small outbursts of flame to enormous conflagrations, that matters. <br/>This year so far, 5.8 million hectares \u2014 an area larger than Nova Scotia \u2014 have burned, compared to the 414,215 hectares burned on average by this date over the past 25 years. By this time last year, a comparatively meagre 80,216 hectares had burned. <br/>The areas of Canada burned, by hectare, between 1983 and 2023 to date. It's just one way to measure the impact of this year's fire season, already high with many more months to come. Graphic: Shawn Parkinson / The Narwhal <br/>Since 1990, according to the federal government, fires have burned an average of 2.5 million hectares each year. So far this year, more than double that average has already burned. <br/>That's not to say there haven't been bad years, but this year is shaping up to be the worst in recorded history. <br/>Over the past 40 years, the biggest year in terms of areas burned was 1995, when 7.1 million hectares went up in smoke. We have just exceeded the second-worst year, 1989, when 5.9 million hectares fell to flame. <br/>The caveat is that location matters. When fires burn in the wilderness, away from infrastructure, homes and industry, they are often left to their own devices. That can impact the number of hectares consumed. <br/>Is climate change to blame? <br/>Weather is a big factor in how many fires are lit and how fast they grow. Hot and dry weather means forests are ready to burn and burn fast. This year's weather is an example. <br/>Models show climate change is having an impact. <br/>Between 1948 and 2022, annual average temperatures have increased 1.9 C, according to Environment and Climate Change Canada[27]. <br/>'Nine of the 10 warmest years have occurred during the last 25 years, with 2010 being the warmest on record (3.0 C above the 1961 to 1990 reference value),' according to the department. <br/>It isn't arson: untangling climate misinformation around Canada's raging wildfires[18]'It isn't arson: untangling climate misinformation around Canada's raging wildfires' \u2014 The Narwhal[28] <br/>At the same time, annual average precipitation in the form of snow, rain and all the other wet-sky stuff increased between 1948 and 2012[29] and that trend is expected to continue. Ultimately, the impacts will vary by region, time of year and whether and to what extent carbon pollution is curtailed. <br/>That might sound good for combatting wildfires, but projections also anticipate a feast-or-famine scenario, with extreme amounts of precipitation in short periods combined with dry spells. That can lead to both flooding and droughts. <br/>The changes in climate are also putting strain on forests with increased disease and infestation from mountain pine beetles and other pests. According to data from Statistics Canada, in 2020,nearly 18 million hectares[30]of forest was stripped of its greenery or contained dead-standing trees, courtesy of bug infestations. The result is more fuel for fires. The Canadian Wildland Fire Strategy[31], last updated in 2016, warns things are likely to get worse. <br/>'Wildland fires caused by lightning and humans are predicted to increase 18 per cent by 2050 and 50 per cent by 2100,' it warns. 'The growth of the wildland-urban interface, expanding industrial development and consequential results of climate change are compounding factors of this projection.' <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenarwhal.ca/author/drew-anderson/\">https://thenarwhal.ca/author/drew-anderson/</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-smoke-hours-way-up-smoky-summers-more-common-1.6846615#:~:text=Six%20of%20the%20last%20eight,12%20smoke%20hours%20per%20summer\">https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-smoke-hours-way-up-smoky-summers-more-common-1.6846615#:~:text=Six%20of%20the%20last%20eight,12%20smoke%20hours%20per%20summer</url>.

According to news reporting from Yakutsk, Russia, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Vegetation and soils of the North Taiga zone were studied in natural and thermokarst-disturbed areas of Yana-Adycha interfluve (northeastern Yakutia).\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Russian Foundation For Basic Research. <br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Institute for Biological: \"Soil research includes a description and physicochemical analysis of samples. The objects of study were selected taking into account the landscape diversity of the area experiencing permafrost melting due to pyrogenic factors under global climate change: young thermokarst and taiga untouched by fires and within the thermokarst basin of early Holocene. It was determined that the permafrost melting is accompanied by the transformation of homogeneous soil cover. After a forest fire, thawing depth increases and occurs redistribution of moisture and water-soluble matters. As a result, on the drier tops of byllars, the formation of albic material under the organogenic horizon is observed in the calcic cambic cryosol, which indicates a fairly fast transformation rate. In depressions, the forest is not recovered.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"In the mature alas, the vegetation and soil cover has a belt structure, represented by a combination of cryosols, stagnosols, and gleysols. In contrast to the soils of the Central Yakutia alases, there are almost no signs of lacustrine redeposition of soil, which indicates a difference in the processes of alas formation in different parts of the cryolitozone.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Dynamics of Vegetation and Soil Cover of Pyrogenically Disturbed Areas of the Northern Taiga under Conditions of Thermokarst Development and Climate Warming.

Scott announced today.</p><p>The fire, known as the \"Way Fire,\" ignited on August 18, 2014, in the community of Wofford Heights in Kern County. The United States alleges that the fire ignited when, as a result of SoCal Edison's negligence, an insulator broke free from its pin on the cross arm of a SoCal Edison power pole, allowing the conductor to come into contact with another conductor.</p><p>\"This settlement goes a long way toward compensating the public for the damage to public lands caused by the fire and the expense of fighting the Way Fire,\" U.S. Attorney Scott said. \"This office will continue to pursue recovery against those whose carelessness results in fires that place public lands and communities at risk and require public funds to suppress.\"</p><p>\"I'm pleased that this issue was resolved in a positive manner for our agency,\" Randy Moore, Regional Forester for the USDA Forest Service Pacific Southwest Region. \"A lot of time and resources go into both fighting fires and cost recovery, and recouping these costs is important.\"</p><p>Since 2012, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of California has secured settlements in more than 25 different cases involving wildfire damage to federal lands, with settlements valued at nearly $200 million.</p><p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Vincente A.

Settle scheduled sentencing for Oct 18. Wilke faces up to 10 years in prison</p><p>\"When people steal trees from our public lands, they are stealing a beautiful and irreplaceable resource from all of us and from future generations,\" said Acting U.S. Attorney Tessa M. Gorman.</p><p>\"That theft, coupled with the sheer destruction of the forest fire that resulted from this activity, warrants federal criminal prosecution. I commend the various branches of the U.S. Forest Service who worked diligently to investigate and hold this defendant accountable.\"</p><p>According to records filed in the case, between April and August 2018, Wilke conducted an illegal logging operation in the Elk Lake area of the Olympic National Forest, near Hood Canal.</p><p>In July 2018, just days after his release from state prison, another defendant, Shawn Edward Williams, 49, joined the conspiracy, helping Wilke remove maple from the forest and transporting it with Wilke to a mill in Tumwater. The type of maple harvested by the defendants is highly prized and used to produce musical instruments.</p><p>The case marked the first use of tree DNA evidence in a federal criminal trial. Wilke claimed the wood he sold to a Tumwater mill had been harvested from private property with a valid permit.</p><p>However, at trial, Richard Cronn, Ph.D., a research geneticist for the USDA Forest Service, testified that the wood Wilke sold was a genetic match to the remains of three poached maple trees investigators had discovered in the Elk Lake area.</p><p>The DNA analysis was so precise it found the probability of the match being coincidental was approximately one in one undecillion (one followed by 36 zeroes). Based on this evidence, the jury concluded the wood Wilke sold to the mill had been stolen.</p><p>On Aug. 3, 2018, the men decided to cut a maple tree that contained a wasp's nest near the base of the tree. To remove the nest, they sprayed insecticide and gasoline on the nest and base of the tree and then lit the nest on fire. They failed to extinguish the fire, which developed into a wildfire later named the Maple Fire.</p><p>The Maple Fire consumed more than 3,300 acres between August and November 2018 and cost approximately $4.2 million to contain. Some witnesses testified at trial that Wilke was standing next to the nest when it was lit on fire, and therefore appeared to have set the fire.</p><p>However, because the fire was set at night, they were not able to see his exact actions. The jury did not convict Wilke of the two federal counts related to the forest fire: setting timber afire and using fire in furtherance of a felony.</p><p>Williams, who testified that Wilke set the fire, pleaded guilty in December 2019 to theft of public property and setting timber afire. He was sentenced in September 2020 to 30 months in prison.</p><p>A U.S. Forest Service law enforcement officer and wildland firefighter were credited with preserving evidence in the case.</p><p>The case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Seth Wilkinson and Will Dreher.</p><p>Copyright 2021 Aberdeen Daily World</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCDWAW-news20210713NKDF4184798</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MCDWAW2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:634P-9691-F0HF-83JK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">475944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"584\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.
