The flames devastated a tenth of the entire Galician territory included in the Natura Network, a total of 37,819 hectares, a sad record in the 21-year history of this figure of environmental protection in the community. The data was released on Tuesday by the environmental association Adega after requesting it from the forest fire information network that depends on the European Commission. The figure coincides with the estimates of the Xunta, taking into account that the Galician president, Alfonso Rueda, estimated in about 120,000 hectares burned and the Ministry of Environment admits that a third of this destruction (about 40,000) corresponds to protected areas.</p><p><br/>According to Copernicus data released by the ecologists, this affection of fire to 10% of the Galician network of natural areas has been \"the most extensive of the century\" and triples the previous record of 2011. In Ourense, the flames burned more than half of the Massif Central and the Bidueiral de Montederramo, a birch forest of enormous ecological and historical importance, as it was the scene of the adventures of Romasanta, the werewolf that shocked Spain in the nineteenth century. The fires also devastated 20% of Pena Trevinca, almost 15% of Pena Maseira, and 7.5% of the Serra da Enci\u00f1a da Lastra. In Lugo, 5,389 hectares of the Ancares-Courel Special Area of Conservation (ZEC) were burned, more than 5% of its surface.<br/>The environmental association Adega claims to the Xunta \"means and resources\" to regenerate these territories that are \"home to very sensitive and endangered species such as the bear, the golden eagle or endemic flora\". \"The ecosystem services provided by these areas to society (water regulation, carbon absorption, erosion control, food supply ...) will take years to recover,\" warns the organization.<br/>Adega criticizes the lack of data from the Xunta. In his view, the \"opacity and misinformation practiced by the Regional Ministries of Environment and Rural Affairs during this wave of fires was matched by their laziness and inoperativeness\". And recalls the \"regrettable\" statements of the president of the Xunta, Alfonso Rueda, when he stressed that they had burned mostly \"stones and brush\": \"They are an example of a worrying ignorance and an unacceptable environmental trumpism\".<br/>The Department of the Environment admits that a third of the total burned area (120,000 hectares, according to Rueda in his appearance in Parliament) belong to the Natura Network, although he emphasizes that this is provisional data and asks for \"caution\". As a measure of restoration of these areas, the department of \u00c1ngeles V\u00e1zquez cites the aid that has been approved for municipalities and associations of forests to \"replace structural elements of trails and marked routes; fix infrastructure and facilities for interpretation of the natural environment; or restore elements of recreational areas\" in protected natural areas.<br/>On the other hand, the organization Ecoloxistas en Acci\u00f3n presented this Tuesday its first report on the state of the Natura 2000 Network in Galicia. The first delivery focuses on the province of Pontevedra and appreciates in these spaces a \"serious environmental deterioration\". The two areas analyzed, the A Ramallosa intertidal complex and the Ulla-Deza river system, lack specific management plans. The study of Ecoloxistas en Acci\u00f3n also claims that the mountain ranges of A Groba and O Su\u00eddo should be protected under this community figure. Galicia is at the bottom of the list in Spain in terms of the percentage of territory integrated in the Natura Network. In 2011, the government of Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o began to process a proposal for an extension that included, among other places, these two mountainous areas, but it was never approved despite the demands of the European authorities.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-73186701</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GS3-RCC3-RS97-72HJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"664\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 16, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Incendios forestales</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Espa\u00f1a</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Galicia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Ourense</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Red Natura</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Medio ambiente</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Incendios</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Xunta Galicia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Adega</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Ecologistas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Comisi\u00f3n Europea</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001511</classCode><className>RURAL COMMUNITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;

According to news reporting from Gebze Technical University by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Forest fires are typically triggered by natural factors or human negligence and accidents, spreading across vast areas and causing extensive damage to vegetation, wildlife, and ecosystems.\" </p><p><br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Gebze Technical University: \"Machine learning algorithms have recently become important tools for their efficiency in generating high-quality wildfire susceptibility maps in the literature. Despite their success in achieving promising thematic accuracies, they are typically criticized for their black box structure and their limited ability to interpret the resulting susceptibility maps. This study aims to address these limitations by exploring the inherent characteristics of geospatial covariates controlling the wildfire phenomena with local and global underlying factors of wildfire phenomena with the application of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). For this purpose, three ensemble machine learning algorithms, including random forest, XGBoost, and NGBoost, were initially inputted with 11 conditioning factors to produce wildfire susceptibility maps. The internal mechanisms of these models were then interpreted using global and local XAI techniques. The results showed that the NGBoost had the highest predictive performance with an overall accuracy of 81.42%, and outperformed the other algorithms by approximately 5% to 8%.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The global explainability analysis with the SHAP technique revealed that topographical parameters, such as elevation and valley depth, were the most influential factors in wildfire susceptibility. On the other hand, local analyses conducted with the LIME technique for three randomly selected instances highlighted the significant influence of parameters such as elevation, wind speed, and valley depth on individual wildfire cases.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Explainable Artificial Intelligence to Unveil Intrinsic Characteristics of Conditioning Factors Governing Forest Fire Susceptibility.

The all-time national record was set in 2022 with 131 confirmed tornadoes.</p><p>Last year also experienced the longest tornado season on record, lasting 240 days, with the first tornado reported in Malden Centre, Ont. on March 16 and the last one in Fergus, Ont. on Nov. 10.</p><p>The first tornado of 2025 reportedly occurred on April 12 in Rolling Hills, Alta.</p><p>Historical tornado data in Canada</p><p>Over the last few years, NTP confirmed the following number of tornadoes across Canada:</p><p>2024 - 1292023 - 902022 - 1312021 - 1272020 - 1102019 - 802018 - 1042017 - 71</p><p>Based on a 30-year period between 1991 and 2020, the average number of tornadoes per year is 64.9 in Canada and 18.5 in Ontario, Sillis said.</p><p>The NTP team is investigating why some years are less active, in terms of tornadoes, than others, with Sillis saying there are many factors involved.</p><p>Possible reasons for fewer tornadoes this season</p><p>Environment Canada couldn't provide a definitive answer as to why we're experiencing fewer tornadoes this year, but offered a hypothesis.</p><p>Meteorologist Steven Flisfeder said there are two possible causes why Ontario, and particularly southern Ontario, are experiencing fewer tornadoes this year.</p><p>One is that this summer has been dominated by high-pressure systems, which are typically associated with clear skies.</p><p>\"That would have the tendency to inhibit any kind of storms, any kind of convection, which would lead to lightning, which would lead to potential thunderstorms, which would lead to potential tornadoes,\" Flisfeder said.</p><p>\"That high pressure, which was very strong, very persistent throughout the summer, is a possible reason why there were fewer tornadoes than we normally see in a typical year.\"</p><p>The second possibility is related to all the forest fire smoke we've experienced this year, particularly in June and July.</p><p>\"There was a lot of smoke in the atmosphere, which has a tendency to reduce solar heating, which would help reduce the potential for thunderstorm initiation as well,\" Flisfeder said.</p><p>This is just a hypothesis, he added, noting a definitive answer would require further research.</p><p>Is tornado season over yet? Expert outlook</p><p>Sillis expects the number of confirmed tornadoes to climb before the year is out.</p><p>The NTP team is still reviewing satellite images from Canada's vast boreal forest, which could turn up more tornadoes from this summer that had not been reported yet due to the area's low population density.</p><p>\"So, the numbers from this summer will likely go up,\" he said, and tornado season is likely not over yet.</p><p>\"I suspect we haven't seen the end of the tornado season in Ontario, or Canada, quite yet. In fact, we've got quite a warm-up in the long-range forecast for southern Ontario, and that typically means higher potential for severe storms,\" he added.</p><p>More information on tornadoes in Canada is available on the NTP website. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KWREC-2025091676648926</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KWREC2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GRX-BGT3-RT4B-G2P1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247362</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"570\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

According to news reporting originating in Bethesda, Maryland, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Professional identity formation is central to physicians' identity over their full careers. There is little guidance within military service on how to leave careers as clinician educator faculty in graduate medical education programs.\" </p><p><br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, \"The objective of our study was to explore how leaving this community of practice (COP) affects a clinician educator's professional identity. We used reflexive thematic analysis with Communities of Practice as a sensitizing construct. Fifteen semi-structured interviews were conducted among active-duty clinician educators at the point of their retirement from the military. Interview questions focused participants' lived experiences as clinician educators and professional identity changes leading to and resulting from the decision to retire. We found the clinician educators' journey through a time of professional transition led to three connected themes: Loss Precedes Growth, Fallow Season-Liminal Space, and New Growth. The experiences of military clinician educators retiring from active duty demonstrate how leaving one COP emanates across a range of professional identities. In addition, the decision to leave a professional COP can lead to a sense of disloyalty to that community. Normalizing this transition in a way that honors the community's values offers the opportunity to enable the decision to retire.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Understanding retirement as a process that first involves identity loss, followed by the discomfort of a liminal space before achieving new growth creates the opportunity to engage in rituals that celebrate the service of departing community members, releasing them to grow into new identities.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Controlled Burn: Managing the \"forest Fire\" of Leaving a Professional Identity In Medical Education.

Political violence is a very real issue in America, fueled in part by the prevalence of hate speech and the availability of weapons, two things that the New York Times cites as things Kirk protected.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To many, in the wake of Kirk's death, this presented a form of irony that could not go ignored. This irony has been invoked to claim that Kirk had incited his own assassination. To others, this does not matter in the grand scheme of things, claiming that the tragic loss of human life should always be mourned, no matter the beliefs of the victim.\u00a0</p><p>This debate, along with the graphic footage that circulated on social media platforms such as X directly after the shooting, caused Kirk's death to spark large-scale political engagement to a degree that is unusual, even for events of this caliber.</p><p>NPR cites the graphic footage that a large number of people were exposed to as a possible spark that lit the reactionary forest fire of the internet's response.\u00a0</p><p>\"Seeing content like the videos of the Kirk shooting, or another video that circulated widely this month showing the fatal stabbing of a Ukrainian refugee in Charlotte, N.C., does have consequences for viewers. Those include heightened emotions, feelings of fear and vulnerability, and calls for revenge,\" said Nicole Hemmer, a political historian at Vanderbilt University.</p><p>The responses indicated in this article could be seen in the Instagram stories of people who weren't commonly posting about politics immediately after the shooting. Responses varied widely, from some calling for support for Kirk's family despite his beliefs, to others refusing to grieve for someone they claimed did not support their right to exist. The latter group typically called out the names of other people recently killed by political violence and the lack of media response to those events.</p><p>The most striking part of this debate was the sheer number of people who got involved. One could find people who hadn't posted on their story in years using that platform to share their stance. Why were so many people who typically took apolitical stances suddenly engaging in politics?</p><p>One possible reason is the sheer reach this tragedy had. Once the graphic video circulated and extremists from both sides of the aisle began to share their opinion on the matter, apolitical people were likely emotionally affected. As stated before, graphic videos like the footage of Kirk's assassination spark intense emotions.\u00a0</p><p>This fact, paired with extremist commentary that many apolitical people found offensive, likely caused a perceived need to arise among apolitical people to share their own less extreme views on the matter. Thus, outpourings of sympathy were fueled by both extreme takes by the far left and the far right.\u00a0</p><p>These likely well-intentioned calls for sympathy instead of increased infighting were then viewed by those with political views who are usually quite private about the matter. These people were then encouraged to post their views, which varied widely. Some expressed the idea that Kirk was one of many politically motivated deaths and that others, perhaps those that didn't have any association with politics, who could have incensed their murders, deserve just as much recognition and grief by the general public as Kirk. Others claimed that some were unjustly celebrating Kirk's death.</p><p>It is true that the news coverage and the general impact of Kirk's death was astounding, even leading to the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show, \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" This impact is not typically seen for victims of gun violence, even if they are high-profile.\u00a0</p><p>For example, the assassination of democratic congresswoman Melissa Hortman was not given the same amount of national attention. For example, flags were not lowered in response to this, while they were for Kirk. The assassination, which occurred in June of this year, did not garner nearly as much attention on social media, likely a reason for the lack of discussion and coverage nationally.</p><p>Regardless of your political position, it is clear that Kirk's assassination was a rare event that had almost everyone discussing politics. It is not every day that apolitical community members and people who like to stay private about politics weigh in on the national situation. For this reason, the impacts of Kirk's death will likely continue to make national news and impact public personalities on both sides of the aisle for some time to come.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-6203269</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GTK-66V3-RXWY-J1MJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"760\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Suffolk Journal: Suffolk University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 23, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Boston</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>MA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DHZR</classCode><className>POLITICAL VIOLENCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp;

The regional government defends that it cannot negotiate these improvements for the workers as it is not competent in a sectorial collective agreement, as a report requested for this purpose to the Directorate General of Labor points out. Specifically, the report, consulted by Europa Press, states that, although Tragsa \"is not entitled to negotiate\" this sectoral collective agreement, it can negotiate \"its own company agreement\".<br/>Specifically, the personnel of the Forestry Brigades of Madrid are governed by the Sectoral Agreement for the Prevention, Surveillance and Extinction of Forest Fires of the Community of Madrid, an autonomous sectoral collective agreement on which, according to Tragsa, \"is not entitled to negotiate\".<br/>As Tragsa's own president, Jes\u00fas Casas, recently explained, with the 2022 order, the public company took charge of this service in the region, \"subrogating it with the agreement that existed in the Community of Madrid and with the personnel that already existed\". In any case, Tragsa has emphasized that if labor improvements are included in the new order, it will apply them.<br/>Among the proposals put forward in recent weeks, the works committee has already expressed its clear rejection of the possibility of joining the agreement of the public company for the state Forest Fire Reinforcement Brigades (BRIF). Although the Community considers that it is \"perfectly legal\", the workers believe that \"it is clearly not an option\" and would generate \"legal insecurity\".<br/>DEMANDS<br/>The works council denounces the precarious and temporary situation in which they carry out their work and demands labor improvements for the collective and the negotiation of the collective agreement, which has not been revised since 2008.<br/>Among other demands, they ask to update salaries, frozen since 2010, to take into account the danger, hardship and toxicity involved in their work - they are not protected against carcinogenic agents -, and to put an end to the temporary nature of their work - 40% of the workforce is working four months a year.<br/>They also demand improvements in some bases that have been abandoned for 20 years or that Law 5/2024, approved on November 8, 2024, be applied, something that the Community of Madrid does not do.<br/>They are about 500 forest firefighters -about 350 in the off-season- who work in the Community of Madrid but are hired by the public company Tragsa.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-72464221</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GKV-9W53-RXXX-847F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"933\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 27, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0003QZR</classCode><className>SEPI - SOCIEDAD ESTATAL DE PARTICIPACIONES INDUSTRIALES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS212390 OTHER NONMETALLIC MINERAL MINING AND QUARRYING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>SIC1479 CHEMICAL &amp;

The Puma concolor, also known as mountain lion or American lion, extends from Alaska to the south of Argentina and Chile, being the wild mammal with the largest distribution area in the continent.</p><p><br/>In Argentina, this feline plays a fundamental role as a top predator, regulating the populations of wild prey such as the guanaco. Its presence is essential to maintain the ecological balance, since its remains feed scavenger species, such as the Andean condor. However, their relationship with livestock activity has generated conflicts in various rural regions of the country.<br/>The scarcity of natural prey in some ecosystems has led the puma to hunt sheep and goats. This has provoked reprisals by producers, including illegal hunting and poisoning of these animals. To reverse this situation, organizations such as WCS Argentina are promoting non-lethal coexistence strategies.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Coexistence strategies</emphasis><br/>Among the strategies that stand out are the use of night lights, sound emitters, protection dogs and Wildlife Friendly\u00ae certification. The latter improves the value of products such as merino wool and mohair, fostering a more harmonious relationship between producers and the puma.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Threats to the puma</emphasis><br/>The puma also faces various threats, such as the loss and fragmentation of its habitat, the advance of the agricultural frontier, road killings and harassment by domestic dogs. In the province of Mendoza, the feline is legally protected, which prohibits its hunting or possession as a pet.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">History of International Puma Day</emphasis><br/>The date of August 30 was established in honor of a rescue operation that took place in 2009 in the Pumakawa reserve, in C\u00f3rdoba. At that time, a forest fire endangered the lives of several specimens. Since then, the reserve has worked on conservation campaigns that include the closure of breeding grounds for hunting, the prohibition of trophy imports and coordinated actions with local producers.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Status of the puma population</emphasis><br/>According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the total puma population on the continent is estimated to be less than 50,000 and is on a downward trend. In view of this reality, specialists stress the importance of conserving healthy habitats and promoting a harmonious coexistence between wildlife and human activities.<br/>The post The puma in Argentina: an essential predator in danger first appeared on Peri\u00f3dico La Patria.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-72581424</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GMG-RFY3-S6W0-70JB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"424\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 30, 2025 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Internacional</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Argentina</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Ecolog\u00eda y medio ambiente</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Medio Ambiente</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> amenazas a la fauna silvestre</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> conflictos ganaderos</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> conservaci\u00f3n de pumas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> depredador tope</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> D\u00eda Internacional del Puma</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Equilibrio Ecol\u00f3gico</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> estrategias de convivencia no letales</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> h\u00e1bitat del puma</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Puma concolor</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX001511</classCode><className>RURAL COMMUNITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000523</classCode><className>DOGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000264</classCode><className>WILD CATS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001473</classCode><className>RESCUE OPERATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009OG7</classCode><className>MAMMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000CFER</classCode><className>ANIMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DL9T</classCode><className>HUNTING &amp;

According to news reporting from Hangzhou, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Forest fires have a great destructive impact on the Earth's ecosystem; therefore, the top priority of current research is how to accurately and quickly monitor forest fires. Taking into account efficiency and cost-effectiveness, deep-learning-driven UAV remote sensing fire detection algorithms have emerged as a favored research trend and have seen extensive application.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include The National Natural Science Foundation of China; Industry-university-research Innovation Fund of Chinese Colleges. <br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Zhejiang University of Science and Technology: \"However, in the process of drone monitoring, fires often appear very small and are easily obstructed by trees, which greatly limits the amount of effective information that algorithms can extract. Meanwhile, considering the limitations of unmanned aerial vehicles, the algorithm model also needs to have lightweight characteristics. To address challenges such as the small targets, occlusions, and image blurriness in UAV-captured wildfire images, this paper proposes an improved UAV forest fire detection model based on YOLOv8. Firstly, we incorporate SPDConv modules, enhancing the YOLOv8 architecture and boosting its efficacy in dealing with minor objects and images with low resolution. Secondly, we introduce the C2f-PConv module, which effectively improves computational efficiency by reducing redundant calculations and memory access. Thirdly, the model boosts classification precision through the integration of a Mixed Local Channel Attention (MLCA) strategy preceding the three detection outputs. Finally, the W-IoU loss function is utilized, which adaptively modifies the weights for different target boxes within the loss computation, to efficiently address the difficulties associated with detecting small targets. The experimental results showed that the accuracy of our model increased by 2.17%, the recall increased by 5.5%, and the mAP@0.5 increased by 1.9%.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"In addition, the number of parameters decreased by 43.8%, with only 5.96M parameters, while the model size and GFlops decreased by 43.3% and 36.7%, respectively. Our model not only reduces the number of parameters and computational complexity, but also exhibits superior accuracy and effectiveness in UAV fire image recognition tasks, thereby offering a robust and reliable solution for UAV fire monitoring.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: An Improved Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Forest Fire Detection Model Based on YOLOv8.

According to news reporting out of Mashhad, Iran, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"The increasing frequency and intensity of forest fires, driven by climate change and human activities, pose a significant threat to vital forest ecosystems, particularly where fire is not a natural element in the regeneration cycle. This study aims to identify the indicators influencing forest fire vulnerability and compare maps of forest fire susceptibility that are based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change tripartite model, with a focus on the vulnerable Hyrcanian forest region in Golestan Province, northern Iran, where forest fires have caused considerable economic losses.\" </p><p><br/> Financial support for this research came from University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna (BOKU). <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, \"On the basis of expert opinions and a literature review, we used geographic information systems, remote sensing and machine learning techniques to select and weigh 30 biophysical, environmental and socioeconomic indicators that affect forest fire vulnerability in the study area. These indicators were rigorously normalized, weighted and amalgamated into a comprehensive forest fire vulnerability index to analyze forest exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. We thus identified and mapped areas with very high forest fire exposure, high sensitivity and low adaptive capacity for urgent targeted intervention and strategic planning to mitigate the impacts of forest fires. The results also revealed a set of critical indicators that contribute more significantly to forest fire vulnerability (e.g., precipitation, elevation and factors related to biodiversity, human activity and economic reliance on forest resources).\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Our results provide insights that can inform policy-making, community engagement and environmental management strategies to mitigate the vulnerabilities associated with forest fires in the Hyrcanian forest.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Assessing Hyrcanian Forest Fire Vulnerability: Socioeconomic and Environmental Perspectives.

This rule <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">would support the work of investigators</emphasis> and make it easier for arsonists to be convicted with \"definitive indications and evidence\", as <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">currently strong indications are not enough</emphasis> to imprison the executor of a fire.</p><p><br/>This idea was already endorsed by the Andalusian president, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Juanma Moreno</emphasis>, who last week called for tougher penalties for those who cause fires considering that <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">the current Penal Code is \"innocuous\" for arsonists</emphasis>, whom he described as \"murderers\" of nature. A request made by the leader of the Andalusian popular after it was revealed that the evidence pointed to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">the Tarifa fire had been</emphasis> intentionally <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">set</emphasis>.<br/>In this sense, the Andalusian Popular will promote a rule to<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> remove obstacles to the prosecution of the perpetrators</emphasis> of the fires through its government in the Board. Thus, they intend to toughen the penalties for those who cause the fires, as well as to support the work of investigators by offering them more means to do their work.<br/>The Councilor of the Presidency of the Andalusian Government and coordinator of the Interior of the PP in Genoa, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Antonio Sanz</emphasis>, has also stressed that his formation is studying measures to change the rules. Thus, Justice will be able to act calmly -currently<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">if there is no evidence the arsonist is free within hours-</emphasis>when there is a \"regrettable circumstance, of bad intention\" that is to say, that everything indicates that the fire has been caused \"in bad faith\" with the aim of harming the environment.<br/>In this context, Sanz stressed the importance of citizen collaboration to identify the perpetrators of fires, which, he said referring to the fatalities that have occurred this month due to fire, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">can cause both material and personal damage irreparable</emphasis>.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-72307298</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GJS-G1B3-RS1P-J4TS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"331\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 22, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Andaluc\u00eda</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DZIO</classCode><className>CRIMINAL PROSECUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>STX000113</classCode><className>ARSON</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CA1O</classCode><className>BAD FAITH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp;

The study said that between 1959 and 2015, lightning played a role in about 50 per cent of wildfires, while the other half was caused due to anthropogenic factors.</p><p>Fires ignited by lightning led to a more extensive burnt area because they happened in isolated regions, unlike those caused due to anthropogenic triggers, because they were closer to human habitations and could be contained quickly.</p><p>Moreover, the lightning-induced forest fires were spatially distributed in clusters, overwhelming the fire management agencies to address them in multiple and remote areas.</p><p>Another study published in August pointed out cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning is a major source of summer wildfire ignition in the western United States (WUS). These fires are responsible for wiping out over two-thirds of the total burnt area in the region.</p><p>\"Smoke from these fires has detrimental effects on air quality and public health and has partially reversed air quality improvements stemming from the Clean Air Act. As the climate continues to warm in the WUS, the risk of wildfires - including those sparked by lightning - is projected to grow due to drier vegetation,\" the study said.</p><p>Lightning-induced wildfires to increase with climate change</p><p>It was also observed that climate change has led to alterations in surface heating, moisture fluctuations and circulation changes, which contribute to cloud-to-ground lightning occurrences and precipitation. This increases the risk of flash floods and slope failures due to heavy rain-producing thunderstorms, especially impacting recently burnt areas.</p><p>The risks in these areas may not necessarily be from lightning-induced wildfire but rather hydrologic hazards.</p><p>The researchers factored in Fine Fuel Moisture Code, Duff Moisture Code and Drought Code from the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) System to understand and estimate fire ignition possibility due to lightning.</p><p>The study predicted coincidence in cloud-to-ground lightning days with FWI by 2031 and 2060, particularly in the interior northwestern US.</p><p>Lightning-induced wildfires to increase with climate change</p><p>Apart from the US, wildfires have wiped out over 1 million hectares of forests in Europe this year, releasing volumes of carbon dioxide equivalent to the annual emissions of Sweden or Portugal.</p><p>Lightning was found to be responsible for triggering wildfires in Portugal and Spain.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Down to Earth.

According to news reporting from Sangju, South Korea, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Forest fires significantly threaten Indonesia's tropical forests, driven by complex interactions between human activity, environmental conditions and climate variability. This research aims to identify and analyze the factors influencing forest fires in Kalimantan, Sumatra, and Papua during the rainy, dry and all-season conditions using machine learning techniques and create vulnerability prediction maps and categorize risk zones.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Korea Ministry of Education; Korea Ministry of Science And Ict. <br/> The news editors obtained a quote from the research from Kyungpook National University: \"Eight years (2015-2022) of forest fire data were combined with 15 forest fire susceptible factors that consider of human, environmental, meteorological, and land use/land cover conditioning factors. Random forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) machine learning models were used to train and validate the dataset through hyperparameter tuning and 10-fold cross-validation for accuracy assessment. The XGB model was selected as the best performer based on accuracy, recall, and F1-score and was used to generate probability values. The evaluation showed that the accuracies and AUC values for the nine models were greater than 0.7, with AUC values ranging from 0.71 to 0.95, indicating good performance. Papua had the highest accuracy, with 90.5%, 91.6%, and 92.5% for all, rainy, and dry seasons, respectively. Population density, elevation, precipitation, soil moisture, NDMI, NDVI, distance from roads and settlements, land surface temperature and peatlands are the key contributing factors of forest fire occurrences. Vulnerability maps categorized into five risk zones, identifying high-risk areas that aligned with observed fire occurrences.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"This research highlighted the diverse characteristics of factors that determine forest fires and examined their impact on fire occurrences. The findings provide actionable insights for targeted fire management strategies, though future research should incorporate additional variables to improve predictive accuracy and address long-term environmental changes.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Assessment of forest fire vulnerability prediction in Indonesia: Seasonal variability analysis using machine learning techniques.

Brussels has 26 aircraft for the 2025 fire campaign for the whole of Europe. The unprecedented call for resources ended up unleashing the crossfire between the PP and the PSOE. The Popular Party reproached that same weekend that the resources had not arrived. The general director of Civil Protection and Emergencies, Virginia Barcones, replied that the PP presidents had asked for \"impossible\" and El\u00edas Bendodo called her a \"pyromaniac\".</p><p><br/>The Executive of Alfonso Fern\u00e1ndez Ma\u00f1ueco, who on the 14th assured that the Junta had \"sufficient means\", went on to request a day later, within a very long list, 20 personnel transport helicopters and 10 water bomber helicopters. The Junta, presided by Mar\u00eda Guardiola, in turn requested 10 amphibious planes and 10 light helicopters. The Xunta, led by Alfonso Rueda, generically requested \"all the fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters available to the central government\".<br/>To get an idea of the dimension of the resources demanded by the regional presidents of the PP - 40 helicopters and 10 aircraft - the Community Protection System, created in 2001 to strengthen cooperation between EU countries and improve prevention and response to such natural disasters, this year has 22 aircraft (Spain provides two of the 14 Canadair CL-415 aircraft to a fleet that completes 6 Fireboss aircraft and two Air Tractor) and four helicopters, according to data from the European Commission. In addition, Member States can make voluntary, ad hoc offers for specific emergencies in other countries. This is what has happened with two Chinook helicopters that the Netherlands offered to Spain in the wave of fires that have devastated more than 400,000 hectares in 15 days, concentrated in the provinces of Ourense, Zamora, Le\u00f3n and C\u00e1ceres, according to the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS).<br/>On August 15, Ma\u00f1ueco also requested in writing to the Minister of the Interior, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, 1,000 soldiers, 25 bulldozers \"with the most expert machinists possible in the bush\", 15 mother vehicles and 15 advanced command posts. \"In addition to these resources, it is necessary that the Government of Spain requests the arrival of new means within the European Civil Protection Mechanism,\" added the president of Castilla y Le\u00f3n in his letter, which was sent at 22.52.<br/>Half an hour before, the Extremadura Minister of the Presidency, Abel Bautista, \"having knowledge of the activation of the European aid\" - a decision that the Government formalized in the early morning of August 12, when it declared the pre-emergency - sent a request for troops to help in the emergency, moved a request for troops to fight the simultaneous fires that the community suffered \"since August 11\" and that at that time had burned about 5,000 hectares in Llerena (Badajoz) and 4,800 in Jarilla (C\u00e1ceres), which would end up becoming the most serious in the history of the region after burning more than 17,000 hectares. In his letter, the Minister \"urges to request new means to Brussels, with the activation of the following means for the autonomous community of Extremadura: 100 light trucks equipped with forest firefighters, 10 amphibious planes and 10 light helicopters\". Later, in another e-mail, he insisted on the \"deployment of operative means, heavy machinery and aerial means of the Army in Extremadura to help in the extinction tasks\". And he reiterated: \"The mobilization of means and resources arriving from Europe is necessary\".<br/>Two days later, on August 17, Feij\u00f3o accused the Government of not having appealed to Brussels for help. \"We have been asking for days to activate EU aid for more air resources and the deployment of Army troops and machinery. The Government has to stop always being late. I ask Sanchez not to let more time pass and the means arrive now,\" he posted on his account in X despite the fact that it was not so. As an example, on the 16th, two Italian air tankers provided by Brussels landed at the Matac\u00e1n air base (Salamanca) to fight the fires. Earlier, on the 14th, another two Canadair planes supplied by France and with a capacity of more than 5,500 liters each arrived in Galicia.<br/>The aerial resources deployed by Brussels in Spain in August were also four helicopters (two Czech and two Slovak Black Hawks). As for the ground teams, three teams of firefighters on foot have been provided by Finland, Romania and Greece - the EU has eight such teams, of which Spain contributes with two - and three teams of firefighters with vehicles (two from France and one from Germany) of the 17 existing ones. Since July, the European system has participated in 16 fire emergencies concentrated in the Iberian Peninsula and the Balkans.<br/>Dolors Montserrat, secretary general of the European People's Party, returned this Sunday to hold the government responsible for the severity of the fires of the last two weeks. \"In 2021, the Government of Sanchez asked for 401 million of the Next Generation for forest management and fire prevention and there are still 320 million to invest,\" she said. The Ministry of Ecological Transition claims that the Government has transferred 253 million to the autonomous communities for investment in prevention and extinction. Sara Aagesen's department assures that it has allocated another 149 million to the \"modernization of all the operational bases\" of the Forest Fire Reinforcement Brigades (BRIF) and the \"modernization of the avionics of the Ministry's aerial firefighting operations\".<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-72368180</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GKD-DFT3-RRR5-S1P8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"975\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 25, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001TJO</classCode><className>BOMBARDIER INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS336411 AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC3721 AIRCRAFT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>BBD.A (TSX)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Espa\u00f1a</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Gobierno de Espa\u00f1a</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> PSOE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> PP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Incendios forestales</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Comunidades aut\u00f3nomas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Castilla y Le\u00f3n</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Extremadura</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Galicia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Alfonso Fern\u00e1ndez Ma\u00f1ueco</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Protecci\u00f3n civil</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Emergencias</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N928000CC</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS &amp;

They demand the closure of the activities once the company promoting the plots was urged to voluntarily evict the people living in the enclosure of about 12 hectares. According to the Consistory that urges the forced execution of the closure of the illegal campsite, it is rustic land.</p><p><br/>What began about three years ago as a business venture of two brothers to promote a farm, was becoming a parceled space that have been renting to vulnerable people. \"Evicted people and vulnerable families started coming to us to ask for help and we let them settle in caravans, tents and huts,\" explains Bilal El Harrak, one of the promoters. Now more than 100 families live there, all of them highly socially vulnerable, including political refugees from South American countries and 50 socially deprived minors.<br/>\"We have tried to protect all these vulnerable people\" justifies El Harrak, although he acknowledges that they also get an economic return. \"There are families who, because of their critical situation, do not pay and others pay the monthly rent according to their capacities\". In exchange, they get well water and electricity supplied by several generators, \"just enough for a TV and a few light bulbs\". Each family has been building a home on the plots, \"some with motor homes, others with prefabricated modules and several with wood\".<br/>In the end, despite pressure from the authorities, \"we have been building a community that helps each other\" and gives shelter to families who have been left out of the social circuits. Some are evicted from their homes, others were living in vehicles and others were wandering the streets.<br/>El Harrak regrets that the City Council does not attend to the families sheltered in the campsite. Mari, an Andalusian with four children who needs regular dialysis, and a Venezuelan family with disabled children who had to flee their country, have their home there. Some Spaniards are at risk of exclusion, like the owner of a nearby farm whose wealthy owners left him abandoned to his fate, and others whom Sareb \"forced us to leave the apartment\".<br/>All this nonsense began 25 years ago when a famous real estate developer acquired the land \"thinking they could build luxury homes, but the mayor changed and the land was never requalified\". So they decided to rent all the hectares for farming, which did not bear fruit. \"We went bankrupt with the watermelon business,\" Bilal acknowledges.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">More than fifty minors at risk of social exclusion live in the area.</emphasis><br/>The City Council considers that it is a flagrant case of shantyism which they oppose head-on and which has been litigated for years with urban discipline proceedings and sanctions. The case has been taken to the Environmental Prosecutor's Office and the Mossos d'Esquadra. The land is located in a periurban area of special natural protection, next to the road to Mata and that, according to municipal technicians, \"has a high potential fire risk\" especially for its continuity with the Parc Natural del Montnegre i Corredor. \"The existence of people living continuously in the campsite increases very significantly the risk of forest fire\" they certify.<br/>The families affected by the eviction have initiated protest actions, such as the collection of signatures on digital platforms supported by social entities such as the Sindicat de l'Habitatge, which makes explicit the vulnerability of the people staying at the campsite. They warn that \"this new shantyism may end up being a trend\" if \"rentier\" options continue to be defended and evictions are carried out instead of \"attacking the root of the problem\".<br/>On the other hand, the neighbors of nearby urbanizations, such as Can Quirze, who are also clamoring against shantyism and the supposed danger it entails, support the municipal decision, as well as the farmers of the agricultural area of Les Cinc S\u00e8nies, who show their concern because more and more agricultural spaces are being \"scratched\".<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-73207692</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GS9-PS63-RS7W-K2W4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"682\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 17, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>vida</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008XWL</classCode><className>EVICTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX000166</classCode><className>INSOLVENCY &amp;

Another 25 deputies abstained.<br/>YOU MAY BE INTERESTED: EU accuses France of thwarting Gaza cease-fire by recognizing Palestine as a state<br/>The entire opposition, the extreme right and all left-wing groups, voted against in that motion that Bayrou decided to call to validate his gloomy diagnosis on French public finances and on the need for a 44 billion euro cut in the deficit in the budgets for 2026.<br/>Bayrou will tender his resignation on Tuesday, according to his entourage. He is the fourth prime minister to parade through the Elysee since the May 2022 start of Macron's second term, after Elisabeth Borne (until January 2024), Gabriel Attal (until September 2024) and Michel Barnier (until December 2024).<br/>POLITICAL INSTABILITY IN FRANCE<br/>Since the failed early elections of 2024, France has been experiencing a deep political instability without stable parliamentary majorities, in a context of high public debt reaching about 114% of GDP.<br/>The French presidency later reported that Macron will appoint a new prime minister \"in the coming days.\"<br/>Macron \"takes note of the result of the deputies' vote\" and \"will appoint a new prime minister in the coming days,\" the French presidency said in a statement, minutes after Bayrou's fall in a confidence motion.<br/>YOU MAY BE INTERESTED: Forest fire in France, one of the biggest in its history<br/>The far-right leader, Marine Le Pen, estimated that Macron has a moral \"obligation\" to call early legislative elections.<br/>Le Pen would not be able to run in the elections as she is sentenced to a disqualification sentence for embezzlement of European public funds. Her trial on appeal will take place between January 13 and February 12.<br/>According to the polls, these elections would again leave an Assembly divided into three blocs left, center-right and far-right and without stable majorities, although with a rise of Le Pen's party and a fall of the ruling party.<br/>Macron advocated last week to look to his left and try to attract the socialist opposition to the current government, formed by his centrist alliance and the conservative party The Republicans (LR).<br/>\"We are ready, let him come and get us,\" assured this Monday the Socialist deputy, Boris Vallaud, who specified, however, that it is now up to the \"left\", winner of the 2024 legislative elections, to form a government.<br/>YOU MAY BE INTERESTED: Devastation continues in France due to worst wildfire in decades<br/>The fall of a new government could lead Macron to resign.

According to news reporting out of Freiburg, Germany, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Forest fires are increasing in frequency and intensity worldwide due to the anthropogenic climate change, threatening people's lives and causing huge economic and environmental damages. Recent forest fire events suggest that forest fires are also an urgent issue in the European Alps, but studies assessing the forest fire hazard under future climate scenarios are still rare.\" </p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the University of Freiburg, \"Thus, this study aims to analyse the impacts of climate change on the probability of forest fire hazard across the European Alps and surrounding areas. In specific, we (1) explain the current forest fire hazard based on a set of environmental and anthropogenic parameters, and (2) map the forest fire hazard under current and future conditions across the study area using geographically weighted regression. Our results suggest that the fire hazard mainly depends on the frequency of lightning strikes, the annual mean temperature, and the precipitation seasonality. Overall, our results indicate a future increase in forest fire hazard, which is already significant under the SSP126 (+15.5%), while highest increases occur under the SSP370 (30.6%) and the SSP585 (35.4%). However, while the impacts are less pronounced in already fire-prone regions in the southwestern regions in France, the probability of forest fire hazard will greatly increase in the Northern and Eastern regions. Our findings emphasize the urgent need to address these climate-related challenges by decision-making and management through fire-smart forest management.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Nevertheless, further efforts are needed to overcome current limitations related to data availability and uncertainties in future scenarios.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Mapping the probability of forest fire hazard across the European Alps under climate change scenarios.

Levine found that industrially-managed forests are typically of higher density, have similar types of trees which are also of a similar age. This homogenous structure makes private forests more susceptible to wildfires than publicly-managed ones, with the scholars estimating that high-severity fires were 1.45 times more likely to take place at industrially-managed land than public. </p><p>But weather also plays a part in the risk equation. </p><p>High-severity fire risk increases under extreme weather conditions, particularly in hot and dry and when fuel moisture is low, according to the research. In hot weather, fire can spread crown-to-crown, making large trees a liability while diminishing the role of \u2018fuel ladders\u2019 such as vegetation that weaves onto the tree trunks from the ground up. </p><p>Importantly, even well-managed forests may experience high-severity fire if extreme weather is intense enough: </p><p>Ultimately, forest management holds the key to limiting fire risk in both private and public land: forests with reduced density and greater heterogeneity are at a lower risk of ever being felled by megafires, even in extreme weather conditions.</p><p>What forest fire risk means for business</p><p>These findings can be of critical importance for businesses investing in forest-based carbon credits, particularly in fire-prone regions such as California.</p><p>This is because high-severity fires kill over 95% of trees, impacting forest carbon integrity but also carbon permanence.</p><p>Businesses should therefore adjust their risk models to consider forest structure, ownership type, and regional weather and fire trends to figure out if they are making a smart investment; or whether a carbon credit scheme may be overvalued or vulnerable to reversal.</p><p>The study also highlights the importance of realtime monitoring of forest conditions and the need for buffer pools or insurance mechanisms to cover carbon losses from fire.</p><p>Source:</p><p>Extreme Weather Magnifies the Effects of Forest Structure on Wildfire, Driving Increased Severity in Industrial Forests</p><p>Jacob I.

And in one deeper spot, water levels have dropped, turning the brook into an isolated pool\u00a0of water.</p><p>Fen Boates-Bishop, a volunteer with\u00a0the Jijuktu'kwejk Watershed Alliance, said\u00a0this sometimes happens for a few days each\u00a0summer, but the fish here have been isolated for over two months.</p><p>\"There's a lack of oxygen, there can be a lack of food and competition for food and space in these pools, and that just leads to general stress for the fish and that could be harmful for them,\" he said.</p><p>And while he has seen this happen in other brooks that are outside wooded areas or on\u00a0private properties, he can't know for sure how many tributaries in the watershed have been affected, because he can't access them without risking a fine of up to $25,000.</p><p/><p>Kings County is one of the 11 counties where the woods ban remains in place.</p><p>Blistering temperatures earlier this summer meant water temperatures warmed to over 20 C, which was bad for the trout and white suckers' health, said\u00a0Boates-Bishop.</p><p>But for some species, warmer waters\u00a0are less problematic, said\u00a0Boates-Bishop.\u00a0He said\u00a0invasive species like chain pickerel adapt more easily to warmer waters, giving them an advantage over\u00a0native fish.</p><p>Commercial fisherman Darren Porter says eels can\u00a0handle lower water levels well.</p><p>\"Eels ...\u00a0can breathe through their skin if they're damp and move up and down systems to find safer spots,\" he said.</p><p>While rain is needed to restore water levels, Porter encourages people to think about how they use water in their homes or their farms.</p><p/><p>\"If we're using the water, the fish don't have it,\" he said.</p><p>Rachel Walsh, aquatic program manager for Clean Annapolis River Project, said her group is quite concerned\u00a0about Atlantic salmon.</p><p>\"For adults returning from the ocean, drought creates barriers to migration,\" she wrote in an email.\u00a0\"Low water and dry stream beds can block their passage to spawning grounds. Even if they do reach spawning areas, stressful conditions can reduce reproductive success.\"</p><p/><p>And while the group usually carries out projects to improve water flow and the habitability of spawning areas,\u00a0that work has now stopped.</p><p>\"However, with the current weather, woods ban and large forest fire in our region, we haven't been able to conduct any restoration work this summer,\" she said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MORE TOP STORIES</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewscanadanovascotianovascotiadroughtfish17621483</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GMX-CFG3-RWXH-M0D3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"453\"/><timeReceived>9:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 CBC/Radio-Canada.

which has allowed the Fasgar-Colinas fire, which was the only one remaining in Potential Severity Index (IGR) 2 in Castilla y Le\u00f3n, has been lowered to severity 1, so it has proceeded to dissolve the provincial CECOPI, since the regional was dissolved on Friday afternoon.</p><p><br/>This has been moved by the territorial delegate of the Board in the province, Eduardo Diego, after the CECOPI meeting held this morning, which has detailed that the fire has been lowered to severity level 1 Fasgar and Hills, therefore it has been discontinued CECOPI provincial as the situation has improved \"substantially\" as there are no more fires of severity 2.<br/>Thus, the forest fire of Fasgar and Hills has experienced a \"very favorable\" evolution during the night due to low temperatures and drizzle, which have helped to slow the progress of the outbreaks that were active in the area of Tremor de Arriba, but now remains to work on consolidation of the perimeter.<br/>For its part, in the fire in severity 1 of Llamas de Cabrera, the weather has also contributed to consolidate the perimeter of the west area and work continues on techniques and functions of liquidation of this fire.<br/>In the case of the Barniedo de la Reina fire, the perimeter is also stabilized and with reproductions which are being attended by the means available in the area, and work is also being carried out to consolidate the perimeter.<br/>The representative of the Autonomous Executive in the province has also pointed out that the fire of La Ba\u00f1a, which is also in IGR 1, has registered a \"very favorable\" evolution during the last hours, although there have been small reproductions near the quarry of La Ba\u00f1a that have been solved \"without major problems\".<br/>\"Therefore we can say that the situation is very favorable and positive, we no longer have fires that threaten populations or evacuated or confined populations,\" he added.<br/>However, Diego has assured that at this time \"you can not lower our guard\" as there are stabilized fires in which means are maintained deployed to perform consolidation work perimeter and surveillance, as long as \"the risk of reproduction has not disappeared.\"<br/>He also took advantage of the last meeting of the provincial CECOPI to thank the entire operation, the institutions and administrations involved and the State Security Forces and Corps, UME and Defense, for their work during evacuations and confinements, but also in research work of the various fires.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Also on Thursday night (4/9), flames were spotted in the S\u00e3o Pedro Valley, a vast region with countless waterfalls and more than 10,000km\u00b2 of preserved Cerrado. The municipal fire brigade acted throughout Friday (5/9), from morning until night, and managed to keep out the blazes that were approaching rural homes. At the height of the blaze, the flames reached the ground cover of a farm and caused a thick column of smoke. According to Nasa satellite images, it is estimated that around 12km\u00b2 of native vegetation was damaged by the fire, which is still active in another direction.     Also on Friday, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Correio</emphasis> contacted the Municipal Environment Secretariat requesting information on the impacts of the incident, the investigation into the incident and the budget for actions to prevent and combat forest fires, but did not hear back. </p><p>The space remains open and will be updated as soon as the issues are clarified. Local sources, however, suspect that the fire was caused by cattle farmers, who adopt the harmful and outdated practice as a way of renewing pastures. Participants in the municipality's Environmental Conference also highlight the need for greater investment in preventative measures and in the brigade's structure, with more staff and equipment, to tackle arson.     <br/>Silza Freire, a socio-environmental entrepreneur, art therapist and head of Espa\u00e7o Ecologia Viva, located in a reserve area in the Serra do Paran\u00e3, recounts the terror caused by forest fires in the Cerrado and calls for more support to prevent further occurrences. \"We need to continue preserving springs and local biodiversity, but every year we are at risk of fire during the dry season. We make a protective barrier here, but we lack the support to get appropriate safety equipment to fight fires. Last year, I fought the fire using only a flashlight on my cell phone and branches to put it out. I took several falls on the rocks, but I didn't give up and kept putting it out. The firefighters didn't arrive until almost two hours later, because they were on another job,\" she says.<br/>       A resident of the region and also a socio-environmental entrepreneur, lawyer Aleska Ferro, a delegate at the National Environment Conference and a representative of the Environmental Law and Sustainability Commission of the OAB Formosa, reinforces the need for greater attention to be paid to the Cerrado in S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o d'Alian\u00e7a. \"In addition to the loss of biodiversity and water contamination, we face serious structural problems: inadequate waste disposal, illegal burning, excessive use of pesticides and deforestation in sensitive areas, such as the banks of the Vereda stream, which is now at risk of disappearing. The solutions necessarily involve environmental education: workshops in schools, companies and farms, joint efforts and listening groups. Also through local cultural appreciation and keeping people in the countryside, with qualified and aware labor, public-private and university partnerships to apply ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) practices, as well as mechanisms for effective compensation for environmental damage,\" he points out.

Several of them are marked by the high temperatures, the striking geography or the demanding altitude in which they are located.</p><p><br/> If there is one thing there is no doubt, it is that the teams will seek to take advantage of every \"advantage\" of their cities, since several of these scenarios are really complicated. This is the case, for example, of the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Estadio Polideportivo de Az\u00e1ngaro</emphasis>, where the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">San Mart\u00edn Tour</emphasis> club plays its home games.   <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> The imperious stadium with one of the highest heights in the Copa Peru.   </emphasis><br/> Located in the Puno region, the Estadio Polideportivo Az\u00e1ngaro will be one of the most difficult venues for any club, as it <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">is located above 3,850 m. a. s. n. m.</emphasis> It was inaugurated just 7 years ago, specifically in 2018.<br/> In addition, it has synthetic turf and can receive just over seven thousand spectators in the two stands that the stadium has. As if that were not enough, it can host night matches, since it has 60 floodlights.<br/> It will be up to San Mart\u00edn Tour to get its stadium into League 2 in 2026. For the time being, it will have to beat Instituto Apur\u00edmac in its debut in the National Stage of the Peruvian Cup.    <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Which are the 64 clubs that have qualified

Deadly blazes have consumed four times as much land this year compared to the average for the same period over the past two decades, according to data from the European Forest Fire Information System . EFFIS revealed that 1,015,024 hectares have been burnt this year, surpassing the previous record of 988,544 hectares set in 2017.</p><p>The fires have released 37 million tonnes of carbon dioxide \u2013 roughly equivalent to the annual CO2 output of Portugal or Sweden. They have also shattered records for this period of the year across nine additional air pollutants, including fine particles termed PM2.5 that researchers say make wildfires considerably more lethal than previously understood.</p><p>Wildfires have been exacerbated by dry conditions. </p><p>Cristina Sant\u00edn Nu\u00f1o, a fire scientist at the Spanish National Research Council, explained that the \"perfect conditions\" for large wildfires were occurring increasingly frequently due to climate change and changes in land usage.</p><p>Wildfires tore across vast areas of southern Europe this month as temperatures went beyond 40C throughout much of the Mediterranean and the Balkans.</p><p>This dried out vegetation, which in countries such as Spain and Portugal had flourished following a damp spring, allowing fires to burn more intensely and spread further.</p><p>The flames are confirmed to have claimed more than a dozen lives but scientists warn the actual death toll is likely to be higher.</p><p>Dense clouds of smoke will have contaminated people's lungs with dangerous gases and poisonous particles tiny enough to penetrate the bloodstream.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Copernicus atmosphere monitoring service discovered that \"unprecedented\" fire activity this year had taken Spain's wildfire emissions to the highest annual total in the 23 years since records began.</p><p>Toxic fumes from blazes across the Iberian peninsula were worsened by smoke drifting across the Atlantic from Canada, which has also suffered severe burning in recent weeks.</p><p>Wildfire emissions from Spain and Portugal in August have been \"exceptional\", said Mark Parrington, a scientist with Copernicus.</p><p>EFFIS said on Tuesday that fire weather conditions were expected to ease across most of southern Europe this week, but added that \"very high to very extreme\" anomalies were expected in north-west Europe.</p><p> Read Next </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EXPONL-114020849</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EXPONL2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GJT-F0N3-RY3H-P0XC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408506</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"413\"/><timeReceived>1:53 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Northern and Shell Media Publications All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Express Online</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12327\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 23, 2025 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

The rest includes riverine areas, rangelands and coniferous patches.</p><p>Provincial Forest Department Director General Azfar Zia said large-scale plantation drives were under way with 51 million saplings planned to be planted on 40,000 acres.</p><p>The target for the ongoing monsoon season is 21 million saplings over 25,000 acres, with 6.5 million already planted.</p><p>\"In the spring plantation campaign, we exceeded the target by planting more than 10.5 million saplings,\" Zia added, noting that agroforestry initiatives are also engaging farmers to plant trees on their lands.</p><p>Official record shows that Punjab's forest area has grown from around 701,000 acres in 2013 to 1.263 million acres, while barren land has dropped from 960,000 acres to 399,000 acres.</p><p>However, experts argue that the progress remains insufficient. They point out that raising forest cover by even 1% would require around 43 new forests the size of Changa Manga, land for which the province does not have available.</p><p>The National Project Director at the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Asim Jamal, said that of Punjab's forested land, only 0.45% is actually tree-covered.</p><p>He stressed that reforestation of the land was crucial. \"Farmers and landowners must be convinced that trees enhance soil fertility, protect crops from disasters, and can even generate income through carbon markets,\" he added.</p><p>According to the World Wide Fund for Nature-Pakistan (WWF-Pakistan), the country loses about 11,000 hectares of forest every year. The main drivers include unchecked logging, wildfires, climate change and conversion of forest land for agriculture and commercial use.</p><p>WWF-Pakistan Director General Hammad Naqi Khan said, \"Forest protection is not just an environmental necessity, it is an economic imperative.\"</p><p>He warned that large-scale felling of mature trees is compounding ecological losses, while shrinking green spaces in cities are intensifying urban flooding.</p><p>He called for stronger protection of mature trees alongside afforestation and urban greening measures.</p><p>The forest department says it is deploying modern technology for monitoring and protection. Satellite-based GIS monitoring now covers 67% of Punjab's forest area, while AI-powered drones are used for wildfire surveillance. In 2024, 269 forest fire incidents damaged 6,500 acres, but in 2025, the number of cases dropped to 200 with damage reduced to 2,500 acres.</p><p>Provincial Senior Minister Mariyyum Aurangzeb said Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has, for the first time, banned the traditional auction system of forest timber.</p><p>The new policy aims to curb illegal logging through transparent, technology-based monitoring and mapping. The government insists that the move is not only crucial for tree protection but also vital for reducing soil erosion.</p><p>Experts, however, emphasize that large-scale afforestation in Punjab is constrained by land scarcity.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EXPRES-EXPTRIB0609202500030</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EXPRES2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GNS-2T03-RTJV-21RH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">381932</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"602\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Express Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>The Express Tribune</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19764\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 6, 2025 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Lahore</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Pakistan</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DSGR</classCode><className>GRAZING LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000DT12</classCode><className>TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CP4R</classCode><className>2010 PAKISTAN FLOODS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009SI7</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DKU4</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp;

The current heatwave, with temperatures topping 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) on several days this month, is expected to linger until Monday.</p><p>In Galicia, fires shut down several highways and halted high-speed rail services to Madrid. The EU's European Forest Fire Information System reported that wildfires in Spain this year have already burned 158,000 hectares (390,000 acres), an area the size of metropolitan London.</p><p>Friday marked the Feast of the Assumption in Spain and Portugal, a major Catholic holiday usually observed with family gatherings and processions.</p><p>The fires raging across Portugal caused a first fatality Friday, when the former mayor of the eastern town of Planta died fighting fires there, President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa announced.</p><p>The president offered 'heartfelt condolences to the mayor of Guarda for the death of former mayor Carlos Damaso, victim of a fire he was fighting in his parish, asking that he pass them on to his family', the president's statement said.</p><p>Almost 4,000 firefighters battled seven active fires in Portugal, as authorities extended a state of alert until Sunday. The government also sought European Union assistance under its civil protection mechanism.</p><p>A day earlier, Spain received two Canadair water bomber aircraft from the European Union, the first time it had ever activated the bloc's emergency firefighting aid.</p><p>Elsewhere in Southern Europe, Greece continued to struggle with a major wildfire burning for four days on the island of Chios. Several overnight evacuations took place as flames spread through the island's northern region. Two planes and two helicopters dropped water during calmer winds early on Friday.</p><p>After devastating fires earlier this week in western Greece, the fire service remained on high alert outside Athens and in southern areas, where strong winds and high temperatures heightened the danger.</p><p>Across the Balkans and Southern Europe, demand for the EU's shared firefighting resources has soared this year. Bulgaria, Montenegro and Albania have all called for help in recent days as the system has already been deployed as often as during the whole of last year's fire season.</p><p>Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual head of the world's Orthodox Christians, expressed solidarity with wildfire victims during prayers for the Dormition of the Virgin Mary, one of the faith's most significant feast days.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURASI-EURASIADIARY3108202500191</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURASI2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GMH-WCR3-RV30-C3N5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">461109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"510\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Eurasia Diary All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Eurasia Diary (Backu, Azerbaijian)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 31, 2025 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0001TJO</classCode><className>BOMBARDIER INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS336411 AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>SIC3721 AIRCRAFT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>BBD.A (TSX)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N924120QC</classCode><className>OCEANOGRAPHIC &amp;

Patrolling, surveillance and reconnaissance flights remain constant to prevent the fire from spreading.<br/>\u21d2\u21d2 State authorities have urged the population to avoid any activity that could originate new fire outbreaks in the region. \u21d0\u21d0<br/>Municipal authorities have announced the hiring of more personnel to work on the opening of firebreaks, as well as the acquisition of necessary machinery, such as chainsaws and machetes. The institutions involved have reiterated their commitment to maintain the firefighting work uninterrupted until the fire is completely controlled.<br/>Brigaders are facing difficulties due to weather conditions. The persistent drought in the area of the inlet, coupled with strong winds, hinders the progress of firefighting efforts, although other communities in the municipality have experienced heavy rains. This combination of factors keeps the risk high and requires maximum cooperation from the population.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Protected area at risk</emphasis><br/>While several communities in the municipality report rainfall, the extreme dryness and winds in the affected area continue to hinder the work of the brigadistas, who are trying to contain the fire and protect the area's biodiversity.<br/>The Yum Balam reserve, with an area of 154,000 hectares, is a protected natural area with a diversity of ecosystems, including jungles, mangroves, dunes, and lagoons.<br/>This environment is home to a wide variety of flora and fauna species at risk, including jaguars and tapirs, sea turtles such as loggerhead and hawksbill turtles, American and swamp crocodiles, flamingos, jabiru storks, roseate spoonbills, spider monkeys, pumas, ocelots, ocelots, margays and manatees.<br/>In the inlet area, the presence of chit palm and grape sea trees, both of which are listed as protected species, raises concerns about the ecological impact of the fire.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-72595732</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GMP-6DR3-S15R-808P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"489\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 31, 2025 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>america</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>medio-ambiente</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001379</classCode><className>PRIMATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DKTF</classCode><className>SURVEILLANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001832</classCode><className>WETLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST00097C9</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS &amp;

Blazes have destroyed more than 415,000 hectares, mostly in August, according to the European Forest Fire Information System, marking a new annual record since reporting began in 2006. Four people have died and thousands have been evacuated because of this month's fires. The Socialists blame the PP for failing to implement effective fire prevention policies and for playing down climate change.</p><p>the PP points to arson as the cause of the fires and accuses the central government of withholding resources, including enough  military support. PP leader Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o has proposed creating a national registry of arsonists. But government minister Angel Victor Torres insisted on public television on Wednesday that regional governments were responsible for disaster response. 'The opposition leader shows up and points fingers instead of helping,' he said, referring to the proposed arson registry. Defence Minister Margarita Robles said many PP-led regional governments had 'failed to act'. 'When there has been no investment in prevention, it is not enough to say, 'The army will arrive,'' she told radio station Ser. PP spokeswoman Ester Munoz countered, accusing the government of scapegoating. 'The response of a 'serious government should be 'where and when do you need resources' and not that local authorities are incompetent,' she said.</p><p>the political debate mirrors the controversy that followed deadly floods in October 2024 in PP-governed Valencia. The row comes as Sanchez's politicalstanding has taken a hit from several investigations into alleged corruption among his inner circle. His wife, Begona Gomez, has been ordered to appear in court again in September for questioning into alleged embezzlement of public funds. Sanchez has dismissed the allegations against his wife - which are related to her past job at Madrid's Complutense University - as an attempt by the right to undermine his government.</p><p>the prime minister's former right-hand man, Santos Cerdan, was detained in June in an ongoing probe into alleged kickbacks for public contracts.</p><p>and his younger brother, David Sanchez, has been under investigation since 2024 for alleged embezzlement, influence peddling and tax fraud. Sanchez's minority government is propped up by smaller regional parties and it has struggled to pass legislation or even a budget. Feijoo has dismissed Sanchez as a 'zombie' head of government because of his difficulty in passing laws and called for an early general election</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OMANDO-OMANDOBS2808202500018</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OMANDO2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GKW-5TY3-S3TD-615P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433714</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"479\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Oman Daily Observer All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Oman Daily Observer</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28359\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 28, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

Could exceed 35 degrees in the Guadalquivir, and locally in the Guadiana, Tajo and Ebro.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Situation in Castilla y Le\u00f3n</emphasis><br/>Castilla y Le\u00f3n begins the third week fighting forest fires with six fires that remain in potential severity index 2, the maximum level, and two declared this Sunday, after a positive evolution that has allowed lowering the level of six other although the rise in temperatures, accompanied by a drop in humidity and wind, again complicate the situation.<br/>Leon continues to focus the concerns with five level 2 fires, those declared in Fasgar, La Ba\u00f1a, Ig\u00fce\u00f1a, Gara\u00f1o and Molinaseca -with favorable evolution-, the latter two emerged this Sunday, with great virulence and forced to evacuate eleven localities, bringing to twelve the number of evacuated with more than 700 affected.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related to this topic</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">From catastrophe to opportunity: forestry experts see feasible to recover a good part of the 400,000 hectares of burned land</emphasis><br/>Adhik Arrilucea<br/><br/>The reactivations in the face of rising temperatures, with the consequent drop in humidity, and the wind that remains persistent in some areas, with changes of direction, have marked the last hours in the fight against the fire, rekindling for example the fire of Fasgar.<br/>On the other hand, the favorable evolution of some fires has allowed to lower the level of severity. Thus, the Junta de Castilla y Le\u00f3n has lowered from level 2 to level 1 the fires of Anllares del Sil, Llamas de Cabrera, Barniedo de la Reina and Gestoso, in Le\u00f3n, and that of Carda\u00f1o de Arriba in Palencia.

It is precisely its transfer to Le\u00f3n, with risk for the population of the area of La Ba\u00f1a, which keeps it at level 2, given that most of the Zamora perimeter is under control.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related to this topic</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Weather gives a respite in the extinction of fires in Galicia, Castile and Leon and Extremadura</emphasis><br/>The fires in Yeres -which affected the natural area of Las M\u00e9dulas, a World Heritage Site-; Resoba, in Monta\u00f1a Palentina; Molezuelas de la Carballeda, where three people lost their lives; San Pedro de Cansoles; Bra\u00f1osera; and Candelario, in the province of C\u00e1ceres- are still active but not serious.<br/>The forest fire extinction operation will continue this Monday pending the evolution of the meteorological conditions, due to the increase of temperatures, and from the Junta de Castilla y Le\u00f3n it is again alerted that some of the fires declared in the last hours, and which are under investigation, could be intentional, which complicates the extinction tasks.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Evolution of the fire in Galicia</emphasis><br/>Galicia has this Monday three active forest fires, all in the province of Ourense, where on Sunday a new fire broke out in the municipality of Avi\u00f3n, and presents favorable evolution of Chandrexa de Queixa, with only one active focus.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related to this topic</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Courage, but also taxes: this is how the UME, firefighters and neighbors have put an end to the flames</emphasis><br/>The last balance of Rural Environment updates the area burned in Avi\u00f3n, with a fire declared on Sunday afternoon in the parish of Nieva that has devastated 70 hectares.<br/>The fire in Chandrexa de Queixa, which started the wave of fires on August 8 and has devastated 19,000 hectares, is still active. Its evolution is favorable, because only the focus of Vilari\u00f1o remains active.<br/>Also active is the fire of Carballeda de Valdeorras, parish of Casaio, which entered from Porto de Sanabria (Zamora) and has burned 4,400 hectares, including Pena Trevinca, the highest peak in Galicia.<br/>The Larouco fire, the largest in the history of Galicia with 30,000 hectares burned, remains

ha), Ri\u00f3s-Fumaces and A Trepa (100 ha) and Carballedo- A Cova (100 ha).<br/>The wave of fires that began on August 8 in Galicia has already devastated almost 92,000 hectares, according to data from Rural Environment, which only reports fires of more than 20 hectares or affecting protected areas.<br/>The Xunta maintains active situation 2 throughout the province of Ourense, although no new confinements or evacuations have been carried out. <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Favorable development of the fire in Andalusia</emphasis><br/>The Operational Service for the Extinction of Forest Fires of Andalusia (Infoca) has considered controlled about 24 hours after the fire declared on Saturday night in a place located between the capital and Cenes de la Vega that forced at the beginning to cut traffic in the area.<br/>According to information provided by the Infoca, the plan has been controlled the fire at 21.00 hours this past Sunday, a day after a first flame of fire in the area of the Fuente de la Bicha gave the alarm.<br/>Two groups of forest firefighters, an agent of the Environment and two fire engines are working on the tasks for the finish and liquidation.<br/>The fire started after 21.00 hours this past Saturday in a forest area near the Serrallo tunnels, between Granada capital and Cenes de la Vega, and affects a hillside near the river Genil.<br/>The forest fire, which has also mobilized firefighters from the South and North parks of Granada, Civil Guard, Local Police and Civil Protection, caused during the night of Saturday the closure to traffic of the A-395, the road to Sierra Nevada, reopened on Sunday with normality.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Controlled the fire in Jarilla (C\u00e1ceres)</emphasis><br/>The Plan to Combat Forest Fires in

to level zero.<br/>In the area remain two units of forest firefighters, four agents of the Natural Environment and an extinguishing technician.<br/>Thirteen days after the fire started, it has been possible to control this devastating fire, the largest in the history of Extremadura, which has burned 17,355 hectares in a perimeter of 170 kilometers.<br/>The fire was stabilized this Friday, the Infoex level 2 was deactivated, downgraded to level 1, and the Advanced Command Post of 112 Extremadura, which has been coordinating the emergency operation these days, as well as external means that have collaborated in the tasks for its control and extinction, was withdrawn.<br/>The Junta de Extremadura declared this Saturday the total deactivation of the Special Plan for Civil Protection against Forest Fires in Extremadura (INFOCAEX), after neutralizing the Jarilla fire, in which Infoex own means have remained dedicated to consolidation tasks of the stabilized perimeter.<br/>This Friday could return to their homes the neighbors of the houses of the periurban area of Herv\u00e1s, as well as the isolated houses of Jerte, Tornavacas, Cabezuela and Navaconcejo after declining the evacuation that weighed on them, a measure that during the previous days has been affecting other municipalities depending on the progress of the fire, such as Jarilla, Cabezabellosa, Villar de Plasencia or Rebollar.<br/>In the most critical moments of the fire, half a thousand troops and about thirty aerial means fought against the flames that have burned thousands of hectares in the regions of Valle del Jerte and Ambroz, even entering the Castilian province of Salamanca.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Emergency services in Galicia sent alert messages urging residents in dozens of towns to take precautions.  </p><p>\"If you receive this alert: remain calm and read the text carefully,\" the alerts said. \"As the fires spread, avoid all unnecessary travel and stay indoors. If you are outside and have nowhere to stay, move away from the affected areas.\"  </p><p>About 3500 military from a special emergency unit were deployed around the country, with some political leaders calling for more.  </p><p>Alfonso Fernandez Manueco, the centre-right president of Castile and Leon, asked Sanchez's Government \"for an exceptional response: we need more army personnel at the disposal of the regions\".  </p><p>Extremadura has also made an official request for reinforcements.  </p><p>In Spain, firefighting is in principle the responsibility of the regions, with the central government only intervening in the event of a major disaster.  </p><p>Spain is expected to remain on heat alert until tomorrow, the extreme temperatures having significantly increased the risk of wildfires.  </p><p>Smoke from wildfires in Spain and Portugal has reached the UK, the country's Met Office reported.  </p><p>Since the beginning of the year, more than 157,000ha have been reduced to ashes in Spain, according to the real-time map of the European Forest Fire Information System.  </p><p>-AFP</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NZHRLD-NZH,NZC,NZCAA,NZCB,NZCBB,NZCC,NZCCC,NZCD,NZCDD,NZS,NZSAA,NZSB,NZSBB,NZSC,NZSCC,NZSD,NZSDD,HSM,HSMB,HSMBB,HSMC,HSMCC,DRI,MAG,NHH,NTR,NZF,OCA,OEA,OFD,ONM,ORO,ORP,OWA,PTQ,WHO,WMNDWorldSpainFires1898</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NZHRLD2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GHJ-22D3-RTP0-W159-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">257912</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"341\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The New Zealand Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New Zealand Herald</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 18, 2025</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>N924120QC</classCode><className>OCEANOGRAPHIC &amp;

Starting as early as 2031-2060, the study found essentially all of the western United States, or 98%, will see an increase in days posing a risk for lightning-started wildfires.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Areas that are already at high risk for wildfires started by lightning, such as Oregon, Idaho and Montana, are expected to see the largest increase in overall lightning days, with up to 12 more days per summer by 2060. Some areas, particularly in the U.S. Southwest, like Arizona, are expected to see a smaller increase as they will simply see less lightning.</p><p>The new study was published in Earth's Future, AGU's journal for interdisciplinary research on the past, present and future of our planet and its inhabitants.</p><p>\"The first step was to project lightning,\" said Dmitri Kalashnikov, research scientist at the University of California Merced and lead author on the study. \"The typical climate models don't directly simulate lightning. It's too small a process.\"</p><p>To get around this, Kalashnikov created his own machine-learning models that predict lightning based on the occurrence of weather variables that are typically found in climate models, such as the amount of moisture in the atmosphere. He published the models last year in AGU's Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres.</p><p>He combined his lightning models with the Fire Weather Index projections to predict the number of future days when conditions that encourage lightning and fire ignition and spread coincide.</p><p>The Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index, created in 1968, measures how favorable the weather is on a given day for wildfires. It keeps track of temperature, precipitation, humidity and other factors that could impact fires. For example, higher temperatures or lower precipitation, especially prolonged, can increase the chances of a fire.</p><p>While there have been previous models created for worldwide changes in lightning, Kalashnikov and his team created models that were specifically trained for locations in the western United States and for a closer timeframe. Their models focused on the years 2030 to 2060, compared to previous models that typically only looked at the end of the century.</p><p>Using the Fire Weather Index, researchers were able to predict how the number of days that have a high risk of wildfires will change over the coming decades.</p><p>The modeling found the northwestern United States was expected to see the largest increase in both lightning days and days with high risk for wildfires. Parts of Idaho, Oregon and Montana saw the largest increase in this cloud-to-ground lightning, or lightning that strikes the ground, which can ignite flammable vegetation. However, due to lesser increases in the Fire Weather Index, these areas will see slower increases in fire risk compared to areas farther south.</p><p>The southern half of the western United States still saw an increase in potential fires started by lightning, despite seeing a lower risk for lightning increases than the northern states. The increase is still projected because the entire West saw a general increase in high-risk days for wildfires as temperatures climb and the risk of droughts and heatwaves increase. In the south, Colorado, Wyoming, Arizona and New Mexico projected the largest increases in wildfires started by lightning.</p><p>Kalashnikov said next steps could expand what the models include, like bringing in rainfall amounts to differentiate between dry lightning and wet lightning, or lightning that happens with or without rain. This could help differentiate between thunderstorms that pose a risk of wildfires versus heavy-rain producing storms that could create flash flooding.</p><p>\"You can't help but wonder what the future will look like, especially if you dig in and you realize that there's actually a lot that we don't understand,\" Kalashnikov said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUSRVW-508386715</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUSRVW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GRG-FV53-RRYW-539P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417294</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"697\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025  Buzz Future LLC Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Eurasia Review</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35455\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 14, 2025 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>STX001477</classCode><className>RESEARCH REPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001154</classCode><className>MODELING &amp;
