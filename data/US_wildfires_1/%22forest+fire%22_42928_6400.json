I'm the analyst here that covers Revolve. We're great -- we're pleased today to have Jesse Timmermans, CFO. You want to take it away?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JESSE TIMMERMANS, CFO, REVOLVE GROUP, INC.: Yeah.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DYLAN CARDEN: Great. Thanks, everyone.</p><p>JESSE TIMMERMANS: Thanks, Dylan. I will jump in. I know it sounds like some of you are generalists here. So I'll take it a step further beyond what Dylan communicated earlier to me is that we sell clothes online, pretty simple. But it's way more complicated than that and complicated in an exciting way.</p><p>I'm going to pause here just a second on the intro slide. This is actually AI-generated image. We'll get into AI and technology here in a minute, but we're pretty excited about this campaign heading into Revolve Festival this past month during April and a lot of good stuff going on the AI front.</p><p>So if you step back, we're actually celebrating our 20th year anniversary this year. So we've been around a while. Mike and Michael founded the company 20 years ago, not fashion guys. So they relied on data and technology to actually create Revolve. And it's based on, like I said, data and technology, data-driven merchandising combined with a powerful marketing engine.</p><p>And that's important. You can have the powerful marketing, the social media marketing, but without the great merchandise, it doesn't -- it's not as impactful. And on the flip side too, you can have the great merchandise. But if you don't have that authentic connection with this next-generation consumer, not as impactful.</p><p>We have a global reach. Just shy of 20% of our sales are to customers outside of the US, and that's a growing market for us, huge TAM. Again, we've been doing this for 20 years. We've been profitable every year, except for 2008 in the great financial crisis.</p><p>And that gets back to the founder-led entrepreneurial culture. Mike and Michael actually bootstrapped the company through the financial crisis, only took our first funding in 2012, went public actually four years ago today.</p><p>Strong balance sheet, again, consistently profitable over time and growing in a large market. And if you look at the market, we are squarely positioned between two really significant shifts that are happening right now, e-commerce, which has been happening, that continues to grow. We expect that to continue to grow, and the brick-and-mortar share shifting to e-commerce over time.</p><p>And then we have purchasing power of this next-generation consumer, and that's shifting to this next-generation consumer over time. And it's important because she shops differently. She's digital, social, engaged. She wants discovery; she wants newness.</p><p>And I say she -- 97% of our sales are to the millennial female. We'll get into men's and some of the other growth opportunities in a minute, but it is primarily female focused destination at this point.</p><p>We serve her through two complementary destinations. We say complementary because they are unique and different, but also complementary in primarily the product assortment and the price point. Revolve is the lion's share of the business, 84%. You can see the AOV there of $279.</p><p>This is primarily dresses, going-out apparel. It's kind of that festival this summer expanding into categories such as active and outerwear and cold weather gear, different from our historical summer spring festival. I think if you rewind a few years, you would run into a customer on the street and she would say I love Revolve. I'm going to a party this weekend or I'm going to festival, and I got my dress there.</p><p>We used to think that was a great compliment. Now it's almost a kind of a constructive criticism because we want her to say I love Revolve because I go for my dress for festival, for active, for beauty, for my significant other, which is what we're working on and a huge growth opportunity for us.</p><p>Complemented with Forward, this is the higher-end luxury destination. And complementary in that it is a different price point and it SKUs more handbags and shoes than dresses. We know that if she's buying a $200 dress, she's complementing that with a multi-thousand-dollar handbag, statement pair of shoes, something unique and special from Ford. You can see the different brand assortments here.</p><p>Revolve is the emerging and established brands, but primarily emerging. We have about 20% of the Revolve business as our own brands that we design and develop in-house. We call them owned brands, not private label, because they are true brands in the eyes of the consumer. These are kind of knockoff lower price point brands.</p><p>And then the luxury brands from the Forward destination. And forward really differentiated from the traditional luxury players and that curation and that young luxury feel. If you compare it to a, say a Farfetch, which, if you know what you want, you go to Farfetch because they have everything under the sun.</p><p>My Theresa, great operators, but a little bit kind of older school, older style luxury versus the Kendall Jenner West Coast, have young luxury feel with a lot of more emerging brands combined with those established brands.</p><p>Customer service and focus on that customer has been core to the business since day one. Combined with the data-driven merchandising that I mentioned at first, Mike and Michael treated the home as a addressing room from day one. They were trying to create the biggest, the best, the most curated department store online. And in order to replicate that experience, they knew you have to have free shipping and free returns.</p><p>And on top of that, just fast, everything fast, accurate, great customer experience. All of our fulfillment is 1P, or customer service is 1P. So really controlling everything soup-to-nuts on that customer experience. And that comes through.</p><p>We'll get into retention and the customer dynamics here in a bit, but you can see the record NPS score increasing over time. And that develops this really trusted relationship with her. So she comes back more frequently over time. And also, buys at higher average order values.</p><p>Again, 20-year anniversary, long track record of profitable growth. Profitable growth is the key. We're very capital efficient, which leads to a strong balance sheet. You can see the 22% three-year CAGR here.</p><p>We did have a dip during COVID. We're all about going out, living your best life. So when COVID hit, of course, everything was put on hold for us. We had to shift pretty quickly and abruptly into the COVID categories like active and home and beauty and things like that versus the dresses that we are known for.</p><p>And then when COVID was over, just as abruptly shifting back into dresses and going on. You can see the recovery there. Again, consistently profitable.</p><p>And taking share over time. You can see that here, Revolve versus the industry e-commerce growth benchmark where we outperform every year, again, except for that COVID year.</p><p>I mentioned capital efficiency. CapEx is generally, call it less than 1% of net sales. Here we have some peaks and valleys, but it's generally consistent over time, which leads to a really strong balance sheet. We ended the quarter last quarter with $283 million in cash.</p><p>We had strong positive free cash flow in the quarter. And that really stands out when you look at the peer group here, with the growth in profitability and cash flow with really just Revolve. And then we have Zalando here as well.</p><p>But really important, especially in a macro environment that we're in today, where strong balance sheet, cash is king. We can stay front-footed on the marketing and technology investments where others are forced to pull back and make their own decision for the long term.</p><p>We're getting into customers here a little bit. Active customers at 2.3 million -- billion -- yeah, 2.3 million, sorry. And they buy at full price.</p><p>Again, she comes to us for discovery, for what's new, what's exciting. She's not coming to us for the price or for a discount. And with that strong customer service, she comes back to us more frequently over time.</p><p>Our revenue retention is over 100%. If you look at year two and beyond. If you blend the year one and year two, you can see the retention of the pre-existing coordinate sales here. COVID dipped down to 74%. Of course, we had a strong rebound to get to 120%, and then even last year was 97% revenue retention. So again, a really strong customer dynamic.</p><p>You can see the stacks of the cohorts on this slide, which really hit home. And again, we have 20 years of cohorts, really consistent behavior from those customers. And really back to the customer service, the data-driven merchandising, really the core of what Revolve is.</p><p>And the customers. Here's a good visual of the activity of those customers, the number of orders placed per active customer. Active customer, to clarify, is the trailing 12-month numbers if you look at the active customers versus the orders placed over the last 12 months.</p><p>Over 3.5 orders per active customer, which is down from that COVID recovery period of 2021, but still higher than our pre-COVID levels. So again, showing that activity over time. And we think we can increase that activity, and also, the net sales per active customer increasing over time.</p><p>Our pre-existing customers, because of that frequency and that retention rate, active customers -- 50% of our active customers are pre-existing customers. That 50% makes up 77% of the orders and 79% of the net sales. So there, you can see that 50% punches above their weight on the orders and then even more so on the net sales, showing both the frequency increase and the average order value increase over time.</p><p>If we look at the most recent quarter, very challenging times. It was a mixed quarter for us. Starting with the positive on the left here. Number one priority going into the quarter was to right size our inventory kind of rewind to COVID. We pulled back significantly. We reassorted into those stay-at-home COVID categories.</p><p>When the world opened up again, we reassorted in and pivoted back into the dresses, chase demand. And then around mid-year, May, June of last year when the economy started to slow down, we had to pull back. We were over-inventoried like many others out there.</p><p>Number one priority leaving 2022 and into 2023 was to right size that inventory. We think we're on track and had a really successful quarter in bringing that inventory back into check, which results in $48 million of free cash flow. That's two times that of the full year of 2022, primarily because of that inventory dynamic and really bringing things back in check.</p><p>On the more challenging side. It is tough out there. The consumer sentiment is low, consumers challenge. She is making decisions between that dress and paying for gas and paying for rent and all the other inflationary costs out there. So we ended the quarter at minus 1% that led into April, which was minus 7%.</p><p>And then most recently, this past month of May, we were down mid-single digits. So the pressure has continued to really saw progressively more challenging quarter as the quarter progressed in Q1, where typically, we see March 120% that of January.</p><p>This year, March was actually lower than January, which is very atypical for our seasonality where we see a build into that spring and summer season and festival and that going out time. So very challenging time, I think both from a demand perspective and just her sentiment.</p><p>And then also on the cost perspective. Costs are higher. Inflation is real. Return rates for us are up year on year and then over a multiyear period as well.</p><p>There are some longer-term dynamics at play there. But also, just the consumer shift where she is more and more comfortable returning coming out of COVID, she was more comfortable returning. And then when we see these abrupt macro shifts, we do see an increase in that return rate.</p><p>The increase in return rate has a meaningful impact on the cost structure, which resulted in still positive adjusted EBITDA about a 5.4% margin, which was down year over year. We have a lot of things in the works to bring that back to the double digits, but it's going to take some time to work through that, both on the return rate front, inflationary costs working through this cycle, but confident in the long term.</p><p>And with the strong balance sheet, we're confident we're making the right decisions now to benefit us over the long term and not pulling back in the wrong areas.</p><p>I mentioned inventory that was number one priority coming into the quarter, rightsizing inventory. So you can just see the visual here where that differential between the net sales growth and the inventory growth has significantly compressed from the, call it the trough of Q2 '22.</p><p>And looking -- I mentioned, making the right investments for the long term and having a strong balance sheet and allowing us to do that through these kind of disjointed times. I think we are founded in a down cycle in that dot-com bust of 2000 -- just after the 2001, 2002. We bootstrapped through the great financial crisis.</p><p>I think if you ask Mike and Michael living through that and operating through that, we came out stronger. So I'll use the analogy that Mike uses and that this is like a forest fire where it weeds out all that small brush and only the stronger left standing. And we feel the same today.</p><p>With the stronger balance sheet, we're even more confident. So we're able to invest. Continue on the marketing, we are launching a forward pop-up tomorrow. Yeah, tomorrow is a kind of private opening night for that. This is one of the larger forward-dedicated brand marketing investments we've made to date.</p><p>This is a pop-up shop in in LA curated by Kendall Jenner, our Creative Director, both from an aesthetic perspective and then also the brands that we're going to carry there. So it's one store and then also place for events. So we'll have multiple events throughout the course of that pop-up shop.</p><p>Also, a test into accepting returns in a physical location, what does that do to the customer experience. One of our initiatives is to increase the cross-shopping between that Revolve customer and the FWRD customer. Again, we know if she's buying that $200 dress, she's buying handbag, why not at FWRD?</p><p>So really cross marketing to that powerful 2.3 million active Revolve customers. So Revolve customers can actually take the returns to this forward pop-up. So doing a little bit more of that cross-marketing, cross-shopping initiative.</p><p>FWRD renew a great way to acquire new customers. This is selling pre-owned handbags on FWRD, both from a buyback perspective where we buy back the bag from an existing FWRD customer, and also curating other third-party authenticated handbags that maybe it's a brand we weren't able to carry on FWRD, so it's a great way to attract that new customer into FWRD.</p><p>International is a growth initiative. We partnered with Nykaa in India to tap into that market. The Middle East and Mexico, some of those emerging markets have been the fast-growing markets for us as of recent.</p><p>And then LOBA, recent own brand launch. We're really optimistic and excited about the own brands platform over the long term. LOBA and Helsa are two of the most recent launches. These are partnerships with influencers, celebrities that have performed very well.</p><p>And then on the back office, the efficiency front. Really excited about AI. And then we have our East Coast fulfillment center that we are ramping up that will offset some of the increased costs from those returns, and also provide a better customer experience for the customers on the East Coast.</p><p>And just a quote here from Mike, our Co-Founder, in showing their ownership. So very much aligned in that. Mike and Michael, still own about 45% of the outstanding shares. So I think that entrepreneurial founder-led spirit is still here today, very active Co-CEOs and Founders in the business.</p><p>Looking ahead, the growth drivers as we cycle through this, whatever we're in and however long it takes, we do think there's this just huge opportunity in the core. So we have a lot of other growth initiatives. But even without those, we think there's opportunity in this core.</p><p>Only 3% penetrated in the target demographic. You get to that 3% in a number of ways. You can look at the number of women in the US, 18 to 44, which is our target age demographic.</p><p>You can look at our sales versus what we define as the TAM in the US, which also translates to about 3%. And because TAMS are squishy and populations are squishy, you can look at just as a gut check, look at the active customers for some of the existing players out there and how Revolve compares to that. And we continue to take share from these existing players.</p><p>The offering. I've mentioned the kind of that order frequency and how do we get her to come to us for more than just the dress and more than just the festival. Beauty is a really exciting opportunity for us, great tool for customer acquisition, lower price point. We know she is buying beauty, of course, from somewhere, why not Revolve?</p><p>We think we can curate better and different. We have her engaged. We have a great experience. It's around 3% of our sales now. If you look at comparables out there, we think it can be more than 10% of the business over time.</p><p>Just hired a dedicated beauty director that is -- number one, acquiring brands. That's the first step in beauty. It's to acquire the brands, get the right assortment on the website, then work on the experience. And this is similar to what we did for FWRD, similar to what we do for international when we're going through growth initiatives. So one, get the product; two, get the experience, right? And then really start to market the product to the customer.</p><p>Men's and other opportunity, about the same size as beauty right now at about, call it low-single digits percent of the business. We carry men's across both Revolve and FWRD. So another great cross-shopping opportunity.</p><p>We also know that the female -- typically, 30% to 50% of the purchases for the male come from a female. We have a very captive and engaged female audience. So we see a lot of opportunity in men's. Also, not really anybody out there really curating men's and providing a really great destination for that male in the way we think we can and then actively use as an example of other adjacent categories that we can expand into.</p><p>Beauty, just a quick chart there to show the opportunity. And I guess I should go back to the cross-shopping. I mentioned the cross-shopping opportunity between Revolve and FWRD. We think we can tap that two point -- the vast majority of that 2.3 million active customers on Revolve and sell FWRD to her.</p><p>A couple of the recent things we have done, the loyalty program that we had on Revolve, launching that on FWRD and allowing her to use her loyalty points cross platform. Updating the site nav, so that FWRD and men's are both more prominence on the site and easier to navigate between the two destinations. I mentioned the marketing that we're doing and more cross marketing between the two dedicated e-mails about FWRD to that Revolve customer.</p><p>This is more on FWRD. And then international. Internationally is just shy of 20% of the business today. Over time, we have, again, number one is get the service and the product right. Service internationally involve making that international experience more like the US customer experience where it's free shipping, free returns.</p><p>Historically, if you rewind five years ago, really painful for an international customer where you had to pay for your return. Not only did you have to pay for your return, but if you look at Canada, for example, you would be shocked at the checkout because you have these incremental Canadian taxes that you'd have to pay.</p><p>And then if you want to return the product, you need to go to the government to recollect those taxes. We wouldn't refund those taxes. So now, with all-inclusive pricing, everything's included in the price on the website. Then if you return, you get the full price returned and refunded to you and then we work with the Canadian government to recollect those taxes.</p><p>So huge improvement in the customer experience. Of course, that does increase the return rate, but more than offset by the increase in gross sales, which increases the net sales. And so, that localization started in the UK, moved into Europe, moved into Australia.</p><p>Canada was one of the more recent larger markets to launch that all-inclusive pricing and localization. Those western markets and more established markets have been more challenged recently, both from a macro perspective and then also from a currency perspective.</p><p>We price in US dollar and then convert to the local currency. So when you have a strong US dollar, you had a pricing disadvantage to the tune of 10% plus or minus in those core regions like the UK and Europe, also Australia. So those regions being challenged but offset by really great growth coming from some of our emerging regions like Mexico, China, Middle East, India.</p><p>Mexico has doubled year over year and is now one of our top five markets. And then looking ahead internationally, it's all about that customer experience. Number one, get the product right; number two, technology site enhancement, payment types. And then we can really start to market to that international customer.</p><p>Right now, we are indirectly marketing. Social media really has no boundaries outside of maybe China. So we have an international influencer base. So we are indirectly tapping into that international customer, but going in country by country and more dedicated and specific marketing to that customer to expand the share.</p><p>Own brands, huge opportunity for us in the long run. If you look back at the history of own brands, we went from 0% to 36% in five years from 2014 to 2019. That was too fast. And we became over-assorted in certain categories and price points. And V2 of the own brand is to grow that, but in a more moderated pace.</p><p>And we think we can have a more profitable own-brand business at a lower percentage of net sales than we did before. And that's going to come through a combination of new brands, also new styles and products within the existing brands expanding into additional categories.</p><p>One of the recent categories was Wellbeing and BeingWell, which is a sustainable active brand that we launched. And then also partnering with influencers, celebrities, personalities.</p><p>If you think about Helsa recent launch, that has performed very well. And unique from our own brand perspective in that Helsa was carried on both FWRD and Revolve. It kind of edited differently for each of those sites, but the product was similar. So really great launch.</p><p>And I mentioned LOBA, which was a recent launch, performing really well and really tapping more into that younger Gen Z consumer versus the millennial that's been at the core. And that is a wrap.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>DYLAN CARDEN: Awesome. So we have about eight minutes here. We have a Q&amp;A breakout at [Nager Maher] on the Midwest. But if anyone has questions now, happy to deal with.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: (inaudible - microphone inaccessible)</p><p>JESSE TIMMERMANS: Most outside. I think at some point -- sorry, the question was for beauty, can we expand with own brands or is it going to be third-party outside brands. At least for the start, outside third-party brands and really building out that assortment. And then over time, there is the potential for own brands, but not a focus in the near term.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: This idea of you capturing more than beyond festivals events, something that Michael talks about recently, I guess, broadly, what's the strategy there? And what have you seen from a market share or loss share perspective in your existing customer base? And you look at Nordstorm's 35 million customers and say that those are our customers hopefully over time. Is that the base condition that you expect?</p><p>JESSE TIMMERMANS: Yeah, absolutely. We see those 35 million customers as very addressable, and we continue to take share. And then you add Nordstrom plus Macy's plus Saks plus Neiman plus everybody else, we think we can continue to take share. And again, largely addressable when we expand categories, when you expand age/demographics. So that is the goal, both in that core customer, address more aspects of her wallet.</p><p>Beauty, for example, is a great way to acquire new customers. New customer is over-indexed on beauty versus the other. So it's a great price point to get her. Also, a great add-on product if she's buying the dress to throw in a beauty product.</p><p>And then I mentioned, the men's where 30% to 50% of the male purchases out there come from a female. We have this very captive and active female audience. So tapping into that.</p><p>And then just the other adjacent categories. Cold weather gear, for example, historically, it's been all about -- not all about, but skewed towards summer, spring, the festival, the dresses, the swim, the going out.</p><p>Two years ago, we started to push more on ski and ski wear. So that really curated aspirational, going to Aspen Veil Switzerland and really looking your best while you're in the lodge, while you're skiing. And that's performed really well over the last couple of years.</p><p>So more opportunity to spread the sales out across the year, tap into more aspects of her wallet, and expand the TAM via some of those other demographics.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: And it involves a bit of a different [message here]. I think some people see Instagram as (inaudible). But as TikTok and other platforms emerge, it actually benefits the strategy as far as being able to reach broader audience in different aspects of their life.</p><p>JESSE TIMMERMANS: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. We feel we -- are around for 20 years, so we are around before Instagram, before Facebook. So there's -- she's always look to somebody, something, some influencer to guide her in her purchase, whether that was the fashion editor in the early days, that moved to bloggers, that moved to influencers on Instagram with a static post that shifted now more recently to video, whether video being on Instagram or on TikTok.</p><p>So we've been able to really navigate and be at the forefront of all of those shifts. And like I said, she'll always look to something or somebody before that influence. So we're confident that we can continue to shift. Where she's at we'll be at. And we'll be -- I think the key is being authentic, having the right merchandise, combined with the right marketing, whatever kind of venue or vehicle that's in.</p><p>AI, I had mentioned in the early part of the presentation that being an AI-generated image. And that permeates throughout the organization and throughout the growth strategies.</p><p>We think AI is real. It's here. We've been using AI/machine learning for years, whether that's through in the early days of inventory planning, inventory management.</p><p>That moved more recent in the last couple of years to operational things like fraud detection and loss package prediction. And now, more recently, that AI editorial campaigns, this kind of feeds into how you shift the marketing, shift the messaging, shift the product in a really quick way. So that AI image, it was a campaign, multiple models, AI generated.</p><p>With clothing, we actually took that, that clothing that was produced via AI and produce physical goods and sold that via our own brand platform to real customers. So that's the next step is, using AI for editorial, for creative, for next-step design. And just the speed of iteration that we can accomplish through AI versus the traditional processes, we're pretty excited about.</p><p>And then longer term, the site experience. And I mentioned return rate increasing. We are looking to decrease return rate, but in win-win ways for the customer and for us.</p><p>We're not going to make it harder for her and start charging for returns, shortening the window, pulling the return slip from the package. We know that if you do some of those things, return rate will increase. But it also is a negative experience for her and will impact that long-term retention that we're proud of and that benefits us over the long term.</p><p>So are there ways via technology, via AI to improve the experience for her on the site through personalization, recommendations, that's more near term. Longer term is their augmented reality, AI-generated virtual try on that to make that first purchase more educated.</p><p>I think there will always be the case where she's going to an event on Saturday. She needs a dress. She's going by five to make sure she gets the right one for that event, and we're okay with that. But it's just making that experience better and better for her.</p><p>And to the extent we can't reduce the return rate, she continues to behave in that way and buy the multiple dresses to keep that one, then offset that with cost and efficiency improvements through East Coast distribution center, through better inventory flows, and a number of other projects where we're working on.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: (inaudible) active customers, is that all individuals, or (inaudible)</p><p>JESSE TIMMERMANS: No, all individuals. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's a -- yeah, you mentioned rent the runway. It's all purchases and returns and individual customers, but we do have a sizable reverse logistics process given that if our $1 billion of sales and we have a 50%-plus return rates, we're actually selling $2 billion to get $1 billion returned to net to that $1 billion. So it's a pretty scaled operation.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Can you squeeze it to one minute how you're managing costs?</p><p>JESSE TIMMERMANS: One minute. Managing costs, yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Why is it difficult from a marketing standpoint (inaudible)</p><p>JESSE TIMMERMANS: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Number one, the premium price point helps, especially on that return rate where you have more room to absorb the cost of the returns versus operating at a lower price point and you're paying the same cost per package going in and out. So that's a benefit for us. And really, a moat is that premium price point, the premium nature of the product.</p><p>The areas we are focused on controlling costs, I guess, one is gross margin, working through that inventory, getting back to a higher full-price mix. We're confident in that. We're confident we can do that in the near term.</p><p>If you work down the P&amp;L, the fulfillment line item, I mentioned East Coast distribution center. That is very early on, early innings. So as we grow into that space, scale efficiencies, and then also cost benefit from not shipping onesie-twosie products back and forth from the East Coast to the West Coast, but refulfilling within the East Coast.</p><p>That also impacts the selling and distribution line item where you're offsetting that return rate with those freight savings and not shipping back and forth.</p><p>Next step on the fulfillment footprint is looking at international distribution centers, small footprint, international distribution centers to do that refulfillment, or holding the returns in the region and reshipping to that customer in the region.</p><p>And then we have probably two dozen other individual initiatives against that selling and distribution line item from looking at international freight carriers and using alternative carriers, optimizing rates within existing carriers, domestically looking at line haul opportunities, and different last-mile carriers to get better freight rates there.</p><p>We're also seeing fuel surcharge start to abate. So that was a peak. Last Q2, we're starting to see a tailwind from that versus a headwind that we've been seeing for the last several years. Marketing is one where we are not calling that a cost savings. With a strong balance sheet with the strong customer that we have, we want to continue to market, continue to acquire customers.</p><p>While others are pulling back and forced to play defense, we think this is a great opportunity to really build for the future and come out stronger when we get through this cycle.</p><p>And in G&amp;A, being around for 20 years, that's largely fixed. And we get scale efficiencies on that line item over time. And this is, again, an opportunity for us when others are pulling back and -- for example, firing engineers, we're hiring engineers. We're going more global with our technology and back-office infrastructure.</p><p>So a lot of opportunity in these kind of disjointed times.</p><p>DYLAN CARDEN: (inaudible - microphone inaccessible)</p><p>JESSE TIMMERMANS: Thanks.</p><p>DYLAN CARDEN: Thanks, everyone, for being here.</p><p>[Refinitiv, an LSEG business, reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

I am the analyst here that covers Revolve. We're pleased today to have Jesse Timmermans, CFO. Do you want to take it away?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jesse Timmermans:</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yeah, sure.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dylan Carden:</emphasis></p><p>Great. Thanks, everyone.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jesse Timmermans:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Dylan. I will jump in. I know it sounds like some of you are generalists here. So I'll take it a step further beyond what Dylan kind of communicated earlier to me, is that we sell clothes online, pretty simple. But it's way more complicated than that and complicated in an exciting way.</p><p>I'm going to pause here just a second on the intro slide. This is actually a AI-generated image. We'll get into AI and technology here in a minute, but we were pretty excited about this campaign heading into Revolve Festival this past month or in April, and a lot of good stuff going on on the AI front.</p><p>So if you step back, we're actually celebrating our 20th year anniversary this year. So we've been around a while. Mike and Michael founded the company 20 years ago, not fashion guys. So they relied on data and technology to actually kind of create revolve.</p><p>It's based on, like I said, data and technology, data-driven merchandising, combined with a powerful marketing engine. And that's important. You can have the powerful marketing, the social media marketing, but without the great merchandise, it doesn't -- it's not as impactful. And on the flip side, too, you can have the great merchandise, but if you don't have that authentic connection with this next generation consumer, you are not as impactful.</p><p>We have a global reach. Just shy of 20% of our sales are to customers outside of the US. And that's a growing market for us, huge TAM. Again, we've been doing this for 20 years. We've been profitable every year except for 2008 in the great financial crisis.</p><p>And that gets back to the founder-led, entrepreneurial culture. Mike and Michael actually bootstrapped the company through the financial crisis, only took our first funding in 2012, went public actually four years ago today. Strong balance sheet, again, consistently profitable over time and growing in a large market.</p><p>If you look at the market, we are squarely positioned between two really significant shifts that are happening right now, e-commerce, which has been happening. That continues to grow. We expect that to continue to grow and the brick and mortar share shifting to e-commerce over time. And then we have purchasing power of this next-generation consumer and that shifting to this next-generation consumer over time.</p><p>And it's important because she shops differently. She's digital, social, engaged; she wants discovery; she wants newness, and I'd say she -- 97% of our sales are to the millennial female. We'll get into men's and some of the other growth opportunities in a minute, but it is primarily a female-focused destination at this point.</p><p>We serve her through two complementary destinations. We say complementary because they are unique and different, but also complementary, in primarily the product assortment and the price point. And Revolve is the lion's share of the business, 84%. You can see the AOV there of $279. This is primarily dresses, going out apparel. You know it's kind of that festival this summer, expanding into categories such as active and outerwear and cold weather gear, different from our historical kind of the summer-spring festival.</p><p>I think if you kind of rewind a few years, we'd run into a customer on the street and she would say, I love Revolve. I'm going to a party this weekend or I'm going to a festival and I've got my dress there. We used to think that was a great compliment. Now it's almost kind of a constructive criticism because we want her to say, I love Revolve because I go for my dress for festival, for active, for beauty, for my significant other, which is what we're working on and a huge growth opportunity for us.</p><p>Complemented with Forward. This is the higher-end luxury destination, and complementary in that it is a different price point, and it skews more handbags and shoes than dresses. We know that if she's buying a $200 dress, she's complementing that with a multi-thousand dollar handbag, a statement pair of shoes, something unique and special from Forward.</p><p>You can see the different brand assortments here, and we have always emerging and established brands, but primarily emerging. We have about 20% of the Revolve businesses are own brands that we design and develop in-house. We call them own brands, not private label, because they are true brands in the eyes of the consumer. These aren't kind of knockoff lower price point brands. And then the luxury brands from the Forward destination.</p><p>And Forward really differentiated from the traditional luxury players in that curation and that kind of young luxury feel. If you compare it to say a Farfetch, which if you know what you want, you go to Farfetch because they have everything under the sun. Mytheresa, great operators, but a little bit kind of older school, older style luxury versus the Kendall Jenner, West Coast, kind of young luxury feel with a lot of -- lot more emerging brands combined with those established brands.</p><p>Customer service and focus on that customer has been core to the business since day one. Combined with the data-driven merchandising that I mentioned at first, Mike and Michael treated the home as a dressing room from day one. They were trying to create the biggest, the best, the most curated department store online, and in order to replicate that experience, they knew you have to have free shipping and free returns.</p><p>And on top of that, just fast; everything fast, accurate, great customer experience, all of our fulfillment is one P, our customer service is one P. So we're really controlling everything soup to nuts on that customer experience. And that comes through -- we'll get into retention and the customer dynamics here in a bit, but you can see the record NPS score and increasing over time. And that develops this really trusted relationship with her. So she comes back more frequently over time and also buys at higher average order values.</p><p>Again, 20-year anniversary, long track record of profitable growth. Profitable growth is the key. We're very capital efficient, which leads to a strong balance sheet. You can see the 22%, three-year CAGR here. We did have a dip during COVID. We're all about going out, living your best life. So when COVID hit, of course, everything was put on hold for us. We had to shift pretty quickly and abruptly into the COVID categories like active and kind of home and beauty and things like that versus the dresses that we are known for. And then when COVID was over, just as abruptly, shifting back into dresses and going out. And you can see the recovery there. Again, consistently profitable.</p><p>And taking share over time, you can see that here Revolve versus the industry e-commerce growth benchmark, where we outperform every year, again, except for that COVID year.</p><p>I mentioned the capital efficiency. Capex is generally, call it, less than 1% of net sales. Here we have some peaks and valleys, but it's generally consistent over time, which leads to a really strong balance sheet. We ended the quarter -- last quarter with $283 million in cash. We had strong positive free cash flow in the quarter, and that really stands out when you look at the peer group here with the growth and profitability and cash flow with really just Revolve and then you have Zalando here as well.</p><p>But really important, especially in a kind of a macro environment that we're in today where strong balance sheet, cash is king, we can stay kind of front-footed on the marketing and technology investments where others are forced to pull back and make the wrong decision for the long term.</p><p>We'll get into customers here a little bit. Active customers at 2.3 million -- billion -- yeah, 2.3 million, sorry. And they buy at full price. Again, she comes to us for a discovery, for what's new, what's exciting. She's not coming to us for the price or for a discount. And with that strong customer service, she comes back to us more frequently over time. Our revenue retention is over 100%. If you look at year two and beyond, if you blend the year one and year two, you can see the retention to the pre-existing cohort net sales here.</p><p>COVID dipped down to 74%. Of course, we had a strong rebound to get to 120%, and then even last year was 97% revenue retention. So again, a really strong customer dynamic. You can see the stacks of the cohorts on this slide, which really brings it home. And again, we have 20 years of cohorts, really consistent behavior from those customers, and really back to the customer service, the data-driven merchandising, really the core of what Revolve is.</p><p>And the customers, here is a good visual of the activity of those customers, the number of orders placed per active customer. Active customer, to clarify, is a trailing 12-month number. So if you look at the active customers versus the orders placed over the last 12 months, over three and a half orders per active customer, which is down from that COVID recovery period of 2021, but still higher than our pre-COVID level. So again, showing that activity over time. And we think we can increase that activity and also the net sales per active customer increasing over time.</p><p>Our pre-existing customers, because of that frequency and that retention rate, active customers, 50% of our active customers are pre-existing customers. That 50% makes up 77% of the orders and 79% of the net sales. So there you can see that 50% punches above their weight on the orders and then even more so on the net sales, showing both a frequency increase and the average order value increase over time.</p><p>We look at the most recent quarter, very challenging times. It was a mixed quarter for us, starting with a positive on the left here. Number one priority going into the quarter was to right-size our inventory. If you can rewind to COVID, we pulled back significantly. We reassorted into those kind of stay-at-home COVID categories. When the world opened up again, we reassorted and pivoted back into the dresses, chased demand, and then kind of around mid-year May, June of last year, when the economy started to slow down, we had to pull back, we were over-inventory like many others out there.</p><p>Number one priority kind of leaving 2022 and into 2023 was to right-size that inventory. We think we're on track and had a really successful quarter in bringing that inventory back into check, which resulted in $48 million of free cash flow. And that's two times that of the full year of 2022 primarily because of that inventory dynamic and really bringing things back in check.</p><p>On the more challenging side, it is tough out there. The consumer sentiment is low, consumer is challenged. She is making decisions between that dress and paying for gas and paying for rent and all the other inflationary costs out there. So we ended the quarter at minus 1%. That led into April, which was minus 7%. And then most recently, this past month of May, we were down mid-single digits. So the pressure has continued. We really saw a progressively more challenging quarter as the quarter progressed in Q1 where typically we see March 120% that of January. This year, March was actually lower than January, which is very atypical for our seasonality where we see a build into that spring and summer season and festival and that going out time.</p><p>So very challenging time, I think both from a demand perspective and just her sentiment. And then also on the cost perspective. Costs are higher, inflation is real, return rates for us are up year-on-year, and then over a multi-year period as well. There's some longer-term dynamics at play there, but also just a consumer shift where she is more and more comfortable returning, coming out of COVID. She was more comfortable returning. And then when we see these abrupt macro shifts, we do see an increase in that return rate.</p><p>The increase in return rate has a meaningful impact on the cost structure, which resulted in still positive adjusted EBITDA, but a 5.4% margin, which was down year-over-year. We have a lot of things in the works to bring that back to the double digits, but it's going to take some time to work through that both on the return rate front, inflationary costs, working through this cycle, but confident in the long term. And with the strong balance sheet, we're confident we're making the right decisions now to benefit us over the long term and not pulling back in the wrong areas.</p><p>I mentioned inventory. That was the number one priority coming into the quarter, right-sizing inventory. So you can just see the visual here where that differential between the net sales growth and the inventory growth has significantly compressed from the, call it, the trough of Q2 '22.</p><p>And looking -- I mentioned making the right investments for the long term and having a strong balance sheet and allowing us to do that through these kind of disjointed times. I think we are founded in a down-cycle and that dot-com burst of 2000 -- just after the 2001-2002. We bootstrapped through the great financial crisis. I think if you ask Mike and Michael and living through that and operating through that, we came out stronger. So I'll use the analogy that Mike uses in that this is kind of like a forest fire where it kind of weeds out all that small brush and only the stronger left standing.</p><p>And we feel the same today. With a stronger balance sheet, we're even more confident. So we're able to invest, continue on the marketing. We are launching a Forward pop-up tomorrow. Yeah, tomorrow is kind of private opening night for that. This is one of the larger Forward dedicated brand marketing investments we've made to date. This is a pop-up shop in LA curated by Kendall Jenner, our creative director, both from an aesthetic perspective and then also the brands that we're going to carry there. So it's one store and then also a place for events. So we'll have multiple events throughout the course of that pop-up shop.</p><p>Also a test into accepting returns in a physical location. What does that do to the customer experience? One of our initiatives is to increase the cross-shopping between that Revolve customer and the Forward customer. Again, we know if she's buying that $200 dress, she's buying a handbag, why not at Forward. So really cross-marketing to that powerful 2.3 million active Revolve customers. So Revolve customers can actually take the returns to this Forward pop-up. So doing a little bit more of that cross marketing, cross-shopping initiative.</p><p>Forward Renew, a great way to acquire new customers. This is selling pre-owned handbags on Forward, both from a buyback perspective where we buy back the bag from an existing Forward customer and also curating other third-party authenticated handbags that maybe it's a brand we weren't able to carry on Forward. So it's a great way to attract that new customer into Forward.</p><p>International is a growth initiative. We partnered with Nykaaa in India to tap into that market. The Middle East and Mexico, some of those emerging markets have been the fast-growing markets for us as of recent. And then LOBA, recent own brand launch. We're really optimistic and excited about the own brands platform over the long term. LOBA and Helsa are two of the most recent launches. These are partnerships with influencers, celebrities that have performed very well.</p><p>And then kind of on the back office, the efficiency front, really excited about AI and then we have our East Coast fulfillment center that we are ramping up that will offset some of the increased costs from those returns and also provide a better customer experience for the customers on the East Coast.</p><p>And just a quote here from Mike, our co-founder in showing their ownership, so very much aligned in that Mike and Michael still own about 45% of the outstanding share. So I think that entrepreneurial, founder-led spirit is still here today, very active co-CEOs and founders in the business.</p><p>Looking ahead, the growth drivers, as we cycle through this, whatever we're in and however long it takes, we do think there's just huge opportunity in the core. So we have a lot of other growth initiatives, but even without those, we think there's opportunity in this core. Only 3% penetrated in the target demographic. You get to that 3% in a number of ways. You can look at the number of women in the US, 18 to 44, which is our target age demographic. You can look at our sales versus what we define as the TAM in the US, which also triangulates to about 3%. And because TAMs are squishy and populations are squishy, you can look at just to kind of -- as a gut check, look at the active customers for some of the existing players out there and how Revolve compares to that. And we continue to take share from these existing players.</p><p>The offering. I mentioned the -- kind of that order frequency and how do we get her to come to us for more than just a dress and more than just the festival. Beauty is a really exciting opportunity for us, great tool for customer acquisition, lower price point. We know she's buying beauty of course from somewhere. Why not Revolve? We think we can curate better and different. We have her engaged, we have a great experience.</p><p>It's around 3% of our sales now. If you look at comparables out there, we think it can be more than 10% of the business over time. Just hired a dedicated beauty director that is -- number one, acquiring brands. That's the first step in beauty, is to acquire the brands, get the right assortment on the website, then work on the experience, and this is kind of similar to what we did for Forward, similar to what we do for international when we're going through growth initiatives. So one, get the product; two, get the experience right, and then really start to market the product to the customer.</p><p>Men's, another opportunity; about the same size as beauty right now at about, call it, low single digits percent of the business. We carry men's across both Revolve and Forward, so another great cross-shopping opportunity. We also know that the female, typically 30% to 50% of the purchases for the male come from a female. We have a very captive and engaged female audience. So we see a lot of opportunity in men's. Also not really anybody out there, really curating men's and providing a really great destination for that male in the way we think we can. And then actively using as an example of other adjacent categories that we can expand into.</p><p>Beauty, just a quick kind of chart there to show the opportunity. Oh, and I guess I should get back to the cross-shopping. I mentioned the cross-shopping opportunity between Revolve and Forward. We think we can tap that 2 point -- the vast majority of that 2.3 million active customers on Revolve and sell Forward to her.</p><p>A couple of the recent things we have done, the loyalty program that we had on Revolve, launching that on Forward and allowing her to use her loyalty points cross platform; updating the site now so that Forward and men's are both more prominent on the site and easier to navigate between the two destinations. I mentioned the marketing that we're doing and more kind of cross-marketing between the two dedicated emails about Forward to that Revolve customer. This is more on Forward.</p><p>And then International. International is just shy of 20% of the business today. Over time we have -- again, number one is get the service and the product right. Service internationally involved making that international experience more like the US customer experience where it's free shipping, free returns. Historically, if you rewind five years ago, really painful for an international customer where you had to pay for your return. Not only did you have to pay for your return, but if you look at Canada, for example, you would be shocked at the checkout because you have these incremental Canadian taxes that you'd have to pay.</p><p>And then if you want to return the product, you need to go to the government to recollect those taxes. We wouldn't refund those taxes. So now with all-inclusive pricing, everything is included in the price on the website. Then if you return, you get the full price returned and refunded to you, and then we work with the Canadian government to recollect those taxes. So huge improvement in the customer experience. Of course, that does increase the return rate, but more than offset by the increase in gross sales, which increases the net sales. So that localization started in the UK, moved into Europe, moved into Australia. Canada was one of the more recent large -- larger markets to launch that all-inclusive pricing and localization.</p><p>Those western markets, the more established markets have been more challenged recently both from a macro perspective and then also from a currency perspective. We price in US dollar and then convert to the local currency. So when you have a strong US dollar, you add a pricing disadvantage to the tune of 10% plus or minus in those core regions like the UK and Europe, also Australia. So those regions being challenged, but offset by really great growth coming from some of our emerging regions like Mexico, China, Middle East, India. Mexico has doubled year-over-year and is now one of our top five markets.</p><p>And then looking ahead, internationally, it's all about that customer experience, number one; get the product right, number two, technology, site enhancement, payment types, and then we can really start to market to that international customer. Right now we are indirectly marketing. Social media really has no boundaries outside of maybe China, so -- and we have an international influencer base. So we are indirectly tapping into that international customer, but going in country by country and more dedicated and specific marketing to that customer to expand the share.</p><p>Own brands. Huge opportunity for us in the long run. If you look back kind of at the history of own brands, we went from zero to 36% in five years from 2014 to 2019. That was too fast. And we became over-assorted in certain categories and price points. And kind of V2 of the own brands is to grow that, but in a more moderate pace. And we think we can have a more profitable own brand business at a lower percentage of net sales than we did before.</p><p>And that's going to come through a combination of new brands; also new styles and products within the existing brands expanding into additional categories. One of the recent categories was Wellbeing + Beingwell, which is a sustainable, active brand that we launched. And then also partnering with influencers, celebrities, personalities. If you think about Helsa, recent launch that has performed very well, and unique from our own brand perspective in that Helsa was carried on both Forward and Revolve, kind of edited differently for each of those sites, but the product was similar. So a really great launch, and then I mentioned LOBA, which was a recent launch, performing really well and really tapping more into that younger GenZ consumer versus the millennial that's been at the core.</p><p>And that is a wrap.</p><h>Questions And Answers</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dylan Carden:</emphasis></p><p>So we have about eight minutes here. We have a Q&amp;A breakout at [indecipherable] on the Midwest. But if anyone has questions now, happy to fill them.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>[indecipherable] anything about going into France or outside [indecipherable]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jesse Timmermans:</emphasis></p><p>Mostly outside. I think at some point -- sorry, the question was for beauty, can we expand with own brands or is it going to be kind of third-party outside brands. At least for the start, outside third-party brands and really building out that assortment. Then over time, there is the potential for own brands, but not a focus in the near term.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dylan Carden:</emphasis></p><p>This idea of you kind of capturing more than beyond festivals, events, something that Michael talks about increasingly, I guess broadly, what's the strategy there and sort of what have you seen from a market share or a wallet share perspective of your existing customer base? And do you look at Nordstrom's 35 million customers and say those are our customers hopefully over time? Is that sort of the basic transition that you are expecting? Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. So yeah, we see those 35 million customers as very addressable and we continue to take share and then you add Nordstrom plus Macy's plus Saks plus Neiman plus everybody else. We think we can continue to take share, and again, largely addressable when we expand categories, when we expand age/demographics. So that is the goal both in that core customer, address more aspects of her wallet. Beauty, for example, is a great way to acquire new customers. New customers over-index on beauty versus the other. So it's a great price point to get her; also a great add-on product if she's buying the dress to throw in a beauty product. And then I mentioned the men's where 30% to 50% of the male purchases out there come from a female. We have this very captive and active female audience. So tapping into that. And then just the other adjacent categories. Cold weather gear, for example, historically, it's been all about -- not all about, but skewed towards summer, spring, the festival, the dresses, the swim, the going out. Two years ago, we started to push more on ski and ski wear. So that really curated, aspirational, going to Aspen, Vail, Switzerland, and really kind of looking your best while you're in the lodge, while you're skiing, and that's performed really well over the last couple of years. So more opportunity to spread the sales out across the year, tap into more aspects of her wallet and expand the TAM via some of those other demographics. And what was a bit of a different messaging, right? I mean, I think some people say, oh, Instagram is losing its appeal or Facebook [indecipherable] but as TikTok and other platforms emerge, it actually benefits strategy as far as being able to reach a broader audience [indecipherable] Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. We feel -- we are around for 20 years. So we were around before Instagram, before Facebook. So there's -- she's always looked to somebody, something, some influencer to guide her in her purchase, whether that was kind of the fashion editor in the early days, that moved to bloggers, that moved to influencers on Instagram with a static post that shifted now more recently to video, whether video being on Instagram or on TikTok. So we've been able to really navigate and be at the forefront of all of those shifts. And like I said, she'll always look to something or somebody for that influence. So we're confident that we can continue to shift where she's at, will be at, and will be, I think, the key is being authentic, having the right merchandise, combined with the right marketing, whatever kind of venue or vehicle that's in. AI, I had mentioned in the early kind of part of the presentation, that being an AI-generated image. And that kind of permeates throughout the organization and throughout the growth strategies. We think AI is real, it's here. We've been using AI/machine learning for years, whether that's through in early days of kind of inventory planning, inventory management. That moved more recently, in the last couple of years, to operational things like fraud detection, lost package, prediction. And now more recently, that AI editorial campaigns, this kind of feeds into how you can kind of shift the marketing, shift the messaging, shift the product in a really quick way. So that AI image, it was a campaign, multiple models, AI generated. With clothing, we actually took that clothing that was produced via AI and produced physical goods and sold that via our own brand platform to real customers. So that's the next step, is using AI for editorial, for creative, for next step design and just the speed of iteration that we can accomplish through AI versus the traditional processes, we're pretty excited about. And then longer term, the site experience and I mentioned return rate increasing. We are looking to decrease return rate, but in win-win ways for the customer and for us. We're not going to make it harder for her and start charging for returns, shortening the window, pulling the return slip from the package. We know that if you do some of those things, return rate will increase, but it also is a negative experience for her and will impact that long-term retention that we're proud of, and that benefits us over the long term. So are there ways via technology, via AI to improve the experience for her on the site through personalization, recommendations? That's more near term. Longer term is there, augmented reality, AI-generated kind of virtual try-on to make that first purchase more educated. I think there will always be the case where she's going to an event on Saturday, she needs a dress, she's going to buy five to make sure she gets the right one for that event. And we're okay with that. But it's just making that experience better and better for her. And to the extent we can't reduce the return rate, she continues to behave in that way and by the multiple dresses to keep that one. Then offset that with cost and efficiency improvements through East Coast distribution center, through better inventory kind of flows, and a number of other projects where we're working on. When you refer to active customers, is that all individuals or you have [indecipherable]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jesse Timmermans:</emphasis></p><p>No, all individuals. Yeah, yeah. It's -- yeah, you mentioned [indecipherable]. It's all purchases and returns and individual customers, but we do have a sizable reverse logistics process given that if our $1 billion of sales and we have a 50% plus return rates, we're actually selling $2 billion to get $1 billion return to net to that $1 billion. So it's a pretty scaled operation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dylan Carden:</emphasis></p><p>[indecipherable] one minute, how you're managing costs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jesse Timmermans:</emphasis></p><p>One minute, managing costs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dylan Carden:</emphasis></p><p>From a marketing standpoint. [indecipherable] marketing stand, and then yeah, you mentioned sort of the [indecipherable]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jesse Timmermans:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, yeah, yeah. We -- number one, the premium price point helps, especially on that return rate, where you have more room to absorb the cost of the returns versus operating at a lower price point, you're paying the same cost per package going in and out. So that's a benefit for us. And really, a moat is that premium price point, the premium nature of the product.</p><p>The areas we are focused on controlling cost, I guess, one is gross margin, working through that inventory, getting back to a higher full-price mix. We're confident in that, we're confident we can do that in the near term. If you work down the P&amp;L, the fulfillment line item. I mentioned East Coast distribution center. That is very early on, early innings. So as we grow into that space, scale efficiencies, and then also cost benefit from not shipping onesie, twosie products back and forth from the East Coast to the West Coast, but re-fulfilling within the East Coast. That also impacts the selling and distribution line item where you're offsetting that kind of the return rate with those freight savings and not shipping back and forth.</p><p>Next step on the fulfillment footprint is looking at international distribution centers, small footprint international distribution centers to do that refulfillment where we're holding the returns in the region and reshipping to that customer in the region. And then we have probably two dozen other individual initiatives against that selling and distribution line item from looking at the international freight carriers and using alternative carriers, optimizing rates within existing carriers, domestically looking at line haul opportunities and different last-mile carriers to get better freight rates there.</p><p>We're also seeing fuel surcharge start to abate. So that was a peak last Q2. We're starting to see a tailwind from that versus a headwind that we've been seeing for the last several years.</p><p>Marketing is one where we are not calling that a cost savings. With the strong balance sheet, with the strong customer that we have, we want to continue to -- market continue to acquire customers. While others are pulling back and forced to play defense, we think this is a great opportunity to really build for the future and come out stronger when we get through this cycle.</p><p>And then G&amp;A, being around for 20 years, that's largely fixed, and we get scale efficiencies on that line item over time. And this is, again, an opportunity for us. When others are pulling back and, for example, firing engineers, we're hiring engineers. We're going more global with our technology and back office infrastructure. So a lot of opportunity in these kind of disjointed times.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dylan Carden:</emphasis></p><p>[indecipherable]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jesse Timmermans:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Dylan.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALPANT-e008d98d29a35c16b3096199a09dd486</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALPANT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GTK-K4F3-RS7P-V4PJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">494744</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5509\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023AlphaStreet Inc., All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Alphastreet, Inc. - Earnings and Conference Call Transcripts</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"65767\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 7, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000542</classCode><className>ANNUAL FINANCIAL RESULTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001410</classCode><className>COMPANY PROFITS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp;

Due to night fall and the steep rugged terrain firefighters began initial attack first thing the morning on August 8. A cold front that day produced sustained windspeeds of 30-40 mph on the fire, which increased fire activity resulting in the fire growing to approximately 250 acres. Helicopters were unable to fly and drop water on the fire due to the winds. Additionally, due to safety concerns which included numerous snags and very active fire behavior, the firefighters disengaged from the fire.</p><p>Following the cold front event, two (2) Type 1 crews (20 people) and a Type I helicopter have been assigned to the fire. Crews are beginning by working to secure the Middle Fork corridor, and then will move to complete containment lines around the fire perimeter. The helicopter will make water drops on the fire to help slow the spread of the fire and strengthen containment lines.</p><p>In addition to the full suppression actions, Forest Fire Managers have also inserted one (1) Wildland Fire Modules (10 people) at Thomas Creek Airstrip to begin evaluating values at risk which are defined as property, structures, physical improvements, natural and cultural resources, community infrastructure, and economic, environmental, and social values such as the Middle Fork River corridor. This work includes evaluations and an appropriate level of preparatory work for defense of the identified values to initiate a point protection strategy if needed due to fire behavior.</p><p>WEATHER: High pressure ridge aloft will move over Idaho and expect dry and warm conditions through Friday. Winds are expected to be lighter on Wednesday as the ridge axis moves closer but areas of afternoon 10 to 20 mph gusts will still be present. The next chance for showers and thunderstorms will be Saturday mainly in zone 476 then become much more widespread Sunday into next Tuesday. Will have potential for significant wind increase Monday with cold frontal passage.</p><p>CLOSURES AND RESTRICTIONS: No closures are in place for the Scarface Fire. If you are recreating near an ongoing wildfire suppression operation, please keep your distance - do not congregate in the area and allow the firefighters to do their job safely and efficiently.</p><p>Forest officials are asking the public to be extremely careful when recreating on the Forest. The 2021 fire season has begun with unseasonably high temperatures and low fuel moistures, so it's especially imperative this year for the public to be aware of the very high fire danger and Stage 1 Fire Restriction for the entire Salmon-Challis National Forest, excluding the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness. We can all make a difference in reducing human-caused fires during this season. Remember, One Less Spark Means One Less Wildfire.</p><p>Nationally, there are 96 uncontained large fires being managed under a full suppression strategy and 52 large fires managed under a strategy other than full suppression.

More than half of the 'national interest' section in its amicus brief argued that the military 'depends on a well-qualified and diverse officer corps' which requires that colleges select for diversity over merit.</p><p>'It is not possible to achieve that diversity without race-conscious admissions, including at the nation's service academies,' Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar told the Supreme Court.</p><p>The Roberts decision in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard shot down affirmative action as a legal practice, but punted on the question of racial discrimination within the military and its service branch academies. A footnote briefly stated that, 'no military academy is a party to these cases, however, and none of the courts below addressed the propriety of race-based admissions systems in that context. This opinion also does not address the issue, in light of the potentially distinct interests that military academies may present.'</p><p>The idea that racial discrimination should be illegal at colleges, but still legal at service branch academies like the Air Force Academy and the Naval Academy, is a loophole. Justice Sotomayor argued that the exception proves that 'the Fourteenth Amendment does not categorically prohibit the use of race in college admissions.' And it's hard to deny her reasoning. Either racially discriminating against students is legal or it's illegal. National security can only go so far to justify an illegal practice especially when it's a social element with an indirect effect.</p><p>Democrats quickly attacked Justice Roberts for seemingly leaving the carveout on military diversity that the Biden administration had demanded as a matter of national security</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/detransitioner-files-1m-lawsuit-against-doctors-botched-mastectomy-left-her-permanently-disfigured\">Detransitioner Files $1m Lawsuit Against Doctors for Botched Mastectomy That Left Her 'Permanently Disfigured'</url></p><p>A 21-year-old Texas woman who detransitioned is suing a medical clinic and its doctors for 'gross malpractice' after she was put on puberty blockers at 17 and was pressured into a botched double mastectomy that she says left her 'permanently disfigured.'</p><p>Soren Aldaco offered an emotional recollection of her traumatic medical transition in an exclusive interview on 'The Ingraham Angle' Monday, revealing details of a $1 million lawsuit she filed last week against the doctors and a nurse practitioner who, according to the suit, pushed her to transition, 'irreversibly disfiguring and disabling' her with surgical mutilation while ignoring a host of mental health challenges she was struggling with at the time.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://slaynews.com/news/elon-musk-warns-moviegoers-woke-barbie-movie-you-will-pass-out-before-it-ends/\">Elon Musk Warns Moviegoers About Woke 'Barbie' Movie: 'You Will Pass Out Before it Ends'</url></p><p>Twitter boss Elon Musk has slammed the new 'Barbie' movie and warned social media users about the film's 'woke' agenda.</p><p>Musk joined the chorus of critics who have panned the 'Barbie' movie.</p><p>In response to another user's Twitter post, Musk blasted the movie's incessant carping about the 'patriarchy.'</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://summit.news/2023/07/25/panic/\">Panic!</url></p><p>They're saying, 'Heat is the new COVID.'</p><p>Manipulating data and spreading fear to coerce the population into mass compliance.</p><p>Yeah, the similarities are uncanny.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.infowars.com/posts/putin-signs-law-banning-gender-reassignment/\">Putin Signs Law Banning Gender Reassignment</url></p><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed a law banning gender reassignment in all cases except when allowed for health reasons.</p><p>The relevant document is published at the official legal information portal.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/temple-u-host-philly-fatcon-queer-sex-therapist-offering-fat-positive-sexual-healthcare\">Temple U to Host Philly 'FatCon' With Queer Sex Therapist Offering 'Fat Positive Sexual Healthcare'</url></p><p>Temple University is set to host the first-ever Philly 'FatCon' this October, a conference boasting its role as an exclusively judgment-free fat-focused event featuring 'fat-friendly' fitness classes, vendors, talks with influencers, a Halloween costume party, and more.</p><p>'The Fat Sex Therapist' Sonalee Rashatwar, who uses they/he pronouns according to one of the con's Instagram posts, is slated to be the conference keynote speaker.

As such, the school implemented policies prohibiting the use and possession of smoke-related substances. This includes tobacco and nicotine products and e-cigarettes such as vapes and Juuls. The policy also extends to marijuana use and possession. According to Drew University's website, the new rules were implemented in light of the United States Surgeon General's statements regarding smoking which state, \"Environmental tobacco has been classified as a Group 1 carcinogen, and that any exposure to tobacco and/or nicotine smoke is hazardous.\" Furthermore, the University webpage devoted to the policy says Drew wanted to create a safe environment and protect the health and wellbeing of the community, considering that Group 1 carcinogens have the ability to cause cancer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In theory, a smoke-free campus is a fantastic idea. Prior to the implementation of these campus-wide regulations, smoking of all types was negatively impacting the campus and the environment. University air was being polluted by smoke from cigarettes, vapes and marijuana, not only outside but inside the dorms as well. Students reported smoke from other rooms seeping into their dorms through vents, hindering their ability to maintain a level of comfort while also exposing them to carcinogens.</p><p>With the new policy, this cloud has cleared and there have been other considerable benefits. The primary benefit: protecting students and the general Drew community from being exposed to the harmful effects of smoking, tobacco and nicotine products, regardless of first or second hand exposure.</p><p>However, the policy is problematic because it is extremely difficult to regulate and implement for several reasons. Firstly, a significant portion of students who smoke have moved this activity indoors so as to avoid scrutiny or being reprimanded for smoking on campus. Although there has been significantly less odor outdoors, dorm residents are experiencing more and more issues with smoke going through the vents into their dorm rooms. Not only is the smell of the smoke unpleasant to some residents but indoor smoking also increases the negative carcinogenic impact of the smoke because there is less circulation, which maintains the presence of the harmful gases in the air for longer periods of time. Regardless of how strictly the policy is enforced, students will find a way to continue their habits.</p><p>Smoke-related littering has also significantly increased. Prior to the enactment of the smoke-free policy, ashtrays were located above garbage cans all around campus. At that time, students were more likely to put out their cigarette butts in the ashtrays as opposed to on the ground. However, due to the removal of the ashtrays on campus with the 2021 policy change, certain areas have become littered with cigarettes. Putting cigarettes out in this manner also increases the risk of a forest fire. According to the American Nonsmokers Rights Foundation website, \"One of the biggest causes of fires, be it structural or a wildfire, are discarded cigarette butts.\" Additionally, the National Park Service website states that 85% of wildland fires in the U.S. are caused by humans. Throwing butts onto the ground also pollutes the environment by seeping into waterways and contaminating drinking water, and poses a threat to animals which may attempt to eat them.</p><p>Photo by Basil MK on Pexels.com</p><p>The policy is a terrific idea in theory, but its major downfall is that it is extremely difficult to enforce, which has in turn caused a slew of new problems for campus life and the local environment. As student smokers have moved inside to avoid punishment, other students are being involuntarily exposed to the harmful carcinogens in their residence halls, which will continue to affect them more drastically than outdoor smoking because of the lack of ventilation within the buildings. Not to mention, the smoking regulations are even more difficult to combat when students smoking outside refuse to comply or cite cultural reasons for their smoking. In order to create a campus which is safest for all students involved, campus policy needs to be greatly improved and Drew must implement a better means of application in order to truly be effective.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5099538</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63RJ-DN01-JBSN-32BP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"713\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Acorn: Drew University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>October 1, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SURGEON GENERAL</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Madison</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>NJ</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>Business &amp;

Please avoid these areas so as not to interfere with ongoing operations. For safety, roads, trails, and areas may need to close temporarily as firefighter operations are taking place. Although unlikely, smoky conditions may also reduce visibility to a level that would require additional temporary closures. During prescribed fire operations, there is potential for impacts to camping and hunting. Hunters are advised to plan ahead. For their safety they should not camp in or near an area of prescribed fire activity. Until we receive additional precipitation on the burns, forest visitors can expect to see smoke in the vicinity of the burn units.

While all fire restrictions will be lifted, forest visitors are reminded that the potential for wildfires still exists and to please use caution with campfires and other potential ignition sources.</p><p>Now that campfires are again allowed on the Prescott National Forest, fire managers remind the public that abandoned campfires are still the leading cause of human-caused wildfires. Forest visitors are urged to follow campfire safety procedures (<url normalizedValue=\"https://smokeybear.com/en/prevention-how-tos/campfire-safety\">https://smokeybear.com/en/prevention-how-tos/campfire-safety</url>). It is every camper's responsibility to properly maintain and extinguish a campfire to prevent wildfires.</p><p>Campfire guidelines:</p><p>* Never cut whole trees or branches, dead or alive. Live materials will not burn and dead standing trees, snags, are often homes for birds and other wildlife.</p><p>* Do not burn aerosol cans, pressurized containers, glass or aluminum cans. They could explode, shatter and/or create harmful fumes.</p><p>* Keep the fire to a manageable size.</p><p>* Never leave your campfire unattended.</p><p>Ensure campfire is fully extinguished:</p><p>* Allow wood to burn completely to ash, if possible.</p><p>* Pour water on the fire. Drown all embers, not just the red ones. Pour until hissing sound stops.</p><p>* If water is not available, stir dirt or sand into the embers with a shovel to bury the fire.</p><p>* Scrape any remaining sticks and logs with a shovel to remove any embers.</p><p>* Continue adding water, dirt, or sand and stir with a shovel until all material is cool.</p><p>* If it is too hot to touch, it is too hot to leave.</p><p>Violators of regulations that prohibit abandoning a campfire are subject to a fine and/or imprisonment. If an abandoned campfire causes a wildfire, violators can also be held responsible for fire suppression costs.

The jar had made the trip to Mora's last three doubleheaders, and it sat in the visitors dugout as reminder to the team of what it was playing for - a community that was under duress from a wildfire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For the past week, Mora's track and field, baseball and softball teams have been traveling nomads since the Calf Canyon and Hermits Peak Fire has endangered their community, canceling school and closing the campus to activity.</p><p>But the games, practices and camaraderie while being away from home have been cathartic for Mora athletes. Some of them already have seen the fire's danger up close and personal, while others have family members who are working the lines to try to hold back the blaze, which had consumed 65,824 acres as of Friday morning.</p><p>Students and families are spread throughout Northern New Mexico as some evacuated the area, while others steadfastly remained but stand ready to leave at the drop of a hat. The one thing they can rely upon for now is that small window of time when they can be with teammates, hone their skills and not worry about what might be happening back home.</p><p>\"I can honestly say we're using softball as an escape from the fire,\" said Rangerettes senior pitcher AmayaRose Romero. \"It's keeping us mentally OK. When we're out on the field or with the team, the fire is not a worry. When you come back, it's a whole different situation. It's, 'Oh, are we leaving? What's the plan for as of right now?' \"</p><p>Romero and the rest of her softball teammates had practice canceled Friday as west winds gusted to 30-35 mph around noon and continued to increase throughout the day, again threatening Mora and the surrounding communities, especially Carmen and Ledoux. Romero and her family remained at their home, which she said was in the \"go\" evacuation region. She said she had several family members who were on the front lines trying to slow down and hopefully turn the fire away from the region.</p><p>Fellow teammate and track athlete Marisol Martinez said her family moved to her grandmother's house, which was in the \"set\" region, meaning residents had to be ready to leave.</p><p>Mora senior pitcher Diego Aragon and his family, which includes Monica and Michaela, stayed in Chimayo with his grandmother. He was at shortstop for the opener of the District 5-1A/2A doubleheader finale at McCurdy, which the Bobcats won 21-5. All the while, the family home in Ledoux was threatened by the fire as it inched closer to the community.</p><p>Diego had the shortest distance to cover among his teammates and he said the drive to McCurdy was surreal.</p><p>\"I would rather be playing my last game at home, of course,\" Diego said. \"But it was different, not being with the team. The bus rides are always good times with the team.\"</p><p>Mora athletic director Manuel Romero was among those staying in town, saying his role as transporter of bulldozers to the front line caused him to stay. He and Mora Superintendent Marvin MacAuley discussed its options for spring teams last weekend and decided to let them continue playing even though the campus was closed. Romero added, the school received permission from the New Mexico Activities Association to not play its district schedule if games were missed because of the fire and still be eligible for the postseason, which is a requirement for member schools.</p><p>Mora's final home games for softball and baseball were moved to McCurdy, and athletes - or their parents - had to drive to events and practices. Manuel Benavidez, Mora's head softball coach, said his team had only a handful of participants for the first two days of practice at New Mexico Highlands University before getting about 12 players for Thursday's session. Benavidez said Cowgirls head coach Kevin Jannusch offered the Rangerettes use of the field while they waited out the fire.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum was Mora head baseball coach Jerry Martinez, who said his team hadn't practiced this week. However, the Rangers had three consecutive days of district doubleheaders at Questa, Pe\u00f1asco and McCurdy.</p><p>The softball team played Wednesday at Espa\u00f1ola's Industrial Park and swept two games against the Lady Bobcats to secure the district title and a spot in the Class 1A/2A State Tournament.</p><p>Martinez said it was a bittersweet reprieve from the anxiety she and her family felt as the fire threatened their home last weekend - and might face a similar fate this weekend. She said the fire came within 30 feet of their home but her dad cut down trees near the house to provide a fire break and stayed throughout the initial threat.</p><p>\"You did not know what was going on; you didn't know what was happening,\" Martinez said. \"You couldn't hold your tears in. It was a horrible feeling. I don't wish anybody to have to experience that.\"</p><p>When the fire crept toward Mora on April 22, the school canceled the track and field team's travel to the Santa Rosa Invite that day, but the team did show up for the Northern Rio Grande Invitational at Escalante the following day.</p><p>\"I think it has gone a little bit smoothly,\" Manuel Romero said.</p><p>Amid the chaos and uncertainty the Mora community endured, there were moments of kindness and hospitality from their opponents. The baseball team was treated to meals from Questa, Pe\u00f1asco and McCurdy, and Bobcats head baseball coach Roberto DeVargas gave Mora the field in between games to honor its lone senior in Aragon and his mother, Monica, for its Senior Day activities.</p><p>For all of the good will and short reprieves from the forest fire, the harsh reality remained. Benavidez said the beautiful landscape outside of his Ledoux home is likely gone - and maybe his home, too. He left his home around midday Friday as the fire crept to within a quarter mile.</p><p>\"It's pretty rough,\" Benavidez said. \"Our views, the mountains, will never be the same again.</p><p>\"Never.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWMEX-15665441</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWMEX2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65BP-7K71-JBSG-14YT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147872</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-04-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"999\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Santa Fe New Mexican All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Santa Fe New Mexican</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"04\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>April 30, 2022 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"76\"><className>Business &amp; Corporate Compliance</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"76\"><className>Gaming &amp; Lotteries</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzJGRTBFOEMyOENBNDQ5MTg1NTA2NDdFQjhCNzhERjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0JFMDdFQkREMkFENDRFMEFGRkJEQ0E4OTg1NEM5RTc</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Education Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Coaches</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzcwQkQ0Q0E1NEJCNEY1M0JFRTBFQzY0NjBENEYxNjg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzBBQzFGOUQ2NzlGNDMzMUEwQ0IxNTdDOTNFQ0Y2QjU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"76\"><className>Gaming &amp; Lotteries</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzJGRTBFOEMyOENBNDQ5MTg1NTA2NDdFQjhCNzhERjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0JFMDdFQkREMkFENDRFMEFGRkJEQ0E4OTg1NEM5RTc</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000170</classCode><className>BASEBALL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RM9</classCode><className>SOFTBALL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000126</classCode><className>ATHLETES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001529</classCode><className>TRACK &amp; FIELD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS147</classCode><className>NEW MEXICO, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

This is primarily done, he said, through burning under a range of duff moistures that can result in some consumption of duff but not enough to cause significant damage.</p><p>\"Repeated burns under these conditions can slowly restore bare ground by consuming some duff each time. That measured approach is important for pine regeneration as well as herbaceous plants that have been absent as a result of fire exclusion,\" said Kreye.</p><p>This duff-danger is a major issue in the South in longleaf pine ecosystems that are very well adapted to frequent fire, Kreye noted. Longleaf pine forests naturally have one of the most frequent-fire regimes of any forest ecosystems, burning every three to five years on average. But the phenomenon is not limited to the southeastern U.S., Kreye contends.</p><p>\"This is an issue in many Western pine forests as well, particularly ponderosa pine forests that range across much of the western U.S.,\" he said. \"This is also a likely problem in pine forests of the east that have depended on regular burning, such as red pine, pitch pine and shortleaf pine.\"</p><p>Prescribed fire is commonly used in southeastern U.S. forests and is being applied more widely in fire-prone ecosystems elsewhere. Research on direct effects of burning has focused on aboveground impacts to plants with less attention to belowground effects, Kreye said. This study, recently published in Forest Science, is among the first to look at belowground effects of forest fire.</p><p>Researchers used probes attached to thermometers to measure soil heat at sampling locations after controlled fires near the bases of mature trees in a longleaf pine flatwoods ecosystem and a longleaf pine sandhill ecosystem, both in northern Florida. They found that soil heating was minimal in frequently burned sites. Where fire had been excluded for several decades, however, they detected substantial soil heating sustained for considerable durations.</p><p>Long-duration heating was most prominent where accumulated forest floor duff was deepest, particularly at the base of mature pines in long-unburned sites. Temperatures potentially lethal to plant tissues at or above 140 degrees Fahrenheit were sustained for several hours as deep as 4 inches near pines in flatwoods sites. Sustained temperatures at or above 500 F when impacts to soil nutrients can occur were observed for up to 35 minutes at soil surfaces.</p><p>Also involved in the research were J. Morgan Varner, U.S. Forest Service, Tall Timbers Research Station, Tallahassee, Florida; and Leda Kobziar, University of Idaho.</p><p>The research was supported by the Joint Fire Science Program, an initiative jointly funded by the Department of the Interior and the U.S. Forest Service.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123539494</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YD2-1901-DYTH-G4S9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"708\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 21, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In addition, Biden said many students from low-income backgrounds will receive an additional $10,000 in relief. </p><p><br/>The unprecedented maneuver by Biden should reach over 43 million borrowers and even wipe out loan repayments for some. But it likely won't fix some of the larger issues surrounding student debt \u2014 namely the cost of college and the large amounts borrowed by some to foot the cost of college. Nationally, student debt has ballooned to over $1.7 trillion. <br/>U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said in a news release Wednesday that student loan debt has hindered many Americans' ability to achieve their dreams[1] \u2014 including buying a home, starting a business, or providing for a family.The department also announced other changes to make repaying loans easier. <br/>'Getting an education should set us free; not strap us down,' Cardona said. 'We're delivering targeted relief that will help ensure borrowers are not placed in a worse position financially because of the pandemic, and restore trust in a system that should be creating opportunity, not a debt trap.' <br/>Biden ran on canceling at least $10,000 in student loan debt and faced pressure from advocates to cancel much more. He repeatedly delayed a decision amid intense debates about whether debt cancellation would advance economic justice or disproportionately benefit higher-earning Americans during a time when the working class is struggling. <br/>The plan provides more help to the students who started with the least. About 27 million Pell Grant recipients should be eligible to receive up to $20,000 in loan forgiveness. Pell Grants cover a portion of college costs for students from low-income families, with the large majority of eligible students coming from households that earn less than $60,000 a year. <br/>Kyle Southern, The Institute for College Access and Success associate vice president of higher education quality, said there's two sides to the announcement. It's life changing, especially for borrowers from low-income backgrounds. But a larger conversation about student debt needs to happen, especially when it comes to which students leave college with debt.  <br/>Thecap on how much debt will be forgiven means white borrowers will have a larger share of their debt relieved than Black and Latino borrowers from low-income backgrounds, who on average owe more than white students do upon leaving college. <br/>The announcement should fuel further conversations about how to invest in the Pell Grant program and support for institutions that serve a high number of students of color. <br/>'We're very conscious that we haven't yet broken the cycle that feeds those kinds of debt-based approaches to higher education,' Southern said. <br/>In a recent CNN opinion article, Derrick Johnson[2], NAACP national president and CEO, said '$10,000 in relief is like pouring a bucket of water on a forest fire' for Black Americans who owe almost double the student debt that white Americans do \u2014 almost $53,000 on average for Black college goers. <br/>Shanique Broom, 31, who lives in Denver, sees the Biden plan as a drop in the bucket. She owes more than $300,000 after attending Central Michigan University for her bachelor's and master's degrees and the University of Denver for her doctorate. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> Shanique Broom <br/>Jason Gonzales / Chalkbeat <br/><br/> She's happy for the relief, but wishes students from low-income backgrounds were eligible for more debt relief. <br/>'I was wanting something more equitable,' said Broom, who works in education policy. 'But realistically, with how this government, this administration, just like our country has operated, I didn't even expect this.' <br/>She said students whose families have fewer resources have to borrow more just to cover living expenses while they're in college. <br/>'It's like you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't,' Broom said. 'I spent my whole life trying to live this American Dream of obtaining my degree, but put myself into debt. My future is clouded.' <br/>Biden and his administration also received praise for the debt cancellation plan. Felipe Vieyra, who graduated from the University of Denver in 2012 with over $60,000 in student loan debt, said he already texted friends about his excitement. The 32-year-old said the $10,000 the government will forgive should bring down his student loan debt to $20,000. He has spent years chipping away at the debt on his own. <br/>At one point he lived out of a storage room for $200 a month because he couldn't afford other rent. He said the $20,000 he will still owe feels more surmountable. <br/>'This gives me more control,' he said. <br/>He added that he's not sure whether the announcement helps students of color see college as more attractive. The percentage of students enrolling straight from high school into college has been dropping. Many of those choosing jobs instead cite aversion to debt and higher pay for entry-level jobs. <br/>A recent report from The Institute for College Access and Success[3] showed half of all Colorado students graduating college in 2020 held debt, on average $26,424. In 19 other states, average debt for college graduates was more than $30,000, while in six states it averaged more than $35,000. <br/>'It's still expensive to go to college,' Vieyra said. 'And that needs to be addressed one way or another.' <br/>Colorado Department of Higher Education Commissioner Angie Paccione said debt relief is especially helpful for students who went to college but didn't complete a degree. Paccione said in Colorado there are 700,000 people who attended a higher education institution but didn't graduate, 'which means they have probably at least half the debt that they accrued, but they don't have a credential that helps to maximize their earning potential.' <br/>She said she expects unintended and yet-unknown consequences and political backlash, especially from those who already paid off their loans. But this generation, she said, 'is suffering disproportionately more than what it cost me to pay.' <br/>'What I'm fearful of is that there will be people who see it as a handout instead of a helping hand up,' she said. <br/>The administration expects to release more details on the student loan forgiveness plan, specifically on how to apply for loan forgiveness.  <br/>Southern said he hopes the administration will clearly communicate how students can take advantage of the debt forgiveness and that federal officials 'automate as much as possible.' <br/>We have to be really vigilant in making sure that this program is widely known and easy for people to access the benefits that they're entitled to,' he said. <br/>The Biden administration announcement also included several other actions related to student loan repayments. <br/>It will extend the pause on repayment, interest and collections until Dec. 31 for borrowers who will still owe payments beyond the cancellations.The pause extends the delay put in place at the start of the pandemic. <br/>The department also is proposing to reduce monthly payments for low- and middle-income borrowers. <br/>The proposal would cut in half \u2014 from 10% to 5% of discretionary income \u2014 the amount that borrowers have to pay each month on their undergraduate loans. The rule would also forgive loan balances after 10 years of payments \u2014 instead of 20 years \u2014 for borrowers with original loan balances of $12,000 or less. And it would cut interest as long as borrowers make payments on time. <br/>Borrowers like Broom with high student loan debt will likely get the most relief not from the $20,000, but from the income repayment changes. Nonetheless, she expects her payments will still be thousands of dollars a month, akin to paying a second mortgage, she said. <br/>The administration also plans changes that will make it easier for borrowers working in nonprofit jobs or the military to use the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. And the administration said it's taking steps to hold private schools accountable for high debt and will publish an annual watch list of programs that contribute to high student debt. <br/>The list will name programs with the highest debt levels in the country.

It was the worst of the 71 forest fires that broke out in various parts of Greece since late Tuesday.</p><p>The nearby towns of Anavyssos and Palia Fokea were ordered evacuated as a precaution as flames headed in their direction, together with some smaller settlements in the area. Authorities provided detailed escape routes by road and many evacuees were temporarily housed in local hotels.</p><p>Fire service and local authorities said it was unclear how many buildings had been damaged in the Keratea blaze, although there had been several reports of limited damage. Thick smoke in the area reduced visibility, but there were few immediate reports of severe damage.</p><p>The fire service said about 180 firefighters took part in the effort to contain the wildfire that raged through forest, olive groves, scrub and vineyards, assisted by eight water-dropping helicopters and five planes, as well as local volunteers.</p><p>All the firefighters were to remain in the area overnight to deal with potential flare-ups.</p><p>Early Thursday, a new forest fire broke out near the village of Aghios Konstandinos, a few kilometers farther south of Keratea. About 60 firefighters were sent to the spot. Officials said the blaze was not immediately threatening inhabited areas.</p><p>Other wildfires broke out Wednesday on the islands of Andros and Thassos, and in two locations in the southern Peloponnese region where authorities ordered the evacuation of a village. Firefighters contained a blaze at the seaside resort of Nea Makri east of Athens and on the island of Crete.</p><p>Wildfires are common during Greece's hot, arid summers. In 2018, a major blaze that swept through the seaside Mati resort, near Nea Makri, caused 102 deaths.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-912e425eccae7440866dea7d36695e0f20200909</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T2-2SY1-DYMD-614H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"360\"/><timeReceived>10:09 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 9, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.</p><p>The burn ban, which was put in place May 24, was lifted by the N.C. Forest Service at 5 p.m. because of rainfall in the area, according to the NCDACS. Residents in those counties had been told not to burn debris because of dry conditions that were considered \"hazardous forest fire conditions.\"</p><p>\"Recent rainfall across central and eastern North Carolina has decreased fire danger,\" Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler said.</p><p>\"With more rain expected across the area through the weekend, we should see even more improvement. Still, residents should burn responsibly. Check for restrictions before burning, and make sure you have a valid permit. Check the weather, and never leave a debris fire unattended,\" Troxler added.</p><p>Rain showers are \"likely\" and a thunderstorm is \"possible\" for the Lumberton area on Friday, according to the National Weather Service. The chance of precipitation is 70%.</p><p>\"A large area of high pressure will import copious moisture into the Carolinas over the next several days bringing some much-needed rainfall. Rain chances linger but lessen over the weekend as temperatures rise slightly; this pattern lasting into early next week,\" according to a NWS area forecast discussion.</p><p>Thunderstorms and rain showers are forecast for Monday and Tuesday, with Wednesday's forecast calling for a chance of rain.</p><p>Other counties for which the burn ban was lifted are Anson, Beaufort, Bladen, Brunswick, Carteret, Columbus, Craven, Cumberland, Duplin, Greene, Harnett, Hoke, Jones, Lee, Lenoir, Moore, New Hanover, Onslow, Pamlico, Pender, Pitt, Richmond, Sampson, Scotland and Wayne.</p><p>Robeson County Ranger Robby Freeman thanked county residents who did their part to reduce the risks of fire.</p><p>\"A thank you to the citizens that did adhere to the burn ban,\" he said.</p><p>N.C. Forest Service rangers and personnel responded to 30 fires in Robeson County between May 24 and Wednesday, Freeman said. Some were considered wildfires, while others were burn ban violations.</p><p>\"Thanks to the fire departments, law enforcement, and the fire marshal's office for their assistance during this time, but especially to the dispatchers. They are usually forgotten about, and they probably have the most stressful and taxing job of all,\" Freeman said.</p><p>As of 5 p.m. Wednesday, burn permits were available in all counties, according to NCDACS. Burn permits can be obtained from any authorized permitting agent or online at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ncforestservice.gov/burnpermit\">www.ncforestservice.gov/burnpermit</url>. All burn permits previously granted in the 26 counties affected by the burn ban were canceled when the ban became effective.</p><p>Thus, a valid permit must be obtained. Residents with questions regarding their specific county can contact their N.C. Forest Service county ranger or their county fire marshal's office. To find contact information for a NCFS county ranger, visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ncforestservice.gov/contacts\">www.ncforestservice.gov/contacts</url>.</p><p>\"As far as the rain, the Lord sends us what we need when we need it. We have no control over weather,\" Freeman said.</p><p>\"All we can do is work with it, rain or shine,\" he added.</p><p>___ (c)2021 The Robesonian (Lumberton, N.C.)

Importantly, it has increased biodiversity and ecosystem heterogeneity across all of Earth's major terrestrial biomes.</p><p>\"Declines in biodiversity were associated with high-severity fire activity, which began with the disruption of Indigenous-controlled fire use at the onset of colonization,\" said research co-lead Kira Hoffman, a recent postdoctoral fellow in the Faculty of Environment at the University of Waterloo, now a jointly appointed postdoctoral fellow at the University of British Columbia's Faculty of Forestry and The Bulkley Valley Research Centre.</p><p>\"Agency and public support for Indigenous-led fire stewardship, specifically cultural burning can revive important cultural practices while helping protect ecosystems and human communities from increasingly destructive wildfires.\"</p><p>The study points out that over a century of fire suppression, combined with warmer and drier conditions associated with climate change, has led to increasingly severe wildfire events, which is threatening biodiversity on a global scale.</p><p>The team made up of undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the Trant Ecological Legacies Lab in the School of Environment, Resources and Sustainability (SERS) conducted a review of primary ecological literature published from 1900 to the present, noting 79 per cent of applicable studies reported increases in biodiversity as a result of Indigenous fire stewardship.</p><p>\"Identifying and implementing human-fire interactions supporting a variety of valuable social and ecological outcomes is becoming increasingly urgent, given what we're seeing in Western Canada, Manitoba, and Ontario, our forest fire situation that can only go from bad to worse without changes to existing strategies,\" said Andrew Trant, Associate Professor in SERS and co-author of the recent publication.</p><p>Although evidence for widespread and contemporary Indigenous fire stewardship exists, the millennia-old practice is still debated in many parts of the world. Hoffman said misunderstandings of what cultural burning is, have been driven in part by colonialism, fear of fires becoming out of control, and real versus perceived public perceptions of wildfire risk, which can be in direct opposition to scientific evidence and Indigenous Ecological Knowledge that fire is a necessary and healthy component of functioning ecosystems.</p><p>\"Importantly, Indigenous-led fire stewardship continues to demonstrate the value of routinely applying controlled fire to adapt to changing environments while promoting desired landscapes, habitats, and species while also supporting subsistence practices, communities and livelihoods,\" Hoffman said.</p><p>Indigenous peoples comprise only 5 per cent of the world's population but protect approximately 85 per cent of the world's biodiversity through stewardship of Indigenous-managed lands. This is partly due to long-term and widespread relationships with and dependence on fire, which has been applied as a tool for managing landscapes for millennia.</p><p>The findings of the open-access study co-authored by Hoffman, Trant, Emma Davis, and Sara Wickham were published today in the journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p><p>* * *</p><p>JOURNAL: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences <url normalizedValue=\"https://uwaterloo.ca/environment/sites/ca.environment/files/uploads/files/pnas-indigenous-fire.pdf\">https://uwaterloo.ca/environment/sites/ca.environment/files/uploads/files/pnas-indigenous-fire.pdf</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7561262 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7561262</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6396-86J1-DYG2-R3R4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"700\"/><timeReceived>8:40 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 4, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It was the worst of the 71 forest fires that broke out in various parts of Greece since late Tuesday.</p><p>The nearby towns of Anavyssos and Palia Fokea were ordered evacuated as a precaution as flames headed in their direction, together with some smaller settlements in the area. Authorities provided detailed escape routes by road and many evacuees were temporarily housed in local hotels.</p><p>Fire service and local authorities said it was unclear how many buildings had been damaged in the Keratea blaze, although there had been several reports of limited damage. Thick smoke in the area reduced visibility, but there were few immediate reports of severe damage.</p><p>The fire service said about 180 firefighters took part in the effort to contain the wildfire that raged through forest, olive groves, scrub and vineyards, assisted by eight water-dropping helicopters and five planes, as well as local volunteers.</p><p>All the firefighters were to remain in the area overnight to deal with potential flare-ups.</p><p>Early Thursday, a new forest fire broke out near the village of Aghios Konstandinos, a few kilometers farther south of Keratea. About 60 firefighters were sent to the spot. Officials said the blaze was not immediately threatening inhabited areas.</p><p>Other wildfires broke out Wednesday on the islands of Andros and Thassos, and in two locations in the southern Peloponnese region where authorities ordered the evacuation of a village. Firefighters contained a blaze at the seaside resort of Nea Makri east of Athens and on the island of Crete.</p><p>Wildfires are common during Greece's hot, arid summers. In 2018, a major blaze that swept through the seaside Mati resort, near Nea Makri, caused 102 deaths.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-912e425eccae7440866dea7d36695e0f20200909</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T2-2SW1-DYMD-613D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"359\"/><timeReceived>10:09 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 9, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Trump had urged the former football star to challenge Democratic U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock.</p><p>In one of his first public appearances since entering the race, Walker on Saturday talked about his relationship with Trump, but also urged his listeners to \"come together as a people\" and not be upset with others \"because they disagree with you.\"</p><p>Also speaking was U.S. Rep Jody Hice, Trump's choice against Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. While Raffensperger refused the former president's entreaties to \"find\" enough votes to overturn Trump's narrow loss to Democratic President Joe Biden in Georgia, Hice objected to Georgia's electors in Congress.</p><p>Completing the trio was state Sen. Burt Jones, an early Trump supporter who pushed measures to overturn Joe Biden's Georgia win and is running for lieutenant governor.</p><p>Teams check damage from California fire</p><p>REDDING, Calif. - Damage assessment teams went out Saturday to determine how many buildings have burned in a forest fire that has displaced thousands of residents in Northern California.</p><p>Firefighters working in steep, drought-stricken terrain hope calmer weather over the next few days will help as they battle the Fawn Fire north of the city of Redding.</p><p>Initial assessments found that at least 100 homes and other buildings had burned.</p><p>School bus driver dies after stabbing</p><p>PASCO, Wash. - A school bus driver was stabbed after he had picked up students from a Washington state elementary school and died of his injuries at a hospital, police said.</p><p>Students from Longfellow Elementary in the city of Pasco were already on the bus Friday when a man got on and attacked the driver, police Capt. Bill Parramore said. After the assault, the driver lost control of the bus, driving over the curb and crashing into some hedges near the school.</p><p>The children on the bus and at the school grounds were taken into the school building, Parramore said, and the suspect was still at the scene when officers arrived.</p><p>He was taken into custody without incident, police said. The driver was taken to a hospital, where he died.</p><p>Probe: No seat belts in theme park death</p><p>DENVER, Colo. - A 6-year-old Colorado girl who died in a fall from a theme park ride this month wasn't wearing the seat belts, and operators of the vertical drop ride didn't properly check the restraints before allowing it to begin, according to a report from state investigators.</p><p>Wongel Estifanos fell 100 feet to her death from the Haunted Mine Drop ride at Glenwood Caverns Adventure Park on Sept. 5, according to the report released Friday from the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment.</p><p>Investigators found the child was sitting on the two seat belts instead of wearing them across her lap, and two newly hired operators never noticed despite doing checks. Investigators also found that an alarm system warned of a problem, but one of the workers reset the system and started the ride because that person was not trained well enough to know what to do about it.</p><p>Judge stalls mandate by New York City schools</p><p>New York City schools have been temporarily blocked from enforcing a vaccine mandate for its teachers and other workers by a federal appeals judge just days before it was to take effect.</p><p>Workers in the nation's largest school system were to be required to show vaccination proof starting Monday. But late Friday, a judge for the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted a temporary injunction sought by a group of teachers pending review by a three-judge panel, which will take up the motion Wednesday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELHLD-4749214</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELHLD2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63PW-0911-DYWP-803H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">156396</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"663\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Woodward Communications, Inc.

A Forest Service employee, Larry Bilyeu, restored the cabin in the early 1990s.</p><p>The Forest Service makes the cabin available for rent through a contract administered by Anthony Lakes Mountain Resort.</p><p>\"While the fire at Peavy Cabin was an unfortunate incident, it was also a shining example of cooperation and shared stewardship,\" said Kendall Cikanek, Whitman District Ranger. \"Everyone is safe, and the cabin is still standing, and that is thanks to a coordinated response from the hunters staying at the cabin, the North Powder Rural Fire Protection District, and Anthony Lakes Mountain Resort.\"</p><p>The fire started when heat escaped from the fireplace chimney, setting fire to a wall and the cabin's ceiling, according to Cikanek.</p><p>Flames burned a section of logs on the outside of the cabin in one area.</p><p>The hunters spent much of the night pouring water on the fire, Cikanek said.</p><p>North Powder Rural Fire Protection District and Wallowa-Whitman National Forest fire staff arrived early Wednesday and confirmed that there was no heat left, he said.</p><p>Jay Moore, recreation specialist for the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest, said: \"Clearly, the cabin will need to be repaired, although we are relieved to see that it remains sealed from the winter weather. We will also explore alternatives to firewood heat to reduce the risk of a future fire.\"</p><p>Peavy Cabin was slated to close for the season on Oct. 31 regardless.</p><p>The Whitman District's goal is to have it ready for rental by May 1, 2021.</p><p>___ (c)2020 the Baker City Herald (Baker City, Ore.)

Their dedication is routinely recognized by customers, legislators, and others, yet we all cheer louder when one of our own is selected for meaningful awards.</p><p>Georgia Forestry Commission Wildland Urban Interface Specialist Anthony English recently received the prestigious Robert E. Browning Award for 2019 in Georgia, recognizing his outstanding work to prevent wildfire.</p><p>\"This recognition from the U.S. Forest Service is an outstanding achievement for Anthony and for our agency,\" said Georgia Forestry Commission Director Tim Lowrimore. \"Anthony is known for his collaborative work with all of our partners and cooperators to get the message out about the importance of wildfire prevention. North Georgians and the landscape itself have benefitted from the outreach he's done to lessen the possibility of dangerous wildfires.\"</p><p>The Robert E. Browning Award was established by the U.S. Forest Service in 1990 to acknowledge employees, groups or projects that are extremely valuable to the fire prevention effort. In 1994, the award's name was changed to memorialize the loss of Robert Browning, who died fighting a wildfire in Colorado. Each State Fire Chief or the Forest Fire Management Officer is allowed to nominate one individual or group each year.</p><p>English was nominated for the award by Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest Service Fire Management Officer Mike Davis. In his nomination documents, Davis described English as a \"dedicated public servant,\" and lauded him for a plethora of activities that promoted wildfire prevention. They included media appearances, extensive promotion of the Firewise USA program, many stints portraying Smokey Bear, and an assignment to the North Georgia Wildfire Prevention &amp; Education Team during a flash drought period that was beginning to rival historic 2016 fall fire season conditions. Records indicate English's program outreach over the past five years impacted close to 29,000 people at events large and small across north Georgia, yet Davis believes the impressions total several hundred thousand because of his collaborative efforts.</p><p>\"I'm flattered and honored to receive this award,\" said English. \"People remember the 2016 fires in North Georgia and those in California. It's encouraging that what we do has real meaning for them and can make a difference.\"</p><p>English received a special plaque commemorating the honor during a surprise Zoom call with his GFC and USFS colleagues. He has been with the GFC for five years.

Davidson and Jefferies are preparing to price $160 million in unrated federally and state taxable industrial development revenue bonds to aid further expansion. The date hasn't been set on the bonds, but the bankers expect to bring the deal in mid to late June, said Kyle Thomas, a D.A. Davidson managing director. JMG Attorneys is bond counsel. \"Unfortunately, there has been a lot of demand for forest fire suppression assets in the U.S.,\" said McAndrew Rudisill, Bridger's chief investment officer and a director.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The deal being sold through conduit Gallatin County, Montana, will refund $7.6 million of revenue bonds; pay $133 million to add four CL-415EAF Super Scooper planes at a cost of $28 million each to its fleet, of which two have already been delivered; and construct two hangers on the Belgrade campus near Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport to bring the total to four. The proceeds will also fund a $19.7 million debt service fund.</p><p>Drought, increasing temperatures, overgrown forests and increased development near forests have resulted in more frequent and severe wildfires across much of the West.</p><p>Nearly a quarter of the U.S., mostly in the West, is at moderate to very high risk of severe wildfires, according to the U.S. Forest Service. This comes on top of several years of fires that have burned millions of acres inOregonandCalifornia.</p><p>Fire activityincreasedin May, mostly across the Southwest, with activity also across portions of California, inland Western states and southern Colorado, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Wildfires have burned 112% more acreage by June 1 than the 10-year average, with nearly 88% of the total acres burned in the south to southwest, according to NIFC.</p><p>The situation had become so bad in California that S&amp;P Global Ratings analysts said in a report last year the state no longer has a \"fire season, because it's become a year-round phenomenon.\"</p><p>\"Fires have become more of a year-round event,\" Rudisill said. \"Peak season is June through November in the western U.S.\"</p><p>It's not just climate change driving the compounding fire problem, but that the number of people who live in what is called the urban-wildland interface has increased, he said.</p><p>\"It's a confluence of events, plus the temperatures are higher on average,\" Rudisill said. \"That is why it's important to put them out quickly.\"</p><p>In addition to the increase in the number of fires during the time Bridger has been in business, the fleet of suppression aircraft in the U.S. is very old, and much of it is being taken out of service, Rudisill said.</p><p>\"There has been a lot of demand, and that demand has continued to grow, and the supply of fire suppression aircraft has gone down,\" Rudisill said</p><p>The company has more than 30 contracts with state and federal government agencies, but the primary contract is with the U.S. Forest Service, Rudisill said. One in five of its employees are U.S. veterans.</p><p>Kestrel Verifiers provided an independent opinion that the bonds qualify as sustainable. Kestrel said it determined that the bonds conform with the four core components of the International Capital Market Association.</p><p>The planes it uses are more environmentally-friendly, because they scoop up lake water, so they don't use environmentally-harmful chemicals to suppress fires, according to the online investor presentation for the bonds.</p><p>\"Kestrel rated our company sustainable and a protector of national resources,\" Rudisill said. \"We got the second-party opinion prior to raising the equity, because a lot of environmentally focused funds require a sustainability rating.\"</p><p>The company received a lot of interest from ESG funds when it did a $300 million private equity raise in April, he said.</p><p>\"What we are doing directly reduces CO2 emissions by putting out fires,\" he said. \"Fires are the No. 1 or No. 2 emitter of CO2 emissions behind cars and factories.\"</p><p>The CL-415 EAF airplanes the bonds will finance are the only aircraft purpose-built for aerial firefighting, according to the investor presentation. Most firefighting aircraft are conversions.</p><p>The planes have a higher water drop capacity and faster airspeed than helicopters and can drop 50,000 gallons of water on fires before refueling, compared to the 20,000 gallons of fire retardant a 747 super tanker can drop before refueling, according to bond documents.</p><p>\"Scoopers can do 15 drops an hour,\" Rudisill said. \"They can land on a lake. They don't have to go to base and refuel. They are pretty efficient planes.\"</p><p>Its fleet is growing in 2022 from four to six Super Scoopers; nine other planes including five twin commanders and four Daher Kodiak aircraft for reconnaissance and command; and two drones for aerial intelligence, imagery gathering and real-time active wildfire mapping. By 2026, it plans to grow the entire fleet to 12 Super Scoopers, 33 reconnaissance and command planes and seven drones.</p><p>The $300 million in private equity will help it expand into the rest of the U.S. and internationally, Rudisill said.</p><p>The bonds will be sold as term bonds maturing in September 2042 with level annual debt service. They include an optional redemption on Sept. 1, 2029, at 103% declining annually to par.</p><p>Purchasers are restricted to qualified institutional buyers in denominations of $100,000 or greater.</p><p>State statute requirements limit non-rated bonds to qualified institutional buyers, but it came down to a discussion between the issuer, bond counsel and the banking team as to who the appropriate investors would be, Thomas said.</p><p>He doesn't think limiting it to qualified institutional investors will shrink the pool of buyers because institutional buyers are usually the only buyers of this type of deal, he said.</p><p>The finance team had planned a two-week marketing period for the bonds, because \"it's a great company with a unique asset in the Super Scoopers.\" A challenge will be that the unrated bonds fall in the high-yield category, which has seen less demand and a lot of outflows in current market conditions.</p><p>It's apt to directly benefit Bridger as a taxable issuer, but one good sign for the category as a whole is that Nuveen recentlyopted to reversea soft close of two high-yield municipal bond funds to investors.</p><p>When Nuveenclosed the fundsto new investors, the market climate was plagued by high bond prices, supply scarcity and a swell of money flooding into high-yield funds chasing few offerings, the fund manager told The Bond Buyer in late May.</p><p>Improving market conditions and strong state and local revenue collections were a chief influence in the decision, according to a Nuveen spokesperson.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BONDBY-0000018140c5db5eafb742c54c980000F661</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BONDBY,bondbuyer_new2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65N7-D9K1-F06X-W3TK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303185</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-06-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1163\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Bond Buyer</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40530\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><volume>Vol. 394</volume><issueNumber>No. F661</issueNumber><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bondbuyer.com/news/montana-firm-taps-bond-market-for-aerial-firefighting-fleet-expansion\">https://www.bondbuyer.com/news/montana-firm-taps-bond-market-for-aerial-firefighting-fleet-expansion</url><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"06\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>June 10, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000197</classCode><className>BOND MARKETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000198</classCode><className>BONDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DN5Y</classCode><className>FINANCIAL MARKET UPDATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

The bill's final size will depend on two factors: How much in new taxes the centrists in both chambers can stomach, and how much creative math lawmakers are willing to use to justify the budget reconciliation bill's price tag.The maneuver under discussion has the potential to break a series of logjams involving progressives and centrists in the House and Senate. What they're saying: \"I'm a proponent for ensuring that the climate provisions within the reconciliation bill aren't subject to being paid for,\" said Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.). She was among the centrist lawmakers who met with Biden on Wednesday afternoon.Murphy told Axios she \"led\" her White House remarks by suggesting that climate provisions should be exempt from 'the president's desire to ensure that the entire bill is paid for.' Democrats are arguing that the financial cost of inaction on climate will be so high \u2014 from paying for flood to forest fire recoveries \u2014 that they don't need to raise taxes to cover their green proposals. The big picture: The Democrats' approach to climate spending is a version of the Republicans' argument that tax cuts pay for themselves, once economists factor in so-called dynamic scoring. The theory is that any lost revenue from tax cuts is less than the higher overall tax receipts generated from a booming economy.The challenge is dynamic scoring rarely produces the amount of revenue advocates predict.Democrats long opposed the practice[1] but embraced it to help justify the cost of the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package that received both Republican and Democratic support in the Senate. Go deeper: Democrats in both chambers are now willing to try the same concept with climate change. 'It's not like you apply dynamic scoring to everything,' Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) told Axios. 'But there are climate investments we could make that would not only bring down costs to society but would also bring down costs within the federal budget.'With green projects, it's difficult to calculate precisely how much hypothetical money might be saved, but some estimate[2]s put the health costs of climate change at $800 billion a year. The other side: Republicans scoff at the notion climate spending will pay for itself. \"They really don't want to offset anything,\" said Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.). By the numbers: In the House Way and Means Committee's version of the $3.5 trillion bill, there are some $273 billion in tax credits to achieve Biden's climate goals. There's also an additional $150 billion for a Clean Electricity Payment Program in the Energy and Commerce Committee's wider package of climate provisions.Finally, the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee voted for $715 billion[3] in new spending for everything from traditional roads to zero-emission vehicles and high-speed rail.If Democrats agree that none of that spending needs to be offset, that could lower the final tax requirement by hundreds of billions of dollars.

(OTC: DUTV), announces an update for current and potential investors on the current status of DUTV, Easy Energy Systems, Inc., and Easy Energy Finance, as well as to clarify some potential confusion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Easy Energy Financing, Inc. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Easy Energy Finance, Inc.\u00a0 initiated in the Spring of 2022 the \u00a0creation of a Reg D and Reg S exempt security to raise capital. \u00a0\u00a0The purpose of this capital is to be utilized to purchase modular equipment from Easy Energy Systems, Inc. , Easy Modular Manufacturing, Inc and the \u00a0other subsidiaries of DUTV. \u00a0This equipment will then be leased to end customers in the form of an operating lease\u00a0 via a revenue share agreement to end user customers\u00a0 with waste streams. \u00a0</p><p>\u00a0The end result is that the investors and the operators essentially \u201cshare\u201d in the profits of the various waste conversion processes. \u00a0\u00a0Hence our slogan \u201cConverting Waste into Wealth.\u201d \u00a0Easy Energy Finance, Inc. is a separate company, currently owned 100% by Mark Gaalswyk , that is \u00a0\u00a0NOT under the DUTV public company \u00a0umbrella nor part of the planned Easy Energy Systems, Inc. merger with DUTV. Its sole purpose is to raise capital to fund Modular Projects for end customers. The initial vehicle to do this was called the \u201cEasy Energy Climate Token\u2120\u201d with first go live happening\u00a0 this past early summer.</p><p>The Easy Energy Climate Token\u2120, though well received,\u00a0 with over 300 interested investors signing \u00a0up to invest \u00a0amounts varying from $5,000 to $50,000 each - the actual funded amounts did not reach the $100,000 minimum.</p><p>After studying this closely, it was realized when talking to potential \u00a0investors that they did not like the very intensive\u00a0 accredited investor background checks and supporting info required by the platform that we had selected. \u00a0While the platform was an extremely reputable \u201ctoken-focused platform,\u201d we began to realize that the platform we had selected was more of an \u201cinvestor club\u201d that HAD\u00a0 to be VERY \u00a0restrictive as investors were not just signing up for a one-time investment, but were actually joining a longtime \u201cinvestor club.\u201d</p><p>Thus, most of the new interested investors that were coming in and signing up via our offering, were \u201cstalled out\u201d and offended \u00a0by \u00a0the multi-day, \u00a0tedious process of becoming approved to be part of the \u201dinvestor club\u201d \u2013 versus just a one-time investor.</p><p>Meanwhile, even though we had structured our offering\u00a0 to be asset based and revenue sharing\u00a0 ( far DIFFERENT from other tokens and crypto) we became \u201cguilty\u201d \u00a0by association and sign ups slowed\u00a0as the crypto crash continued to occur in the marketplace.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Realizing this, we held up pushing \u201ctoo excessively\u201d for \u00a0the investor type show that had already filmed us and that was planning on airing or segment. \u00a0We did not want the possible thousands of investors to hit the same road block of the long and tedious\u00a0 frustrating sign up. \u00a0</p><p>To solve the above problem, we spent the last couple of months signing on with a different platform that was recommended to us by the show itself. \u00a0It is much quicker and easier for investors to sign up and invest. Furthermore, on that platform we can now be a NON-block chain focused offering.</p><p>Investors will sign up initially to a \u201ctraditional\u201d non crypto type investment, \u00a0but the plan is to provide them the \u201coption\u201d \u00a0(in the future) to tokenize it if they so choose. \u00a0Thus, we should now be attractive \u00a0to BOTH types of investors.</p><p>The new name of this offering is Easy Energy Climate Capital\u2120.\u00a0 We now have completed signing \u00a0on \u00a0with the new Platform and will be going live very soon with an updated PPM. Stay tuned for its release. The new offering will also lower minimum investment to $2,000.\u00a0</p><p>Sales and Easy FEN Update</p><p>On the sales side, while we have many different disruptive modules for our customers in need, the fertilizer and drought conditions worldwide have led us to FIRST \u00a0focus primarily on the Easy FEN\u2122 and its capability to create within local coops and rural villages\u00a0 the exciting Liquid Microbial Fertilizer Terreplenish\u00ae .\u00a0 To aid in this, in this past early Summer, we brought the company that owned this microbial technology (Feed Earth Now) in under our DUTV public company umbrella . That agreement has been fully executed and is \u00a0in escrow while we are making the required payments. The final payment is currently scheduled for the end of this year.</p><p>While we had initially anticipated using \u00a0the funds from the Easy Energy Climate Token\u2120 to fund our customers Easy FEN\u2122 modular systems,\u00a0 we were EXTREMELY \u00a0delighted when the federal government created a grant program with up to $500 million dollars to focus on funding exactly the type of Regenerative Agricultural Liquid Microbial Fertilizer Production system as the\u00a0 Easy FEN\u2122 \u00a0\u00a0The grant will furnish our customers up to 60% of the funds needed for such a system. The good news is the USA came up with the perfect grant.</p><p>The bad news is that we believe this created a delay in purchasing as first award recipients will not be announced until year end followed by additional recipients in the first quarter of 2023. This will delay when we expect to receiver first revenue from this product, but as 60% of the system\u2019s price\u00a0 could potentially be paid for by this grant -\u00a0 the longer term sales \u201ccould\u201d\u00a0 likely be much greater than if we had only relied on the Easy Energy Finance, Inc. funding. \u00a0\u00a0To capture this opportunity, we partnered with a world class grant writing firm to begin working with our various customers.</p><p>As a sales update, we currently have approximately 30 of these $1-to-1.4-million-dollar \u00a0Easy FEN\u2122 systems that are in various stages of the sales, financing, grant funded pipeline. \u00a0The interested customers are \u00a0in the USA, \u00a0Central America, South America, Africa, India, Canada, Europe and the Middle East. Along with proceeding through the sales steps, we are also signing up numerous Independent sales reps for various sales territories that are now actively seeking more customer prospects.</p><p>Sales and Auto Segmentation Update</p><p>We currently have (now two) \u00a0large $86 million dollar \u201cAuto Segmentation\u201d \u00a0projects that we are in the sales process with .\u00a0 We already announced the letter of intent project in Tennessee and we are stepping through that project. \u00a0This will include applying for numerous federal grants for the project. The project should qualify nicely for Fertilizer Production Grants, various recently announced forest fire mitigation-related grants and advanced bio-fuels grants. We plan to have the matching funds provided by the Easy Energy Climate Capital\u2120 investors.</p><p>In addition to the already announced Tennessee project, we have also been working the last few months on a second $86 million dollar project that is located in a foreign country. That country is having a severe problem with an open garbage disposal site attracting birds that then interfere with \u00a0incoming airplanes at a large \u00a0international airport.\u00a0 The country is also experiencing a severe fertilizer shortage crisis along with tremendous drought, and is at risk of having its foreign supplied electricity reduced.</p><p>We were approached for a solution and we believe\u00a0 our combined Auto Segmentation and Easy FEN\u2122 modular technologies was a \u201cbulls eye\u201d solution. As 25% of municipal waste is food (birds dig in trash for food) only 4 of our Easy FEN modules could immediately \u00a0help with the bird problem, allow the airport to reopen, \u00a0while also creating Terreplenish\u00ae to solve the pending food crisis in the country if the fertilizer shortage is not solved immediately.</p><p>The Terreplenish\u00ae \u00a0liquid microbial fertilizer product created locally by the Easy FEN\u2122 \u00a0would provide 1/3 of the fertilizer needs for 750,000 acres of crop land, while reducing water needs for crops by up to 20%! </p><p>The Auto Segmentation Modules \u00a0would also \u00a0convert all the remaining trash into bio fuels, low to negative\u00a0 carbon \u00a0bio electricity, bio char, and a bio coal additive that can be mixed 1/3 with 2/3 regular coal allowing coal fired power plants to meet the Paris accords.</p><p>\u00a0While doing so, it would \u00a0also be sequestering up to 50,000 tons per\u00a0 year of CO2. It is our believe that such a project would be a model project for landfills across the world. </p><p>While we have been told that there is a strong desire for the system by the leaders of the country, the project is now awaiting final funding to become a \u201cformal\u201d order. \u00a0The project is now seeking investment capital. We will let you know more on this project.</p><p>Funding</p><p>With the addition of Moe Vela as a board advisor, the doors are beginning to open up to potential world class investors. \u00a0As stated before, the plan is for these investors to each invest into the sub technology verticals under the main DUTV Umbrella. \u00a0Some are interested in the Easy FEN\u2122, others are excited about mitigating forest fires, others for cleaning water and still others for our coal additive to give the coal mines some longer-term value in the \u201cback up power\u201d arena. \u00a0Discussions are ongoing with all of these investor groups. It is very possible that this increasing global exposure is helping\u00a0 some with the DUTV stock price.</p><p>Merger</p><p>As stated before, we were honored to be selected to be featured on a widely watched global television investor show.\u00a0 The show was recorded last June. We were told it was going to air first in July, then Sept 28. We were then told it was delayed as they did not want their other featured companies attempting to go public in the down public market.</p><p>Thus, we have been waiting for the show to air since this summer.\u00a0 As previously stated, this has been an impetus for delaying the merger, per previous agreements.\u00a0 However, a decision to move forward, regardless of the show airing or the air dates\u2026is imminent. \u00a0We will let you know more on this as soon as we are able.</p><p>The management team at DUTV, as well as Easy Energy Systems and Easy Energy Finance, appreciates the continued confidence and support as we continue our vision: \u00a0To convert waste into wealth .. while fueling the world, feeding\u00a0the famished, and fostering environmental\u00a0sustainability</p><p>About Digital Utilities Ventures Inc.:</p><p>Digital Utilities Ventures, Inc. is working to become a formidable presence in the green solutions marketplace.

It's unbelievable. Those who lose their shame lose their heart too,\" main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) spokesman Faik Oztrak tweeted. <br/>The government has also been criticised over the lack of firefighting planes, with Turkey forced to accept help from Azerbaijan, Iran, Russia and Ukraine. <br/>\"If we don't have planes or helicopters, we must buy them,\" Bodrum mayor Aras of the CHP said in a video shared on Twitter. <br/>Erdogan insisted Saturday that Turkey had \"the strongest infrastructure in the region to fight forest fires\" as he promised financial support for those affected. <br/>Experts warn that climate change will wreak further damage in Turkey, causing more fires and other disasters if necessary measures to tackle the problem are not taken. <br/>According to European Union figures, Turkey has been hit by 133 wildfires in 2021 so far compared with an average of 43 by this point in the years between 2008 and 2020. <br/>Last month six people were killed after heavy rain caused flooding and landslides in northeastern Turkey. <br/></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767162783302376225879100190</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:638K-G3J1-JCMN-Y0M6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484255</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"639\"/><timeReceived>3:50 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 1, 2021 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>Mayors</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qjc5QjBGQUU4M0Y4NDVEMEI4Njk1MUVGRjU1NzREMzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Davidson and Jefferies are preparing to price $160 million in unrated federally and state taxable industrial development revenue bonds to aid further expansion. The date hasn't been set on the bonds, but the bankers expect to bring the deal in mid to late June, said Kyle Thomas, a D.A. Davidson managing director. JMG Attorneys is bond counsel.\"Unfortunately, there has been a lot of demand for forest fire suppression assets in the U.S.,\" said McAndrew Rudisill, Bridger's chief investment officer and a director.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The deal being sold through conduit Gallatin County, Montana, will refund $7.6 million of revenue bonds; pay $133 million to add four CL-415EAF Super Scooper planes at a cost of $28 million each to its fleet, of which two have already been delivered; and construct two hangers on the Belgrade campus near Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport to bring the total to four. The proceeds will also fund a $19.7 million debt service fund.</p><p>Drought, increasing temperatures, overgrown forests and increased development near forests have resulted in more frequent and severe wildfires across much of the West.</p><p>Nearly a quarter of the U.S., mostly in the West, is at moderate to very high risk of severe wildfires, according to the U.S. Forest Service. This comes on top of several years of fires that have burned millions of acres inOregonandCalifornia.</p><p>Fire activityincreasedin May, mostly across the Southwest, with activity also across portions of California, inland Western states and southern Colorado, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Wildfires have burned 112% more acreage by June 1 than the 10-year average, with nearly 88% of the total acres burned in the south to southwest, according to NIFC.</p><p>The situation had become so bad in California that S&amp;P Global Ratings analysts said in a report last year the state no longer has a \"fire season, because it's become a year-round phenomenon.\"</p><p>\"Fires have become more of a year-round event,\" Rudisill said. \"Peak season is June through November in the western U.S.\"</p><p>It's not just climate change driving the compounding fire problem, but that the number of people who live in what is called the urban-wildland interface has increased, he said.</p><p>\"It's a confluence of events, plus the temperatures are higher on average,\" Rudisill said. \"That is why it's important to put them out quickly.\"</p><p>In addition to the increase in the number of fires during the time Bridger has been in business, the fleet of suppression aircraft in the U.S. is very old, and much of it is being taken out of service, Rudisill said.</p><p>\"There has been a lot of demand, and that demand has continued to grow, and the supply of fire suppression aircraft has gone down,\" Rudisill said</p><p>The company has more than 30 contracts with state and federal government agencies, but the primary contract is with the U.S. Forest Service, Rudisill said. One in five of its employees are U.S. veterans.</p><p>Kestrel Verifiers provided an independent opinion that the bonds qualify as sustainable. Kestrel said it determined that the bonds conform with the four core components of the International Capital Market Association.</p><p>The planes it uses are more environmentally-friendly, because they scoop up lake water, so they don't use environmentally-harmful chemicals to suppress fires, according to the online investor presentation for the bonds.</p><p>\"Kestrel rated our company sustainable and a protector of national resources,\" Rudisill said. \"We got the second-party opinion prior to raising the equity, because a lot of environmentally focused funds require a sustainability rating.\"</p><p>The company received a lot of interest from ESG funds when it did a $300 million private equity raise in April, he said.</p><p>\"What we are doing directly reduces CO2 emissions by putting out fires,\" he said. \"Fires are the No. 1 or No. 2 emitter of CO2 emissions behind cars and factories.\"</p><p>The CL-415 EAF airplanes the bonds will finance are the only aircraft purpose-built for aerial firefighting, according to the investor presentation. Most firefighting aircraft are conversions.</p><p>The planes have a higher water drop capacity and faster airspeed than helicopters and can drop 50,000 gallons of water on fires before refueling, compared to the 20,000 gallons of fire retardant a 747 super tanker can drop before refueling, according to bond documents.</p><p>\"Scoopers can do 15 drops an hour,\" Rudisill said. \"They can land on a lake. They don't have to go to base and refuel. They are pretty efficient planes.\"</p><p>Its fleet is growing in 2022 from four to six Super Scoopers; nine other planes including five twin commanders and four Daher Kodiak aircraft for reconnaissance and command; and two drones for aerial intelligence, imagery gathering and real-time active wildfire mapping. By 2026, it plans to grow the entire fleet to 12 Super Scoopers, 33 reconnaissance and command planes and seven drones.</p><p>The $300 million in private equity will help it expand into the rest of the U.S. and internationally, Rudisill said.</p><p>The bonds will be sold as term bonds maturing in September 2042 with level annual debt service.

Several members of his church <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sga.org/fighting-fires-and-spreading-the-gospel-in-yakutia/\">joined the volunteer firefighters</url>, and Christian medics provided care at the scene. <br/><br/>'Frontline Pastors' Risk All<br/>\"That's why we call them '<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sga.org/donation/gifts/\">frontline pastors</url>',\" said SGA president Michael Johnson, who just visited Russia and neighboring Ukraine, where several local pastors partnering with SGA serve in a war zone. \"These pastors are risking everything to serve their communities -- even their own safety and lives.\" <br/><br/>The Illinois-based organization aims to raise $130,000 to help 1,300 local pastors and ministry workers -- like Pastor Yegor -- get through the harsh winter months, when many face poverty, hunger, and bone-freezing conditions. In Siberia, Russia, temperatures in January can plummet to minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit -- or even lower. <br/><br/>Compassion for the 'Forgotten'<br/>\"Right now, despite their own hardships, pastors across the former Soviet Union are sharing their faith and the compassion of Christ with the broken and the forgotten, including addicts, widows, orphans, and those traumatized by war,\" Johnson said. <br/><br/>\"Urgent aid will arrive just in time for the winter,\" he said. \"Frontline pastors, ministry workers, and their families -- who always put others' needs ahead of their own -- will receive gifts from SGA to buy food, get medical treatments they desperately need, and purchase winter boots for their children.\" <br/><br/>\"Frontline pastors\" include Alexander Sheleg and his wife, who've adopted nine orphaned children -- and many other local pastors like him who work multiple jobs to help feed orphans and others in need. Across the former Soviet Union, there are 700,000 orphans and unwanted children -- equal to the entire population of Boston. <br/><br/>Hope 'Dried Up'<br/>In the summer, as severe drought devastated vast areas of Kazakhstan -- a former Soviet republic in Central Asia -- local pastors and their churches gave sacrificially to help feed hungry families, while also offering them Christian literature in the Kazakh language. <br/><br/>Local pastors shared the \"good news\" with those whose hope had dried up. \"One of them -- Pastor Albert -- was able to bring the hope of Christ to a young mother-of-two who recently lost her unborn child,\" Johnson said. <br/><br/>Love in a War Zone<br/>Other pastors serve in war zones -- such as Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Ukraine -- where conflict has left widespread suffering and trauma. Pastor Sergei Alexeev  is one example -- moving his young family into a war zone in eastern Ukraine so they can \"minister to families and show them God's love is real,\" said Johnson, whose organization partners directly with local evangelical churches and pastors. <br/><br/>\"These frontline pastors -- who've sometimes lost their own sons, daughters, and homes in war zones -- comfort their neighbors, pray with them, and share the love of Christ with them in ways that speak much louder than words,\" he said. <br/><br/>Founded in 1934, Slavic Gospel Association (SGA, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sga.org\">www.sga.org</url>) helps \"forgotten\" orphans, widows and families in Russia, the former Soviet countries of Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and Russian-speaking immigrants in Israel - caring for their physical needs and sharing the life-transforming Gospel of Jesus Christ. SGA supports an extensive grassroots network of local evangelical missionary pastors and churches in cities and rural villages across this vast region. <br/><br/>SOURCE Slavic Gospel Association (SGA, ) <br/><br/>CONTACT: Sheryl Sellaway, 404-695-5564, <url normalizedValue=\"mailto:ssellaway@inchristcommunications.com\">ssellaway@inchristcommunications.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHRSTN-33981</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHRSTN2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:641N-XRK1-JCPC-F39F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">302064</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"773\"/><timeReceived>10:15 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Christian Communication, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Christian Newswire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 8, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00099LP</classCode><className>CHRISTIANS &amp; CHRISTIANITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000309</classCode><className>CLERGY &amp; RELIGIOUS VOCATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp; TEENS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000691</classCode><className>FAMILY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A2EX</classCode><className>ORPHANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001814</classCode><className>WAR &amp; CONFLICT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001464</classCode><className>RELIGION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008X9J</classCode><className>FOOD CHARITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000CUXE</classCode><className>HUNGER IN SOCIETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000CA2H</classCode><className>POVERTY &amp; HOMELESSNESS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001811</classCode><className>VOLUNTEERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX002002</classCode><className>MEDICAL TREATMENTS &amp; PROCEDURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GS129</classCode><className>ILLINOIS, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>GC578</classCode><className>RUSSIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009WRP</classCode><className>ARCTIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC581</classCode><className>UKRAINE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Those Canadian communities are (from West to East):</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* Princeton, British Columbia (Princeton and District Arena)</p><p>* Douro-Dummer, Ontario (Douro Community Centre and Arena)</p><p>* Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec (Arena Marcel-Larocque)</p><p>* Sydney, Nova Scotia (Canada Games Complex)</p><p>Kraft Hockeyville has established a legacy of supporting Canadian communities by making an impact on community arenas and the overall culture of the game. The program is dedicated to building stronger, more connected, and inclusive communities across the country through the love of the game of hockey. In fact, according to the Kraft Hockeyville Community Hockey Survey, an overwhelming majority of Canadians agree that community hockey is a great way to bring communities together.</p><p>The program has managed to bring passionate hockey communities together again, including the Top 4 finalists. The Top 4 community finalists were selected based on their nomination stories and their ability to score additional rally points by engaging their community.</p><p>\"The passion and enthusiasm for hockey in Canadian communities was abundantly clear through the nominations we received from across the country,\" said Adam Butler, President of Canada and North America Coffee, Kraft Heinz. \"With hockey being the heart and soul of so many communities, it's never easy to select our finalists, but we couldn't be more excited to announce this year's Top 4 communities. Their stories really highlight the power hockey has in shaping communities.\"</p><p>About the Finalist Communities</p><p>* Princeton, British Columbia (Princeton and District Arena)</p><p>Princeton perseveres. After a forest fire threatened their community two years ago, they were hit by widespread floods that are still impacting residents today. \"How can I help?\" is the mentality of this community, and together, they have been able to overcome any obstacle in their way. The next obstacle is upgrading the Princeton and District Arena, which is the hub of the community. It's not just a place for hockey, but a place to create memories like weddings, dances, fundraisers, and more. With its roof in disrepair, water has been pouring onto the ice during games. Winning Kraft Hockeyville would allow the community to keep a roof over their skaters' heads, which means so much to them after all they've been through as a community.</p><p>* Douro-Dummer, Ontario (Douro Community Centre and Arena)</p><p>Douro Arena is a place where all members of Douro-Dummer feel welcome. Whether you've stepped on the ice for the first time, or have been at it for decades, members of the community care about your experience as much as they care about their own. Youth hockey is only part of why the arena is so important to the community. It's also a place for the community to come together to support fundraising for the local food banks and toy drives. The community continues to strive to help make hockey more accessible for everyone, and winning Kraft Hockeyville will allow them to make long-overdue upgrades to their lobby and dressing rooms, so all members of the community and visitors feel welcome.</p><p>* Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec (Arena Marcel-Larocque)</p><p>Celebrating its 50th anniversary, Arena Marcel-Larocque sits in the centre of a small town with an unparalleled excitement for hockey. In the Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu community, the passion for the game is only half of what matters. The arena is the community's hub, where youth make lifelong connections and parents reconnect with old friends. Parents have passed their love of hockey to future generations who now claim the arena as their second home. It's clear that the arena is a source of joy for all members of the community. Winning Kraft Hockeyville would allow the community to build 50 more years of meaningful memories by helping fund much-needed upgrades throughout the arena including its changerooms, washrooms, and ice plant.</p><p>* Sydney, Nova Scotia (Canada Games Complex)</p><p>Cape Breton is a small island with a huge passion for hockey. Locals describe the island the way they describe their love for community hockey: fierce, resolute, and resilient. The Canada Games Complex in Sydney was built 35 years ago to host the 1987 Canada Winter Games but has since had to close its doors to hockey. Since then, the demand for rink access on the island has outweighed the supply, making it difficult to accommodate the sharp increase in participation in girls' hockey the community has seen over the last number of years. Winning Kraft Hockeyville would help the community purchase the new compressor it needs to reopen its arena's doors and empower the girls on the island itching for ice time.</p><p>The 2022 grand prize winner will have an opportunity to host an NHL(R) preseason game on a date to be determined by Kraft Heinz Canada, the NHL and NHLPA, and receive $250,000 to be used towards arena upgrades, as well as the coveted title of Kraft Hockeyville 2022. This year's winner and each of the three runner-up communities will also receive $10,000 worth of new hockey equipment for their minor hockey programs, courtesy of the NHLPA Goals &amp; Dreams fund.</p><p>These finalists are now tasked with rallying their community and Canadians from across the country.</p><p>Canadians from coast-to-coast can help determine the winner of Kraft Hockeyville 2022 by voting for one of the Top 4 communities online at krafthockeyville.ca. Voting opens on May 6th at 9:00am ET and closes on May 7th at 5:00 p.m. ET. Votes can only be cast on the website during the voting phase and voting per person is unlimited. The winner will be announced live on Hockey Night in Canada the evening of May 7th following the conclusion of the vote.</p><p>For complete contest rules and programs details, and to learn more about the Top 4 finalists, including their stories, photos, and videos, please visit krafthockeyville.ca. Kraft Heinz Canada encourages all participants to adhere to COVID-19 health and safety protocols that may be required or recommended by federal, provincial, or local authorities in your respective jurisdiction.</p><p>[Category: Sports]</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7816797 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7816797</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:659G-WSN1-DYG2-R15B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-04-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1073\"/><timeReceived>10:17 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"04\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>April 24, 2022 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In March and April, cities and counties worked together with the media to slow the coronavirus progression. We were successful, and our numbers were better than those of most major cities around the country. Because the number of positive cases and deaths were low, the Governor commenced reopening businesses without consulting with local governments. In addition, he took away the authority from cities and counties to manage the response. The results were disastrous.</p><p>\"Thirty days later, the virus was out of control like a forest fire, and more people tested positive, more people died, and hospitals were scrambling to expand capacity. Consequently, the State ordered businesses to close for a second time, and Texas joined Florida, Arizona, and California in the national spotlight but not in the right way. In July, the Governor imposed a statewide mask requirement which was desperately needed, and he should be commended for that.</p><p>\"And again, cities and counties and local media rallied together with the State to slow the virus's spread. This helped significantly reduce the positivity rate, which needs to be below 5% and stay there. Most of the numbers are better, but the number of people dying is still too high, and the positivity rate remains above 5%.</p><p>\"And now that numbers are better like in April, the Governor is about to embark on the same course again. It is frustrating that he is making decisions that impact all of us without including local officials in the process. The State is about to repeat its mistake, expecting a different result. Please tell that to the virus and explain that to the people who will suffer.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123924432</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RS-W7K1-JCBF-S4C1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"331\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 2, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp; DYING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002064</classCode><className>EPIDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921100JQ</classCode><className>MAYORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001880</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DN6R</classCode><className>PUBLIC OFFICIALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009G89</classCode><className>REGIONAL &amp; LOCAL GOVERNMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DOXW</classCode><className>PANDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DRL9</classCode><className>FACE MASK MANDATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX002145</classCode><className>VIRUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GX591</classCode><className>HOUSTON, TX, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GS159</classCode><className>TEXAS, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS125</classCode><className>FLORIDA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Challenges ranging from accessing forest product markets to workforce deficits, including labor and know-how for prescribed burning, make increasing the rate of hazardous fuel treatment for wildfire mitigation a steep climb.</p><p>However, Fox and Colorado Senator Michael Bennet agreed that a significant, long-term investment could make a big difference. According to NASF, to take care of the tremendous fuel reduction and restoration needs of our forests, the country must treat five million acres per year on top of our current activity (roughly three million acres per year). In their estimation, this will cost $60 billion over 10 years, a big jump from current funding levels that average $591 million per year. But, to put that number in perspective, Senator Bennet quoted a figure from the U.S. Forest Service (USFS): it costs an average of $50,000 per acre to fight a forest fire versus $1,500 an acre to perform fuel treatment. Adding the costs spared to people and communities from catastrophic wildfires, preparedness is the cheaper option. To help realize this, the lawmaker has introduced the Outdoor Restoration Partnership Act, which would authorize that level of funding to tackle the millions of acres of land that pose a severe wildfire risk.</p><p>While the FY2022 federal budget blueprint released by the Biden Administration in early April is not as ambitious as the Partnership Act, it does propose a major increase in fuel mitigation and forest restoration funding$1.7 billion to the USFS and $340 million to the Department of Interior. In letters sent last week to Congressional Appropriators, NFPA voiced its support for this proposal. Outthink Wildfire a\u201ecents calls for an increase in resources for fuel management and related actions to decrease wildfire risk in the nation's forests. Outthink Wildfire also calls for more support for local fire personnel who are the first responders to the overwhelming majority of wildfires, which is why NFPA also stressed the need for at least $108 million for the USFS' the State Forestry Assistance and Volunteer Fire Assistance programs which help train and equip state and local fire agencies. The letter also touched on support for community hazard mitigation, like the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program and the Administration's proposal to add $540 million in new resources to help communities undertake pre-disaster planning and make investments in resiliency.</p><p>It's still early in the process for both the Partnership Act and the FY2022 budget and so, too early to know if Congress will act to treat wildfires in the US like the emergency they truly are. However, we all must understand that spending less on wildfire preparedness now is not a path to savings later.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124492685</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62TB-YY31-DYTH-G3VX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"579\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 27, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Riley's innovative use of the local RC&amp;D Council for fire prevention outreach to local communities is reshaping the identity for these organizations across the nation.</p><p>A national award, Riley was selected to receive the very coveted Smokey Bear Award this year by the Cooperative Forest Fire Prevention committee made up of the U.S. Forest Service, the National Association of State Foresters, and the Ad Council. When announcing the award to Riley, the Forest Service noted that his use of Smokey Bear imaging and products for wildfire prevention, combined with his demeanor and networks across the State of Georgia, opened new doors, created trust and new partnerships. \"These Smokey Bear Award winners are being honored for the dedication, innovation and energy they bring to wildfire prevention,\" said USDA Forest Service Chief Vicki Christiansen. \"Throughout the many years of these awards, it's people like these who show up with the passion and desire to make a difference. We thank them for their outstanding work in preventing human-caused wildfires.\"</p><p>Riley has worked for the Chestatee-Chattahoochee Resource Conservation and Development Council since 2012. A University of Georgia graduate, he began his career in forestry. On receiving the Smokey Bear Silver Award, Riley said, \"It means a lot. It's a recognition of my team's work to reach people and help them live better in these rural areas.\"</p><p>While wildfire prevention is not in his job description, Riley brings that passion to his leadership of the Appalachian RC&amp;D Council Fire Adapted Communities (FAC) Coalition, in his role as the State Firewise USA Liaison to Georgia, and to the Georgia Prescribed Fire Council where he served as Chair in 2019-2020. He continues to serve as a volunteer firefighter in his home county in North Georgia. In just the past two years, Frank has given hundreds of presentations, displayed inflatable Smokey Bears and Smokey Bear banners in popular parades and fairs, and handed out promotional prevention materials at more than 150 events.

The annual management tool is used to reduce the potential for large wildfires by decreasing unwanted vegetation and improving the overall health of Alabamas national forests. The Forest Service is asking the public to check the National Forests in Alabama social media accounts and the forest website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/alabama\">www.fs.usda.gov/alabama</url> for the latest updates regarding any planned prescribed burns .</p><p>Prescribed burning is one of the most effective land management tools to prevent the outbreak and spread of wildfires. The controlled burns also improve habitat for wildlifeincluding deer, turkey, quail and songbirdsby opening the forest floor up to light and encouraging the growth of native grasses and other plants that provide food and shelter for many species.</p><p>Our prescribed burning program is a targeted approach to reducing flammable vegetation on the landscape known as fuels that build upon the forest floor and can feed large wildfires. Reducing these fuels reduces future wildfire impacts in our communities, said Joe Smith, forest fire management officer with the National Forests in Alabama.</p><p>A lot of planning occurs to conduct successful prescribed burns. Exact burn date depends on weather and moisture conditions that best allow for the appropriate burn intensity level and smoke management.</p><p>If you have questions about the planned prescribed burns, contact the following Forest Service district offices:</p><p>1. Bankhead Forest is planning to burn approximately 16,000 acres in Winston and Lawrence Counties, call</p><p>(205) 471-7724.</p><p>2. Conecuh Forest is planning to burn approximately 35,000 acres in Escambia and Covington Counties, call</p><p>(334) 708-0595.</p><p>3. Talladega Forest- Talladega and Shoal Creek Districts are planning to burn approximately 40,000 acres in Calhoun, Clay, Cleburne and Talladega Counties, call the Heflin office at (256) 463-2272 or the Talladega office at (256) 369-5882.</p><p>4.

Chile</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A new national park in Chile will protect over 185,000 acres of melting glaciers. The National Glacier Park site is 60 kilometers (37 miles) from the capital city of Santiago and will protect 46% of the ice found in the Andes area of the metropolitan region, where over 7 million of the nation's 19 million people live. \"It is a fundamental step that our country is taking to combat the destruction of nature,\" said then-President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era on March 6.</p><p>Glaciers are a key indicator of climate change for scientists, and all but two of Chile's 26,000 glaciers are shrinking due to rising temperatures. In the southern region of Patagonia, glaciers are diminishing faster than in any other location around the world. Meanwhile, a national law for glacier protection has been under debate since it was proposed in 2006. The new national park cannot turn back the clock on climate change and has been criticized for not protecting enough land, but it is a sign politicians are heeding the urgent call from scientists and environmentalists for more robust protections. The government says the park will serve as a key site for ecotourism and research.Agence France-Presse; EOS; University of Santiago, Chile, Daily</p><p>2. Burkina Faso</p><p>Francis K\u00e9r\u00e9 became the first African to earn the Pritzker Prize, architecture's most prestigious award. When Mr. K\u00e9r\u00e9 was a boy in the village of Gando, Burkina Faso, there was no school. He was sent to the provincial capital to receive an education - in an unventilated, crowded classroom with poor lighting. There, sitting with over 150 other students in 110 F heat, he made up his mind: \"In my heart, I felt even then that I wanted to build things better one day, so that kids like me would be free to learn,\" he recalls.</p><p>Mr. K\u00e9r\u00e9 studied architecture at the Technical University of Berlin. While there, he raised $50,000 to build Gando's first primary school, later adding teachers' housing and a library. The student body has since grown from 120 to 700. He has designed schools, libraries, health care facilities, and public spaces throughout West Africa, using simple, local materials in innovative ways, and has built structures across Europe and the United States. His architectural philosophy combines social service and elegance. \"It is not because you are poor that you should not try to create quality,\" said Mr. K\u00e9r\u00e9. \"Everyone deserves quality, everyone deserves luxury, and everyone deserves comfort.\"The New York Times, Pritzker Architecture Prize</p><p>3. United Kingdom</p><p>The United Kingdom's first consumer-owned wind farm came online in South Wales. Each of the 907 owners of the Graig Fatha wind turbine, operated by Ripple Energy, is also a consumer of the affordable, stable-priced green energy.</p><p>A share of the wind farm can be purchased for as little as \u00a325 ($33), and most members own enough to supply all of their home energy needs. Together, the co-owners have contributed \u00a32.2 million ($2.9 million) to the project, which also received a grant from the Welsh government for \u00a31.1 million. The electricity generated is first sold to Co-op Energy, which then supplies owners with power, discounted at rates that depend in part on how much of the turbine the customer owns. Thousands of people have already signed up to become members of Ripple's second wind farm in Ayrshire, Scotland.Energy Digital</p><p>4. Thailand</p><p>It's becoming easier for communities to fight forest fires in Thailand thanks to a new phone app. Every year from February to April, dry weather creates conditions for a dangerous fire season in the north of the country. In 2017, geospatial technology researcher Nion Sirimongkonlertkul, from the Rajamangala University of Technology Lanna, developed an application that uses data from NASA satellites to visualize a map of fire hot spots as they're burning. Nearby firefighters and local volunteers are notified and shown the shortest path to the flames. Dr. Nion says the community involvement fosters a sense of empathy and shared responsibility.</p><p>In the past, only the national government could access this data, which it would send via email to firefighters. \"Now with the app, everybody can monitor the fires in real time,\" said Natthaphon Singtuan, head of the forest fire volunteer center at the nonprofit Mirror Foundation. \"So we join forces. And the more people there are, the safer it is.\" The app has thousands of downloads, and developers plan to expand its use around the country and beyond. With some fires set to prepare land for cultivation, researchers are also working to help farmers move away from burning toward more sustainable practices.Mongabay</p><p>World</p><p>Bike donations around the world have made school and work more accessible. In rural and remote areas, dependable modes of transportation can be expensive, dangerous, or nonexistent. \"Bicycles are a really overlooked tool for people to access opportunities,\" said World Bicycle Relief (WBR) CEO Dave Neiswander. \"There's a billion people [who] are challenged to find reliable transportation. Bicycles are a very efficient way for them to help themselves.\"</p><p>The nonprofit has distributed more than 635,000 bicycles since 2005, in places ranging from Zambia and Zimbabwe to Colombia and Sri Lanka. Wherever it goes, WBR works closely with the entire community, including schools, religious organizations, and civic leaders, to assess local needs. In Zambia, primary school girls who received bikes reduced absenteeism by 28%, lowered dropout rates by 19%, and improved punctuality by 66%, according to a WBR study. For years, research has shown that in areas with poor transportation infrastructure, bikes can be a tool against poverty.</p><p>Following its success with donations, WBR began a social enterprise organization to meet growing demand, allowing individuals to buy a bike and pay it off in small increments. WBR also gives local employment a boost through training for mechanics - around 2,300 so far - who work at its 60 repair shops worldwide.Reasons To Be Cheerful</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CSM-e7e0caf6c82d531ab5d3ece0b4756e77</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CSM2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:658W-MW61-JC8H-M2J4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7945</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-04-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1036\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Christian Science Publishing Society All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Christian Science Monitor</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"04\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>April 22, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00052GB</classCode><className>AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>SIC7375 INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"/><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001021</classCode><className>GLACIERS &amp;

More than 57 percent of the state is now experiencing moderate drought conditions and the remainder of the state is classified as abnormally dry.</p><p>The heightened concern for wildfires will continue until adequate precipitation is received allowing new leaves and green vegetation to emerge.</p><p>\"As we transition from winter to spring, it's important that everyone be aware that their change in activities may alter the causes of wildfires, but not the risk,\" said Capt. Douglas Miner from the N.H. Forest Protection Bureau. \"Being vigilant about what we are doing outdoors whether disposing of ash from a woodstove, having that first cookout of the season or doing something else that involves combustion and practicing strong wildfire prevention behavior can have an enormous impact on all of us.\"</p><p>Ninety percent of wildfires in New Hampshire are caused by human behavior. While brush fires and campfires are common causes, other sources include improper disposal of smoking materials, overheated engines and sparks emitted from machinery.</p><p>\"New Hampshire's forests experienced a significant increase in visitors in 2020, and overall that's great for our health and our economy,\" said Patrick Hackley, director of the N.H. Division of Forests and Lands. \"Unfortunately, not everyone understands how their actions might start a wildfire and cause damage to our landscape. This proclamation serves to highlight the importance of wildfire prevention awareness.\"</p><p>The state's Forest Protection Bureau, part of the N.H. Division of Forests and Lands, is responsible for protecting 4.5 million acres of both public and private New Hampshire forestlands from the threat of wildland fire and crimes against the forest resource. This is accomplished by forest rangers, fire patrolmen, fire tower personnel and support staff as well as the forest fire wardens and deputy wardens serving in each community.</p><p>From 2016-2020, New Hampshire experienced an average of 119 wildfires impacting 276 acres annually.</p><p>The N.H. Forest Protection Bureau is part of the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources' Division of Forests and Lands, which protects and promotes the value provided by trees, forests and natural communities.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124400253</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62GD-67T1-DYTH-G137-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"516\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"04\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>April 19, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DS5C</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008XH6</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX000854</classCode><className>PLANT CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DM3Y</classCode><className>FORESTRY WORKERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX001981</classCode><className>LAYOFFS &amp; DISMISSALS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DS5C</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DM3Y</classCode><className>FORESTRY WORKERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DLA5</classCode><className>CHRIS SUNUNU</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX576</classCode><className>CONCORD, NH, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>GS145</classCode><className>NEW HAMPSHIRE, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GR214</classCode><className>NORTHEAST USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

We begin in southern Ukraine where it's just gone 7:00 in the morning and rescue operations continue under fire in parts from Russian shelling in the Kherson region, two days after the biggest dam in Ukraine suffered a major breach.</p><p>The Ukrainian president calls the damage catastrophic, pleading for a clear and swift humanitarian response from the international community.</p><p>Thousands of homes are believed to have been flooded. So far, more than 1,500 residents have been evacuated from Ukrainian controlled areas.</p><p>And now, the United Nations has stepped in. As Ukraine claims Russian forces are offering no help to get residents out of areas under Russian occupation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): The situation in the occupied part of the Kherson region is absolutely catastrophic. The occupiers have simply abandoned the people and these dreadful conditions without rescue, without water. They are left on the rooftop and flooded communities.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Ukraine and Russia are accusing each other of being responsible for the collapse of the dam Nova Kakhovka. Ukraine has now begun an investigation into a war crimes and possible ecocide.</p><p>CNN's Fred Pleitgen is in the flood of Kherson Region, witnessed firsthand the rescue mission which is now underway.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Raging floodwater with whole towns submerged. This Ukrainian military drone video purports to show a family trapped in a Russian controlled village pleading for help. But all the small drone can do is drop a bottle of water.</p><p>We went on a rescue mission in Kherson where the water levels are still rising.</p><p>PLEITGEN: So, these guys tell us that they've been at work here since last night. They said the work during the night was extremely difficult and that they're really tired but of course, they have to keep going.</p><p>PLEITGEN (voice over): They found this house abandoned but rescued three kittens. Roman Skandrakov (PH) tells me the volunteers face Russian shelling on nearly every sortie.</p><p>Of course, it's extremely dangerous, he says, especially today, it's very loud.</p><p>Russia and Ukraine continue to blame each other for the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam and hydroelectric power plant.</p><p>The Ukrainian say on their side alone, hundreds of thousands or without normal access to water and nearly 2,000 homes are underwater. While the rescue efforts are hampered by the near constant artillery and mortar barrages.</p><p>Look, we're working despite the possibility of us being shelled. We're taking risks every day, Ukraine's interior minister tells me. We understand that this is war and it is very difficult to completely avoid a drone or incoming missile.</p><p>And that dangerous work is far from over. The authorities here say they expect they'll be busy all night getting more people to safety.</p><p>Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Kherson, Ukraine.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: With us now in southern Ukraine and joining us is Selena Kozakijevic, area Manager for CARE Ukraine. Selena, thank you for being with us.</p><p>It's been more than 48 hours now since the dam collapse. At this point, what appears to be the most immediate and urgent problems caused by the bridge? What are your biggest concerns now in the coming days?</p><p>SELENA KOZAKIJEVIC, AREA MANAGER, CARE UKRAINE: Good morning, John.</p><p>Yes, as was mentioned before, more than 2,600 buildings have been affected by the floods in almost in around 20 settlements in the Kherson region as far as our latest information shows.</p><p>Obviously, the evacuation of the affected population in the flooded areas was the main priority and immediately upon the evacuation, the provision of food, water, safe space for those evacuated.</p><p>[00:05:15]</p><p>Another of course, the important thing would be to provide safety knowing that the conflict is ongoing actually and that people are exposed.</p><p>VAUSE: And with that in mind, here's a little more from the Ukrainian president on rescue operations within Russian occupied areas around the Kherson region. Here he is, listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ZELENSKYY (voice over): A clear and prompt response from the world is needed to what is happening. It is even impossible to accurately determine how many people in the temporarily occupied territory of Kherson region may die without rescue, without drinking water, without food, without medical assistance, our military and special services to the extent possible, despite the shelling --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: So, has CARE and other aid agencies been given access to these areas under Russian occupation? Have you tried? Have you made any kind of effort to get there? Is it possible to even get into these areas under Russian occupation?</p><p>KOZAKIJEVIC: Obviously, CARE operates in Ukraine with local partners, national organizations that are present and have been present in Ukraine.</p><p>However, the right bank of the river is not accessible. And this has been a difficult situation, knowing that some of our partners do report receiving calls through the hotline pleading for assistance as it is deemed necessary at the moment.</p><p>However, this part of the river is not accessible at the moment.</p><p>VAUSE: Do you have any assessment of the extent of the damage there, the humanitarian needs, as well as maybe numbers of those who have died or hurt, I guess in the areas controlled by the Russians and also in the areas that you now have access to?</p><p>KOZAKIJEVIC: We do receive reports that as of yesterday evening that two persons were declared missing and their whereabouts were unknown.</p><p>So far, we are not aware of the actual casualties from the floods themselves.</p><p>What remains important, obviously, in the area around Kherson City that is accessible, there is access for humanitarians. There are a number of volunteers of local organizations working together with the authorities in providing immediate assistance.</p><p>What we understand is that around 1,800 people have been evacuated so far.</p><p>VAUSE: Here's part of an assessment of the damage by your aid agency CARE. At least 150 tons of oil have been released into Dnipro River with the risk of further leakage of more than 300 tons.</p><p>This may lead to the need to Nyzhniodniprovskyi National Nature Park to disappear which is more than 80,000 hectares of protected land. Forgive me if my pronunciation was bad.</p><p>This assessment as bad as it sounds, is it just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the environmental damage here?</p><p>KOZAKIJEVIC: Obviously, the risks to the environment are extremely high and there is a huge risk of water being polluted and contaminated. And this is only not an immediate issue requiring provision of safe drinking water for those who are affected, but also could be a mid to long term issue to be resolved and to be -- to be monitored.</p><p>In addition to that, obviously, there are other risks related to contamination of the area with unexploded ordnance and explosive devices. So, all of these are the risks that we are looking at right now.</p><p>VAUSE: Selena, thank you so much for being with us. We wish you all the very best in these operations. Please stay safe.</p><p>KOZAKIJEVIC: Thank you very much.</p><p>VAUSE: 75 million people in the United States, millions more in Canada are now breathing noxious, smoky hazy air drifting south from hundreds of wildfires burning in Canada.</p><p>This is what New York City looks like right now. Time there it is just eight minutes, nine minutes past midnight. The air quality is the worst of any major city in the world. Worse than New Delhi, worse than Beijing, worse than Shanghai designated hazardous which is the most severe level.</p><p>This time lapse shows smoke engulfing the city over a three hour period Wednesday afternoon. Skyline vanishes behind a thick orange haze by 2:00 p.m. From the Midwest to the Northeast and mid-Atlantic, states are urging people to stay inside, put on masks if they need to go outside.</p><p>Smoke is emanating from more than 100 fires active in central Quebec. Officials warned the smoke could blanket much of the United States and Canada for the next several days.</p><p>We get the very latest now from New York City from CNN's Athena Jones.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[00:10:01]</p><p>ATHENA JONES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): From New York.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I've never experienced anything like this before, never to this degree.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That did shock me how quickly it came in last night.</p><p>JONES (voice over): To Cleveland, Ohio and even as far south as Raleigh, North Carolina, unhealthy air blanketing a large swath of United States. From over 400 Active wildfires burning in Canada, more than half of them determined to be out of control according to the Canadian interagency Forest Fire Center.</p><p>JUSTIN TRUDEAU, CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER: Last year and this year, the worst wildfire season we've ever had right across the country.</p><p>JONES (voice over): Canada's wildfire season got off to an unusually early and intense start in May, picking up aggressively this month, largely in Quebec.</p><p>More than nine million acres have burned in Canada so far this year, 15 times the normal amount. Smoke from those fires traveling more than 500 miles to blanket New York City.</p><p>ERIC ADAMS, MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY: From the gloom over Yankee Stadium to the smoky haze, scurrying our skyline. We can see it, we can smell it and we felt it. And it was alarming and concerning.</p><p>JONES (voice over): The Air Quality Index reaching levels that could be harmful for everyone, New Yorkers being urged to stay indoors as much as possible, or wear a high quality mask.</p><p>ADAMS: This is not the day to train for a marathon or to do an outside event with your children. Stay inside, close windows and doors and use air purifiers if you have them.</p><p>JONES (voice over): Wildfire smoke contains particulate matter, or PM2.5. Among the tiniest and most dangerous pollutants, it's able to infiltrate the lungs and enter the bloodstream and has been linked to conditions like asthma and heart disease.</p><p>School districts in central New York not far from the fires in Quebec, among the first to cancel all outdoor activities. Public schools in New York City and Montgomery County, Maryland doing the same.</p><p>Officials warning this smoke will continue to impact much of the East Coast until at least the weekend.</p><p>ZACHARY ISCOL, COMMISSIONER, NEW YORK CITY EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT: We expect this to be a multiple day event. So we expect that that advisory to remain in place for the next few days.</p><p>Athena Jones, CNN, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: Bill McKibben is founder of Third Act which organizes people over the age of 60 for action on climate and justice.</p><p>In 1989, he wrote the End of Nature, widely regarded as the first book for a general audience about climate change. He is also the distinguished scholar at Middlebury College, and we are lucky to have him with us this hour. It's good to see you again.</p><p>BILL MCKIBBEN, ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, MIDDLEBURY COLLEGE: Good to be with you, John.</p><p>VAUSE: OK, so this heavy kind of dystopian haze blowing in from Canada just seems to bring together so many elements of this climate crisis. Here's the governor of New York state, listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. KATHY HOCHUL (D-NY): We've seen some very extreme weather. My first week as governor almost two years ago, we had two hurricanes. We had record snow events in Western New York, my hometown, and now we're seeing something that is absolutely unprecedented.</p><p>So, climate change, we have to be prepared for all conditions, especially what we're experiencing now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: And what we're experiencing now is kind of like, you know, it's an example that you cannot hide from climate change consequences. There is nowhere to run, what happens in one country doesn't stay in one country.</p><p>And yes, we have to be prepared. But it also seems we have to put into place the solutions, which we know are out there, we just have to have the will to do it.</p><p>MCKIBBEN: That's right. Look, what we're -- what we're reminded of today and in some ways, what the power corridor of the northeastern United States is learning that much of the rest of the world learned a long time ago, is that when you burn things, it's bad all around, it gets in your lungs, it gets -- it gets in the air. It's scary.</p><p>It's been scary in New York, and D.C. and Philadelphia, and all those places the last couple of days, that's because we didn't do what scientists told us to do 30 years ago. We've burned more carbon in those 30 years than we did in all of human history beforehand. We better now step up to the plate and do what science is telling us to do. Which is turn off the fossil fuel, turn down the heat, give those forests a chance not to burn in the decades ahead.</p><p>VAUSE: I want you to listen to Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the impact from these wildfires on his country Canada, here he is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUDEAU: People across the country are being affected are seeing vulnerable people at risk, outdoor events cancelled. Kids having to be kept inside at recess.</p><p>I can't help but think my conversation with Liam (PH) yesterday to conversations with my own kids, the past few years have been challenging for kids.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Yes, they've been challenging. But what happens if we continue to head down this road of environmental destruction with the accelerator flat to the floor, belching carbon pollution and unprecedented rates like we're doing right now? What sort of world are we giving our children and their children?</p><p>[00:15:04]</p><p>MCKIBBEN: It was Prime Minister Trudeau who told an oil and gas conference in Texas four or five years ago, no country would find spend a lot of oil under its soil and just leave it there. That was his defense for digging up the incredibly dirty tar sands of Alberta and pumping that oil all over the world.</p><p>Look, we've got to leave fossil fuel in the ground if we're to have any hope of slowing down the rate at which the planet is warming, the rate at which its forests are burning.</p><p>If we don't, then well, the world we leave behind for our kids, we're getting a kind of foretaste of just how dystopian it's going to be.</p><p>VAUSE: And from 2006 to 2010, I was based in Beijing, I was a CNN reporter there. Almost every day I woke up in that city, it looks like it does right now in New York and Washington and other parts of the United States.</p><p>He's part of the report I did in efforts to try and clear the pollution before the Beijing Olympics. It's a very young version of me.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Never before has the city this big with this much pollution taken such drastic action to try and clear the air so quickly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) VAUSE: You know, they succeeded in a band aid approach of clearing the air, it was still bad, it is still bad. It's still worse in many parts of the world. Billions of people across Asia, and Africa, are waking up to this kind of dirty air every single day.</p><p>The differences in Asia especially, it's caused by burning fossil fuels, especially coal. And that's an easy fix.</p><p>So, you know, for people in New York and Washington, welcome to how the rest of the world lives.</p><p>MCKIBBEN: Yes, it's terrible in New York right now, and we shouldn't make light of it. But it's precisely how most people across much of the world live every single day. That's why nine million people a year one death in five on this planet comes from the effects of breathing fossil fuel combustion.</p><p>The good news is we have an easy fix. We now live on a planet where the cheapest way to produce power is to point a sheet of glass at the sun. We should be in an all-out effort to move to renewable energy and to save energy so we don't have to use as much of it.</p><p>VAUSE: Bill, as always. It's so great to have you with us. Thank you for your time, Sir.</p><p>MCKIBBEN: Thank you, John. Take care.</p><p>VAUSE: Still to come, back to the future for Prince Harry. The British Royal ends days of testimony against three major British tabloids by relitigating the past we'll explain in a moment.</p><p>Also, an announcement from a soccer player. Lionel Messi announces where he will play next. And the football world is caught by surprise.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Messi coming into Miami is one of the best thing that ever happened.</p><p>[00:20:03]</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So, for the Argentinians, this is so exciting because we was waiting for this moment for a long, long time.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Having a figure like him in this country is tremendous.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: That's not quite a done deal but football legend Leonel Messi told the world he is heading to MLS club into Miami. There was speculation he would leave Paris Saint-Germain and maybe would return to Barcelona where he spent 17 seasons. Possibly he may have headed to Saudi Arabia to cash in on his later years. But the 35-year-old led Argentina to the World Cup championship last year, he's won a record seven Ballons d'Ors. Major League Soccer tweeted this, The GOAT, greatest of all time is coming. Millions of MLS fans all over the world welcome you, Leo.</p><p>CNN's Don Riddell.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT CORRESPONDENT: These are heady days for sports fans in South Florida but the excitement went into overdrive on Wednesday with news that Lionel Messi is coming to town.</p><p>The Argentine World Cup winner who is now widely regarded as the greatest football player of all time says that having left Paris Saint-Germain, he's now on his way to Major League Soccer and enter Miami.</p><p>To paraphrase the NBA legend LeBron James, Messi is taking his talents to South Beach.</p><p>LIONEL MESSI, 20222 WORLD CUP WINNER (through translator): I made the decision that I am going to Miami. I still haven't closed it 100 percent, I'm missing some things. But we decided to continue my journey there.</p><p>RIDDELL: Well, this month sports fans in the region have been enjoying the Miami Heat and the Florida Panthers runs to the NBA finals and the Stanley Cup final but the Messi news is absolutely huge.</p><p>Many had expected Messi to move to Saudi Arabia with whom he already has pretty close business ties and where his generational rival Cristiano Ronaldo is already playing.</p><p>But his move to the states will significantly boost the global audience of Major League Soccer, and it's perfectly timed as well. The United States will be co-hosting the next World Cup in just three years time along with Canada and Mexico.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: Thanks to Don Riddell from CNN World Sport for that report.</p><p>An emotional day for Britain's Prince Harry concluding testimony in his phone hacking lawsuit against British tabloids. He appeared uncomfortable during cross examination, where at times he clashed with a lawyer for Mirror Group Newspapers.</p><p>CNN's Max Foster breaks down all the details and reporting in from London.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MAX FOSTER, CNN ROYAL CORRESPONDENT: Day two of Prince Harry's evidence and we saw more details emerge of his accusations against Mirror Group Newspapers as well as one point of pretty emotional display from the Royal.</p><p>He was again cross examined by the lawyer for MGN Andrew Green on dozens of stories which Harry says were obtained using illegal means by the group's journalists, including phone hacking.</p><p>At one point, he alleged that the private investigator working for MGN fitted a tracking device in the car of former girlfriend Chelsy Davy, he described an article in the now defunct British magazine The People that gave great detail on a private conversation between him and his father now King Charles, saying that kind of article just perpetuated feelings of distrust within all of my relationships.</p><p>Harry highlighted this picture, an article published by the Sunday Mirror in 2007, which shows him dropping Davy off in a private road near Kensington Palace. He said he was suspicious of the means by which the photographer knew about this location, it posed a security risk.</p><p>One by one, the court went through articles published in the 1990s and 2000s. Harry detailing his suspicions about how the information was sourced.</p><p>Green would then point to legitimate ways MGN reporters could have gathered information on him, such as via palace spokespeople. He repeatedly accused Harry of entering into the realms of speculation, and this accusation that led to Harry's only real show of emotion in his two day appearance.</p><p>Later, he was questioned by his own lawyer about how it felt to be repeatedly accused of speculating, having to sit through so much cross examination, how he paused for a long time and got visibly choked up.</p><p>Harry's evidence finished early in the afternoon, and the court then heard from Jane Kerr, a former Mirror journalist who wrote many of the articles Harry identified in his testimony.</p><p>Kerr has been defending her stories and is denied using any illegitimate means to obtain information. MGN is contesting all of Harry's claims saying he lacks evidence or they've been brought too late. Harry said in court today that he would feel some injustice if he and other claimants lost their case.</p><p>We'll have to wait a while to hear the result though, the hearing is expected to go on for another three weeks or so.</p><p>Max Foster, CNN, London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: FBI agents are now in Peru for the extradition to the U.S. of the prime suspect in the disappearance of Natalee Holloway. Peru is temporarily transferring Joran van der Sloot to the U.S. to face charges of trying to extort Holloway's mother, after her daughter vanished. He's already serving 28 years in a Peruvian prison for murdering another young woman in 2012.</p><p>[00:25:11]</p><p>Holloway was last seen alive 18 years ago as she leaves in nightclub with van der Sloot and two other men in a river. Her body has never been found.</p><p>Still ahead on CNN NEWSROOM, from the gas pump to the Gulf Coast. Saudi Arabia flexing its growing influence on the world stage. We'll explain in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VAUSE: Welcome back, I'm John Vause, you're watching CNN NEWSROOM. A number of sources tells CNN federal prosecutors have told Donald Trump's legal team, the former president is a target in their investigation into how he handled classified documents.</p><p>Legal experts say it's clear -- it's a clear sign an indictment may be imminent. It's also an indication that the investigation is focused on Trump's actions, not just those around him.</p><p>Prosecutions are looking at how Trump handled sensitive material, which were found at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida after he left the White House.</p><p>FBI agents retrieved more than 100 classified documents in a search last August, almost a year ago.</p><p>The latest candidate in the Republican race in the U.S. President was asked about the documents investigation during a CNN town hall just a few hours ago, Mike Pence pulled some punches. The former Vice President said he does not want to see the Justice Department indict his former boss, arguing it would be terribly divisive for the country.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE PENCE, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're the emblem of democracy, we're the symbol of justice in the world and the serious matter which has already happened once in New York, of indicting a former president of the United States sends a terrible message to the world.</p><p>I hope the DOJ thinks better of it and resolves these issues without an indictment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Very different though during his campaign kickoff earlier in the day in Des Moine, Pence went after Trump over his actions ahead of the -- during the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol to which some protesters, a lot of them chanted hang Mike Pence, hang Mike Pence because Mike Pence refused to overturn the election results as Donald Trump has asked him.</p><p>Pence said Trump should never be president again, that if he has to choose between Trump and the Constitution, he will always choose the Constitution.</p><p>One of the most successful professional golfers on the PGA Tour is speaking out about the new partnership with the Saudi sponsored LIV Golf.</p><p>Rory McIlroy says he still needs a lot of answers, but feels the move will eventually be good for the game. McIlroy became one of the leading critics of LIV Golf when it launched a year ago.</p><p>At the time, Tiger Woods said players who joined LIV turned their backs on the organization that helped them succeed. McIlroy now says he has mixed emotions.</p><p>[00:30:12]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RORY MCILROY, PROFESSIONAL GOLFER: I still hate Liv. Like, I hate Liv. Like, I -- I hope it goes away. And I really expected that it does. It's hard for me to not sit up here and feel somewhat like a sacrificial lamb and, you know, feeling like I've put myself out there, and this is what happens. Again, removing myself from the situation, I see how this is better for the game of golf. There's no denying that.</p><p>(ENDS VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: PGA tour commissioner Jay Monahan was also very critical of Liv Golf when it launched a year ago, but he is now defending his new partnership. On the Golf Channel Wednesday, he said a lot of players were shocked by the news. No kidding. But he's trying to convince them of the positives.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAY MONAHAN, PGA TOUR COMMISSIONER: I understand the criticism I'm receiving around the hypocrisy and me being hypocritical, given my commentary and my actions over the last couple of years. I'm confident that we've done something that's in the best interest of our sport and ultimately in the best interests of PGA Tour members.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: This is clearly a win by Saudi Arabia, and it's also the latest example of the kingdom exerting its influence on the world stage. CNN's international diplomatic editor, Nic Robertson, explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): Whether it is gobbling up golf rights or signing yet another global soccer star, or setting oil price trends -- Saudi cutting production by one million barrels a day -- or in diplomacy -- Secretary of State Antony Blinken's three-day visit -- many, many roads now seem to lead to Riyadh. U.S. relations with the desert kingdom have been rocky, President Biden making democracy and human rights a core issue. But increasingly, Saudi's crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, setting his own agenda.</p><p>Blinken hoping to thaw U.S.-Saudi tensions and build on recent cooperation, hoping both Yemen and Sudan end internal conflicts. Ahead of his arrival, Blinken putting Israel on his agenda, too.</p><p>ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATES: The United States has a real national security interest in promoting normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia.</p><p>We believe that we can and, indeed, we must play an integral role in advancing it.</p><p>ROBERTSON (voice-over): Blinken's days-long visit meeting not just Saudi officials, but regional and other diplomats, too. Discussing ISIS in Africa and Asia, and likely Iran's nuclear enrichment program, as well as Russia's war in Ukraine. All point to Saudi's growing influence.</p><p>Monday the crown prince hosted Venezuela's president. Tuesday, Iran reopened its diplomatic mission in Riyadh, thanks in part to bin Salman strengthening ties with China.</p><p>Last month he hosted Ukraine's President Zelenskyy; hopes to help broker peace there one day.</p><p>Whether diplomacy or sport, MBS is thinking big. Eye-poppingly big. Listen to the Saudi private investment fund governor who bankrolled Saudi's Liv Golf tour, explain Saudis' growing influence in the world of golf.</p><p>YASIR AL-RUMAYYAN, SAUDIPIF GOVERNOR: The potential there is really big. I mean, if you look at the -- the size of golf, of monetary wise, it's about 100 billion today. And I think the growth is -- it's there.</p><p>ROBERTSON (voice-over): From Formula 1 to boxing to music festivals. MBS is reimagining his kingdom. As strange as it seems to many outside the region, outraged at the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, bin Salman is offering his population entertainment, unimaginable a decade ago, when religious conservatives he banished held sway.</p><p>At home, his re-branding of Saudi Arabia has gained traction, albeit detractors risk jail if they speak out. Significantly, however, he has yet to persuade the world he can be trusted.</p><p>Nic Robertson, CNN, London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: Pope Francis is now awake and fine, apparently, after hernia surgery. Doctors say he will remain in hospital for another ten days. The 86-year-old pontiff has been increasingly fragile in recent years, with numerous ailments. A man in Rome is CNN's Jim Bittermann. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JIM BITTERMANN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A day after Pope Francis made a surprise trip to the Gemelli Hospital in Rome, he was back in, this time for surgery. And the man who performed the operation said it all went well.</p><p>[00:35:00]</p><p>DR. SERGIO ALFIERI: The surgical operation and the general anesthesia were well-tolerated by the Papa (ph). Now he's awakened. He's fine. And he's already at work.</p><p>BITTERMANN (voice-over): It's the second time this year the 86-year- old pontiff has worried the faithful, after spending four days in the hospital in March for bronchitis.</p><p>And it's the second time he's had abdominal surgery in two years.</p><p>This year the Vatican says he was placed under general anesthesia, so doctors could repair a hernia the Vatican said was causing recurrent, painful and worsening symptoms.</p><p>Medical sources say it's probably related to the surgery that the pope had to remove half his colon in 2021.</p><p>The pontiff has been dogged with health issues for years. He often uses a cane or a wheelchair due to the pain in his right knee. He also suffers from chronic sciatica, which has caused him to cancel engagements.</p><p>As the surgery went on, the faithful and even non-Catholics showed concern.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, I'm not Catholic. But he's an important person, and he does a lot of good. And I hope he does well and that he recovers quickly.</p><p>BITTERMANN (voice-over): But the recovery period could be long. The Vatican has preventively canceled the pope's audiences and events until June 18.</p><p>Even so, afterwards, he'll need to be fully recovered, because he has big summer plants. First to Portugal in August for World Youth Day, where he'll spend a grueling four days meeting with young Catholics from all over the world and visiting the Shrine of Fatima.</p><p>And then to Mongolia at the end of August.</p><p>Jim Bittermann, CNN, Rome.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: Coming up next on CNN NEWSROOM, Disney's newest and brightest star widely praised around the world for her performance in \"The Little Mermaid.\" Everywhere, that is, except parts of Asia and South Korea. We'll explain why.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There he comes, the Iron Sheik. Right over the top and into the ring, trying to attack the Sergeant. But the Sarge beat him to the shot.</p><p>(BELL RINGING)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: It's fake, right? One of the great villains of sports entertainment, who rose to be a champion, while at the same time terrifying opponents and thrilling fans, has passed away.</p><p>WWE Hall of Fame wrestler the Iron Sheik, real name Hossein Khosrow Ali Vaziri, was 81 years old. He was born in Iran, became a central character in all of the over-the-top antics of pro-wrestling during the 1980s, winning the heavyweight championship -- they took it seriously, apparently -- in 1983.</p><p>He lost that title a month later to that other great athlete, Hulk Hogan.</p><p>Fans never tired of the Iron Sheik's cold (ph) boots, bombast and infamous Camel Clutch finishing hold. Who could ever forget the Camel Clutch?</p><p>Disney's new live-action movie, \"The Little Mermaid,\" is tanking in China and South Korea, mostly in part because of the racist backlash. People complaining on social media that Ariel is played by Halle Bailey, a black actress.</p><p>[00:40:13]</p><p>The movie has grossed less than $500 million in each country since it was released late last month.</p><p>Kristie Lu Stout now live for us from Hong Kong with more. What's going on?</p><p>KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Well, you know, \"The Little Mermaid,\" as you just mentioned, it is dramatically underperforming in these key markets, South Korea and China, the world's second largest box office, amid racist critiques and criticism out there.</p><p>The black actress Halle Bailey has been praised for her inspired, star-making turn as the main character, Ariel, in this Disney remake. But apparently, that's just not enough to win over certain would-be viewers in China and South Korea who simply can't get over the fact that Disney cast her in this part.</p><p>Now, the film has found success in many countries around the world. Let's walk through some data points for you. According to Comscore, globally, the film has made some $327 million. But China, again, the world's second largest box office, has contributed a very, very small amount.</p><p>According to Ndata (ph) -- this is a Chinese box office tracker -- in mainland China, the film made only $2.7 million in its first five days. And you have to compare that to \"Spider-man Across the Spiderverse,\" which in the same period of time brought in nearly $20 million in the first five days of its opening.</p><p>And some in mainland China have been openly sharing their thoughts and objections online. You know, one Netizen on Malyen (ph) -- this is a Chinese movie box office platform -- said, quote, \"The fairytale that I grew up with has changed beyond recognition.\"</p><p>And Chinese state media has encouraged such reactions. In, fact this op-ed that was published before the film's debut in China in The Global Times\" says this: quote, \"The controversy surrounding Disney's forced inclusion of minorities in classic films is not about racism, but it's lazy and irresponsible storytelling strategy,\" unquote.</p><p>Now, Disney declined to comment on the story to CNN.</p><p>I should add that similar reaction has been found online in South Korea, with one user there saying that the movie had been, quote, \"ruined,\" and using the hashtag \"#notmyariel.</p><p>According to the Korean film council, in South Korea, this film, \"The Little Mermaid,\" attracted some -- more data here -- 472,000 viewers in the first week, and compare that to the 643,000 fans that showed up for the latest \"Fast and Furious\" sequel over the same period -- John.</p><p>VAUSE: It's their loss.

It is understood that the men offered to work four hours a week rather than to have the furlough to go into effect, but that their offer was refused by Mr. Blazer, the company's representative. The track foremen are working now with two men, in gangs that normally have from 10 to 15 men. At the local freight transfer sheds, about 30 percent of the men are out on furlough.</p><p>Two settlements at Georgetown and Coon Hollow on South Mountain, west of Burkittsville, this county, were last night jeopardized by a forest fire that had been raging for nearly two days in Washington county. Fanned by a stiff gale the fire, according to reports last night, had spread from a point three or four miles southeast of Keedysville toward the settlements. The cause of the fire, which broke out on the farm of Lancelot Jacques, tenanted by W.E. McAfee, is unknown.</p><p>50 Years Ago</p><p>Jan. 26, 1971</p><p>Frederick County Farm Bureau was presented the 1970 Outstanding Program Achievement Award at the state organization's recognition banquet Friday at the Lord Baltimore Hotel. Outstanding results in membership, policy development, policy execution, information, Women's and Young Farmer's Committee programs were cited.</p><p>Health Department and Social Services personnel generally agree that few people understand the medicaid program, now it operates, who is eligible and what the benefits are.</p><p>20 Years Ago</p><p>Jan. 26, 2001</p><p>A controversial plan to devote $8 million in state dollars to private school textbooks drew about 30 proponents and opponents Thursday evening to a House of Delegates subcommittee hearing. Education funding is one of the few acts the Maryland constitution requires of the legislature. But Delegate Dick D'Amato, D-Anne Arundel, said the textbook program allows out of state children attending Maryland private schools to qualify.</p><p>The City of Frederick has been selected by Home Office Computing as having the best economic foundation in Maryland for home-based business. While the announcement is good news to city officials, a local attorney, who had pushed for changes to the home-based business ordinances, said the laws could be improved.</p><p>___ (c)2021 The Frederick News-Post (Frederick, Md.)

As a result, the whole world is experiencing the conspicuous problem of various types of pollution like air pollution, soil pollution and water pollution, resulting in development of numerous diseases, disorders, temperature rise, sea level rise, climate change, ecological imbalance, loss of bio-diversity, flood, destruction of ecosystems, drought, erratic rainfall and so on, causing great hardship to the peaceful and developmental life of human beings on a sustainable basis.</p><p>The main causes of environmental pollution that all know are: ill-planned industrialization, urbanization, extensive use of automobiles, excessive exploitation of natural resources, increasing population pressures, intensive and injudicious agricultural practices, injudicious use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, deforestation, forest fire, excessive use of plastics and other many sources of developmental activities capable of emitting various pollutant which are ultimately aggravating the menace of our environmental pollution. So all the issues that are creating, or are capable of creating environmental pollution, need to be understood by all human being across the world in right ways and extent and remedial fruitful actions must be implemented at the right time and place on a very sustainable basis with mass cooperation at all level.</p><p>Picture of Environmental pollution: Various national and international reports in different times are reporting the magnitude of environmental pollution and establish that ever-increasing rate of environmental pollution is a great threat to mankind and its peaceful existence with sustainable development. For example, according to WHO, nine out of ten people breathe air containing high levels of pollutants and research revealed that about 8-9% of the total disease burden may be attributed to pollution. The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization states that annually 75 billion tons of soil, the equivalent of nearly 10 million hectares, which is about 25 million acres, of arable land is lost to erosion, water-logging and salivation and another 20 million hectares is abandoned because its soil quality has been degraded. Again, the World Bank revealed that deforestation and forest degradation contribute about 12% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>It is also reported that currently, 3.2 billion people - 40% of the world's population- suffer from the continued degradation of ecosystems, for example by losing access to fertile soil or safe drinking water. According to the UN, due to the exploitation and destruction of our planet's ecosystems., every three seconds, the world also loses enough forest to cover a football pitch and over the last century we have destroyed half of our wetlands. As much as 50 per cent of our coral reefs have already been lost and up to 90 per cent of coral reefs could be lost by 2050, even if global warming is limited to an increase of 1.5C. The same organization has also opined that world loses about 4.7 million hectares of tropical forest every year, resulting not only the loss of biodiversity but also ecological imbalance and loss of valuable ecosystems. Thus, there are many facets of environmental pollution with varied dimension affecting our human existence and its civilization and its peace and progress. Thus there are many established reports or research findings which signify the menace of environmental pollution to mankind. Today, the human race is experiencing climate change, temperature rise, global warming or green house effect, soil degradation, emergence of dreaded disease, pest, and other natural calamities or disasters which have stood as great threats to our human civilization and its peaceful and safe existence of human life, besides other flora and fauna. So, one thing is very clear that we must stop or control pollution to the extent possible and will need regular fruitful intervention.</p><p>Relevance of World Environment Day: World Environment Day (WED) is celebrated annually on June 5 every year since 1974 with different suitable themes and is the United Nations' principal vehicle for encouraging awareness and action for protection of the environment and is a global platform for public outreach, with participation of over 143 countries annually for raising awareness on environmental issue such as marine pollution, human over-population, global warming, sustainable consumption and wildlife crime. As environmental pollution is a great threat to mankind and its peaceful and developmental existence with sustainability, so there is always a need to celebrate a great event like World Environment Day in true spirit. It will be a continuous event for the greater interest of mankind and its desire to fulfill various wants or needs, but it must not at the cost of environment and its resources on a unsustainable basis.</p><p>It is worthwhile to mention here that The United Nations General Assembly has declared the years 2021 to 2030 as the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration led by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) with an aim to prevent, halt, and reverse the loss and degradation of ecosystems worldwide. It also aims at reviving hundreds of millions of hectares, covering terrestrial as well as aquatic ecosystems. A global call to action, the UN Decade draws together political support, scientific research, and financial muscle to massively scale up restoration. This is really a very appreciable approach of this reputed international organization for the greater cause of mankind as the ecosystems, rather its proper use and restoration, has great or crucial role in getting a very pollution-free environment besides restoration of ecological balance, biodiversity and many more. This does not mean that we should pay due attention only in one parameter of environmental pollution. Rather, all the causes of environmental pollution must be addressed properly at the right time and place. Only then can human beings expect a very desirable and sustainable environment free of any type of pollution with its minimum affect. So, this year's World Environment Day theme also reflects the very slogan of sustainable management of environment as 'Only One Earth', giving due emphasis on \"Living Sustainably in Harmony with Nature\" where role of we human beings will be crucial.</p><p>Thus, there is ever existing essential need for a due protection, prevention and control of our earth environment from the ill-effects of environmental pollution in the world. For this we all need to understand the very danger of environmental pollution at all levels irrespective of caste, creed, or institutional or geographical boundaries and have to be successful in true sense in our war against environmental pollution with our honest, sincere, effective and dedicated fruitful efforts in the form of idea, innovation, action, skill, management, monitoring and evaluation of all efforts and actions of right policies and programme in right time and place. Otherwise, our beautiful world will be not remain fit for sustainable living with due amount of peace, prosperity and safety.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SENTIL-0058721039</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SENTIL2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65M7-P1V1-DXMP-K083-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438973</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1255\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Omega Printers &amp;

The 2019-2020 disaster was unprecedented in scale. The Gospers Mountain fire north of Sydney was the largest forest fire ever recorded in Australia, burning more than 500,000 hectares.</p><p>More aggressive hazard reduction, or controlled burn-offs that can reduce the severity of future bushfires, would make Australia safer, according to an independent panel.</p><p>However, previous research has shown that as conditions get hotter and drier, it becomes less effective. But the report wants landowners in high-risk areas to increase prescribed burning. It also said that climate change was one of many factors that made last summer \"so extraordinary\". The fires were fueled by record-breaking temperatures and a long drought across southern and eastern Australia.</p><p>New South Wales state premier Gladys Berejiklian says global warming is making the country more vulnerable.</p><p>\"The next fire season is already upon us, so the government has taken every action we can already in response to the recommendations that we received. We do also have to also accept that in addition to the issues that have been canvassed this morning, our climate is changing and those who wrote the report actually acknowledge that our climate is changing,\" Berejiklian said.</p><p>The New South Wales state government has accepted each of the panel's 76 recommendations.</p><p>The report has called for more scientific research into fighting fires, including the use of artificial intelligence and drones to help put them out quickly. It said the answer was not more fire trucks or firefighters.</p><p>Critics of the inquiry have reportedly said it was lackluster and contained no significant recommendations.</p><p>The Black Summer fires killed more than 30 people and destroyed thousands of homes.</p><p>For the first time ever catastrophic fire conditions had been forecast for Australia's biggest city, Sydney.</p><p>Ominously, the panel warned that Australia should expect to see similar conditions, or worse, to happen again.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VOAMNS-VAV8250A2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60NW-3GJ1-JCCP-00S3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468347</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"377\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Voice of America News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 25, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Country &amp;

In Kiev, the owner of an office had a shootout with security guards in an office center in the very center of the capital, the police reported. In the middle of the night, the man went into his office building, and the alarm system went off and private security arrived. The man then fired shots in their direction, injuring one security guard, and then barricaded himself in the office armed. A special police unit conducted an operation and eventually detained the offender, who turned out to be the owner of the office. Today, the first details of the shooting appeared. It turned out that the 'shooter' was Artem Babenko, the owner of the company 'Terrakot Ukraine', which is engaged in retail trade in building materials. According to the source, at three o'clock in the morning, an alarm went off in Babenko's office, and he arrived on the spot to find out what was going on. 'A few minutes later, employees of a private security firm arrived at the office. Babenko opened the front doors to the guards, introduced himself as the owner and said that the alarm had gone off accidentally. After that, the guards left, but half an hour later the alarm went off again. The same squad came to the call again, but this time Babenko did not immediately open the doors. After opening the doors, he shot at the guards with a Glock 17 pistol. One bullet hit the guard in the elbow, as a result of which he was taken to hospital. After the shooting incident, the shooter locked himself in his office. The employees of the security company reported the incident to the police, who sent a special unit of KORD to the scene. Upon arrival, the law enforcers negotiated with the man, after which he decided to surrender.</p><p>This story is not the first, and most likely not the last in a series of criminal incidents involving various Ukrainian entrepreneurs, who almost daily face coercive pressure from the authorities.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://tass.com/world/1648769\">More Explosions Heard in Ukraine's Odessa</url></p><p>According to preliminary data, the first wave of explosions sounded from 01:05 to 01:07 Moscow time</p><p>MOSCOW, July 19. /TASS/.

Photo: AFP / Gal ROMA  <br/><br/>It is estimated that over 40 square kilometres (16 square miles) of pine forest and other land are estimated to have been razed already, he said. <br/>Fifteen aircraft were assisting operations on Friday and gale force winds are expected to abate. Army clearing machinery is supporting efforts, Hardalias said. <br/> Nearly 300 firefighters battled throughout the night to keep the fire contained Photo: AFP / Louisa GOULIAMAKI  <br/>The state civil protection agency on Thursday had said hundreds of people had been evacuated from 17 villages and hamlets in the surrounding area, as well as from local monasteries. <br/> To indicate the speed of the fire, Hardalias said it had crossed 10.3 kilometres in less than five hours on Thursday. <br/>\"The fire got to within five kilometres of Megara\" on Thursday, a local resident told Skai, referring to a coastal town around 60 kilometres west of Athens. <br/> Officials said a number of properties have been destroyed in the blaze Photo: AFP / ANGELOS TZORTZINIS  <br/>\"Vineyards, cottages, crops have been burned, it's a total disaster... many of my friends have had their homes burned,\" he said. <br/>Officials said a number of properties have been destroyed, but declined to give precise figures before the fire was extinguished completely. <br/>The blaze started late on Wednesday in the Corinthian Gulf village of Schinos, apparently by someone burning vegetation in an olive grove, the civil protection agency said. <br/>Smoke from the fire choked Athens on Thursday with ash falling from the sky. <br/>The national observatory in Athens said the smoke had reached the Cycladic islands as far as Ikaria. The health ministry recommended people limit physical activity and close doors and windows. <br/>Hardalias on Friday said the Geraneia mountains fire broke relatively early in the season, around a month before Greece has scheduled to have its water bomber fleet at full strength on June 15. <br/>An equivalent fire in mid-May had occurred 20 years earlier on the island of Samos, he said. <br/>In 2018, 102 people died in the coastal resort of Mati, near Athens, in Greece's worst ever fire disaster. <br/></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767162159753787425976100228</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62R7-NXV1-JCMN-Y0CT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484255</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"569\"/><timeReceived>11:45 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 21, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC000DAPH</classCode><className>MALLINCKRODT PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS325414 BIOLOGICAL PRODUCT (EXCEPT DIAGNOSTIC) MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS325412 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>MNK (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

I am looking forward to applying a social equity and environmental justice lens to the work in our committee with the goal of ensuring our transportation system works for everyone, including underserved communities that are often overlooked,\" said Ramos, whose experience on transportation issues is extensive, having served with the U.S Department of Transportation in the Federal Transit Administration for seven years.</p><p>As part of the Policing Policy Leadership Team (PPLT), representing the Members of Color Caucus, Ramos will step down from College and Workforce Development to serve on the Public Safety Committee. The committee considers issues relating to law enforcement agencies, crime prevention, criminal penalties and sentencing, impaired driving, registration and civil commitment of sex offenders, and adult correctional programs and institutions.</p><p>Last month, the PPLT joined a Public Safety Committee hearing to review police reform proposals for the 2021 session. The archived video file is available on TVW.</p><p>\"Most law enforcement officers in our state are doing their job to protect and serve the community with integrity and honor, I have no doubt about that, and I am grateful for their service and dedication. But the instances in which that is not the case illustrate the need for accountability processes and that's what we're working on,\" said Ramos.</p><p>Ramos, whose background includes the US Forest Service in North Bend, Wash. as Director of Timber Management, Director of Recreation and Public Services, and Director of Ecosystem Management, will continue serving on the Rural Development, Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee next session.

These airports also provide essential air services, more so during this Covid-19 pandemic, including community resupply, air ambulance, search and rescue, and forest fire response.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Honourable Jim Carr, Minister and Special Representative for the Prairies and Member of Parliament for Winnipeg South Centre, on behalf of the Minister of Transport, the Honourable Omar Alghabra today announced that the Government of Canada is making important safety investments at airports in Manitoba.</p><p>Through Transport Canada's Airports Capital Assistance Program (ACAP), the Government of Canada will provide over $21.9 million to the following Manitoba airports for safety-related projects:</p><p>Flin Flon</p><p>* Replacement of sand storage shed - $287,071</p><p>* Replacement of airport beacon to better identify the airport's location to pilots at night - $16,088</p><p>Gods Lake Narrows</p><p>* Rehabilitation of airside surfaces and electrical systems - $12,872,635</p><p>Lac Brochet</p><p>* Installation of wildlife control fencing - $1,156,265</p><p>Red Sucker Lake</p><p>* Installation of wildlife control fencing - $1,000,203</p><p>Shamattawa</p><p>* Rehabilitation of airside surfaces - $6,282,716</p><p>Thompson</p><p>* Purchase of a sweeper to assist with the essential clearing of ice and snow from airside surfaces - $355,680</p><p>For 2021-2022, Transport Canada has allocated ACAP funding to 63 airports for 86 safety-related projects, including runway and taxiway repairs/rehabilitation, lighting enhancements, purchasing snow clearing equipment and firefighting vehicles and installing wildlife fencing.</p><p>Since the Airports Capital Assistance Program started in 1995, the Government of Canada has invested over $1.1 billion for 1,088 projects at 199 airports across the country.</p><p>Quotes</p><p>\"We know how vital airports are to urban centres and remote communities. The investment our government is making will help ensure continued safe and reliable airport operations for residents, many of whom depend on their local airports not only for personal travel and business, but also for community resupply of essential goods and access to routine and emergency medical care in larger centres. This is part of how we build stronger more resilient and inclusive communities across Canada.\"</p><p>The Honourable Jim Carr, Minister and Special Representative for the Prairies and Member of Parliament for Winnipeg South Centre</p><p>\"Our Government recognizes that airports are major contributors to the economic growth and social well-being of smaller communities, and local airport workers. In addition to supporting personal travel, local airports are key connectors for business, health care, social services, and emerging resource development sectors. These investments will improve access to safe, reliable and efficient air transportation options, and will help us deliver our promise to build safer, healthier and stronger communities across Canada. This is more important than ever as we work towards reopening our economies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\"</p><p>The Honourable Omar Alghabra, Minister of Transport</p><p>Quick facts</p><p>* As announced in the Fall Economic Statement (FES) 2020, the Airports Capital Assistance Program received a one-time funding top-up of $186 million over two years.</p><p>* As well, the FES announced the temporary expansion of eligibility for the Airports Capital Assistance Program to allow National Airport System (NAS) airports with less than one million annual passengers in 2019 to apply for funding under the Program in 2021-2022 and 2022-2023.</p><p>* The eligible NAS airports are: Gander; Charlottetown; Saint John; Fredericton; Moncton; Thunder Bay; London; and Prince George.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7488064 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7488064</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62R0-MS21-DYG2-R18S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"653\"/><timeReceived>9:20 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 20, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
