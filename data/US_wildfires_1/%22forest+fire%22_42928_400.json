The relief package also extends to communities struck by severe flooding at June's end.<br/><br/>Government support will target households, businesses, and local governments, alongside compensation for farmers who suffered losses in crops, forests, and livestock. The plan includes funding for infrastructure repairs and offers preferential loan options to aid recovery efforts.<br/><br/>According to the European Forest Fire Information Service, wildfires have burned roughly 418,000 hectares across Spain this summer, an area larger than the island of Mallorca. Nonetheless, Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska noted that it remains premature to provide a definitive evaluation of the overall damage.<br/><br/>Currently, 15 wildfires remain active in northwest Spain, predominantly in Zamora and Ourense provinces. Despite recent drops in temperature, firefighting operations continue to face challenges due to persistent strong winds.<br/>MENAFN27082025000045017169ID1109981823<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MNBFEN-1109981823MENAFN?Business&amp;FinanceNewsEnglish</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MNBFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GKM-5S73-RXN6-P1YK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">473759</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"258\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 MENAFN.COM All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>MENAFN - Business &amp;

A single plant can potentially produce more than 1,000 seeds.</p><p>\"The large dense stands of lespedeza become seed reservoirs,\" said Sue Myers, horticulture and conservation director for the Pittsburgh Botanic Garden.</p><p>The plant was likely introduced to the site, a former coal mine, many years ago.</p><p>Staffers first noticed it in 2022 on the site, but not in the garden. Then last year, Chinese bushclover was found in two garden areas.</p><p>\"The burn was an important and necessary experiment using a traditional land management practice that the garden had not used before,\" Myers said.</p><p>The controlled burn is only one tool to control lespedeza; they also use mowing (timed before seed set), animal grazing and natural and conventional herbicides, she said.</p><p>\"As we follow an ecological landscaping approach at the garden, all of the methods that are traditional/cultural and less toxic were our first choices,\" Myers said.</p><p>The botanic garden hoped to completely burn 8 acres in the Exhibit Garden and the Margaret Lawrence Simon Dogwood Meadow.</p><p>\"The actual burn pattern was a 'mosaic' of fire effects, with some areas burning completely while in other areas only the fine fuels burned in the garden's meadows. This was the lower grasses and thatch, leaving the standing vegetation scorched but standing,\" she said.</p><p>With unexpected dew in the morning and changing winds in the afternoon, the weather contributed to the burn pattern, she said.</p><p>Ecological landscaping</p><p>Ecological landscaping considers the ecology of a site and enhances the benefits to humans and other organisms by building healthy soils, selecting the proper plants, planting correctly, using non-toxic pest control, conserving water and mimicking natural systems, Myers said.</p><p>The Pittsburgh Botanic Garden contracted with Nature Works LLC, of Shepherdstown, W.Va., which has been carefully setting prescribed burns for more than 20 years.</p><p>\"Smokey the Bear had it wrong,\" said James Remuzzi, CEO of the company, noting that his firm receives more requests each year for the controlled fires.</p><p>Remuzzi assembled a team of nearly a dozen fire technicians with the tools of the trade - rogue hoes and rakes. They ignited the fire with drip torches and controlled it with \"fuel breaks\" - areas without vegetation to burn.</p><p>Certified firefighters employ a range of techniques to control a fire, which is simultaneously governed by the wind and topography. The goal is to safely burn an area between marked boundaries. The logistics of starting and moving a fire is to contain the blaze and get ahead of it.</p><p>Oct. 15 turned out to be a particularly breezy day. Remuzzi warned his team that the direction of the wind could change, and it did.</p><p>\"Keep an eye on where the smoke is blowing,\" he said.</p><p>Situational awareness is a constant for controlled burns.</p><p>More controlled fires</p><p>In the early 1900s, dousing forest fires became organized as blazes broke out along railroads, said Todd Breininger, the prescribed fire specialist for the state Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.</p><p>In fact, the state's Bureau of Forestry was founded to deal with wildfires, he said.</p><p>Smokey Bear, the national forest fire prevention icon, was created in the early 1900s and ignited an era of fire suppression targeting people who unwittingly started wildfires.</p><p>\"But people came to realize that fires are a good tool to manage the landscape and it's cheaper than using herbicides,\" Breininger said.</p><p>\"There's a lot more interest than years ago and now the trend is increasing for more controlled burns.\"</p><p>The Nature Conservancy, a national environmental nonprofit based in ArlingtonVa., has been using prescribed burns for more than 60 years with success.</p><p>Prescribed fires can blunt wildfire severity up to 62% by decimating combustibles like leaf litter and dead branches, the nonprofit reports.</p><p>Additionally, controlled fires promote the growth of natural grasslands and mature forests by suppressing invasive plants and undesirable woody shrubs.</p><p>\"Soon after our highly trained crews set fire to the land, the burned landscapes respond with a flush of native plants that attract birds, pollinators and other wildlife,\" according to the nonprofit's website.</p><p>A bonus is the reduction in tick populations because the fire burns leaf litter where the insects live.</p><p>Pennsylvania agencies have long known the benefits of controlled burns \u00e2\u20ac\u201c eliminating fuel for major wildfires, controlling invasive species, restoring native plants and promoting the growth of young trees.</p><p>State legislation passed in 2009 encourages safe and more controlled burns. All burn plans must be approved by DCNR with certified firefighters doing the work.</p><p>From 2010 to 2022, controlled burns increased dramatically from 56 to 441 fires. Acreage burned has also skyrocketed.</p><p>In the last few years, the number of controlled burns has plateaued at about 15,000 acres across Pennsylvania, Breininger said.</p><p>\"The reason we didn't burn more acres is that some of our weather windows weren't there - it's been too dry and too dangerous because of droughts,\" he said.</p><p>In Pennsylvania, the main driver for a controlled burn is habitat management by the Pennsylvania Game Commission and DCNR.</p><p>\"We're trying to get rid of woody plants and invasive species by knocking them down in favor of seasonal grasses and preserving field and meadow habitat,\" Breininger said.</p><p>For the state's Bureau of Forestry, controlled burns are used to promote forest regeneration, particularly better growing conditions for oak species, he said.</p><p>There are some prescribed burns in state forests to reduce the buildup of vegetation and prevent larger wildfires, which do occur but not at the scale in the western part of the country.</p><p>Future plans at the Pittsburgh Botanic Garden include more work controlling woody plants in the meadow and monitoring for new lespedeza growth early next spring. Myers plans to use more controlled burns in the future.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Scott Goldsmith Photography/Pittsburgh Botanic Garden photos: Tyler Anderson, left, Jim Gormish, Liz Curry and Greg Mackle establish a perimeter for the prescribed burn area in the Margaret Lawrence Simon Dogwood Meadow in the Pittsburgh Botanic Garden.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Scott Goldsmith Photography for Pittsburgh Botanic Garden: Fire begins to spread in the center of the Margaret Lawrence Simon Dogwood Meadow on Oct. 15.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Mary Ann Thomas/Post-Gazette: Sue Myers of the Pittsburgh Botanic Garden examines the invasive plant lespedeza, also known as Chinese bushclover, with James Remuzzi, CEO of Nature Works LLC.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Pittsburgh Botanic Garden: An aerial view of the 5-acre Exhibit Garden on Oct. 15 near the end of the prescribed burn at the Pittsburgh Botanic Garden.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Pittsburgh Botanic Garden: A crew from Nature Works LLC monitors the active burn zone as the fire gradually uses all available fuel and extinguishes naturally.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Pittsburgh Botanic Garden: An aerial view of the 5-acre Exhibit Garden on the morning of Oct. 15, about an hour before the prescribed burn was conducted.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Scott Goldsmith Photography for Pittsburgh Botanic Garden: Fire begins to spread in the center of the Margaret Lawrence Simon Dogwood Meadow on Oct. 15.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PSTGAZ-251026171212820</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PSTGAZ2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6H2F-3FD3-S123-82HR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144577</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1105\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 P.G.

FOM has released a monthly construction update for July. McIlvenna Bay has surpassed the 50% completion mark with 8% monthly completion in July, inflecting upwards from 5% in June due to forest fire delays. Surface construction continues to shift focus to installation from larger earthworks/steel/concrete work, positive for costing risk as i) these items had largely driven the May costing update and ii) with detailed engineering at 98% end of July, we think a shift to installation focus allows avenues of progress to increase into the weather-challenging winter season. While the market may be hesitant to pay for construction updates, we note a growing asymmetry in FOM shares, where at 50% completion average developer out-performance has been ~34.2% versus FOM under-performing by 29.1% since the start of construction,\" analyst Cole McGill wrote.</p><p>(MT Newswires covers equity, commodity and economic research from major banks and research firms in North America, Asia and Europe.

As a result, 24 people were arrested, mostly Venezuelan nationals, including the alleged leader of the organization.<br/>\"This subject would have come to reorganize the structure after the fall of Desa 1. Criminal behavior is dynamic, but the State responds firmly,\" said Malaver.<br/>During the operation, vehicles, technological equipment, explosives, cell phones and various documents were seized.<br/>Likewise, with the support of the Financial Intelligence Unit, 50 bank accounts were frozen and the movement of approximately 20 million soles was blocked.<br/>According to the investigations, the money originated in seven front companies that used the \"smurfing\" modality to transfer funds to Ecuador and Colombia, with final destination in Venezuela.<br/>The Minister urged citizens who have been victims of extortion to file their complaints. \"Thanks to this coup we are going to clarify several bloody facts. We need the victims to collaborate by approaching the police stations or by calling the 111 line\", he emphasized.<br/>The intervention was carried out by the Criminal Investigation Department with the participation of the Public Prosecutor's Office.

The left arm was severed and there were also cuts at the wrist. In addition, the body was missing the lower limbs, which leads to the presumption that other bags with more body parts could be found in the area.<br/>So far, the man's identity has not been established. The police indicated that he was about 35 years old and that fingerprints are being analyzed, in addition to reviewing records from security cameras in the vicinity to obtain clues to advance the investigation.<br/>Neighbors of the sector indicated that the suitcase was not in the place the day before, so it is presumed that it was left in the early hours of the morning. The area where the discovery took place is a wasteland, surrounded by factories and Sedapal treatment plants, with no nearby houses.<br/>Criminalistics agents arrived at the site to collect evidence and cordoned off the perimeter to preserve the scene. The main hypothesis is that the crime is linked to criminal gangs, although the authorities do not rule out other lines of investigation.<br/>They also confirmed that they will analyze the images captured by a nearby security camera, which could have recorded the moment when the suitcase was abandoned.<br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Public Prosecutor's Office is targeting C\u00e9sar Acu\u00f1a's administration</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Peru must recover its saving capacity to face crisis and avoid going into excessive debt</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Dina's ballast: expert's report complicates Santiv\u00e1\u00f1ez's situation</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Personal Secretary of Pope Leo XIV congratulates young people from I.E.

Second place went to Sharyn Harvey.</p><p>Minjeong Kim and Jennifer Eum, both of Langley, captured Overall Low Gross for the second year in a row with a score of 144.</p><p>Overall Low Net , with a score of 125, was won by Hope locals Diane Field and Shelley Simpson.</p><p>Other Hope winners included Tracy Macfarlane, 2nd Low Gross; Pam Testawich and Virginia White, 1st Low Net; Tammy Shields and June Lowe, 2nd Low Net; Anna Johnstad-Moeller and Pam Smith, 1st Low Gross; Inge Wilson and Deb Dixon, 1st Low Net;</p><p>and Jessica McWilliams, 2nd Low Net.</p><p>Back by popular demand, the duo Room to Dance from West Kelowna provided toe-tapping music that got everyone up and dancing after a full-course buffet on Saturday evening.</p><p>Tournament coordinator Macfarlane made a point of honouring several people in her address to the players, including past coordinator Keren Hasell who spearheaded the event for several very successful years. She also recalled two very active and dearly missed members of the Hope Ladies\u2019 Club, Alice Woods and Tama Kawase, both of whom passed away this year.</p><p>Fay Stewart continued the tradition of providing several amusing floral touches around the course.</p><p>The tournament would not have been possible without the help of over 30 sponsors as well as the many volunteers who made sure the tournament ran smoothly.</p><p>Largely due to unflagging work and support from multiple volunteers, the course has come a long way in recovering from a devastating flood in 2021. Great work from greenskeeper Mike Carrier and his crew continue to bring the course up to its full potential.</p><p>The Hope Ladies Golf Club always welcomes new players to join.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HOPEST-news20250912PQJA0004924582</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HOPEST2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GR4-8F93-RRV9-Y14W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"374\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

The Government's inter-institutional monitoring also reflects that five \"active fires\" have been officially registered this day.</p><p><br/>\"We have five 'active fires'. All are in the department of Santa Cruz,\" explained the departmental director of the National Service of Meteorology and Hydrology (Senamhi) Santa Cruz, Omar Soliz.<br/>These \"active fires\" occurred punctually in the municipalities of Ascensi\u00f3n de Guarayos (1), Concepci\u00f3n (2), Carmen Ribero T\u00f3rrez (1) and San Ignacio de Velasco (1). Santa Cruz is also the department most affected by hot spots.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HEAT SPOTS</emphasis><br/>\"At the moment we have 391 hot spots, this is information updated at nine o'clock in the morning today, September 15. Santa Cruz has the largest share with 189 hot spots; it is followed with another higher incidence by the department of Beni with 186,\" said Soliz.<br/>In addition, Pando reports eight hot spots; La Paz, five; Cochabamba, one; and Tarija also has one, according to the report.<br/>As well as immediate attention, the Government has committed to constant monitoring for the timely response to forest fires in the country. In this sense, these daily reports are made, which give signals of a persistence of fire risk in the national territory.<br/>The director of Senamhi Santa Cruz indicated that currently, regarding the risk of spreading forest fires, there are 18 municipalities in red alert, all corresponding to the department of Santa Cruz.<br/>Another 77 municipalities are in orange alert. Of this total, 20 are registered in Santa Cruz; 18 in Beni; 15 in Pando; 15 in Chuquisaca; three in Tarija; five in Cochabamba and one in the department of La Paz.<br/>\"This according to the reports issued by Senamhi and the Forest Fire Monitoring Information System,\" said Soliz.<br/>He also recalled that until Monday was in force an orange alert for rising temperatures in 40 municipalities of Santa Cruz, 19 of Beni, 15 of Pando and two of La Paz.<br/>In this way, the national monitoring continues in this dry season, which means for Bolivia a high vulnerability to fires year after year. This year, according to the Government, the impact is so far less than in 2024, however, the national emergency has been activated and Armed Forces personnel continue to be deployed to attend the outbreaks that still generate concern and risk.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-73161968</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GRW-S8K3-RXVG-24GD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"403\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 15, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0008YXD</classCode><className>EARTH &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DOAM</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTER ALERTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>ST0009XT1</classCode><className>METEOROLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>GX032</classCode><className>LA PAZ, BOLIVIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>GC501</classCode><className>BOLIVIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

That is why it is so essential to promote this State Pact, a long-range forest policy, with a long vision, to face the challenges that we already have in the present and that will unfortunately increase as a consequence of the increase in temperatures\", he warned.<br/>The President of the Government insisted that what the brigadier who \"was directly fighting the fires during this summer's fires was telling him was not a simple opinion, it is pure common sense, pure knowledge based on science and reason\".<br/>\"And I believe that this act shares this identical philosophy, because it expresses a long view, a far-reaching vision in the face of the greatest challenge facing humanity and, therefore, our country.

According to news originating from the National Institute of Ecology by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"This study investigates the impact of a large-scale forest fire that occurred in Wonamri, Toseong-myeon, Goseong-gun, South Korea, in 2019, by analyzing changes in biodiversity before and after the fire.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include National Institute of Ecology; Ministry of Environment. <br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from National Institute of Ecology: \"Using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, the study quantitatively assesses the severity of the forest fire and changes in landcover, including reductions in forested areas and expansions of grasslands. The findings reveal a significant decrease in forest area and a substantial increase in grasslands within the affected region compared to unburned areas. The study also observes the influx of new species, including endangered ones. For instance, the number of bird species increased from one to three, and mammal species rose from three to six. However, amphibian and reptile populations declined, dropping from 15 to eight species in the burned area, indicating species-specific responses to the forest fire's impacts.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"This research emphasizes the importance of understanding how forest fires differently affect various species and highlights the need for further studies to monitor biodiversity recovery and the long-term ecological consequences of forest fires.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Changes in Landcover and Biota due to 2019 Goseong Forest Fire.

In view of this, local private companies authorized by the Municipality of Urubamba will temporarily take over the tourist transportation service, according to the regional governor of Cusco, Werner Salcedo Alvarez.</p><p><br/>The measure seeks to guarantee the continuity of transportation from Machu Picchu Pueblo to the Inca citadel and vice versa, while a new bidding process is being carried out. <br/>LEE: Forest fire in Machu Picchu was controlled after two days of hard work by brigaders<br/>However, private sector tourism associations warn that doubts persist regarding the bus fleet and infrastructure, which continue to be in the hands of the companies that make up Consettur. This has fueled speculation about the possibility of these companies continuing to operate under the contingency scheme.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Protests in Urubamba</emphasis><br/>The transition has generated social tension. In the Main Square of Urubamba, a protest of Machupicchu Pueblo residents resulted in an altercation with neighbors of the province who rejected the mobilization. The protesters defended their struggle as a measure to protect tourism and questioned the mayor of Urubamba for not promoting the new bidding for the route in time.<br/>The private tourism sector expressed its concern for the uncertainty generated by the end of the contract with Consettur. Guilds warned about possible risks to the safety of visitors, the impact on the reputation of the destination and the validity of tickets already purchased. They demand urgent measures to guarantee sufficient capacity and continuity of service to the world wonder.<br/>At the same time, Congresswoman Ruth Luque Ibarra presented Bill No. 12294/2025-CR, which proposes to declare of national interest and public necessity the recovery of the Hiram Bingham route and its direct administration by the district municipalities of the province of Urubamba.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-72762958</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GNJ-3DY3-RS5H-328C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"334\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 4, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX000388</classCode><className>CONTRACTS &amp; BIDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N921000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BODIES &amp; OFFICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001915</classCode><className>TRAVEL &amp; HOSPITALITY SECTOR PERFORMANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DRDX</classCode><className>NEGATIVE MISC NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>ST0008X9C</classCode><className>GOVERNORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001175</classCode><className>MOTORCOACHES &amp; BUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001915</classCode><className>TRAVEL &amp; HOSPITALITY SECTOR PERFORMANCE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"76\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"76\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Public Contracts Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDA5QTlFMDVCQUY0NEY0NUE1QzMyQzA1QkQyQzJGRUY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjU3OTg3MUIwOTAzNDFFMDlGRTc5OEJEOUQ5NzY3RTM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzgxNjJFNTVCRjk1NDZDQThGMkVBOEU0NDQ1OUVBOEQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

of Congo's Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development, features government officials, civil society representatives and academics.</p><p>The program is part of the \"Integrated Climate Change Response Project through Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation Plus (REDD+) in Haut-Uele Province, the Democratic Republic of Congo,\" jointly implemented by the United Nations Development Program and the Korea International Cooperation Agency under an agreement between the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization and UNDP.</p><p>During their visit to KFS headquarters on Thursday, the delegation was briefed on Korea's reforestation success after the Korean War and its advanced forest disaster response system.</p><p>The agency also shared its overseas REDD+ projects contributing to Nationally Determined Contribution goals, while discussing ways to strengthen global forestry cooperation.</p><p>At the Forest Disaster Control Center, the group observed the Forest Fire Situation Control System and firefighting helicopter operations, along with the 24/7 disaster response system for fires, landslides and pest outbreaks.</p><p>They also visited the AFoCO Secretariat, the National Institute of Forest Science, the Korea National Arboretum and the Central Regional Office of the Forest Service, where they were introduced to predictive modeling, ICT-based command systems and smart forestry technologies such as thermal imaging cameras.</p><p>\"The advanced monitoring systems using AI-based ICT platforms and the command system for immediate response were highly impressive,\" said Toirambe. \"Korea's experience will serve as an invaluable reference in strengthening our disaster response capacity.\"</p><p>\"With forest disasters worsening due to climate change, international cooperation is essential,\" added KFS Deputy Minister Lee Mira. \"The KFS will continue to deepen cooperation with the Democratic Republic of Congo and jointly address climate

invitational training program for a 12-member Congolese delegation, the government agency said Sunday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The delegation, led by Toirambe Bamoninga Benjamin, secretary-general of Congo's Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development, included government officials, civil society representatives and academics.</p><p>The program, which ran from Aug. 25 to Sept. 5, was part of the \"Integrated Climate Change Response Project through Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation Plus (REDD+) in Haut-Uele Province, the Democratic Republic of Congo,\" jointly implemented by the United Nations Development Program and the Korea International Cooperation Agency under an agreement between the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization and UNDP.</p><p>During their visit to KFS headquarters on Thursday, the delegation was briefed on Korea's reforestation success after the Korean War and its advanced forest disaster response system.</p><p>The agency also shared its overseas REDD+ projects contributing to Nationally Determined Contribution goals, while discussing ways to strengthen global forestry cooperation.</p><p>At the Forest Disaster Control Center, the group observed the Forest Fire Situation Control System and firefighting helicopter operations, along with the 24/7 disaster response system for fires, landslides and pest outbreaks.</p><p>They also visited the AFoCO Secretariat, the National Institute of Forest Science, the Korea National Arboretum and the Central Regional Office of the Forest Service, where they were introduced to predictive modeling, ICT-based command systems and smart forestry technologies such as thermal imaging cameras.</p><p>\"The advanced monitoring systems using AI-based ICT platforms and the command system for immediate response were highly impressive,\" said Toirambe. \"Korea's experience will serve as an invaluable reference in strengthening our disaster response capacity.\"</p><p>\"With forest disasters worsening due to climate change, international cooperation is essential,\" added KFS Deputy Minister Lee Mira. \"The KFS will continue to deepen cooperation with the Democratic Republic of Congo and jointly address climate change.\"</p><p>By Lee Kwon-hyung (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:kwonhl@heraldcorp.com\">kwonhl@heraldcorp.com</email>)</p><p>Chung

In recent decades, as China has laid down vast networks of high-speed rail and thrown up shimmering cities, Americans have developed a deepening sense that their own country struggles to get things done. In this ambitious account, Wang, a technology analyst with a journalist's eye for color, uses studies of Chinese innovation to show how the two countries' diverging paths and pathologies can be traced to their political cultures. Chinese leaders tend to be engineers who are capable of grand projects but liable to run roughshod over individual rights. The U.S., on the other hand, has become a society of lawyers, better at miring public infrastructure in proceduralism than at creating it. China's example can remind Americans to treasure their country's pluralism, Wang suggests, while also teaching them something about how to build.</p><p>Threads of Empire, by Dorothy Armstrong (St. Martin's). Carpets are \"some of the world's greatest symbols of authority and control,\" Armstrong, a scholar of material culture, argues in this vivid history. She makes her case through profiles of twelve noteworthy specimens, including one frozen in the tomb of a Scythian chieftain; one photographed under the feet of Churchill, Stalin, and Roosevelt at the Yalta Conference, in 1945; and one crafted into a coat for a feudal Japanese warlord. The stories are fraught with violence and colonialism: Persian rugs, for instance, gained their glittering reputation in part from Victorian-era racial hierarchies. But Armstrong draws attention to the carpets' original weavers, often female and illiterate, whose artistry remains a source of awe.</p><p>God and Sex, by Jon Raymond (Simon &amp; Schuster). In this lush novel, which reconsiders the meaning of an \"act of God,\" a moderately successful writer of New Age nonfiction decides to focus his next treatise on trees. As he conducts research, he insinuates himself into the lives of an ecology professor and his wife, soon beginning an affair with the latter. The writer and the professor's wife (whose dalliances Raymond renders through a series of rather explicit coital vignettes) discover that they may have a transcendent connection, but then a forest fire seems to take the wife's life. In the wake of catastrophe, the writer's ambiguous relationship to God begins to reveal itself.</p><p>Dominion, by Addie E. Citchens (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux). This d\u00e9but novel of Southern small-town life considers the hypocrisies forged in patriarchy's crucible and the difficulty of reckoning with a father's sins. Priscilla, the proud yet put-upon matriarch of the most powerful family in Dominion, Mississippi, and a quiet teen-ager named Diamond, whose future is as uncertain as her childhood has been tumultuous, share a love for the town's golden boy, who is Priscilla's son. The young man's beauty, musical talents, and athletic prowess, however, belie volatile currents of desire and rage, which will eventually scandalize the community and unsettle Priscilla and Diamond's faiths.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWYRK-0028792X_0925_25</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWYRK2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6H03-XPV3-S378-Y4BX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">237442</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"506\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Conde Nast Publications, Inc.

According to news reporting originating in Togliatti, Russia, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"Forest fires have a significant impact on forest fauna, killing not only mammals and birds, but also less noticeable representatives of forest fauna - insects. Existing research have mainly studied the effects on vertebrate taxa, but the data on the effects of fires on the number of insects living in forests is currently insufficient to cover all the groups.\" </p><p><br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Togliatti State University, \"The research presented in this paper examines the immediate impact of forest fires on the number of adults in mosquito populations (Culicidae) in burned areas of the boreal forest. The data were collected in the boreal forests of Eastern Siberia, in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). Field survey was conducted in ten forest areas, including five recently burned and five unburned areas. Mosquitoes were caught in flight and counted during daylight hours within the time span of 7 days after the fire. We compared the data obtained from burned and unburned adjacent forest plots, which allowed us to establish the level of immediate impact of forest fires on the abundance of adult mosquito populations in the burned plots of the boreal forest. In all five pairs of forest plots, a decrease in the abundance of adult mosquitoes was noted, within the range of 86.6-93.9%. The data clearly show a lower number of adult mosquitoes for several days after the forest fire. The results obtained are of interest for further studying, regardless of the medical significance of mosquitoes, with consideration of their role in boreal ecosystems.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"This study is planned to be continued over the next few years in order to obtain new data on the impact of forest fires on mosquito populations in a medium and long term, which will allow us to form a broader vision of this problem.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: The impact of fires on mosquito populations in Eastern Siberian forests.

The dynamism and zest in human hearts, has the capacity to be a conflagration.</p><p>On the other hand, a holocaust of fervent fanatics, can paint a perfectly beautiful heaven into hell ! - a raging forest fire is a powerful force. It can be seen for miles, fuming and scalding whatever comes in its way, while looking like a million bucks ! kindling even a small campfire, can be tough, if you lack the technique. The fire in our hearts, though has to be like molten lava, oozing out in a passionate arousal, of rainbow dreams. \"chullhe agg na ghadde de vich paani, chhaddeyaan di joon buri.\"</p><p>Man has, always had the knack, of playing with fire, whether it is hearts or bullets. The thrill of looking up at the night sky, to see the fireworks, lighting up the firmament, with the \"aatish baazi\", must have started with the mughal emperor, Babar's first artillery fire in India. \"Ek aag ka dariya hai, aur doob ke jaana hai\" was perhaps the most apt summing up of \"ishq.\" Fire mesmerizes and hypnotizes, fire thrills and intrigues, making one forget that it has a burning and raging heart. The irony is that, though a tiny spark can become a smoking and throbbing fire, yet all fires go out eventually !.</p><p>Who can explain to a heart on fire to wear protective gear.? Gold has to prove its purity by the test of fire. Fire in the heart, often befuddles and bemuses the head with smoke, the same fire, both enlightens and consumes. The moth and the candle are ample testimony to this saga 'shama jis aag mein jalti hai numaaish ke liye, hum ussi aag mein gumnaam se jal jaate hain aur.\" 'bujh gayee ek aah mein sham me hayaat, mujh ko ek aah sard ne thhanda kiya - zulmat kade mein mere shab e gham ka josh hai, ikk shamma hai daleel e sahar, so khaamosh hai</p><p>Lily Swarn's Book \" A Bejewelled Tiara\" on Love And Peace published by Authors Press is available on Amazon</p><p>Lily Swarn can be reached at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:sukhish83@gmail.com\">sukhish83@gmail.com</email></p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Kashmir Images.

This fire is still active this Tuesday due to strong winds that complicate its control. The Risk Management Unit (UGR) of the Governor's Office has indicated that this situation has led to the withdrawal of personnel for safety reasons, while the brigades are reorganized to continue fighting the fire.</p><p><br/>Ramiro L\u00f3pez, head of the UGR, commented to Unitel that the decision to withdraw the teams was taken for safety reasons, since wind gusts were preventing them from operating normally. He also pointed out that on Monday work was carried out until late at night, which shows the complexity of the situation.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Support from brigades and volunteers</emphasis><br/>During the morning, brigades from the Bolivian Air Force Search and Rescue Service (SAR-FAB) and volunteer groups joined the operation. These units worked in coordination with the municipality and other institutions in order to control the flames in Tolata and prevent them from spreading to other areas.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Origin and spread of the fire</emphasis><br/>The fire originated in Sacaba and, due to the force of the winds, moved to Tolata, affecting large wooded areas. While in Sacaba the fire has been contained, in Tolata the flames are still active and the brigades are focusing their efforts on protecting nearby communities.<br/>\"It has been growing, yesterday it was quite windy and these are favorable conditions for the development of the fire. Now it is being fought from this municipality (Tolata),\" said L\u00f3pez, highlighting the difficulties generated by geography and wind.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Impact and damage assessment</emphasis><br/>There is still no official estimate of the number of hectares affected, but the authorities assure that the figure will be revealed when the fire is completely under control. This is another fire affecting Cochabamba in a few weeks, after more than 350 hectares of Tunari Park were consumed by flames at the end of August.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Causes of the fire</emphasis><br/>At the moment the causes of the fire in Tolata are unknown, although it is not ruled out that it was intentional, as has happened in other recent cases in the department.<br/>The post Fire in Tolata is still active and forces brigades to retreat due to strong winds first appeared on Peri\u00f3dico La

At that moment, a minivan stopped in front of them and immediately criminals got out with the intention of robbing them. Carranza resisted the robbery and one of the assailants shot him.<br/>The impact left him lying on the ground with a serious wound. Neighbors and family members immediately came to his aid while a patrol car from the Piedra Liza police station arrived.<br/>With the support of the officers, the wounded man was rushed to the Hip\u00f3lito Unanue hospital, where he remains hospitalized under medical observation. Doctors were evaluating the complexity of the injury to determine if surgery would be necessary.<br/>One of his sisters explained that Alex works in private security and was scheduled to travel to the interior of the country this Wednesday. She also regretted that crime is hitting citizens who are engaged in honest activities.<br/>The relative asked for guarantees so that Carranza can recover and urged the authorities to reinforce vigilance in the district, where, she said, robberies occur at any time of the day.<br/>Meanwhile, neighbors of jir\u00f3n 29 de marzo denounced that in the last few weeks robberies have increased and that the criminals move around in vehicles to surprise their victims.<br/>In view of this situation, they demanded the National Police and the Serenazgo del R\u00edmac to intensify patrols, mainly in areas where the presence of armed criminals has become constant.<br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Public Prosecutor's Office is targeting C\u00e9sar Acu\u00f1a's administration</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Peru must recover its savings capacity to face crisis and avoid excessive indebtedness</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Dina's ballast: expert's report complicates Santiv\u00e1\u00f1ez's situation</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Personal Secretary of Pope Leo XIV congratulates young people from I.E.

In the course of this operation, 10 other forest fires occurred on July 31 and on August 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 16, 17, 18 and 19 in the same area.<br/>The fires were of little importance due to the rapid intervention of the fire-fighting services, which required a permanent surveillance of the area and the withdrawal of personnel from other areas. This, as indicated by the Guardia Civil, has a \"consequent repercussion\" in the current context of large fires, where numerous troops are mobilized.<br/>Following the investigation work carried out, the Civil Guards were able to identify the alleged perpetrator of the offenses. Once the identity was known, the Civil Guard proceeded to arrest her for allegedly causing a total of 11 forest fires. The detainee, along with the actions carried out, was placed at the disposal of the Court of Instruction number 3 of Carballo.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-72324361</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GKF-M0M3-RRY6-500M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"217\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 23, 2025 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>america</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>agencias</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000959S</classCode><className>CRIMINAL OFFENSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000113</classCode><className>ARSON</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DKTF</classCode><className>SURVEILLANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000112</classCode><className>ARRESTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001932</classCode><className>CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; CORRECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>N928110MM</classCode><className>ARMED FORCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>N928110MM</classCode><className>ARMED FORCES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Constitutional Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Scope of Protection</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzQ2QkNCOTE5MDgxNDNEQkI1MzNERUY0RjQxNUYzQTM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjA3NjVGQkZGQjgwNEJFM0FBM0FGMzlCN0Q4REJGNzQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

In addition, he recalled that the country is moving forward in the preparation of elections which, under the administration of President Dina Boluarte, must be guaranteed with transparency and legality.<br/>The Minister also addressed the recent resolution issued by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights regarding the amnesty law.<br/>In this context, he warned that the Peruvian State is evaluating the possibility of reviewing its permanence within the Inter-American human rights system, as well as the substantive and procedural frameworks that regulate it.<br/>However, he indicated that this review does not mean a distancing from international cooperation. On the contrary, he stated that Peru will continue to coordinate efforts with the Office of the High Commissioner of the United Nations to advance in the protection of fundamental rights.<br/>In another moment, the Minister of Justice emphasized that freedom, independence and self-determination are principles that must be respected without external interference. He considered that this approach is essential to ensure the stability of States and the solidity of their democratic institutions.<br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Public Prosecutor's Office is targeting C\u00e9sar Acu\u00f1a's administration</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Peru must recover its saving capacity to face crisis and avoid excessive indebtedness</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Dina's ballast: expert's report complicates Santiv\u00e1\u00f1ez's situation</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Personal Secretary of Pope Leo XIV congratulates young people from I.E.

In order to encourage new players, a new division requiring no handicap was added this year for the first day of play. Players with a handicap played on both days.</p><p>Practice rounds on Friday and appetizers in the evening were followed by a putting contest won by Tracy Macfarlane sinking a long putt. Second place went to Sharyn Harvey.</p><p>Minjeong Kim and Jennifer Eum, both of Langley, captured Overall Low Gross for the second year in a row with a score of 144.</p><p>Overall Low Net , with a score of 125, was won by Hope locals Diane Field and Shelley Simpson.</p><p>Other Hope winners included Tracy Macfarlane, 2nd Low Gross; Pam Testawich and Virginia White,1st Low Net; Tammy Shields and June Lowe, 2nd Low Net; Anna Johnstad-Moeller and Pam Smith, 1st Low Gross; Inge Wilson and Deb Dixon, 1st Low Net; and Jessica McWilliams, 2nd Low Net.</p><p>Back by popular demand, the duo \"Room to Dance\" from West Kelowna provided toe-tapping music that got everyone up and dancing after a full course buffet on Saturday evening.</p><p>Tournament Coordinator Macfarlane made a point of honouring several people in her address to the players, including past coordinator Keren Hasell who spearheaded the event for several very successful years. She also recalled two very active and dearly missed members of the Hope Ladies' Club, Alice Woods and Tama Kawase, both of whom passed away this year.</p><p>Fay Stewart continued the tradition of providing several amusing floral touches around the course.</p><p>The tournament would not have been possible without the help of over 30 sponsors as well as the many volunteers who made sure the tournament ran smoothly.</p><p>Largely due to unflagging work and support from multiple volunteers, the course has come a long way in recovering from a devastating flood in 2021. Great work from greenskeeper Mike Carrier and his crew continue to bring the course up to its full potential.</p><p>The Hope Ladies Golf Club always welcomes new players to join.</p><p>Copyright 2025 Hope Standard</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HOPEST-news20250909PHS4759780</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HOPEST2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GPG-BVP3-RSM9-X07R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"378\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

AEMET noted that Aug. 8-17 marked the hottest 10 consecutive days since at least 1950, while the first 20 days of August were the hottest for that period since at least 1961. The days of Aug. 11, 16, and 17 rank among the 10 hottest days registered in Spain since 1941. Since records began in 1975, Spain has experienced 77 heatwaves. Six of these saw temperatures exceed the average by 4 degrees Celsius, with five occurring since 2019, indicating a trend toward longer and more intense heatwaves. According to the government's Daily Mortality Monitoring System, this year's heatwaves have caused 1,149 deaths. In addition, the extreme heat coincided with Spain's worst month of wildfires on record. Data from the European Forest Fire Information System show that 406,100 hectares of land, roughly 5.5 times the size of Singapore, have been burned. The fires have claimed four lives and forced over 30,000 people to evacuate. Most evacuees have since returned, but many wildfires remained active as of Sunday.

They said heavy winds six days later caused the underground fire to surface and spread above ground in what became one of the costliest and most destructive disasters in city history. </p><p>The revelations - unveiled in a criminal complaint and attached affidavit Wednesday <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-10-08/palisades-fire-arrest\">charging the alleged arsonist, Jonathan Rinderknecht</url> - raise questions about what the Los Angeles Fire Department could have done to prevent the conflagration in the days leading up to the expected windstorm on Jan. 7 and the extraordinary fire risk that would come with it. </p><p>\"This affidavit puts the responsibility on the fire department,\" said Ed Nordskog, former head of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's arson unit. \"There needs to be a commission examining why this rekindled fire was allowed to reignite.\" </p><p>He added: \"The arsonist set the first fire, but the Fire Department proactively has a duty to do certain things.\"</p><p>A Times investigation found that LAFD officials <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-02-15/lafd-should-have-had-10-engines-patrolling-palisades-hills\">did not pre-deploy any engines to the Palisades</url> ahead of the Jan. 7 fire, despite warnings about extreme weather. In preparing for the winds, the department staffed up only five of more than 40 engines available to supplement the regular firefighting force.</p><p>Those engines could have been pre-positioned in the Palisades and elsewhere, as had been done in the past during similar weather.</p><p>Kenny Cooper, special agent in charge of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives who was involved in the investigation into the Palisades fire's origin, said the blame for the fire's re-ignition lies solely with the person who started it. </p><p>\"That fire burned deep within the ground, in roots and in structure, and remained active for several days,\" Cooper said. \"No matter how good they are, they can't see that, right?\" </p><p>But, he said, wildland firefighters commonly patrol for days or weeks to prevent re-ignitions. </p><p>When he worked at a state forestry agency, he said, \"we would have a lightning strike, and it would hit a tree, and it would burn for days, sometimes weeks, and then ignite into a forest fire. We would go suppress that, and then every day, for weeks on end, we would patrol those areas to make sure they didn't reignite,\" he said. \"If we saw evidence of smoke or heat, then we would provide resources to that. So that, I know that's a common practice, and it's just, it's a very difficult fire burning underground.\" </p><p>The affidavit provides a window into the firefighting timeline on Jan. 1, when just after midnight, the Lachman fire was ignited near a small clearing near the Temescal Ridge Trail. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">12:13 a.m.:</emphasis>  An image taken from a UCSD camera, approximately two-tenths of a mile away, shows a bright spot in the upper left - the Lachman fire.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">12:20 a.m.:</emphasis> Rinderknecht drives down Palisades Drive, passing fire engines heading up Palisades Drive, responding to the fire. </p><p>That night, the LAFD, with help from the Los Angeles County Fire Department, used water drops from aircraft and hose lines, as well as handlines dug by L.A. County crews, to attack the fire, according to the complaint. Firefighters continued suppression efforts during the day on Jan. 1, wetting down areas within the fire perimeter. When the suppression efforts were over, the affidavit said, the fire crews left fire hoses on site, in case they needed to be redeployed. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jan. 2:</emphasis>LAFD personnel returned to the scene to collect the fire hoses.

Ma\u00f1ueco appeared in the regional Parliament to explain the management carried out by his government of the fires that are still burning in his community. In the community there are still four active fires of maximum risk level, and another five of level 1, although the situation has improved thanks to the weather. Finally, after several days out of control, firefighters have made progress in fighting the fire in Fasgar (Le\u00f3n). It has also improved in Galicia, which has dawned with all its fires, at least, stabilized. In Asturias, only the Ibias fire is not under control. During the early morning, the Junta de Andaluc\u00eda has declared level 1 emergency for a fire in Lubr\u00edn (Almer\u00eda), which has forced to evacuate several people. The King and Queen of Spain visit the area of Extremadura affected by the fires.</p><p><br/>Go to topNew publicationsEl Pa\u00eds<br/>Castilla y Le\u00f3n : Ma\u00f1ueco puts the number of fires that affected his community during the first 23 days of August at 348.<br/>The president of the Junta de Castilla y Le\u00f3n, Alfonso Fernandez Ma\u00f1ueco, has assured that during the first 23 days of August, his community was affected by 348 fires and has thanked \"very especially the firefighting operation of Castilla y Le\u00f3n\".<br/>Ma\u00f1ueco thanked the local, provincial and regional institutions, as well as the Government of Spain, for the resources and assistance provided during this wave of fires, although during the critical moments and with the operation itself overwhelmed, he criticized the central Executive for not supplying the means that he demanded despite the fact that he obtained unused state support... He also valued the \"fire fighting operation of Castilla y Le\u00f3n\".<br/>The senior official has pointed to \"exceptional weather conditions and an unusual heat wave with strong winds and low humidity\" to justify the multitude of fires suffered in the territory and recalled that the flames have also affected other territories or European countries.<br/>Published at: 11:20 CEST 29/08/2025 and modified at 11:20 CEST 29/08/2025 Juan Navarro<br/>Ma\u00f1ueco: \"What is happening is too important and too real to make political calculations\".<br/>The president of the Junta de Castilla y Le\u00f3n, Alfonso Fern\u00e1ndez Ma\u00f1ueco, has begun his statement by lamenting the personal and material damage in the fires that have ravaged the region: \"Our land has been hit by a tragedy that has reaped lives, razed land and villages, reduced homes to ashes and snatched hope from many families. The true tribute to those who have lost everything is to raise this debate to the level of the dignity of our people, away from simplism and electoral calculation\".<br/>The president has assured that he wants a debate away from politics: \"What is happening is too important and too real to make political calculations\". Ma\u00f1ueco added that he would have preferred to appear in the Cortes once the wave of fires had ended. <br/>Published at: 11:14 CEST 29/08/2025 and modified at 11:17 CEST 29/08/2025 El Pa\u00eds<br/>The fire is out of control for several days, but the fire is still burning in Fasgar.<br/>The night work, with backfires, have allowed progress in the work of extinguishing the fire Fasgar, technically linked to Ig\u00fce\u00f1a, and according to the Junta de Castilla y Le\u00f3n, is getting to stop it after several days out of control by wind effect.<br/>After 21 days of fighting the flames, the Junta has indicated in a message through social networks that the technical fire has managed to close tonight its advance towards the valley of the Oma\u00f1a river, and although \"there are small columns of smoke, the clouds can be seen at the top\", although there is still work ahead.<br/>Thus, the situation seems to be improving in the Fasgar fire, which yesterday was the one that presented the most unfavorable evolution in all Spain, for being aggressive and unpredictable, and the town of Espina de Tremor, towards which it was heading, seems to be free of danger, as well as Tremor de Arriba.<br/>Thus, with no evacuated localities in El Bierzo at the moment, work continues with intensity in the area in order to take advantage of the weather conditions. A humidity of 80% and the drop in temperatures, in addition to the forecast of rain, could give a turn to a fire that has put in check Colinas del Campo and continues to burn at altitudes above 2,000 meters, with headwinds.

However, the means displaced to the area remained to continue the work to extinguish it.<br/>The notice of the fire was received at 12.59 hours on Thursday, after some dry bushes began to burn near a mountain and the fire spread rapidly to a forest area. After affecting a hillside, it spread to an area of pine trees.

Among them are several forest firefighters who lead the chants against Ma\u00f1ueco and his Minister of Environment, Juan Carlos Su\u00e1rez-Qui\u00f1ones, whom they call for resignation. They also cry out about their unstable working conditions while waving their batfuegos.<br/>Published at: 10:18 CEST 29/08/2025 and modified at: 10:21 CEST 29/08/2025 El Pa\u00eds<br/>Luis Planas, in the Senate: \"If the PP summons us so soon, it is a sign of confidence in the Government\".<br/>The Minister of Agriculture, Luis Planas, has ironized with the haste with which he has been summoned to the Senate by the PP to account for the management of fires as far as his department is concerned. \"I believe that if we have been summoned so soon by the Popular Party, it is a sign of confidence in the Government, of confidence in what we have done since June 2018,\" he said in his initial intervention in the Agriculture Committee.<br/>In this sense, he has stated that it still seems to him \"hasty to take stock\" of the damage caused by the fires \"at this time\". Planas has argued that \"only when they are extinguished\" will be able to \"make an accurate and rigorous assessment\" of the damage and \"give a response that is appropriate\". He also explained that he was \"surprised\" when he received the request to appear in the commission \"because it is still a necessary moment of work and priority to extinguish the fires\".<br/>Planas has shown \"admiration and respect\" for those who are working in extinguishing the fires and has expressed his \"solidarity and support to all the families and friends of the victims, the injured and the members of the Military Emergency Unit, injured this week and who are convalescing\". He also wanted to send a message of support to the rest of the injured and affected, \"to all those affected in our rural world, particularly our farmers and ranchers\".<br/>Published at: 10:04 CEST 29/08/2025 and modified at: 10:11 CEST 29/08/2025 El Pa\u00eds<br/>The fire in Lubr\u00edn (Almer\u00eda) could have been caused by a power line.<br/>The forest fire declared last night in the place of Las Cubillas, in Lubr\u00edn (Almer\u00eda), which has forced to activate the emergency phase 1 of Plan Infoca and the preventive eviction of about twenty residents in the municipality of B\u00e9dar, may have originated from a fault in a power line, according to municipal sources.<br/>The fire started after 23.00, when the single emergency telephone 112 of Andalusia began receiving calls from individuals who alerted of the presence of a fire in the area of Barranco Mu\u00f1oz, in Lubr\u00edn. Immediately mobilized the Civil Guard, Fire Department, Local Police and Infoca troops, who moved terrestrial means to the site. At dawn support aircraft have been added.<br/>The mayor of Lubr\u00edn, Domingo Ramos (PSOE), explained that in the town center of the town there have been no incidents, although it has lived \"a night in suspense\" in the neighborhoods of El Marchal and Campico de las Moletas, where the flames approached. \"In the core of Lubr\u00edn there is no problem. In the Alcarria is more or less controlled, which is where the fire started, in the place of Barranco Mu\u00f1oz. But in the area of the two cores right now are the media trying to extinguish the fire, \"he said.<br/>On the causes, Ramos has indicated that several neighbors point to a power line as a possible origin. \"They have seen that it was sparking and possibly has been the reason for the fire,\" he said.<br/> The alderman has recalled that the municipality has a group of rapid assistance that usually arrives in just five or ten minutes to the outbreaks and has managed to quell small fires on other occasions, although in this case it was impossible. \"It was terrible, at night and in an area with huge vegetation,\" he added.<br/>The mayor of Lubr\u00edn has stressed that this is the third fire suffered by the municipality so far this summer and has described the summer campaign as \"very complicated\".<br/>The fire also forced to act in the neighboring municipality of B\u00e9dar. Its mayor, Angel Collado (PSOE), explained that everything pointed to the flames would enter the municipality, which led to order the eviction of two small neighborhoods, with about 20 people in total. \"Finally, the wind stopped and has not affected us. This morning, first thing, we have told the neighbors that they could return to their homes,\" he said. Collado has admitted that the population lived moments of tension during the night, which have reminded the great fire of 2012. \"We had a difficult time, even though everything pointed to the fact that it was not going to affect us,\" he said.(EFE)<br/>Published at: 09:51 CEST 29/08/2025 and modified at 09:51 CEST 29/08/2025 El Pais<br/>The Minister of Agriculture appears in the Senate<br/>The Minister of Agriculture, Luis Planas, appears at this time in the Senate to account for the management of fires as it concerns his department.

Thursday was a favorable day in the fight against the fire, although the reactivations are still worrying, especially in Fasgar. In Galicia, all fires were, at least, stabilized. In Asturias, likewise, only the one in Ibias remains active.<br/>On the other hand, this Friday will appear in the Parliament of Castilla y Le\u00f3n its president, the popular Alfonso Fern\u00e1ndez Ma\u00f1ueco, much criticized for his management of the fires. The Kings, meanwhile, visit Extremadura, another of the communities affected by the wave of fires.<br/>Published at: 07:41 CEST 29/08/2025         </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-72528802</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GM8-88C3-RX18-S02R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2215\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 29, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Espa\u00f1a</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Incendios</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Emergencias</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Incendios forestales</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Incendios forestales intencionados</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Bomberos</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Castilla y Le\u00f3n</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Andaluc\u00eda</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Galicia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Extremadura</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DVSL</classCode><className>EMERGENCY EVACUATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>ST000A2MQ</classCode><className>CASTILE AND LEON, SPAIN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>ST000A2MJ</classCode><className>EXTREMADURA, SPAIN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000A2MK</classCode><className>GALICIA, SPAIN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST000A2MA</classCode><className>ANDALUSIA, SPAIN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000A2MC</classCode><className>ASTURIAS, SPAIN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GT115</classCode><className>EUROPE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC325</classCode><className>SPAIN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

According to news reporting from Socorro, New Mexico, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Deploying thousands of sensors across remote and challenging environments-such as the Amazon rainforest, Californian wilderness, or Australian bushlands-is a critical yet complex task for forest fire monitoring, while our backyard emulation confirmed the feasibility of small-scale deployment as a proof of concept, large-scale scenarios demand a scalable, efficient, and fault-tolerant network design. This paper proposes a Hierarchical Wireless Sensor Network (HWSN) deployment strategy with adaptive head node selection to maximize area coverage and energy efficiency.\" </p><p><br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, \"The network architecture follows a three-level hierarchy as follows: The first level incorporates cells of individual sensor nodes that connect to dynamically assigned cell heads. The second level involves the aggregated clusters of such cell heads, each with an assigned cluster head. Finally, dividing all cluster heads into regions, each with a region head, directly reports all the collected information from the forest floor to a central control sink room for decision making analysis. Unlike traditional centralized or uniformly distributed models, our adaptive approach leverages a greedy coverage maximization algorithm to dynamically select head nodes that contribute to the best forest sensed data coverage at each level. Through extensive simulations, the adaptive model achieved over 96.26% coverage, using significantly fewer nodes, while reducing node transmission distances and energy consumption.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"This facilitates the real-world deployment of our HWSN model in large-scale, remote forest regions, with very promising performance.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Hierarchical Early Wireless Forest Fire Prediction System Utilizing Virtual Sensors.

These three communities account for 97% of the area affected in August. The remaining 10,000 hectares are distributed in the rest of the autonomous communities that have had some fire episode during August.<br/>Of this figure, 325,000 hectares correspond to large forest fires, fires of more than 500 hectares, which means that 97% of the area affected was precisely due to these large forest fires. The forested area affected is 128,350 hectares, almost 40% of the area affected by the fires.<br/>In the case of the Natura 2000 Network, the area burned by forest fires amounted to 146,190 hectares, i.e. 43% of the area burned.<br/>Critical areas have also been affected for the survival of more than 350 species in danger of extinction, vulnerable or in some protection regime according to the LESPRE list, species such as the urugallo, species such as the brown bear, the lynx or the black stork.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-72798807</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GNS-2DH3-RRWT-K2VT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"331\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 5, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>america</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>agencias</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

With this, the 45 people evicted preventively who were in the camping Mougas and could return to the facilities. However, some of them have stayed at the Santa Tecla campsite, in A Guarda.<br/>On the other hand, in Vilaboa, 14 people were evicted in the core of Paradellas.<br/>In the province of Lugo, Situation 2 was activated in Carballedo due to the proximity of a forest fire to the population center of Oleiros. Thus, and also as a preventive measure, the Os Peares shelter was evacuated. A total of 53 children and 11 monitors were transferred to the Lug2 youth hostel.<br/>In Ourense no new confinements or evacuations have been recorded and all main roads remain operational.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-72287338</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GJS-G0W3-RRVG-823C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"213\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 22, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>america</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>agencias</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000CA23</classCode><className>CAMPING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>ST000A2MK</classCode><className>GALICIA, SPAIN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"76\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"76\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>Finance</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjMzOTBBRTg2MUVDNDdDNUE1M0QxNDk1RERCNjNCN0I7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>Ordinances &amp; Regulations</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjQ1MzRDRUY1OTZBNDRDNTlDODQzRDRCMUFCNDc2RTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>Employees &amp; Officials</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDNCMDQzRTY3RDY3NDNEOEE4RDg2OUFEOTRBNDREQzg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Real Property Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUUyRTcxRURBNEY2NEE2MDk3QzBCNzRDOEY0NTZDQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDMzNTc4RDQzQUI0NDJGODhFNUIyNUFEQzVDNkRGQTM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUVBNzBGMzM3NUY1NEExQjg1QTUxRTZCRjA1QTU1NDk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

To find a year with worse figures of hectares burned would have to go back to 1994, when 437,602.50 hectares burned.<br/>For the moment, the third vice-president and minister for Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge, Sara Aagesen, has put the number of hectares burned up to August 10 at 138,000, although she has warned that the data will foreseeably get worse since these numbers do not include the area burned by the fires that are currently active in a large part of Spain.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-72288808</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GJS-G0W3-RRVG-82KT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"205\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 22, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>america</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>agencias</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00099QF</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GT115</classCode><className>EUROPE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GR169</classCode><className>SOUTHERN EUROPE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC325</classCode><className>SPAIN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>Transition Reports</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0Y4NzUwRTkwOEM4NDJERTkyOTExN0Q0RDM3MjcyQkU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkMxQkJCRDI5RkRBNDQxOThGQzcyMzYxOTVCRjRGQUU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

According to the county's chief fire officer, Jonathan Dyson, there were almost 20 explosions as the fire burned through the vegetation, detonating hidden antique weapons.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> The fire, which started on August 11, has affected around 25 square kilometers in the picturesque coastal region of North Yorkshire, according to the American newspaper CBS News. Teams of firefighters, farmers and rangers are working with water tanks, tractors and firebreaks to try to contain the blaze and protect nearby areas, including farms and sheep pastures.<br/> Part of the affected area had been a tank training camp in the 1940s, which explains the presence of the ammunition. Nearby, the RAF Fylingdales radar station is still in operation.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Take a look:</emphasis><br/><br/> The British Ministry of Defense confirmed that an explosives deactivation team found \"several items of unexploded munitions from the Second World War\", classifying them as \"inert projectiles for practice\". Faced with the risk, firefighters adopted a defensive strategy to protect their teams.<br/> The scale of the fire is unusual for the north of England, traditionally marked by frequent rainfall. This year, however, an exceptionally hot and dry spring and early summer left the moors completely parched.<br/> The North York Moors National Park, which covers more than 1,480 km\u00b2 of rolling hills, includes coastal villages and towns such as Whitby, a popular tourist destination.
