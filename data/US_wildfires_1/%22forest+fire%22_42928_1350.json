Forest fires are natural phenomena, yet studies show they are becoming more widespread, consuming larger areas of forest each year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Natural ignitions occur as a result of lightning strikes in the growing season,\" said Virginia Tech fire ecology and management expert Adam Coates. \"Fire is part of Earth's natural landscape. It has been part of the ecosystem for millennia. In fact, we now know that indigenous peoples utilized fire for a variety of purposes, even burning in the dormant season.\"</p><p>Factors causing unnaturally high numbers of forest fires</p><p>\"In the 2020s, many factors have contributed to create an environment in which forested lands are inundated with a lot of dense vegetation that under ideal circumstances would have been managed and removed, thus supplying a lot of material that can catch on fire,\" Coates said.</p><p>\"Even forests that were once intentionally planted in the 1920s to reclaim abandoned agricultural lands, for example, are often dense and in need of thinning,\" he said. \"Additionally, invasive species can and do play a large role in some wildland fires, contributing both to the total amount of fuel available to burn and in some cases altering the overall flammability of the vegetation.</p><p>\"A lot of that vegetation is interconnected starting at the forest floor and stretching all the way to the canopies of the trees. We call that a 'ladder effect' for fuels we have basically allowed a vertical structure to be built that once a fire starts on the ground it can very easily and very quickly escalate to the tops of the trees.</p><p>\"Coupled with longer periods of time that are hotter and drier, we have all of this vegetation rapidly drying out, increasing the probability of ignition. Once those materials ignite, they often create large wildfires that are difficult to suppress,\" Coates said.</p><p>\"High winds, dry fuels, and low relative humidity are a recipe for extreme fire behavior, particularly in steep or rugged terrain. Wildfires in grasslands and shrublands can be hard to contain, also, because those fuels often produce large flames and spread rapidly with just minor fluctuation in wind speed and direction.</p><p>\"In the United States, most large wildfires have occurred during times that are really dry. Many of the ignitions have also been aided by winds that have amplified the burning conditions,\" he said. \"Though we often think of wildfires as a problem in the western U.S., more and more ignitions are occurring in other locations. Currently there is a large fire in Malibu, California, but we've seen large fires in Canada, New Jersey, New York, and even Virginia over the last several years.\"</p><p>Using fire to prevent fires</p><p>\"The controlled application of fire by a team of fire experts, or prescribed fire, makes for one of the most powerful tools we have available to reduce hazardous wildfire ignitions, not only by reducing hazardous fuel loads, but also altering fuel structure in ways that minimize the possibility of fires starting on the forest floor and spreading to the canopies of trees, creating crown fires. Many threatened and endangered plants and animals benefit from landscapes that are frequently burned with low intensity and low severity prescribed fires,\" Coates said.</p><p>Tips for homeowners</p><p>\"Individuals should be cautious when selecting and maintaining vegetation around their homes. They should also be aware of the entrances and exits of their neighborhoods because it is potentially problematic for roads to be narrow with only one way in and one way out. Individuals should also be aware of conditions that may be noted by Red Flag Warnings where outdoor burning of any kind is prohibited,\" Coates said.</p><p>\"Excellent materials for individual homeowners and homeowners' associations can be found online at Fire Adapted Communities, Firewise USA and the Virginia Department of Forestry's Daily Fire Danger Rating page.\"</p><p>About Coates</p><p>An Associate Professor of Wildland Fire Ecology and Management in the Department of Forest Resources and Environmental Conservation for Virginia Tech's College of Natural Resources and Environment, Adam Coates researches the impacts of wildland fire on ecosystem processes and properties. That focus intersects with topics such as restoration ecology, fuels, fire behavior, silviculture, soils, wildlife habitat, and water quality.

Born in 1930, Jim Chizek, retired Wisconsin conservation warden, number 73, had lived his entire life in Wisconsin. Before working as a state warden, he was raised on a dairy farm in northern Wisconsin, worked as a logger, and on various jobs in railroading. After serving in the Marine Corps during the Korean War, he returned to the northern part of the state, where he married Shirley Plyer in Phillips.</p><p><br/><br/>In 1955, he began his career in conservation, working in various parts of the state under the tutelage of experienced wardens and spent one winter on snowshoes surveying winter deeryards for the state game division, where he saw many starving and dead deer.<br/><br/>He served eleven years as a field warden at Portage before accepting a promotion to district warden stationed at Park Falls, supervising the law enforcement effort of three northern counties. He was seriously injured in a car accident while working deer shiners in the fall of 1968. Taking a job in the chief warden's office in the capital city of Madison, doing budget and planning and undercover law enforcement, he retired in 1986 after thirty-one years of service.<br/><br/>Beginning his writing career after retirement, he successfully published two books: Game Warden Centurion and Protectors of the Outdoors. He also wrote freelance for several magazines and for the Wisconsin Outdoor News, a conservation newspaper. Intrigued by the tragic fire in Northeast Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in 1871, he now wrote The Night Peshtigo Died. His writings are faithful to the scene, time, cause, and the human suffering of the firestorm dubbed the Peshtigo Fire.<br/><br/>Jim Chizek, in his novel, depicts the struggles of the people of Peshtigo, based on actual happenings before, during, and after the disastrous Peshtigo Fire of October 8, 1871.<br/><br/>As East Coast timber was depleted, a demographic shift to the huge pinery along the Great Lakes began. With New England Yankees and new European immigrants finding able work in logging, came disastrous forest fires taking not only forests but also many new logging communities, sometimes with human casualties. With the depletion of the forests also came the extinction of many species of wildlife, including the passenger pigeon and the monk parakeet.<br/><br/>On October 8, 1871, occurred the worst forest fire in American history. Never has there been so much human suffering and loss of life as with the Peshtigo Fire. Because the Peshtigo Fire happened on the same day as the disastrous Chicago Fire, the little-known wilderness area received very little of the infamous notoriety of the fire in Illinois. The Peshtigo Fire was a firestorm with tornadoes of fire that far surpassed that of the Chicago Fire in deaths and suffering of this community. It consumed approximately 1,200,000 acres, with the culmination of deaths far exceeding most estimates of 1,500-2,500, along with twenty-three scattered villages of Menominee, Pottawatomie, Stockbridge, and Chippewa that were burned in the wilderness area.<br/><br/>The story is of a typical family's dream of the time attempting to eke out a living in a wilderness area by utilizing the natural resources that they believed were so enormous they could never be depleted.<br/><br/>Suffering after the fire was much greater due to the seriousness of burns and depravity, followed by those who suffered financial losses and loss of family and friends. The fire left very few survivors to identify the remaining, as the countless homeless were to face the fast-approaching cold Midwest winter. Survivors of the fire and their kin have honored the suffering of that terrible day with many memorials, consecrating the ground where they perished.<br/><br/>Published by Christian Faith Publishing, Jim Chizek's new book is an essential work for those interested in American history, environmental disasters, and the resilience of communities in the face of unimaginable tragedy.<br/><br/>Consumers can purchase \"The Night Peshtigo Died\" at traditional brick &amp; mortar bookstores, or online at Amazon.com, Apple iTunes store, or Barnes and Noble.<br/><br/>For additional information or inquiries about \"The Night Peshtigo Died,\" contact the Christian Faith Publishing media department at 866-554-0919.</p><p>Contact Information:<br/><br/>Christian Faith Publishing<br/><br/>Media Department<br/><br/>800-955-3794<br/><br/>Contact via Email<br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.christianfaithpublishing.com\">www.christianfaithpublishing.com</url></p><p>Read the full story here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pr.com/press-release/941673\">https://www.pr.com/press-release/941673</url><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRCM-0066573726</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRCM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G4N-3G83-S7H0-248D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389193</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"777\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 PR.com, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>PR.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"CBBB\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 27, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply.

This investment is projected to expand engineered wood products capacity by 10 million cubic feet, positioning Weyerhaeuser to seize greater market share in the growing housing sector. While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.</p><p>Shareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program</p><p>Following completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.</p><p>Maintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges</p><p>Weyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.</p><p>Strengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility</p><p>The company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.</p><p>Capital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing</p><p>Management refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.</p><p>Focused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency</p><p>Excluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.</p><p>Expansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth</p><p>Weyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.</p><p>Unlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures</p><p>The announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.</p><p>Timberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base</p><p>Management advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.</p><p>Operational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures</p><p>Initiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.</p><p>Proactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities</p><p>Reserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties. By maintaining adequate coverage for contingent liabilities, Weyerhaeuser bolsters its balance sheet resilience. However, potential over-reserving may tie up capital unnecessarily and requires vigilant management assessment.</p><p>Prioritizing Workforce Stability Amid Labor Market Tightness</p><p>Recognizing a 4.1% unemployment rate as a constraint, Weyerhaeuser focused on hiring and talent retention across its segments. Stability in workforce availability ensures operational continuity and supports management's strategic initiatives. However, rising labor costs remain a potential margin-pressure risk-a critical area to monitor for sustained profitability.</p><p>SECTION 6 TODAY'S BULLISH SIGNALS</p><p>6.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield</p><p>Dividend Yield &gt; 2/3rd Bond Yield:</p><p>The dividend yield of 3.33% is 0.83 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.03%; it is also above the benchmark of 2/3rd set by Benjamin Graham. </p><p>(All figures in %)</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_8\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"480\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"144\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Dividend Yield</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">3.33</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Bond Yield</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">4.03</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Spread</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.7</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>The Dividend Yield of 3.3% is better than the Index average of 1.9%</p><p>- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 3.3%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the S&amp;P 500 Index of 1.9% is 173.4%.

According to news originating from Agriculture and Forestry University by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"Forest fires are recurrent natural hazards threatening ecosystems, biodiversity, and nearby communities. The Chure Tarai Madhesh Landscape (CTML) is a biodiversity hotspot harboring endangered species of flora and fauna.\" </p><p><br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Agriculture and Forestry University: \"The increasing severity of forest fires in this region has raised immediate concerns, yet research remains limited. This study explores synergistic approaches for forest fire risk mapping using a knowledge-based model (Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP)) and data-driven models (Random Forest (RF) and Boosted Regression Tree (BRT)). This study utilized eleven conditioning factors and assessed model accuracy using the ROC curve and multiclass error matrix. The results demonstrate low multicollinearity among factors and a robust FAHP consistency ratio of 0.03. The RF model outperformed with an AUC of 0.95 and an overall accuracy of 0.91. The study revealed an increasing seasonal trend in fire incidents, with the western region showing heightened vulnerability.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The RF, BRT, and FAHP models classified landscape forest areas as highly susceptible to fires; 47.85%, 33.25%, and 50%, respectively, with fourteen out of thirty-six districts of CTML were at heightened risk of wildfires. This holistic approach to fire risk assessment aids in creating more impactful fire risk management plans and provides a foundation for automated fire risk assessment.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Synergistic approaches in forest fire risk mapping using fuzzy AHP and machine learning models in the Chure Tarai Madhesh Landscape (CTML) of Nepal.

Could I be rich and famous from reality TV stardom if an HBO Max/Go/Now crew had documented pioneer trek?</p><p>Trek, for those who may not know, is a tradition(?), occasional activity(?), curse(?), wherein large groups of church youth ages 14-18 are organized into \"families\" and a smattering of adult leaders are designated as \"ma's\" and \"pa's.\" Together, they dress in pioneer garb - including suspenders and bonnets - and travel to desolate locations to pull handcarts through windstorms and recreate the misery our faith's early pioneers undoubtedly felt crossing the plains to Utah in the mid-1800s.</p><p>I participated in trek, under duress, during the summer between my junior and senior year of high school and it remains one of the strangest and most difficult things I've ever done. Not as strange and difficult as some other trek experiences I've heard, which include having to kill a live turkey for food and burying dolls on the side of the trail to represent the pioneers who did not make the journey. Luckily, we had plenty of food and zero Cabbage Patch doll burials. But it was still was not fun or easy. And I wish I had fame or fortune or both to show for it, like the \"Back to the Frontier\" families surely will.</p><p>According to the \"Back to the Frontier\" official trailer, the featured families will be handing over their devices, removing their makeup, and living in log cabins for an unspecified amount of time. </p><p>And that's all good and brave, I guess, but I do believe these families are missing out on a key aspect of the trek experience, which is the bus ride from Provo, Utah, to Nowhere, Wyoming, that lasts roughly 90 hours.</p><p>For me and my fellow travelers, this bus ride featured a group of teen boys throwing Lunchable meat slices at the windows and watching them slowly slide down the glass, leaving a trail of bologna slime behind. For my seatmate, it featured waking up to a mouth full of M&amp;amp;Ms after he had fallen asleep and those same bologna-tossing boys had poured candies into his open mouth. And it all happened on a school bus. Not one of those fancy charter buses with carpeted floors and seats. A regular old yellow, numbered bus with vinyl seats that our skin would have stuck to if we hadn't been covered from literal head to toe in pioneer garb in the July heat.</p><p>But that's fine, you don't <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">need</emphasis> the bus ride to make compelling television, I guess. You do, however, absolutely need some good human drama. According to the \"Back to the Frontier\" trailer, that drama will come from families being forced to share a bed, use a latrine, and harvest crops for meals. Child's play.</p><p>I want to see them live among hordes of teens whose only commonality is a shared congregation and being forced to spend three days in Wyoming pulling handcarts. In my experience, these circumstances led to at least one fistfight between teen boys over reasons I cannot remember but probably were very stupid, quite a few tears shed, some from dust in our eyes and others from emotional pain, and one forest fire near-miss at the hands of a boy who had brought matches in his pocket for some reason. All on the first day. Shakespeare WISHES he could write a plot so compelling.</p><p>Also, the families on \"Back to the Frontier\" appear to arrive on set in covered wagons, not pulling handcarts, and that kind of passenger princess behavior, again, isn't really doing justice to the pioneer experience. Or at least the 2003 version of it. </p><p>You can't call yourself a trekker until you've thrown on a pair of gardening gloves because that's all you could find while packing and pulled a handcart along a dusty trail in violent winds. I did this, for three days, alongside the bologna-throwing kid who happened to have been assigned to the same \"ma\" and \"pa\" as I was. He actually turned out to be pretty nice. Which just goes to show, you can't judge a book by its lunch meat.</p><p>In all sort-of-seriousness, I wish the \"Back to the Frontier\" families luck, because while I don't believe they'll have it as hard as me and my 2003 peers did, life without technology or flushing toilets is still tough. And they deserve to be rewarded handsomely for their efforts. Even if I wasn't.</p><p>What I did get at my trek's completion was more mosquito bites than I had previously believed the human body could tolerate. A sandwich and a Gatorade for the 117-hour bus ride home. An appreciation for the pioneers' long walk across the plains. And the comfort of knowing that I will never again have to ride a bus to Wyoming or pull a handcart through dusty winds.</p><p>Unless, of course, HBO Max/Now/Go calls and promises fame and fortune. In which case I might do it again. But only if the bus is carpeted. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DESNWS-httpswwwdeseretcomopinion20250712backtothefrontierissortoflikepioneertrekonlywithhboscameras</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DESNWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G80-HD63-RW36-T121-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164282</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"903\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Deseret News Publishing Co.

The smoke eventually lessened, but it caused widespread unhealthy air quality in the United States throughout the spring and summer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are signs that this summer could bring a similar problem, as June 2025 brings hazy skies and air quality concerns in some areas.</p><p>The bad news: Smoke likely will be an ongoing health hazard across North America for the next few months.</p><p>\"Communities across both Canada and the United States should stay informed about air quality advisories and be prepared for potential health impacts related to smoke exposure,\" atmospheric scientist Djordje Romanic of McGill University told USA TODAY in an e-mail June 4.</p><p>Some good news</p><p>The circumstances that led to the smoky chaos of 2023 were unique.</p><p>Canada didn't just break its wildfire records that year, it obliterated them. Nearly 58,000 square miles of the nation burned - an area about the size of Illinois - in more than 6,500 wildfires coast-to-coast from April to October, according to revised numbers from the Canadian Forest Service.</p><p>And weather patterns acted in a complex dance to redirect that smoke to the United States.</p><p>\"Not at the same time, but one weather pattern would be succeeded by another weather pattern that were responsible for transporting smoke across Canada and the United States,\" Romanic said.</p><p>2025 looks not as smoky</p><p>So far this year, wildfires in Canada have burned nearly 7,685 square miles, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.

According to news reporting originating from Bayreuth, Germany, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Wildfire risk increases following non-fire disturbance events, but this relationship is not always linear or cumulative, and previous studies are not consistent in differentiating between disturbance loops versus cascades.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Bundesministerium FuR Umwelt. <br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from University of Bayreuth: \"Previous research on disturbance interactions and their influence on forest fires has primarily focused on fire-prone regions, such as North America, Australia, and Southern Europe. In contrast, less is known about these dynamics in Central Europe, where wildfire risk and hazard are increasing. In recent years, forest disturbances, particularly windthrow, insect outbreaks, and drought, have become more frequent in Central Europe. At the same time, climate change is influencing fire weather conditions that further intensify forest fire dynamics. Here, we synthesize findings from the recent literature on disturbance interactions in Central Europe with the aim to identify disturbance-driven processes that influence the regional fire regime. We propose a conceptual framework of interacting disturbances that can be used in wildfire risk assessments and beyond.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"In addition, we identify knowledge gaps and make suggestions for future research regarding disturbance interactions and their implications for wildfire activity. Our findings indicate that fire risk in the temperate forests of Central Europe is increasing and that non-fire disturbances and their interactions modify fuel properties that subsequently influence wildfire dynamics in multiple ways.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Synthesis and Perspectives on Disturbance Interactions, and Forest Fire Risk and Fire Severity in Central Europe.

Ongoing dry, windy conditions prompted the Confederated Salish &amp; Kootenai Tribes Division of Fire to elevate the danger level from moderate to high on Tuesday.</p><p>\"Yes, it's early for fires,\" said fire information officer C.T. Camel. \"The above normal temps have vegetation curing already.\"</p><p>He noted that this type of fine, dead fuel is the primary carrier of fire in the wildland, and when fires get established in this type of fuel they can quickly spread out of control.</p><p>The Foust Slough fire on the west side of the Flathead River across from Moiese burned around 60 acres and was believed to have been started last week by an unattended campfire. In Sanders County, the Banana Lake Fire north of Plains had consumed more than 900 acres by Tuesday morning and was 15% contained.</p><p>If a small fire becomes a full-blown forest fire, it could lead to arson charges, fines and even the bill for all fire-caused costs, warns Camel.</p><p>\"We just want people to be careful when recreating and working in the outdoors,\" he said. \"Put your campfires dead out, secure your trailer chains, don't target shoot in dry areas, don't drive vehicles in tall grass, and don't burn debris on windy days.\"</p><p>In fact, CSKT restricted outdoor burning on the reservation starting Wednesday, June 4, and won't allow it to resume until Oct. 1, after fire season subsides.</p><p>The rest of the state is also gearing up for a potentially intense fire season. During a fire briefing held with Gov. Greg Gianforte Monday, fire management professionals predicted significant wildfire potential in western Montana in July, expanding to central and eastern Montana in August and September.</p><p>Drier, warmer conditions have already begun, with Missoula posting a record-setting high of 94 last Saturday. Temperatures in Polson are expected to reach the 80s by this weekend and hit 91 by Monday.</p><p>Polson Rural Fire also chimed in with a recent social media post noting \"unless we see some changes in the weather pattern, we are looking at a potentially devastating wildfire season.\"</p><p>Tips for coping with the season ahead include signing up for Lake County's automated alert system that can instantly reach homeowners in the event of an emergency.

Such is the case with two graphics, powered by satellite data, that showcase a Canadian wildfire season off to a wild - and scary - start. Twice a day a NASA satellite sends images to the ground, giving a real-time view of where fires are burning. </p><p>This is especially useful for remote areas where no sensors are stationed. As of Tuesday, that satellite had picked up four times as many fire hot spots across Canada than is typical for early June. That's more than any year since the satellite began transmitting in 2012, except 2023, according to data from Global Forest Watch. Though the satellite has recorded thousands of hot spots so far this year, that does not mean there are actually that many active fires. Each hot spot could be detected repeatedly over the course of days. And because each detection is about the size of 26 football fields, it can represent part of a much larger blaze, said James MacCarthy, wildfire research manager at Global Forest Watch. Based on data from the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, about 200 fires are actively burning in Canada and have consumed about 7,700 square miles of terrain, most of it in the last week. Only 2023 saw such high numbers so early in Canada's fire season, which runs from April through October. That year, wildfires burned a record 67,000 square miles - more than twice the surface area of Lake Superior, the largest of the Great Lakes. Taken together, the hot spots and acres burned mean 2025 is the second-worst start to the season in years. \"A warm and dry finish to May and early June has created a significant fire season,\" said Liam Buchart, a fire weather specialist with the Canadian Forest Service. The weather conditions are made more likely by climate change and encourage wildfires to start. That means even though 90 percent of wildfires in Manitoba this year have been human-caused, according to the provincial government, climate change helps enable their spread. \"Climate change is creating the conditions that make it more likely that human-caused fires are going to spread, or even start,\" MacCarthy said. \"It might be a human starting it, but it's going to spread quickly because now there's hot and dry conditions that are occurring more frequently and more intensely than they have in the past.\" The hot and dry weather is likely to to continue for at least the next week across Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, according to Natural Resources Canada. The agency's forecasts also call for \"a warmer and drier than normal July and August for large portions of Canada,\" Buchart said. \"The remainder of the fire season looks to remain above normal, especially over the northern prairie provinces and southern British Columbia,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-000001974078da2aa9bf4e792f550000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G60-2TS3-RS7N-M40J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"476\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 5, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

On the 4th of September 2025, Weyerhaeuser released presentation materials for investors, emphasizing its commitment to disciplined capital allocation and sustainable practices.</p><p>The company set forth several key targets, including a significant $1 billion investment in timberlands by 2025. Additionally, Weyerhaeuser aims to grow its annual EBITDA from natural climate solutions to $100 million and increase lumber production by 5% each year. These targets reflect Weyerhaeuser's focus on fostering growth while prioritizing environmental sustainability.</p><p>Weyerhaeuser also reiterated its leadership in Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance, with a goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2040. Furthermore, the company is committed to maintaining robust shareholder returns through a sustainable dividend policy. The recent analyst rating on Weyerhaeuser stock (WY) is a Hold, with a price target set at $28.00.</p><p>According to Spark, TipRanks' AI Analyst, Weyerhaeuser's overall stock score indicates a stable financial position, backed by strong cash conversion capabilities. However, the company faces challenges in revenue and profit growth, and technical analysis suggests a lack of momentum in the stock. Despite these hurdles, Weyerhaeuser's strategic initiatives and commitment to shareholder returns remain positive indicators for investors.</p><p>As the largest private owner of timberlands in North America, Weyerhaeuser operates across various sectors, including timberlands, real estate, energy, and natural resources. The company manages 10.4 million acres in the U.S. and licenses an additional 14 million acres in Canada, emphasizing sustainable forestry practices and carbon solutions.</p><p>Press Release article 2 of 13, 288 words </p><p>September 02: Weyerhaeuser Concludes Sale of Princeton Lumber Mill to Gorman Group</p><p>Weyerhaeuser Company has completed the sale of its lumber mill in Princeton, British Columbia, to the Gorman Group. This transaction, initially announced in May, includes the transfer of Weyerhaeuser's associated timber licenses in British Columbia, which are expected to be finalized in the coming months, subject to regulatory review and customary closing conditions.</p><p>As part of the sale, Weyerhaeuser received approximately $60 million USD upfront, with additional proceeds tied to the transfer of the timber licenses. The company has recognized a gain from the sale but anticipates a tax liability of about $11 million USD as a result of the transaction. This sale reflects Weyerhaeuser's ongoing strategy to optimize its operations and focus on its core business areas.</p><p>Established in 1900, Weyerhaeuser is among the largest private owners of timberlands worldwide, managing approximately 10.4 million acres in the U.S. and additional public timberlands in Canada. The company is recognized for its commitment to sustainability, operating all its timberlands in compliance with internationally recognized forestry standards. In 2024, Weyerhaeuser reported net sales of $7.1 billion and employed around 9,400 people globally.</p><p>The Gorman Group, a family-owned business founded in 1951, operates multiple divisions in Southern British Columbia and northern Washington state, employing about 900 individuals. The company is well-regarded for its high-value lumber products, particularly in the home finishing and renovation markets.

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply.

This investment is projected to expand engineered wood products capacity by 10 million cubic feet, positioning Weyerhaeuser to seize greater market share in the growing housing sector. While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.</p><p>Shareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program</p><p>Following completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.</p><p>Maintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges</p><p>Weyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.</p><p>Strengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility</p><p>The company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.</p><p>Capital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing</p><p>Management refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.</p><p>Focused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency</p><p>Excluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.</p><p>Expansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth</p><p>Weyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.</p><p>Unlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures</p><p>The announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.</p><p>Timberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base</p><p>Management advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.</p><p>Operational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures</p><p>Initiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.</p><p>Proactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities</p><p>Reserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties. By maintaining adequate coverage for contingent liabilities, Weyerhaeuser bolsters its balance sheet resilience. However, potential over-reserving may tie up capital unnecessarily and requires vigilant management assessment.</p><p>Prioritizing Workforce Stability Amid Labor Market Tightness</p><p>Recognizing a 4.1% unemployment rate as a constraint, Weyerhaeuser focused on hiring and talent retention across its segments. Stability in workforce availability ensures operational continuity and supports management's strategic initiatives. However, rising labor costs remain a potential margin-pressure risk-a critical area to monitor for sustained profitability.</p><p>SECTION 6 TODAY'S BEARISH SIGNALS</p><p>Price/Earnings of 46 &gt; Building Materials &amp; Fixtures sector (of 24 stocks) avg of 24.8:</p><p>- The price-to-earnings ratio of 46 indicates overvaluation compared with sector average of 24.8 and market average of 24.4.</p><p>6.1 3-DAY: MODERATE MOMENTUM DOWN </p><p>WY dips 1.0% on average volume 0.97 times average.

Here, we model relationships between satellite observations of fire radiative power (FRP) and contemporaneous fire weather index, and then we project how FRP is likely to change under near-term warming scenarios. The models project widespread growth in FRP, with increases expected across 88% of fire-prone areas worldwide under 1.5 \u00b0C warming. Projected increases in FRP were highest in the Mediterranean biome and Temperate Conifer Forest biome, and increases were twice as large under 2 \u00b0C warming compared to 1.5 \u00b0C. Disaster-prone areas of the wildland-urban interface saw an average of 3.6 times greater projected increases than non-disaster-prone areas, suggesting wildfire impacts will intensify most in regions already vulnerable to dangerous wildfires. These findings emphasise the urgent need to anticipate changes to fire behaviour and proactively manage wildland-urban ecosystems to reduce future fire intensity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The intensity of wildfires is projected to rise across 88% of global fire-prone areas under 1.5\u00b0C warming, with the largest increases expected in wildland-urban interfaces already prone to disasters, based on modelled fire radiative power in response to projected fire weather.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>Climate change has increased extreme fire weather globally1, leading to larger, more intense, and more destructive wildfires2, 3\u20134. Fire intensity, measuring the rate of energy released by the combustion of organic matter5, is a critical feature of changing fire regimes because intensity influences the degree to which fires can be suppressed, as well as their effects on ecosystems, societies, smoke exposure, and carbon emissions6, 7, 8\u20139.</p><p>Some regions have experienced increases in fire radiative power (FRP)\u2014a proxy of fire intensity often used by remote sensing studies (e.g.10)\u2014over the last two decades. This includes a global trend of increasing FRP at night11, as well as regional increases in FRP in southern Australia, western North America, and most boreal forests12. The number of energetically extreme fire events has more than doubled this century globally, with the six most extreme years occurring since 201713. Recent fire disasters with extraordinary property damage and loss of life (e.g., Los Angeles 2025, Valparaiso 2024, Lahaina 2023) have drawn sharp focus on the problem of intense fire intersecting the wildland-urban interface\u2014the area where human development meets wildlands14. There is already strong evidence that fire regimes are changing and that fire weather will continue to increase with warming temperatures15,16, but there is little understanding of how changes in fire weather will affect both fire intensity and exposure of the wildland-urban interface (WUI) to intensifying fire around the world7.</p><p>To address this gap, we developed statistical models of the FRP of active fires observed by MODIS satellites from 2000 to 202317, and then projected fire intensity under relatively near-term climate projections. We focused on warming of 1.5 \u00b0C above preindustrial levels, corresponding to approximately the next decade or two18, and 2 \u00b0C. These scenarios represent an additional 0.48 \u00b0C and 0.98 \u00b0C above the period 2000\u20132023, respectively. They reflect a realistic decision horizon for vegetation management and planning, distinct from abstract, end-of-century predictions, such as the frequently used high-end emissions scenario that involves &gt;4 \u00b0C warming by 210019. Predicting near-term conditions also has the benefit that vegetation types and human distributional patterns will be broadly similar to those under which our models of FRP were fitted. This is important because forecasting longer-term vegetation is plagued with uncertainty due to intrinsic climate-vegetation-fire feedbacks20, uncertain effects of increasing fire frequency such as interval squeeze21, land cover change from human activities, and the contrasting effects of CO2 fertilisation and atmospheric drying on plants22,23. Short-range projections obviate these uncertainties, as well as longer-term uncertainties in climate models and the emissions pathway we ultimately take.</p><p>To project fire intensity, we fit generalised additive mixed-effects models (GAMs) of FRP as a function of contemporaneous Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI)24, while accounting for other environmental variables that likely influence fire intensity (tree cover, leaf area index, slope, biome, biogeographic realm, ecoregion). FWI is a numeric rating of the influence of weather on fire behaviour calculated from consecutive daily observations of temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and precipitation24, and has been widely used to evaluate fire weather and risk around the world (e.g.1,25,26). Based on the statistical relationship between FWI and FRP, we then projected FRP under future fire weather. Future FWI was estimated using a pseudo climate change experiment that involved perturbing historical FWI values (2000\u20132023) by monthly pattern scaling27 as derived from the multi-model median of 20 general circulation models (Supplementary Table 1). After projecting future fire intensity, we intersected maps of the estimated change in fire intensity with a recent map14 of the WUI, allowing us to identify geographic concentrations of human exposure to increasing fire intensity over near-term horizons most relevant to decision making28.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Results</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fire weather increases fire intensity</emphasis></p><p>Fire weather was positively associated with fire intensity in all biomes, but response curves varied in steepness and curvature among biomes (Fig. 1). GAMs explained on average 30% of the deviance (range: 20\u201342%) in FRP, and FWI improved model fit for each biome (Supplementary Fig. 1). The steepest responses to FWI occurred in regions well-known for intense fires with high socio-economic costs7,29, most notably, the Temperate Broadleaf Forest biome in Australia and South America, the Temperate Conifer Forest biome in North America, and the Mediterranean biome globally (Fig. 1). These steeper response curves imply that increases in fire weather may have more pronounced effects on fire intensity in those regions compared to regions with flatter response curves. The best-performing models (Supplementary Fig. 1) consistently revealed different effects of FWI at day and night, with nighttime FRP consistently lower (Supplementary Fig. 2). The best-performing proxy of fuel load varied by biome, with FRP best explained by leaf area index in seven biomes and by percent tree cover in the remaining six biomes (Supplementary Fig. 1).Fig. 1</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fire weather index (FWI) is positively associated with fire radiative power (FRP).</emphasis></p><p>Lines show the fitted responses (\u00b195% CI) from the GAMs, with all other predictors held at their realm-specific means. Panels are ordered from largest to smallest effect of FWI, measured by the difference between the maximum and minimum predictions of FRP in response to FWI. Lines show the fitted responses for daytime FRP, but see Supplementary Fig. 2 for a comparison of day and night responses to FWI.

Increases were most pronounced outside the tropics (Supplementary Fig. 3), with the Mediterranean biome projected under 2 \u00b0C to have an additional 7.7 days per year above FWI93 (Supplementary Fig. 4). We focus here on FWI93 because it reflects potentially dangerous fire weather that would occur in most fire seasons (25th worst day in a year) and has been shown to be associated with energetically extreme fire events7, but see Supplementary Fig. 6 for a comparison of other FWI percentiles.</p><p>Under the FWI projections, our models project that 88% (+1.5 \u00b0C) and 89% (+2 \u00b0C) of fire-prone (see Method) areas on Earth are likely to experience statistically significant increases in fire intensity (i.e., lower confidence bound for the projected difference &gt; 0), while holding other predictors unchanged. Under 1.5 \u00b0C warming, FRP projections increased by a global mean of 0.69 MW/pixel (1%), with increases as large as 29.7 MW/pixel (7.1%) in the temperate broadleaf forests of South America. Increases were largest in the boreal forests, western North America, southern Amazonia, southern South America, Mediterranean Europe, southern Africa and southern Australia (Fig. 2b).Fig. 2</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Increasing fire weather under climate change will lead to increasing fire radiative power.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> Projected fire radiative power from the GAMs under FWI93 for the period (2000\u20132023) aligning with the MODIS active fire data. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis> The difference between projected FRP under FWI93 historical (2000\u20132023) and FWI93 with 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C warming above preindustrial levels (0.48 \u00b0C and 0.98 \u00b0C above 2000\u20132023).

The substantial increase from 1.5 \u00b0C to 2 \u00b0C highlights the importance of every prevented increment of warming. Substantial parts of these regions, such as the Amazon rainforest and boreal forests, contain intact forests of immense natural value with major carbon stores, while the remainder include the juxtaposition of flammable wildlands and urban areas (i.e., the WUI).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Near-term increases in fire intensity in the wildland-urban interface</emphasis></p><p>Intersecting a map of the WUI14 with projected increases in fire intensity (Fig. 1c) identified several regions already known for their relatively high incidence of socially disastrous wildfires29\u2014namely western North America, Chile, South Africa, Mediterranean Europe and southern Australia\u2014as loci of substantial change (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 7). In support of this pattern, increases in projected fire intensity under 1.5 \u00b0C warming were 3.6 times larger at 159 WUI locations (reported by Cunningham et al.29) that have experienced major socioeconomic wildfire disasters from 1980 to 2023 compared to other areas of the WUI globally (mean of 2.42 MW/pixel vs 0.67 MW/pixel; two-sample Wilcoxon test <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.00001; Fig. 3g).

See Supplementary Fig. 7 for 2 \u00b0C warming.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Discussion</emphasis></p><p>Fire intensity is rising in some ecosystems11,12, making fires more destructive and difficult to control. Our analysis provides near-term projections of likely changes in wildfire intensity globally, suggesting that fire intensity will rise across most of the Earth\u2019s fire-prone areas under warming scenarios of 1.5 \u00b0C\u2014roughly reflecting the coming decade\u2014and 2 \u00b0C. These changes were not evenly distributed, with the largest increases in FRP projected for regions that contain highly flammable ecosystems, such as the Mediterranean biome and the Temperate Conifer Forest biome. The Wildland\u2013Urban Interface, as the locus of major wildfire disasters, is of profound importance for human adaptation to extreme wildfires14,30, 31\u201332. Regions of the WUI already known for wildfire disasters29 were projected to see disproportionate intensification of fire compared to other areas of the WUI, potentially amplifying the impacts of fire in places where consequences are already severe. These projections match emerging evidence of recent anomalous fire seasons or events, including in western Amazonia, Australia, Canada, Chile, France, Greece, Hawaii, Portugal, Siberia and the western United States3,4,33, 34, 35\u201336.</p><p>It has been widely reported that fire weather will continue to increase with climate change15,16, and our findings provide important new knowledge on how such changes will likely manifest in fire intensity. This can help focus attention on where fire behaviour, rather than fire weather, will change most. For example, although fire weather is projected to increase by a similar magnitude across the boreal forests (Supplementary Fig. 3), our models project that fire intensity will increase by a larger amount in North American boreal forests than European or Siberian boreal forests (Fig. 2b, c; Supplementary Fig. 5), aligning with analysis that suggests European boreal forests are less sensitive to changes in climate37.</p><p>Although expected, projections of increasing fire intensity are concerning because fire suppression becomes increasingly difficult as fire intensity increases, pushing fires closer to exceeding suppression capacity38,39. While the projected increases may seem relatively modest, they are increments added to fires that are already difficult to contain. Because FRP is only expressed for fires that have already ignited, the projections of FRP must be interpreted as conditional on the presence of an ignition. If climate change, as expected, also drives changes in other aspects of fire regimes, such as ignition probability15 and rate of spread40, this means the projected increases in fire intensity are likely to occur alongside other changes that also make fires more difficult to control. Taken together, there is the very real risk that effective fire suppression is currently masking the potential for very destructive fires because such changes in already hazardous locations may push systems past critical thresholds, leading to disproportionate increases in damage41.</p><p>Beyond suppression, increasing fire intensity will likely lead to increasing carbon emissions because fire intensity is directly proportional to biomass burned6. This is in line with an emerging trend of increasing carbon combustion efficiency42 and emissions per unit area from fires43. It is also likely that intensifying fires will be more ecologically destructive. Our results are likely conservative because they focus only on changes to fire weather. If other climate-related effects act independently of fire weather and lead to higher fuel loads\u2014such as CO2-driven increases in primary productivity22, drought-induced tree mortality23, or windthrow44\u2014then we might expect larger increases in fire intensity than those projected here.</p><p>We used the MODIS active fire dataset because it is the longest-running dataset on fire radiative power, indicating increases in energetically extreme fire events13 and increasing nighttime fire intensity11 over the last two decades. Active fires detected by MODIS can be substantially smaller than the 1 km2 pixel17, meaning there is inevitably some noise in matching fires to environmental variables. Future research could refine the spatiotemporal scale of analysis, thereby reducing various uncertainties. For instance, newer, finer-scale datasets of FRP, such as VIIRS (375 m resolution), should allow for tighter spatial matches between fires and land use. Moreover, newer geostationary satellites allow for higher temporal resolution linkage between fire intensity and weather, including using (e.g., hourly) fire weather indices based on regional climatologies (e.g., the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index in Australia45). Such finer-grained analyses will also better characterise fireline intensities and more precisely resolve the effectiveness of mitigation and suppression efforts. As distinct from event-specific forecasts, which may be better modelled by fire propagation models, our outputs offer projections that can be used to anticipate and plan for broad-scale changes in future fire regimes over the coming decades.</p><p>Our results provide a global perspective on likely human vulnerability to extreme wildfire, thereby focusing on adaptation and mitigation strategies. We find that wildfire intensity will likely continue to increase in the near term, especially in already-vulnerable regions of the WUI, as well as regions with vast carbon stores such as the boreal and Amazon forests. Any increases in fire intensity in already-problematic regions will likely amplify the effects of fire, making fires that are already difficult to control even more so. This points to a critical research and development frontier in fire science and mitigation: managing ecosystems to reduce the intensity of wildfires46. Doing so will require major socio-ecological adaptation and innovation, including increasing the use of low-intensity prescribed fire and other preventative mitigation measures47,48, allowing fires to burn under moderate conditions if it is safe to do so38, and incorporating the wisdom of Indigenous use of low-intensity fire49, at scales ranging from individual properties to broader landscapes50.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methods</emphasis></p><p>The general workflow, including data processing, modelling, and projection, is summarised in Fig. 4.

The MCD14ML product provides point locations of wildfire \u2018hotspots\u2019 at a resolution of 1 km, along with a measure of each hotspot\u2019s fire radiative power (FRP; megawatts). FRP has been widely used as a proxy of fire intensity and is very highly correlated with the rate of fuel mass combusted6. Hotspot locations represent the centre of a 1 km pixel that was identified as containing a fire somewhere within the pixel. We omitted observations flagged in the MODIS dataset as likely resulting from non-fire sources, and for additional robustness, we selected only high-confidence fires (i.e., confidence &gt; 50)17.</p><p>To explain and project the FRP of individual hotspots, we compiled 7 explanatory variables that we expected would influence fire intensity (Table 1). Six of these variables measure static and dynamic features of the environment, including slope, biogeography (biogeographical realm and biome), and proxies of fuel load (percentage tree cover, leaf area index).

FWI is a numeric rating of estimated fire intensity, calculated from consecutive daily observations of temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and 24-h precipitation24. The Canadian FWI system has been widely used in analyses of fire risk and fuel moisture around the world (e.g.25,26,53). FWI was calculated using daily summaries of maximum temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and 24-h precipitation from ERA5 reanalysis54.</p><p>For each hotspot in the MODIS record between 2000 and 2023, we extracted FWI on the day of the fire and extracted temporally dynamic vegetation variables in the nearest year. Because the full MODIS dataset was excessively large for statistical modelling (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = ~103 million observations), we sub-sampled the dataset to reduce its size while ensuring broad spatial coverage; for 1-degree grid cells that had more than 500 hotspots, we randomly sampled 500 hotspots (separately for daytime and nighttime hotspots), and we retained all observations for grid cells that had fewer than 500 hotspots. This process ensured that all 1-degree grid cells containing a hotspot, which we consider the fire-prone Earth, were retained for analysis, while not unduly skewing the analysis to grid cells with superabundant data. While this threshold itself is arbitrary, it ensured a tractable amount of data for analysis, resulting in a dataset with 8.98 million hotspots used for model fitting.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Statistical modelling of fire radiative power</emphasis></p><p>We constructed generalised additive models (GAMs) that explained the fire radiative power of hotspots using the mgcv package version 1.9-155. GAMs are like generalised linear models, except they can flexibly model non-linear effects, making them well-suited to revealing thresholds and non-linearities, such as whether there are thresholds of fire weather above which fire intensity increases sharply. We fitted the GAMs using the log-link Gamma distribution, which is well-suited to modelling positive, continuous, right-skewed data, such as FRP. We fitted separate GAMs for each biome because we expected fundamentally different relationships in each. For each biome, we fitted six competing models (see Supplementary Fig. 1 for model formulas), with the most complex model taking the form:where <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">f</emphasis>1 indicates a smooth function of logFWI, differing for each combination of realm and day/night; <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">f</emphasis>2 is a smooth effect of logSlope; <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">f</emphasis>3 is a smooth effect of proxies of vegetative fuel (either %tree or LAI, transformed per Table 1); realm is a categorical effect that allows each realm to have its own baseline; satellite is a categorical term used to control for the effect of the different overpass times of the Terra and Aqua satellites; and day/night is a categorical effect of whether a hotspot observation occurred during the day or night, during which we would expect differences in intensity. Random intercepts for ecoregion were included to account for possible differences in fire intensities among ecoregions within each biome, and random intercepts for each 1-degree grid cell were included to account for other unmodelled local effects on fire radiative power and control for likely similarities in hotspots occurring in the same cell.</p><p>To prevent overly complex (i.e., wiggly) response shapes, the complexity of smooth functions was restricted in line with our a priori expectations (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis> = 5). Furthermore, to prevent overfitting, we fit the model using thin plate regression splines with additional smoothing penalties, allowing the term to be shrunk to zero if there is no evidence for an effect55. Models were ranked based on their explanatory power by comparing the deviance explained by each (Supplementary Fig. 1).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Projecting fire intensity under near-term climate projections</emphasis></p><p>Using the best-performing model for each biome, we projected FRP under near-term projected fire weather. Fire weather index was projected using a pseudo climate change experiment approach that perturbs the observed daily temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and precipitation using climate model results. Specifically, we apply a pattern scaling approach27 that scales local changes in each climate variable to first-order changes in climate as in prior studies7,56. We used 20 climate models participating in CMIP6 (Supplementary Table 1) that had daily maximum temperature, minimum relative humidity, precipitation, and 10-m daily mean wind speed. For each model we calculated differences in monthly mean variables aggregated to a common 1-degree horizontal grid between the 1850\u20131900 quasi-preindustrial baseline using historical forcing and 2041\u20132070 using SSP2-45 forcing. Monthly scale factors were defined as the differences between the two periods divided by the difference in global mean temperature. These patterns assume a linear response between local changes in climate for each variable and the amount of global warming and allow us to recast projections relative to the amount of global warming in a scenario-agnostic way. While this approach does not capture attributes of changing variability, it provides a sensible way to perturb observed meteorological forcing that can be seamlessly compared with the observed record. We recalculate FWI using the same procedures using the perturbed meteorological data for +1.5 \u00b0C and +2 \u00b0C, representing 0.48 \u00b0C and 0.98 \u00b0C above the period 2000\u20132023.</p><p>Based on the modelled relationships between FRP and FWI, we projected FRP under near-term FWI. Specifically, we used the GAMs to project FRP on 93rd percentile FWI for the period 2000\u20132023, and with 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C warming above preindustrial conditions. This threshold of FWI93 represents the ~25th worst FWI day in an average year, reflecting potentially dangerous fire conditions that would occur in most fire seasons. This threshold corresponds with the fire weather coinciding with a majority of energetically extreme fire events7. In addition to focusing on FWI93, we also provide a supplementary comparison of projected FRP on FWI95, FWI97.5 and FWI99. We produced maps of the difference (megawatts) between projected daytime FRP under historical weather and FRP under the warming scenarios at a resolution of 0.09\u00b0 (~10 km).</p><p>To characterise human exposure to increasing fire intensity, we intersected the map of change in FRP with a map of the wildland-urban interface and intermix in 202014, considering those sub-categories together as the wildland urban interface (WUI). Furthermore, to evaluate projected change in FRP in disaster-prone areas of the WUI, we used the locations of major disasters reported by a systematic analysis of major disasters from 1980 to 202329, defined as events that caused 10 or more fatalities or the 200 largest economic events relative to a country\u2019s gross domestic product at the time. From these events, we selected those intersecting the WUI (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 159 disasters). We used a two-sample Wilcoxon test to compare projected change in FRP at these disaster-prone locations with the rest of the WUI.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reporting summary</emphasis></p><p>Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>This research was funded by the Australian Government through an Australian Research Council Laureate Fellowship (FL220100099) awarded to DMJSB, which also supports CXC and GJW.

As platforms like Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, and X (formerly Twitter) govern the flow of information through opaque algorithms and profit-driven content curation, societies worldwide face the dual challenge of platform domination and information disorder. Traditional regulatory and educational frameworks have struggled to respond effectively to these transformations. As a result, media literacy has emerged as a strategic and necessary policy response to empower citizens, especially youth, with the critical skills needed to navigate, interpret, and engage responsibly with digital content.</p><p>This article explores media literacy not merely as a pedagogical tool, but as a crucial element of democratic resilience and information governance. It traces the evolution of media literacy from its early focus on broadcast media to its current relevance in algorithmically structured and socially networked environments. The article argues that media literacy policy must be robustly integrated into national education systems, public institutions, and platform accountability frameworks. Drawing on international case studies\u2014including Finland, Canada, and the European Union\u2014the discussion highlights successful policy approaches that address both the cognitive and civic dimensions of media literacy. However, it also emphasizes the limitations of isolated initiatives and the need for holistic, inclusive, and culturally adaptive strategies. In conclusion, the article proposes a multi-stakeholder roadmap for advancing media literacy policy in the digital age. This includes government leadership, platform cooperation, educational reform, and the active engagement of civil society. Only by embedding media literacy into the core of democratic policy responses can societies mitigate the harms of information disorder and reclaim agency over their digital environments.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Harry-Peter/publication/393786924_Media_Literacy_Policy_as_a_Response_to_Platform_Domination_and_Information_Disorder/links/6879f64bf312d71d78c82702/Media-Literacy-Policy-as-a-Response-to-Platform-Domination-and-Information-Disorder.pdf\">https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Harry-Peter/publication/393786924_Media_Literacy_Policy_as_a_Response_to_Platform_Domination_and_Information_Disorder/links/6879f64bf312d71d78c82702/Media-Literacy-Policy-as-a-Response-to-Platform-Domination-and-Information-Disorder.pdf</url></p><p>The Industry</p><p>Canadian and French media producers strengthen partnerships and open new paths for transatlantic content</p><p>Back to all press releases \u2013 25/3/2025</p><p>TORONTO, March 25, 2025 \u2014 France\u2019s Union Syndicale de la Production Audiovisuelle (USPA) and the Canadian Media Producers Association (CMPA) today announced their joint delegation of producers from France and Canada, participating in a dedicated mission to explore coproduction opportunities for drama and documentary projects.</p><p>The delegation will first travel to Series Mania in Lille, France, and then head to Paris, where participants will meet with potential collaborators, as well as commissioners, studio execs, and other industry leaders, equipping themselves with the tools for future partnerships. The initiative aims to strengthen bilateral connections between French and Canadian producers, with a focus on the development of new English-language television series across genres.</p><p>In addition to bringing together experienced producers from Canada and France to strengthen bilateral content collaboration, the CMPA and USPA will discuss the ongoing shared challenges faced by the independent production sectors in their respective countries.</p><p>\u201cUSPA is thrilled with the ongoing international cooperation fostered by its partnership with CMPA in Canada. In the current international context, it is necessary to strengthen the links between our two countries, both operationally and politically,\u201d said Amanda Borghino, Deputy General Delegate of the USPA. \u201cWe look forward to continuing this collaboration and shaping together new paths for transatlantic content.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrance has long been a valued production partner for Canada, and we are thrilled to collaborate with USPA on this initiative,\u201d said Reynolds Mastin, President and CEO of the CMPA. \u201cToday, our two countries are leading global efforts to ensure foreign streaming services respect the right of national governments to require equitable contributions to domestic production, and opportunities for local producers to hold and exploit their own intellectual property. This is critical to the success of local independent production sectors, and to safeguarding individual countries\u2019 national cultural sovereignty.\u201d</p><p>Participants from Canada:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Amos   Adetuyi, Circle Blue Entertainment  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Alfons Adetuyi, Inner City Films  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Kerry Appleyard, Lionsgate Canada  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Eli Campbell, Peacock Alley Entertainment  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Annette Clarke, Ruby Line Productions  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Lauren Corber, LoCo Motion Pictures  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   David Cormican, Fun Republic Pictures  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Malachi Ellis, Area V5 Pictures  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Sibel Guvenc, Kybele Films Inc.  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Frederick Kroetsch, Catapult Pictures  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Michelle Morris, Lily Pictures  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Michael Souther, Amaze Films  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Steven Thibault, Screen Siren Pictures  </p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Participants from France:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Iris Bucher, Quad Drama (USPA President)  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Thomas Anargyros, Mediawan Studio France (USPA Vice President)  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Isabelle Degeorges, Gaumont Televisions France (USPA Vice President)  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Patricia Boutinard Rouelle, Nilaya Productions (USPA Vice President)  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Odile McDonald, Wildcats Productions (USPA Drama college VP)  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Arnaud de Cr\u00e9miers, Jour Premier  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Sophie Deloche, Ashart\u00e9&amp;Cie  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Nicolas Deprost, What\u2019s up productions  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Fabrice Est\u00e8ve, Yuzu Production  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Emmanuel Fran\u00e7ois, Brother Films  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Corine Janin, Bleu Kobalt  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Betty Johnson, Hababo Studios  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Am\u00e9lie Juan, Morgane Production  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Jean-Marie Laronze, Monde et media TV  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Gini Lorin, Scriptline  </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>   Tatiana Maksimenko, Hamak (Effervescence group)  </p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>The initiative is presented in collaboration with Telefilm Canada, the Canada Media Fund, CanExport for Associations (Global Affairs), the French Embassy in Canada and the Canadian Embassy in France.</p><p>Source: The Canadian Media Producers Association (CMPA)</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cmpa.ca/pressreleases/canadian-and-french-media-producers-strengthen-partnerships-and-open-new-paths-for-transatlantic-content/\">https://cmpa.ca/pressreleases/canadian-and-french-media-producers-strengthen-partnerships-and-open-new-paths-for-transatlantic-content/</url></p><p>Canada Media Producers Association</p><p>The Canadian Media Producers Association is Canada\u2019s trade association for independent producers.

This was driven by the flow-through of higher operating revenue, despite a 1.3% increase in operating costs due to higher TV content costs and the acquisition of OUTEDGE Media Canada, which were partly offset by workforce reductions.</p><p>COMMON SHARE DIVIDEND</p><p>On February 6, 2025, we announced that BCE's common share dividend and common share dividend payout policy would continue to be reviewed by the Board.</p><p>The Board has considered the macroeconomic, regulatory and competitive environments of BCE. Heightened economic uncertainty, inflationary pressures and the prospect of a global recession are weighing on consumer confidence. In addition, the decline in BCE's share price has resulted in a higher cost of capital. The Board also considered the impact of the unsupportive regulatory environment given recent CRTC decisions, ongoing aggressive competitive pricing, and a slowdown in immigration.</p><p>Greater financial flexibility and a prudent approach to capital management is required in the current economic, regulatory and competitive environments. Accordingly, the Board has determined to establish the annualized dividend at $1.75 per BCE common share. In addition, BCE's common share dividend payout policy has been updated to target a dividend payout range of 40% to 55% of free cash flow. In order to allow investors to consider the effects of lease liability repayments on our cash available for dividend payments, we will also going forward be disclosing both free cash flow and free cash flow after payment of lease liabilities13.</p><p>This measure is expected to strengthen the Corporation's balance sheet, while providing enhanced flexibility in the context of economic uncertainty. BCE's Board has declared today a quarterly dividend of $0.4375 per common share, payable on July 15, 2025 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 16, 2025.</p><p>BCE also announced today that the Board has determined to terminate the discounted treasury issuances under the Shareholder Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan effective from the July 15, 2025 dividend payment date.

Additionally, net capital expenditures are expected to be lower than under the previous financial guidelines, partially resulting from operational efficiencies following the combination of the Canadian and U.S. management teams.</p><p>Consequently, compared to fiscal 2024, on a constant currency and consolidated basis, we are lowering Cogeco's revenue projections for fiscal 2025 to a low single digit decline, while adjusted EBITDA is expected to remain stable. In addition, due to some better-than-anticipated transformation-related cost savings and lower expected net capital expenditures, we are increasing the Corporation's free cash flow financial guidelines, from a decrease compared to fiscal 2024 to a stable free cash flow, while reducing net capital expenditures projections.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://corpo.cogeco.com/cgo/en/press-room/press-releases/cogeco-announces-q3-2025-financial-results-and-canadian-wireless-launch/\">https://corpo.cogeco.com/cgo/en/press-room/press-releases/cogeco-announces-q3-2025-financial-results-and-canadian-wireless-launch/</url></p><p>Cogeco Inc.

The decrease in net loss was primarily the result of a decrease in depreciation, amortization, restructuring, net financing expense and an increase in gains on disposal of assets held for sale and other assets, partially offset by an increase in interest expense, foreign currency exchange losses and a decrease in gain on derivative financial instruments.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.postmedia.com/2025/07/10/postmedia-reports-third-quarter-results-12/\">https://www.postmedia.com/2025/07/10/postmedia-reports-third-quarter-results-12/</url></p><p>Quebecor Group (TSX: QBR.A)</p><p>The parent company of the Quebecor Group is the Canadian company, Quebecor Inc.

The Corporation continues to make progress, gaining market share quarter after quarter while consolidating its position as the most profitable player in the sector, supported by the strongest balance sheet in the Canadian telecommunications industry.</p><p>Pierre Karl P\u00e9ladeau, President and Chief Executive Officer of Quebecor</p><p>Quebecor posted solid financial results in the first quarter of 2025, including increases of 8.1% in cash flows provided by operating activities and 13.5% in adjusted income from operating activities. As a result of this strong performance, driven by rigorous disciplined management, we were able to reduce our consolidated net debt by more than $155.0 million in the first quarter of 2025 and lower our consolidated net debt leverage ratio to 3.26x at March 31, 2025, the lowest among Canada\u2019s major telecommunications providers.</p><p>In an aggressively competitive business environment, our innovative range of products offered at competitive prices allowed us to deliver an increase of 54,400 (1.3%) new mobile lines in the first quarter of 2025, the best growth rate among Canada\u2019s leading telecommunications providers, and 367,500 (9.6%) lines over the past twelve months. We continued investing in our network, in line with our priority of delivering a superior customer experience. Since April 2025, we have been gradually deploying 3800 MHz spectrum across Freedom\u2019s 5G+ network in Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. With access to state-of-the-art 5G+ technology now included in all Freedom monthly mobile plans, regardless of price, this rollout will significantly boost network capacity and performance. In February 2025, Freedom also launched a new range of mobile plans in Manitoba that offer higher data caps and include \u201cRoam Beyond\u201d international roaming.</p><p>Freedom brand awareness is also growing. Freedom is an official sponsor of the 2025 Calgary Stampede, one of Canada\u2019s most iconic cultural events; the exceptional exposure to millions of attendees and television viewers will strengthen its national positioning.</p><p>We are also proud of the resounding success of Fizz TV, the all-digital television service we launched in February 2025. Available to Fizz Internet subscribers in Qu\u00e9bec, Fizz TV meets the needs of customers seeking flexibility, accessibility and innovation. More than 12,000 new customers signed up in just a few weeks, confirming the relevance of our offer and the appeal of the Fizz brand in a fast-changing market.</p><p>Videotron continued to pick up distinctions, ranking as the most respected telecommunications company in Qu\u00e9bec for the 19th time since 2006 in L\u00e9ger\u2019s 2025 Reputation survey. It also hit a double in L\u00e9ger\u2019s WOW 2025 index, in which it ranked first among telecom retailers for in-store experience in Qu\u00e9bec while Fizz was first in Canada for online experience for the sixth year in a row. Freedom moved up to third place for online experience.</p><p>Although its current restructuring plans have reduced operating expenses considerably, TVA Group Inc. (\u201cTVA Group\u201d) recorded negative adjusted EBITDA of $20.5 million in the first quarter of 2025 as a result of a significant ongoing decline in advertising revenues due to the general crisis in the media industry and fewer major foreign productions filming at our MELS studios. We must therefore maintain a rigorous approach in order to meet the current challenges and safeguard the future of the business.</p><p>Even though TVA Group gained market share, climbing to a total of 42.4% in the Winter 2025 season (January 6 to April 6, 2025), our advertising revenues continued to decline. Our platforms deliver considerably more viewing hours than the American platforms, but advertisers continue to pour their dollars into the latter. Yet their reliability pales in comparison with the credibility of local media, which offer advertisers an unrivalled showcase and reach their target audiences more effectively. As we have repeatedly argued, we believe that the federal government must eliminate the tax deduction for advertising spending on foreign platforms and, conversely, introduce a tax deduction for investment in domestic businesses. At a time when the proliferation of fake news on social media is widely condemned, it defies logic that our public institutions continue to encourage foreign platforms and our governments support them through unfair favourable tax treatment.</p><p>Moreover, as private broadcasters struggle to survive in an over-regulated, over-taxed and loss-making broadcasting environment with a long-obsolete business model, the federal government must move quickly to implement the recommendations of the 2020 Yale Report by reforming CBC/Radio-Canada and its mandate, in particular by eliminating advertising in order to support private broadcasters, for which it is the main source of revenue.</p><p>I would like to mention the upcoming retirement, on May 14, of Lyne Robitaille, Senior Vice President, Newspapers, Books and Magazines, and a valued contributor for the past 36 years. Lyne has had a remarkable career. Over the years, she has led the development and growth of several Quebecor subsidiaries. She oversaw a number of major transformations at Quebecor, including the digital transition of our newspapers, which made Le Journal de Montr\u00e9al and Le Journal de Qu\u00e9bec the most-read newspapers in Qu\u00e9bec across all platforms, with over 3.1 million readers per week. On behalf of Quebecor, I wish her all the best in her well-deserved retirement.</p><p>In April 2025, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Pierre P\u00e9ladeau, Quebecor launched a year-long tribute to honour the memory of its founder, a visionary builder of Qu\u00e9bec Inc. who helped transform and modernize Qu\u00e9bec society and its economy. This anniversary is also a reminder that the philanthropic commitment that was so important to Pierre P\u00e9ladeau remains central to Quebecor\u2019s values, as our recent historic donations\u2014$20 million to Universit\u00e9 Laval to support the Carrefour international Brian-Mulroney and $10 million to the Fondation du CHU de Qu\u00e9bec to support its integrated cancer centre\u2014eloquently demonstrate. Several other events will follow in the course of the year.</p><p>Today, the innovation, ambition and courage to think big that we inherited from Pierre P\u00e9ladeau continue to drive our growth and expansion. Extending our track record of successful execution, we are maintaining rigorous financial discipline and building on solid foundations to achieve our objectives and create long-term value for all our stakeholders.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.quebecor.com/en/-/qu-c3-a9becor-inc.-annonce-ses-r-c3-a9sultats-consolid-c3-a9s-pour-le-premier-trimestre-2025\">https://www.quebecor.com/en/-/qu-c3-a9becor-inc.-annonce-ses-r-c3-a9sultats-consolid-c3-a9s-pour-le-premier-trimestre-2025</url></p><p>Rogers Communications Inc.

(\u201cShaw\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) announces consolidated financial and operating results for the quarter ended August 31, 2022.</p><p>Selected Financial Highlights</p><p>Fourth quarter consolidated revenue decreased 1.5% year-over-year to $1.36 billion, adjusted EBITDA increased 1.6% year-over-year to $624 million, funds flow from operations decreased 5.3% to $487 million, and net income decreased 32.9% to $169 million.</p><p>Fiscal 2022 consolidated revenue decreased 1.1% year-over-year to $5.45 billion and adjusted EBITDA increased 1.4% year-over-year to $2.53 billion. Fiscal 2022 results include year-over-year growth in Consumer Internet, Wireless service and Business revenue, offset by declines in Wireless equipment and Wireline Video, Satellite and Phone revenue. The prior year results included Consumer revenue of approximately $20 million related to the release of a provision following the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) decision on final aggregated Third Party Internet Access (TPIA) rates and higher equity-based compensation costs of approximately $29 million due to the significant increase in Shaw\u2019s share price following the Rogers-Shaw Transaction (as defined below) announcement on March 15, 2021. Throughout the year, management continued to invest in its networks, focus on profitable subscriber growth and support the Proposed Transaction (as defined below).</p><p>\u201cAs Canadians put the COVID-19 pandemic behind them, the need to connect, and stay connected, has remained strong. The Canadian and global communications sectors \u2013 both wireline and wireless \u2013 face important and rapidly escalating investment demands where ongoing investments today determine our competitiveness tomorrow. That is true for our networks, and also for our country. All Canadians depend on our industry to make the necessary investments so that they can benefit from technology advances and all the opportunities afforded by our digital economy,\u201d said Brad Shaw, Executive Chair &amp; Chief Executive Officer.</p><p>Mr. Shaw continued, \u201cThat is why it is so important to move forward with the transactions that Shaw, Quebecor and Rogers have agreed to in direct response to concerns raised by the Competition Bureau and ISED. Our proposed series of transactions creates an unprecedented opportunity to enable a strong, fourth wireless carrier that can compete at scale against the Big 3 and with 5G. The proposal also ensures that Shaw\u2019s wireline business can make the significant investments it needs to remain competitive over the long term. In short, we are proposing a bright future for sustainable competition in Canadian telecommunications. Instead of moving ahead with the investments and long-term planning that will drive more competition, we are unfortunately delayed by litigation with the Competition Bureau. Despite this, we remain optimistic that we will ultimately be able to complete our proposed transactions, and we are unwavering in our conviction that they represent a victory for all stakeholders, especially Canadian consumers. We maintain our strong commitment to the ongoing process, and to ensuring that Canada continues to have a vibrant and competitive industry with world leading infrastructure.\u201d</p><p>Proposed Transaction</p><p>On March 15, 2021, Shaw announced that it entered into an arrangement agreement (the \u201cArrangement Agreement\u201d) with Rogers Communications Inc. (\u201cRogers\u201d), under which Rogers will acquire all of Shaw\u2019s issued and outstanding Class A Participating Shares (\u201cClass A Shares\u201d) and Class B Non-Voting Participating Shares (\u201cClass B Shares\u201d) in a transaction valued at approximately $26 billion, inclusive of approximately $6 billion of Shaw debt (the \u201cRogers-Shaw Transaction\u201d).</p><p>Holders of Class A Shares and Class B Shares (other than the Shaw Family Living Trust, the controlling shareholder of Shaw, and related persons (collectively, the \u201cShaw Family Shareholders\u201d)) will receive $40.50 per share in cash. The Shaw Family Shareholders will receive 60% of the consideration for their shares in the form of Class B Non-Voting Shares of Rogers (the \u201cRogers Shares\u201d) on the basis of the volume-weighted average trading price for the Rogers Shares for the 10 trading days ending March 12, 2021, and the balance in cash. As at March 13, 2021, when the Arrangement Agreement was signed, the value of the consideration attributable to the Class A Shares and Class B Shares held by the Shaw Family Shareholders (calculated using the volume-weighted average trading price for the Rogers Shares for the 10 trading days ending March 12, 2021) was equivalent to $40.50 per share.</p><p>The Rogers-Shaw Transaction is being implemented by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (Alberta). At the special meeting of Shaw shareholders held on May 20, 2021, the Company obtained approval of the plan of arrangement by the holders of Shaw\u2019s Class A Shares and Class B Shares in the manner required by the interim order granted by the Court of King\u2019s Bench of Alberta on April 19, 2021. On May 25, 2021, the Court of King\u2019s Bench of Alberta issued a final order approving the plan of arrangement.</p><p>Agreement to Sell Freedom Mobile to Quebecor</p><p>On June 17, 2022, Rogers, Shaw and Quebecor Inc. (\u201cQuebecor\u201d) announced their agreement for the sale of Freedom Mobile Inc. (\u201cFreedom\u201d) to Quebecor for a purchase price of $2.85 billion. On August 12, 2022, Rogers, Shaw and Quebecor entered into a definitive agreement (the \u201cShare Purchase Agreement\u201d) for the sale of Freedom to Videotron Ltd. (\u201cVideotron\u201d), a subsidiary of Quebecor, substantially consistent with the terms announced on June 17, 2022 (the \u201cFreedom Transaction\u201d). The Freedom Transaction is subject to regulatory approvals from the Commissioner of Competition (the \u201cCommissioner\u201d) and Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED), and is conditional on the completion of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction. Subject to satisfaction of all conditions, closing of the Freedom Transaction will take place immediately before the closing of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction.  Collectively, the Rogers-Shaw Transaction, the Freedom Transaction and all transactions provided thereunder are referred to as the \u201cProposed Transaction.\u201d</p><p>The Share Purchase Agreement provides that Videotron, a subsidiary of Quebecor, will acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Freedom. Accordingly, Videotron will acquire the entire Freedom business, including all Freedom-branded wireless and Internet customers, as well as all of Freedom\u2019s infrastructure, spectrum and retail locations, and all of Freedom\u2019s existing backhaul and backbone arrangements. The Freedom Transaction also includes long-term agreements pursuant to which Rogers will provide Quebecor with transport services (including backhaul and backbone) and roaming services. Rogers and Quebecor will provide each other with customary transition services as are necessary to operate Freedom\u2019s business for a reasonable period of time post-closing and to facilitate the separation of Freedom\u2019s business from the other businesses and operations of Shaw and its affiliates. Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, the Shaw Mobile-branded wireless subscribers will not be transferred to Videotron and will remain with Shaw.</p><p>Status of the Proposed Transaction Regulatory Approvals and Related Proceedings</p><p>For the Rogers-Shaw Transaction, consistent with the terms of the Arrangement Agreement, the parties made filings with each of the Canadian Radiotelevision and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), the Commissioner and ISED in April 2021. For the Freedom Transaction, consistent with the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, the parties made filings with the Commissioner and ISED in June 2022.</p><p>On March 24, 2022, the CRTC completed its comprehensive review and approved the transfer of Shaw\u2019s licenced broadcasting undertakings to Rogers, marking an important milestone towards closing of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction.</p><p>On May 9, 2022, the Commissioner filed applications to the Competition Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) seeking an order to prevent the Rogers-Shaw Transaction from proceeding and an interim injunction to prevent closing until the Commissioner\u2019s case can be heard by the Tribunal. On May 30, 2022, the Commissioner\u2019s interim injunction application was resolved on the basis that Rogers and Shaw agreed to not proceed with closing the Rogers-Shaw Transaction until either a negotiated settlement is agreed with the Commissioner or the Tribunal has ruled on the matter. As announced by the Company on July 6, 2022 and October 27, 2022, the respective mediation sessions between Rogers, Shaw, Quebecor and the Commissioner in July, 2022 and October, 2022, did not result in a resolution of the Commissioner\u2019s objections to the proposed merger.  As a result, the Tribunal hearing began on November 7, 2022.</p><p>On October 25, 2022, the Minister of Innovation, Science, and Industry (the \u201cMinister\u201d) officially denied the application for the wholesale transfer of Freedom\u2019s spectrum licences to Rogers, which is no longer being proposed.  In connection with his ongoing review of the pending application to transfer Freedom\u2019s spectrum licences to Videotron, the Minister gave notice that any spectrum licences acquired by Videotron must remain in Videotron\u2019s possession for at least ten years and the Minister conveyed his expectation that prices for wireless services in Ontario and Western Canada would be comparable to what Videotron is currently offering in Quebec. Videotron subsequently announced that it is willing to accept these conditions.</p><p>The parties to the Proposed Transaction strongly believe that it is in the best interests of Canadian consumers, businesses and the Canadian economy. Above all, the Proposed Transaction will strengthen competition in Canadian wireless and wireline telecommunications and enhance sustainable competition over the long term.  It will also enable network expansion, bridging the digital divide, and the next-generation wireless and wireline networks that will drive innovation and economic growth.</p><p>As previously disclosed, in order to permit continued engagement with the pending regulatory approval processes and related hearings, Rogers, Shaw and the Shaw Family Living Trust have agreed to extend the outside date for closing the Rogers-Shaw Transaction from July 31, 2022 to December 31, 2022 which outside date may be further extended to January 31, 2023 at the option of Rogers or Shaw, demonstrating their commitment to completing this transformative combination. The outside date in the Share Purchase Agreement also tracks the outside date in the Arrangement Agreement but can be extended beyond January 31, 2023 only with the consent of Videotron. Nonetheless, the time required to complete the Tribunal hearing, as well as receive ISED approval, including any appeals of the outcomes of any required regulatory process, is uncertain and could result in further delays in or prevent the closing of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction and the Freedom Transaction.</p><p>Further information regarding the Rogers-Shaw Transaction is contained in the management information circular filed April 23, 2021 on Shaw\u2019s SEDAR profile at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url> and EDGAR profile at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sec.gov\">www.sec.gov</url>.</p><p>Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2022</p><p>In the fourth quarter, the Company added approximately 52,900 new Wireless customers. Postpaid net additions of approximately 25,600 in the quarter were down compared to the prior year due to wireless competition and moderating demand for Shaw Mobile, partially offset by increasing retail traffic for Freedom Mobile, although not yet to pre-pandemic levels. Wireless service revenue growth of 7.3% is due to continued subscriber growth, partially offset by lower ARPU1. Fourth quarter Wireless ARPU decreased 0.9% from the prior year period to $37.08. Wireless postpaid churn2 of 1.39% improved approximately 10-basis points from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.</p><p>Consumer Wireline RGU3 losses in the fourth quarter of approximately 42,500 improved over the prior year period, led by Internet RGU additions of approximately 4,700, combined with fewer Video and Phone losses, primarily due to improved retention tactics. Fourth quarter Wireline revenue decreased 2.4% over the prior year to $1.03 billion and Wireline adjusted EBITDA decreased 1.4% to $501 million.</p><p>Fourth quarter Wireless revenue increased 1.2% to $325 million and adjusted EBITDA of $123 million increased 16.0% year-over-year. For the twelve-month period, Wireless revenue grew 1.5% to $1.29 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $485 million improved 23.4%. Wireless service revenue for the three and twelve-month periods increased 7.3% and 9.1% respectively, to $250 million and $972 million, over the comparable periods in fiscal 2021 due to an increased subscriber base, partially offset by lower ARPU. Wireless equipment revenue for the three and twelve-month periods decreased 14.8% and 16.3% respectively, to $75 million and $319 million over the comparable periods in fiscal 2021. Fourth quarter ARPU decreased 0.9% to $37.08 reflecting Shaw Mobile customer additions offset by lower device subsidy allocations. For the full year, ARPU of $36.83 decreased 1.4% over the prior year. In fiscal 2022, the Company added approximately 160,000 Wireless customers bringing its total customer base to approximately 2.28 million.</p><p>Wireline RGUs declined by approximately 40,400 in the quarter compared to a loss of approximately 45,400 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The current quarter included a gain in Consumer Internet RGUs of approximately 4,700 offset with declines in Video, Satellite and Phone resulting in Consumer RGUs declining by 42,500 in the aggregate. Business RGUs increased by approximately 2,100.</p><p>Fourth quarter Wireline revenue of $1.03 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $501 million decreased 2.4% and 1.4% respectively. Consumer revenue of $879 million decreased 3.4% compared to the prior year as Internet revenue growth was offset by declines in Video, Satellite and Phone subscribers and revenue. Business revenue of $155 million increased 4.0% year-over-year with Internet revenue growth and continued demand for the Smart suite of products.The decrease in revenue was partially offset by lower employee related costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 of approximately $11 million due to the impact of share price movements on stock-based compensation as well as favourable adjustments to employee benefit provisions based on experience.</p><p>For the twelve-month period, Consumer revenue decreased 3.2% to $3.55 billion and Business revenue increased 6.7% to $623 million resulting in Wireline revenue of $4.17 billion, or 1.9% lower than the prior year. Wireline adjusted EBITDA for the same period of $2.05 billion decreased 2.8% due primarily to lower Consumer revenue.</p><p>Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of $340 million compared to $292 million in the prior year. Wireline capital spending increased by approximately $85 million primarily due to higher investments in network upgrades, enhancements and success-based categories as well as an increase in new housing development. Wireless spending of $34 million decreased by approximately $37 million year-over-year primarily due to lower planned investment in the quarter. In fiscal 2022, consolidated capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion increased approximately 7.7% from the prior year.</p><p>Free cash flow4 for the quarter of $70 million compared to $227 million in the prior year. The decrease was largely due to higher capital expenditures and higher income taxes paid, partially offset by an increase in adjusted EBITDA. Free cash flow for fiscal 2022 of $819 million was $154 million, or 15.8%, lower than the prior year due to an increase in capital expenditures and higher income taxes paid partially offset by growth in adjusted EBITDA.</p><p>Funds flow from operations for the quarter of $487 million decreased 5.3% from $514 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 primarily due to the decrease in net income and partially offset by a decrease in non-cash future income tax recovery. Funds flow from operations for fiscal 2022 of $2.0 billion was $257 million, or 11.4%, lower than the prior year primarily due to a higher current income tax and interest expense, partially offset by an increase in EBITDA all in the current year.</p><p>Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 of $169 million decreased 32.9% from $252 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 due to an $83 million increase in income taxes in the quarter, primarily due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax losses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Net income for fiscal 2022 of $764 million was $222 million lower than the prior year primarily due to a $29 million increase in interest expense related to a $35 million reduction of tax related interest expense in the prior year and a $211 million increase in income taxes in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, partially offset by the $34 million increase in consolidated adjusted EBITDA. Tax expense increased in fiscal 2022 mainly due to a $125 million revision to liabilities for uncertain tax positions that became statute barred in 2021 as well as the recognition of a $78 million tax benefit associated with previously unrecognized tax losses in the fourth quarter of 2021 driven by management\u2019s expectations that sufficient future taxable profit will be available to fully utilize such losses, partially offset by the effect of higher pre-tax income.</p><p>As at the end of fiscal 2022, the net debt leverage ratio was 2.2x5.</p><p>Shaw files Year-End Disclosure Documents</p><p>Shaw announced today the filing with Canadian securities regulators of its 2022 audited annual consolidated financial statements, related management\u2019s discussion and analysis and 2022 annual information form and the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of its 2022 annual report on Form 40-F which includes the Canadian filings.</p><p>These documents are available on Shaw's profile on the Canadian Securities Administrators' website (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url>).

(TSX: TCL.A TCL.B) announces its results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, which ended July 27, 2025.</p><p>\"For the third consecutive quarter, we significantly improved our adjusted net earnings per share, which continues to demonstrate the positive impact of the implementation of our two-year program aimed at improving our profitability and our financial position,\" said Thomas Morin, President and Chief Executive Officer of TC\u00a0Transcontinental.</p><p>\"The Packaging Sector experienced a decrease in revenues in the third quarter, mainly due to the sale of our industrial packaging operations at the beginning of the fiscal year as well as weaker than expected demand. Thanks to our discipline and our ability to adapt our costs to the demand, and despite a less favourable product mix, we improved the sector's adjusted operating earnings margin before depreciation and amortization. We expect volume growth in several of our markets in the fourth quarter, which makes us confident in our ability to generate organic growth in earnings for fiscal year 2025.</p><p>\"The Retail Services and Printing Sector posted another good quarter with a 4.5% increase in revenues and an increase in profitability for the fifth consecutive quarter. This solid performance results mainly from significant growth in our book printing activities. As announced, we are pleased with the Mirazed, Intergraphics and Middleton acquisitions, which accelerate\u00a0growth\u00a0in\u00a0our\u00a0in-store marketing activities.\"</p><p>\"The decrease in our financial expenses as a result of the significant reduction in net indebtedness during the last year, combined with the improvement in our earnings and our share repurchase program, allowed us to grow adjusted net earnings per share by 16.7% for the quarter,\" added Donald LeCavalier, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of TC\u00a0Transcontinental.</p><p>Financial Highlights</p><p>Results for the Third Quarter of Fiscal Year 2025</p><p>Revenues decreased by $15.6 million, or 2.2%, from $700.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 to $684.4 million in the corresponding period of 2025. This decrease is mainly due to the impact of the sale of the industrial packaging operations and lower volume in the Packaging Sector, partially offset by higher volume in the Retail Services and Printing Sector, notably in book printing activities, the favourable exchange rate effect and, to a lesser extent, the acquisition of Middleton Group Inc.</p><p>Operating earnings before depreciation and amortization decreased by $12.5 million, or 10.3%, from $121.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 to $109.0 million in the third quarter of 2025. This decrease is mainly due to lower volume in the Packaging Sector, a less favourable product mix in our two main sectors, the increase in restructuring and other costs, an asset impairment charge and the sale of the industrial packaging operations, partially offset by the favourable impact of cost reduction initiatives and the favourable exchange rate effect.</p><p>Adjusted operating earnings before depreciation and amortization increased by $1.6 million, or 1.3%, from $121.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 to $122.6 million in the third quarter of 2025. This increase is mainly attributable to the favourable impact of cost reduction initiatives and the favourable exchange rate effect, mostly offset by lower volume in the Packaging Sector, a less favourable product mix in our two main sectors and the sale of the industrial packaging operations.</p><p>Net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation decreased by $4.9 million, or 11.2%, from $43.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 to $38.7 million in the third quarter of 2025. This decrease is mainly due to the previously explained decrease in operating earnings before depreciation and amortization, partially offset by lower financial expenses, depreciation and amortization, and income taxes. On a per share basis, net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation went from $0.50 to $0.46, respectively.</p><p>Adjusted net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation increased by $7.5 million, or 14.6%, from $51.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 to $58.9 million in the third quarter of 2025. This increase is mainly attributable to lower financial expenses and income taxes as well as the previously explained increase in adjusted operating earnings before depreciation and amortization. On a per share basis, adjusted net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation went from $0.60 to $0.70, respectively.</p><p>Results for the First Nine Months of Fiscal Year 2025</p><p>Revenues decreased by $52.1 million, or 2.5%, from $2,063.6 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 to $2,011.5 million in the corresponding period of 2025. This decrease is mainly due to the impact of the sale of the industrial packaging operations and lower volume, mainly in the Packaging Sector, partially offset by the favourable exchange rate effect.</p><p>Operating earnings before depreciation and amortization increased by $62.0 million, or 21.2%, from $292.9 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 to $354.9 million in the corresponding period of 2025. This increase is mainly attributable to the decrease in restructuring and other costs (revenues), the favourable impact of cost reduction initiatives and the favourable exchange rate effect, partially offset by lower volume and a less favourable product mix in the Packaging Sector as well as the sale of the industrial packaging operations.</p><p>Adjusted operating earnings before depreciation and amortization increased by $1.4 million, or 0.4%, from $327.2 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 to $328.6 million in the corresponding period of 2025. This increase is mainly attributable to the favourable impact of cost reduction initiatives and the favourable exchange rate effect, mostly offset by lower volume and a less favourable product mix in the Packaging Sector as well as the sale of the industrial packaging operations.</p><p>Net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation increased by $54.7 million, or 74.5%, from $73.4 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 to $128.1 million in the corresponding period of 2025. This increase is mainly attributable to the previously explained increase in operating earnings before depreciation and amortization as well as lower financial expenses and depreciation and amortization, partially offset by higher income taxes. On a per share basis, net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation went from $0.85 to $1.53, respectively.</p><p>Adjusted net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation increased by $14.5 million, or 10.8%, from $134.1 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 to $148.6 million in the corresponding period of 2025. This increase is mainly attributable to lower financial expenses. On a per share basis, adjusted net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation went from $1.55 to $1.77, respectively.</p><p>For more detailed financial information, please see the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis for the third quarter ended July 27, 2025, as well as the financial statements in the \u201cInvestors\u201d section of our website at  <url normalizedValue=\"https://tctranscontinental.com/en-ca/investors/overview\">www.tc.tc</url>  .</p><p>Outlook    (1)</p><p>The investments in our growth activities, including flexible packaging and in-store marketing, position us well for the future and should be a key driver of our long-term growth.</p><p>In terms of profitability, despite a weaker than anticipated demand in the third quarter, we expect to generate organic growth in adjusted operating earnings before depreciation and amortization of the Packaging Sector for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024. In the Retail Services and Printing Sector, given the higher than anticipated growth in earnings since the beginning of fiscal 2025, we expect adjusted operating earnings before depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2025 to rise compared to fiscal 2024.</p><p>Lastly, we expect to continue generating significant cash flows from operating activities, which will enable us to pursue our strategy launched in 2023 to reduce net indebtedness while investing in our growth and returning capital to our shareholders.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://tctranscontinental.com/en-ca/company-overview/news-room/press-releases/transcontinental-inc-announces-results-for-the-third-2\">https://tctranscontinental.com/en-ca/company-overview/news-room/press-releases/transcontinental-inc-announces-results-for-the-third-2</url></p><p>Vividata</p><p>Vividata Leader In Canadian Cross-Media And Consumer Research</p><p>Offering the largest syndicated study in Canada, Vividata\u2019s SCC | Study of the Canadian Consumer is the go-to source for demographics, psychographics, lifestyle, life events, media, purchasing and brand preferences.

According to news reporting originating from Vancouver, Canada, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Forest fire risk assessment and prevention are crucial topics in environmental management.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Mitacs. <br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from British Columbia Institute of Technology: \"The most popular method involves using drone imagery and object detection models to analyze risk. However, traditional drone images typically use the sRGB color space, which may lose valuable information. In this study, we systematically investigate the impact of different color spaces (sRGB, Linear RGB, Log RGB, XYZ, LMS, and D-Log) on the performance of state-of-the-art vision transformer models and the latest YOLO model for tree condition detection. Our experiments demonstrate that Log RGB and Linear RGB significantly outperform the conventional sRGB color space, with Log RGB achieving a 27.16% improvement in mean average precision (mAP) and a 34.44% gain in mean average recall (mAR). These improvements are attributed to Log RGB's enhanced dynamic range, superior illumination invariance, and better information preservation, which enable the detection of subtle environmental details crucial for early wildfire risk assessment.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Overall, our findings highlight the potential of leveraging alternative color space representations to develop more accurate and robust tools for wildfire risk assessment.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Beyond sRGB: Optimizing Object Detection with Diverse Color Spaces for Precise Wildfire Risk Assessment.

You're watching the second hour of \"One World.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As the Trump administration steps up threats and investigations into the president's perceived rivals and critics, another high-profile name maybe in the crosshairs. The FBI is conducting searches of John Bolton's home and office.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bolton served as national security adviser during Donald Trump's first term. And sources tell CNN the raids are connected to whether he revealed classified information in a book he wrote about his experience or elsewhere. It's an allegation that has been investigated in the past, but never resulted in any charges against Bolton.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just a short time ago, the president made these comments.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm not a fan of John Bolton. He's a -- a real -- sort of a lowlife. I -- when I hired him, he served a good purpose. He's not a smart guy, but he could be a very unpatriotic. I'm -- we're going to find out. I know nothing about it. I just saw it this morning they did a raid.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: Since leaving the Trump administration in 2019, Bolton has become one of Trump's fiercest critics, especially on foreign policy. He appeared on this show just about a week ago and we asked him about the president's social media attacks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BIANNA GOLODRYGA, CNN ANCHOR: This isn't the first time he's attacked you on social media, but what do you make of this specific post?</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, FORMER UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: Well, I'm glad I'm still on his mind.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: For the latest, let's bring in CNN's senior White House reporter Betsy Klein.</p><p>So, Betsy, one of the things that Donald Trump said just about an hour or so ago when he spoke to media was this idea that he knew nothing about this -- this raid of -- of John Bolton's home. Walk us through that.</p><p>BETSY KLEIN, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: That's right. The president taking questions from reporters a short while ago here in Washington this morning reacting on camera for the first time to news that John Bolton, his former national security advisor's home and now his office, have both been searched by FBI personnel.</p><p>The president claims that he was not aware beforehand that this would be happening. He says he found out on television just like the rest of us. He said that he would be briefed later today by Attorney General Pamela Bondi and would expect to learn some additional details.</p><p>While at the same time he said, well, maybe I shouldn't. Maybe I should let this play out through the Justice Department. So, we'll wait and see whether that proceeds as planned.</p><p>But the president continued to lambast Bolton, who really has been a thorn in his side since leaving the Trump administration calling him a, quote, lowlife, saying he was very bad at what he does. But he did appear to suggest that it was helpful to have Bolton on his team when he met with world leaders who were concerned about Bolton's more hawkish policies.</p><p>But Bolton served for 18 months as Trump's national security advisor during his first term. He was fired in a tweet back in 2019. And in June of 2020, he published a book detailing his time at the highest levels of the Trump administration. He was a very close advisor to President Trump on a number of issues and had a lot of background insight into the decisions that were being made in the Trump White House during the time that he was in office.</p><p>And that 2020 book, a really scathing memoir called \"The Room Where It Happened.\" He detailed things such as an allegation that Trump requested Chinese help to win the 2020 election. He said that Trump argued that Venezuela was part of the United States. He said the president offered to intervene in the criminal justice system on behalf of other world leaders.</p><p>And more broadly, he said that President Trump's policies were, quote, a danger for the republic. But even since then, he has emerged as a key critic of the president's foreign policy, including just weeks ago -- a few days ago, really the president's decision to hold that high-stake summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, President Trump criticizing -- criticism from Bolton, saying that he was fired loser.</p><p>And Bolton, after that summit, told our own colleague Anderson Cooper that President Trump did not lose, but Putin clearly won. He also said he thought that the president looked very tired when he was in Alaska. Certainly something that would catch the president's ire and attention.</p><p>But in a 2024 updated forward for that book in question, Bolton said that Trump is unfit to be president. He said if the first four years were bad, a second four would be worse.</p><p>[12:05:08]</p><p>So again, so many questions for the White House right now referring those inquiries to the Justice Department, but we'll be watching to see whether the president has any more to say, expecting to see him in a short while.</p><p>ASHER: Betsy Klein live for us at the White House. Thank you so much. For a bit more perspective on all of this, let's bring in CNN political commentator Adam Kinzinger.</p><p>Like John Bolton, Adam is a Republican who has been a strong critic of President Donald Trump.</p><p>So, we heard our Betsy Klein on the ground there outside the White House, essentially listing some of the things that John Bolton said about the U.S. president in his memoir.</p><p>You famously broke ties with the president after the 2020 lies about the election being stolen and, of course, the January 6th insurrection. You decided that at some point you -- you had to draw the line somewhere.</p><p>And then the president obviously launched a sustained personal attack against you calling you crying Adam Kinzinger, calling you a total loser, a lightweight saying that you betrayed your party. He had planned to endorse primary challenges against you, but obviously you decided not to seek reelection.</p><p>Just explain to our audience. I see you smiling there. What is a person risk, Adam, when they are a Republican or they have previously sided with the president and then they decide to go up against him?</p><p>ADAM KINZINGER, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, if they continue to side with the president, they risk their soul. I mean, like literally everybody that's like still tied to him knows that this is wrong and evil and they can't speak out. So, that's the one thing I don't want to risk.</p><p>What you do risk though is, you know, look, obviously, the party has become a cult. I mean, it really has. It's become this -- this thing that's not centered around principle anymore. It's centered around a personality and that's really the definition of a cult.</p><p>And so you can't turn against him. If you turn against him, you think about any other cult, what's the penalty? The penalty is you get kicked out, you get excommunicated, you get basically shut down.</p><p>And you know, as humans, we're tribal creatures, right? We need to feel safety and security. There's evolutionary reasons for that. I think people fear more than they even fear death being kicked out of a tribe. And so that's what you risk. You risk that isolation.</p><p>And when you're somebody that's not just, you know, votes Republican, but if you're somebody that has served an office and that becomes your identity, which it shouldn't be, but it does, and that becomes your entire social circle, losing access to that tribe actually has a real cost. And it's a real social and a real -- in some cases, physical cost.</p><p>ASHER: I mean, it's interesting because some people who put formally worked for the president or Republicans have chosen to go against him when they considered it sort of safe to do so after his loss, for example, against Joe Biden. That was a sort of safe period to say, you know, I don't really like him anyway.</p><p>But it's a different thing altogether to go against him and to fall out with him publicly when you are either still working for him or when he is actually in office.</p><p>What we're seeing today in terms of John Bolton's home being raided. And obviously we don't necessarily know that it's 100 percent politically motivated. But that is what a lot of people do believe.</p><p>This is, of course, a warning shot, right, to other people who might be considering going up against the president as well.</p><p>KINZINGER: Well, let's say -- let's take the white out or the Justice Department's argument that it's not politically motivated, which is untrue. But let's take that for a second. Then what they're saying is that the mishandling of classified information supposedly is, you know, worthy of FBI attention. Well, what did Donald Trump get indicted for? Mishandling classified information.</p><p>So by definition, they're saying if what -- if this is not politically motivated, then Donald Trump's indictment was not politically motivated.</p><p>So the key -- the -- the -- the facts are we know this is politically motivated. And so here's what's going to happen. The FBI can raid anybody they want. It's not hard to get a court order to be allowed to do that.</p><p>The question is, can you get an indictment? Also, somewhat easy in a federal grand jury. A conviction is still hard if you're not guilty in this country. We still have a rule of law.</p><p>And so what you're going to see, I predict, is John Bolton, of course, not be found guilty for any of this. But that's not the point. The point is this chilling message. You know, people like me aren't afraid of that. I don't care. Some people probably does chill and that's frightening because it has echoes of what happens in any authoritarian country.</p><p>ASHER: Absolutely. And I -- I do want to hone in on Kash Patel because one of the things that a lot of people feared before he headed up the FBI was this idea that he would use the FBI for political retribution.</p><p>You have a situation where Donald Trump has come out and said that he knew nothing about this. And obviously a lot of people are skeptical about that. But this idea that Kash Patel in his position and obviously he tweeted about -- about this, about what was going on with -- with John Bolton.</p><p>But this idea that in his position that it has now become normalized for him to potentially use the FBI to go after Donald Trump's enemies. What do you -- what do you make of that, Adam?</p><p>KINZINGER: Well, it's chilling. First off with his tweet, he intentionally echoed what people were saying when Donald Trump was indicted, which is nobody's above the law. So, what does that say? It's obviously related to that.</p><p>[12:10:04]</p><p>And he's made it clear. I mean, Pam Bondi even said, my job as Attorney General is to be the president's lawyer, which has never been the case for the Justice Department, is to be the -- the lawyer for the people.</p><p>So, I think it's -- it's obviously chilling in what it does to the reputation of the FBI. And I think for any of my kind of Republican or conservative friends, they need to understand that, look, Trump's going to be in power for the next three years.</p><p>And then more than likely Democrats are going to win. And the one thing you don't want to do is to start breaking these rules or these norms because it's going to come back on you. And that's not a cycle we want to be in in this country.</p><p>And so, look, Kash Patel knows he's got three years left in this job, not 10, like most FBI directors. And all he cares about is retribution. He's made that very clear.</p><p>ASHER: All right. Adam Kinzinger, always good to see you. Thank you so much for being with us.</p><p>KINZINGER: You bet.

After more than three decades in prison, Lyle Menendez is facing the California parole board and a hearing that is now underway.</p><p>He was convicted alongside his brother, Erik Menendez, of murdering their parents back in 1989. The brothers had claimed the killings were in self- defense, alleging years of abuse by their father.</p><p>On Thursday, Erik was denied parole. CNN spoke to the only reporter allowed into the 10-hour hearing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[12:20:59]</p><p>JAMES QUEALLY, REPORTER: It was an emotional hearing. This is a 10-hour hearing, which is very unorthodox for a parole board hearing. Eighteen of Eric's relative supporters, a priest, a mentor, all spoke on his behalf.</p><p>But ultimately, the board decided a number of rules violations that he committed in prison, namely having cell phones. There was a situation in which he helped a prison gang with tax fraud scheme. He was involved in at least two instances of violence.</p><p>They decided those behaviors were ultimately a sign that he was still a danger to the public. You know, not that it would -- they pretty much weighed those almost more than the actual facts of the initial crime as a reason not to release him.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: CNN's Jean Casarez is tracking developments for us from New York. She joins us live now.</p><p>So, obviously, we know that Lyle Menendez has his parole board hearing today. How likely is it? How possible is it that there could be a different outcome for Lyle compared to Erik, especially if you're talking about behavior during that time in prison?</p><p>JEAN CASAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I think anything is possible. They started out yesterday when they were delivering their decision focusing on the murders. And so that will go into Lyle's also and is talking about that -- that to Erik.</p><p>You could have gone to the police. You were of age. You could have gone to this loving family that you have. You could have just left and you didn't do it.</p><p>And then also the double murder of killing the mother that it was devoid of any human compassion at all because she was a victim to the parole commissioner said in that home of domestic abuse.</p><p>And so that fits Lyle too. And they took that into consideration. And then when they segued into the -- the issues within the jail, the prison, as you just heard right there, yes, there were some serious things.</p><p>Now Lyle, just last year, he had cell phone possession in a cell he shared with multiple people. That is the same thing that the parole commissioner really focused on with Erik because he said, what you were doing is you were having other inmates hide your phone and you were getting all of these phones from the outside that could not be traced.</p><p>And then you would attend seminars and lead seminars of the prisoners saying, you know, how you get back into society, how you be a good person, how you not commit any more crimes, but you're having them do this. And so this was just last year. So he has the most recent one, Lyle, in that area. So that's not going to be positive.</p><p>But then also in a little bit before that, he was using a state phone in an incorrect way. And we know that Lyle was in possession of a lighter at one point. He also received contraband, tennis shoes from the outside.</p><p>And, you know, the parole commissioner said yesterday, to the person on the outside, they may not think violations like this are any big deal. But to us, they're illegal. And this shows you are not safe to go to the outside because you are not following the rules that are prescribed.</p><p>ASHER: Well, we'll see what happens. I think a lot of people were surprised about Erik Menendez yesterday and being denied. We'll see what happens today with Lyle.</p><p>Jean Casarez in New York.

Still to come here, more on our breaking news. An outspoken critic of the U.S. president is now under investigation. Ahead, where the FBI is conducting a search of John Bolton's home and office.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[12:30:29]</p><p>ASHER: All right. Welcome back to \"One World.\" I'm Zain Asher.</p><p>U.S. President Donald Trump says, he'll be briefed later today about an investigation into one of his most vocal critics. The FBI has been searching John Bolton's home and office. Bolton served as national security adviser during Trump's first term and has been especially critical about his foreign policy.</p><p>Sources tell CNN the raids are connected to whether he revealed classified information in a book he wrote about his experience or even outside of that.</p><p>A short time ago, the president told reporters that he knows nothing about the FBI search at all.</p><p>CNN's Evan Perez is outside John Bolton's home.</p><p>So, Evan, what have you been seeing this morning?</p><p>EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR U.S. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, we have agents here, Zain, now in their fifth hour of this search at John Bolton's home is in Bethesda, Maryland, just outside of Washington.</p><p>I'll give you just a little bit of a scene here with agents. You see those cars, those are all FBI agents. This is being handled by the FBIBaltimore field office.</p><p>And what we've seen over the last few hours, they've brought in boxes, document boxes, and have been repositioning their -- their cars just in the last hour to -- apparently, to get into a place where they can remove some items.</p><p>We saw them back up one of the SUVs to the garage of the -- of the -- of the home. Bolton was not home when the agents arrived just around seven o'clock in the morning here, local time. We did see what appeared to be his wife talking to some of the agents, looking at some of the paperwork.</p><p>What typically happens in these cases is the FBI agents leave behind or come with the court authorization, which explains the law that they are investigating whether what -- what law was broken or the alleged has been broken as part of this search. And so that's usually what happens in these cases.</p><p>Now, just back in Washington where Bolton has an office, FBI agents have also been seen at that location. We're told that that is also a part of this investigation of a separate search. And this all has to do, according to the sources we've talked to, with a National Security investigation and whether Bolton has mishandled national security information. It typically has to do with classified documents.</p><p>And you'll remember back in 2020, the FBI looked into whether Bolton mishandled classified documents for a book that he published back then, which was a memoir of his time in office.</p><p>Now, look again at the -- at the scene here, agents have been preparing for, we think, to try to wrap up the search. Again, this has been going on for about five hours. Zain.</p><p>ASHER: All right. Evan Perez live for us there. Thank you so much.</p><p>All right. Let's take a step back for a moment and get caught up on all the things that have come down during what has been a really busy week. It's certainly an unprecedented week for President Trump and the White House.</p><p>Just a week ago today, Trump gave a red carpet welcome to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, the two met in Alaska, where they spent some six hours on the ground. Trump says they made, quote, great progress, but no deal to end Russia's war on Ukraine.</p><p>Also this week, the president vowed an exclusive order to end mail-in voting, which he falsely claimed is a scam. He says that President Putin agrees with him.</p><p>Meantime, President Trump also says that his plans to expand his law enforcement crackdown in Washington, D.C., to other cities, his announcement, came during a visit to National Guard troops and police in the Capitol Thursday night.</p><p>All of this as Trump escalates his campaign to purge museums, particularly the Smithsonian of materials that conflict with his own political directives.</p><p>Trump claiming they're too focused on highlighting the negative aspects of American history, like for example, how bad slavery was in his words.</p><p>Time now for \"The Exchange.\" Joining us live now is Larry Sabato, director of the center of politics at the University of Virginia and co-author of the \"Campaign of Chaos: Trump, Biden and Harris, and the 2024 American Election.\" Larry, thank you so much for being with us.</p><p>What I think is really interesting is that all the things that I just laid out there, whether it's this move to sort of push to end mail-in voting, whether it's, you know, talking about the Smithsonian Museum trying to rein them in because they're focused, quote-unquote, on how bad slavery was, whether it's, you know, targeting John Bolton's home, for example, they all seem very different, but you can tie them all together under the theme of this president making several pushes to become that much more authoritarian in his approach. Just give us your take on that.</p><p>[12:35:10]</p><p>LARRY SABATO, DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER OF POLITICS, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA: Well, that's absolutely correct, Zain. It seems every day Trump and his key deputies travel further down the authoritarian highway and they want to control information. They want to have universities and law firms and the news media bend the knee to Donald Trump to do what he wants them to do and to say what he wants them to say.</p><p>All of this is not completely unprecedented in American history, but to this degree involving so many institutions, so many avenues of national influence, all at once, this is unprecedented.</p><p>ASHER: I think what's interesting also is how the Democrats try to fight back. I mean, in the case of John Bolton, I mean, obviously, he didn't have many friends on -- on either side of the aisle, not -- especially not Democrats.</p><p>But just in terms of other areas. When you -- when we talked earlier this week about redistricting, for example, that's been a theme, especially given what's happening in Texas, in the political media. California, you know, tried to sort of fight back. You've got Gavin Newsom being very vocal about that.</p><p>But when it comes to mail-in ballots, for example, how are Democrats supposed to really rise up and fight this president on that?</p><p>SABATO: They're probably going to have to depend on the courts because it is absolutely unconstitutional for the president to issue an executive order, making the states do A, B, C, D in organizing their elections. It is very clear in the Constitution that this is the state's responsibility.</p><p>Congress has authorized to issue certain standards in legislation that can apply to the 50 states. The president has no role in it whatsoever, rather than maybe to sign a bill, if anything ever passes Congress.</p><p>So, again, this is unprecedented. He -- he doesn't care. Trump doesn't care what the law is or what the Constitution says. He's going to do what he wants to do. And he hopes that he can draw this out as he does in so many other areas, like lawsuits, and eventually win, if only by tiring out the opposition.</p><p>ASHER: One of the things about what's happening with John Bolton's home and the raid is that obviously we heard President Trump speaking earlier, and he said a few things that surprised people.</p><p>The first -- the first thing was this idea that he knew nothing about it. I think a lot of people are very skeptical about that. People are viewing this through the lens of political retribution, but he also referred to himself as the nation's chief law enforcement officer, which is a title that's typically reserved for the attorney general, Pam Bondi.</p><p>And then he also said that he expects the Justice Department to brief him on what's happening with John Bolton later today. Again, a lot of people raising their eyebrows on that, which really just tells you the lens through which Donald Trump is viewing this particular case.</p><p>SABATO: Oh, absolutely. Well -- well, he loves titles, and he loves prizes. So, you know, it's not the Nobel Prize. It's knowing what's happening to all of his enemies.</p><p>Look, this isn't called the administration of revenge and retribution for nothing. I would add petty as well. He's the opposite of what Nixon learned during Watergate and -- and told in his last speech.</p><p>But, you know, what it -- what it really comes down to is the election next year. Either the voters turn one piece of American government over to Trump's opposition being the House of Representatives, or Trump will have unfettered access to more and more power and will move down that authoritarian highway almost every day of his second term. Who knows where we'll be by 2028?</p><p>ASHER: All right. Larry Sabato, co-author of \"Campaign of Chaos: Trump, Biden, Harris in the 2024 American Election.\" Thank you so much. Have a good weekend.</p><p>SABATO: Thank you, Zain.</p><p>ASHER: The U.S. Democrats scored a win in California on Thursday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: That's Governor Gavin Newsom signing a trio of redistricting bills that could give Democrats five more seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. He brought the legislation forward in a bid to fight back against Texas Republicans who have redrawn the congressional maps to net their own five seats in the House.</p><p>The Texas Senate could pass legislation today. Newsom had appointed had pointed -- had a pointed message, rather, about what Republicans and U.S. President Donald Trump are trying to do.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA): He's trying to rig the election. He's trying to set up the conditions where he can claim that the elections were not one fair and square. Open your eyes to what is going on in the United States of America in 2025. That's what this is about.</p><p>[12:40:03]</p><p>We're responding what occurred in Texas. We're neutralizing what occurred and we're giving the American people a fair chance.</p><p>Because when all things are equal, we're all playing by the same set of rules. There's no question that the Republican Party will be the minority party in the House of Representatives next year.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: New democratic seats are not a done deal. California citizens still need to vote on whether to allow lawmakers to withdraw the maps.</p><p>All right. Breaking news into CNN. Canada says it will remove many retaliatory tariffs on American goods. That's according to Prime Minister Mark Carney. It's seen as a goodwill gesture to jumpstart stalled trade talks. This comes a day after Carney spoke to Donald Trump.</p><p>Paula Newton joins us live now with details.</p><p>So, we know that Carney is actually going to be keeping in place 25 percent tariffs on American steel and aluminum. But the fact that he's getting rid of these retaliatory tariffs in general, is this Carney capitulating to the U.S. president?</p><p>PAULA NEWTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: 1One hundred percent, Zain. You know, reading the -- the -- reading the writing on the wall as it were and perhaps a bit too late.</p><p>I do want to point out to viewers that, look, it was only Canada and China that actually retaliated against the United States.</p><p>And Prime Minister Carney has been saying for several weeks now, then when -- and looking at the let's say European deal or the Japanese deal that the White House has already negotiated, that they need to really approach this differently.</p><p>The president is not letting go of his determination to make sure that tariffs re-shore a lot of manufacturing to the United States and also raise money. And for that reason, Mark Carney is saying he chooses to now concentrate on sectoral tariffs, right? The very high tariffs on automobile, steel and aluminum, but also to really concentrate on that all- important free trade deal between Mexico, Canada and the United States, which is set to be negotiated next year -- renegotiated next year, Zain.</p><p>No one wants that touch. The Prime Minister made the claim in saying that look, the vast majority, well over 90 percent of the goods going from Canada to the United States go in with either no tariff or a very low tariff and Canada being a much smaller economy here, one-tenth the size of the United States really needs to hang on to that kind of a trade deal.</p><p>So as you said, Zain, a gesture of goodwill, but also a huge dose of reality for the Canadian economy.</p><p>And, Zain, look, for all the damage that Canada wants to do or retaliate to the United States, Canadians themselves have pretty much taken this into their own hands. They are not buying American products when they can avoid it. They are not traveling to the United States. They are choosing to vacation elsewhere. And that has already done more damage to the American economy than any of these retaliatory tariffs could have.</p><p>ASHER: Well, that's such a good point. Paula Newton live for us there.

Authorities say the firefighter suffered severe burns but survived.</p><p>More than 1,600 firefighters are battling several wildfires in central and northern Portugal. The fires have killed at least three people this past week. Officials in Europe estimate that about 274,000 hectares or 677,000 acres of vegetation have burned. This is southern Europe's worst fire season in 20 years.</p><p>[12:50:05]</p><p>We'll be right back with more after this short break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ASHER: All right. Let's take a look and see where the Dow is at. You can see it's been firmly in the green pretty much all morning. Up about 900 points. U.S. markets are up sharply on the news, from the Federal Reserve Chair, who gave hints that he could be in favor of a rate cut in September at their next meeting on September 17th.</p><p>Jerome Powell was speaking at the annual Jackson Hole Symposium, where he talked about inflation still being a threat in this country.</p><p>Also, additional risks for the labor market as well. We saw that jobs report that we got just a few weeks ago being pretty low. Seventy-three thousand jobs added in August. And then on top of that, several downward revisions for the prime months as well.</p><p>So him saying that essentially he is in support of a rate cut. Two, obviously Donald Trump has clashed with Jerome Powell many times because of the president pressuring him to cut interest rates. But the Fed Chair saying that if he does cut interest rates, it will not be because of pressure from the U.S. president.</p><p>An Australian postman is being called a hero for an act of kindness that can only be fully appreciated by those who dry their clean laundry in the sun.</p><p>Kaitlyn Smith from Australia's 9 Network explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAITLYN SMITH, NINE NEWS REPORTER (voice-over): Going above and beyond the call of duty, this Logan Mailman spotted swapping parcels for pegs, rescuing Verrity Wandel's washing in the middle of a downpour.</p><p>[12:55:05]</p><p>WANDEL: And then I drove in and there was no washing on the line and I went, did I hang it out?

For verification, please check the corresponding audio file on the podcast's website.]<br/><br/>ALLIE JAYNES: Hi, I'm Allie Jaynes, in for Jayme Poisson.<br/><br/>SOUNDCLIP<br/><br/>NARRATOR: And looking back on the summer, I think I know now what the magic of childhood is. It's the intensity of it. Its vividness. The fact that almost everything is being experienced for the first time. But not as it's felt by the child, but as it's remembered by us when we're older. When it's been transformed by memory, transformed into something to be hoped for again.</p><p><br/><br/>AJ: That's the conclusion of an episode of The Candid Eye, a documentary series on CBC that aired in 1958, called \"Memory of Summer.\" The goal of this episode was to capture the magic of childhood as the host followed a group of children around while they spent their summer outdoors.<br/><br/>SOUNDCLIP<br/><br/>NARRATOR: They are random atoms, I thought. Free; unconstrained by the world around them. How marvelous it must be to be so completely a child of nature.<br/><br/>AJ: Nearly 70 years later, that's still the ideal. Summer in Canada is a time for kids to play outside, explore nature, get as much fresh air as possible before being stuffed back into their classrooms for the school year. At least on the good days.<br/><br/>SOUNDCLIP<br/><br/>REPORTER 1: Sweltering heat mixed with drought has left much of the country scorched and tinder-dry.<br/><br/>REPORTER 2: Toronto currently ranks second on the global ranking for worst air quality.<br/><br/>REPORTER 3: A wall of flames engulfing fire crews in northern Saskatchewan.<br/><br/>REPORTER 4: The wildfire crisis in eastern Newfoundland is deepening.<br/><br/>REPORTER 5: Scorching, sweaty, and punishingly humid. It's the first taste of extreme heat this summer.<br/><br/>AJ: It can be hard to capture just how consistent and persistent extreme summer weather has been lately in this country, but I bet you've noticed. This summer has been Canada's second worst fire season on record. The ones that first dominated the headlines were in Saskatchewan, Northern Ontario, and most critically, Manitoba. On May 13th, a couple were killed about an hour northeast of Winnipeg.<br/><br/>SOUNDCLIP<br/><br/>REPORTER 6: It's the same area where Sue and Rich Nowell, shown here with their sons, were trapped on their property by a fast-moving fire and died.<br/><br/>AJ: A state of emergency was declared there in late May that lasted until the end of June. About 22,000 people were evacuated from their homes and communities. The CBC's Zubina Ahmed spoke with Brandon Perry from Flin Flon after he arrived in Winnipeg.<br/><br/>SOUNDCLIP<br/><br/>BRANDON PERRY: Now, a little distraught, because everything happened so fast. But I don't know, trying to keep hopes high and hopefully we have a home to go back to.<br/><br/>SERENA MOORE: I'm glad I'm here, but I'm very tired. We're all very tired.<br/><br/>AJ: This is Serena Moore from Pukatawagan First Nation.<br/><br/>SOUNDCLIP<br/><br/>SERENA MOORE: It was very hard, and there was lots of smoke. You couldn't even go out. And staying inside was worse.<br/><br/>AJ: Then, a few weeks later:<br/><br/>SOUNDCLIP<br/><br/>WAB KINEW: At 12:01 p.m. today, we declared a provincial state of emergency.<br/><br/>REPORTER 7: Manitoba's premier again declaring a state of emergency to secure accommodations for new evacuees.<br/><br/>AJ: When Premier Wab Kinew made that announcement, there were about 13,000 evacuees scattered throughout the province. In B.C., while this wildfire season may not have been quite as dramatic as in some years, fires have burned in areas where you don't normally see them, like the one that crews are currently fighting near Port Alberni on Vancouver Island.<br/><br/>SOUNDCLIP<br/><br/>NEWS PRESENTER: The B.C. Wildfire Service describes this blaze as aggressive and explosive. The agency says the extreme fire behaviour is unusual for Vancouver Island...<br/><br/>AJ: Where it's also unusual? The Maritimes.<br/><br/>SOUNDCLIP<br/><br/>DARRIN BENT, Mayor: Well, right now I'm sitting in an evacuation alert zone here in Conception Bay South. We have about 10,000 of our residents on evacuation alert.<br/><br/>AJ: Newfoundland and Labrador has been battling various wildfires since May, but things really ramped up there in early August. The Kingston fire, burning on Newfoundland's north shore, has destroyed at least 100 homes.<br/><br/>SOUNDCLIP<br/><br/>SUSAN ROSE, Councillor: What do you say to someone that they lost their home?<br/><br/>REPORTER 8: This town councillor spent the day telling people their homes are gone.<br/><br/>SUSAN ROSE, Councillor: We have people here with not five cents in their pocket, and that to me is heartbreaking.<br/><br/>AJ: When another forest fire broke out in Paddy's Pond near St. John's, the province had to divert water bombers away from the north shore to save the capital.<br/><br/>SOUNDCLIP<br/><br/>CURTIS PENNEY, Western Bay resident: Unfortunately, with the way the wind was blowing that day, when they pulled the water bombers to attack Paddy's Pond, the fire erupted into an inferno and pretty much cleaned out my community.<br/><br/>AJ: As fires rage and evacuation orders climb in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, both provinces are limiting where people can go outdoors.<br/><br/>SOUNDCLIP<br/><br/>REPORTER 9: Crown lands are off limits in New Brunswick.<br/><br/>SUSAN HOLT, N.B. Premier: Get out of the woods, and stay out of the woods.<br/><br/>REPORTER 9: This, just days after Nova Scotia issued a similar ban. No hiking, camping, fishing or ATV use in the forest. Those who don't comply face a $25,000 fine.<br/><br/>AJ: But even those Canadians who haven't faced the fires head on have noticed their impacts.<br/><br/>SOUNDCLIP<br/><br/>REPORTER 10: That smoke seen throughout much of Canada. Saskatoon, Montreal, Toronto, all blanketed. People being warned to limit their time outdoors.<br/><br/>REPORTER 11: Toronto's air quality has been among the worst of any major city in the world over the past three days.<br/><br/>AJ: And then of course, there's the heat.<br/><br/>SOUNDCLIP<br/><br/>REPORTER 12: The rising temperatures broke more than 60 records across Canada in places like Baie-Comeau, Quebec; Edmundston, New Brunswick; and Happy Valley-Goose Bay in Newfoundland and Labrador.<br/><br/>DAVID PHILLIPS, Climatologist: This is like the dress rehearsal, a dry run of what we're going to see that will be normal in 2050.<br/><br/>AJ: Was summer like this when you were a kid? How often were you outdoors? In a playground, on a basketball court, in a lake or a forest? How often were you told that it was too hot to play outside or the air too dangerous to breathe? What will our children's memories of summer be? A season to be hoped for or a season of dread? Today, we're joined by Denise Balkissoon. She's the executive editor of The Narwhal, an investigative journalism website that focuses on environmental reporting. And she has a piece out today titled, \"I have seasonal depression in the summer now.\" We're going to talk to her about how Canadian summer is not necessarily the carefree season it once was for many -- including children -- and how to navigate the ambient dread of our country's changing climate.<br/><br/>[Music: Theme]<br/><br/>AJ: Hi Denise, thanks so much for being here.<br/><br/>DENISE BALKISSOON: Thanks for having me.<br/><br/>AJ: So you wrote this piece last summer that really stuck with me, where you talked about struggling with whether or not to keep your kid home from soccer that week when the temperatures were hitting like 40 degrees. And I've just spent several minutes in the intro talking about, I mean, major emergency horrors: people having to evacuate their homes, not knowing if and when they'll even be able to go back. But today I do also want to talk about all of the little ways that this extreme weather is touching everyone's life in Canada this summer. You know, even those of us who are sheltered from the worst of it for now. And so talk to me a bit about the kinds of, like, little day-to-day decisions that you're having to make right now about how to allow your kid to enjoy summer.<br/><br/>DENISE BALKISSOON: I mean, we had this same issue this summer with outdoor camps. I, you know, very optimistically, in February or March signed up for two weeks of outdoor soccer camp. My kid is obsessed with soccer. But both of those weeks of camps happened during, you know, weeks where the weather report was \"Feels like 38 degrees Celsius.\" And the camp, especially one of them, was not prepared at all. They didn't even have a shade tent, like not even one. So then it's like ad hoc parent activism: finding a shade tent, putting it up; reprimanding, you know, the poor teenagers running the camp who are just doing what they're told. And so it was deciding again, is it okay to send your kid in that weather? Am I a bad mom for doing that? Am I a worse mom if I just keep them at home? Like you want your kid to be active, right, and the internet is also sometimes a scary place. So we had those kinds of conversations all summer, especially because it's relatively new for us here in southern Ontario, although other parts of Canada have dealt with this for many, many years. But there's a lot of smoke in the air this year, too. And so that, that made it harder as well.<br/><br/>AJ: Mm-hmm. I mean, beyond those soccer camps, you know, talk to me about how your own summer plans have been changed this summer by the smoke and the heat.<br/><br/>DENISE BALKISSOON: Sure. Well, my husband's family has a very unfancy cottage. It does not have air conditioning or even ceiling fans. And we had to cut our trip there short because it was-- they have a Fahrenheit thermometer. It was 85 degrees inside the cottage at 10 p.m. So nobody could sleep so we had to come home a day early. We went camping on Lake Erie with some friends, which we do every summer; we've done for 10 years in a row except for 2020. And one of my kid's friends had a tick that, you know, he had to pull off her and then you have to worry about that.<br/><br/>SOUNDCLIP<br/><br/>REPORTER 13: Warmer winters mean more ticks survive the cold. Ideally, it stays above four degrees for them. So longer springs and falls give them extra time to feed and breed.<br/><br/>DENISE BALKISSOON: We are still going to the Kawartha Lakes this weekend, but that was looking kind of dicey last week because there was a fire there that has thankfully been put under control. And so it's just these minute-to-minute decisions, which, you know, as you said in the opener, this is nothing. There are people that have to leave their homes. So, I'm not trying to overblow it. It's more that it's not as simple as it used to be to just be, like, summer, carefree, fun.<br/><br/>[music]<br/><br/>AJ: Obviously, you know, this isn't just about lakes and forests and those kind of like great outdoors kind of spaces. Like when you think about summer in big cities in Canada, especially Montreal and Toronto, you know, it's like we wait all winter through the sucky weather and everyone being inside and miserable, to finally get to summer, and the cities just explode with life. Like we've got [DENISE: Mm-hmm.] street festivals, markets, concerts, outdoor sporting events. You know, people hanging out in the parks. It's like, this is what, you know, we live for all year is like that excitement of really like outdoor, vibrant city life. And, you know, if you look, for example, at the August long weekend this year, you know, Caribana was going on in Toronto, the Osheaga Music Festival in Montreal, and both cities were smoky and blistering hot. And, like, obviously it makes those things so much harder to like physically endure, let alone enjoy. So, you know, how do you think this is impacting our enjoyment of city life?<br/><br/>DENISE BALKISSOON: Well, one thing that I personally learned from COVID is that you need to get outside no matter what the weather. So I think the evolution will be learning to enjoy different seasons a bit more and appreciating them a bit more and appreciating the cold a bit more. I have a column in The Narwhal this week about just how much I used to actually hate winter and now I really think it's a beautiful time. And so I think if I can put a tiny positive spin on it, just appreciating the rest of the year. But it is going to be-- for people that make their livelihoods on outdoor concerts and things like that, the planning is going to be really difficult. I mean, they were deciding in the Prairies whether or not to hold all sorts of sporting events and festivals. I have no idea how we're going to have the World Cup here in North America in the summer. I don't want people to just do the same thing they've always done and then, you know, have a bunch of fainting and medical emergencies. My family is Trinidadian, so I go to Caribana. And actually this year there wasn't as much emergency response, but last year it was just like stretcher after stretcher of person who was clearly-- you know, had heat exhaustion or hadn't drank enough water. You know, I also think, like, adaptation is something that we need to do, and we need to do on a societal level, not just an individual level. And for me, being outside when it's that hot instead of retreating into air conditioning is understanding that the world's changing. Just facing it and dealing with the sadness that that brings. But maybe, hopefully, that will lead more people to be like, actually, can we do something about this?<br/><br/>AJ: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. I mean, when you talk about adaptation, you know, when you were mentioning this soccer camp and how woefully unprepared they are, like obviously this is just a little soccer camp, but if you're looking at, like, you know, so many school boards across the country have issues where there isn't air conditioning in the schools. And like kids are out in July and August, but like, a lot of daycares, including my kid's daycare, are in TDSB schools.<br/><br/>SOUNDCLIP<br/><br/>REPORTER 14: Only 30 percent of Toronto schools have central air. The rest must rely on fans and open windows. On hot and smoky days, schools face an impossible choice: open windows and let in toxic air, or shut them and swelter.<br/><br/>AJ: But it's also a problem in Quebec schools where the heat can also be sweltering. It's increasingly a concern in B.C., which is a place where, you know, for a long time people haven't needed air conditioning, but increasingly they're needing it. You know, earlier this summer during the first heat wave in Toronto, the city actually had to close five outdoor pools.<br/><br/>SOUNDCLIP<br/><br/>REPORTER 15: According to city staff, the intermittent closures were necessary in order to let lifeguards cool down following provincial requirements related to heat and humidex levels exceeding 45.<br/><br/>AJ: Which is obviously ironic because that's a place that anyone in the city can go to cool down for free. But, like, there's a million examples I could give. But how concerned are you with the ways that Canadian cities and provinces are adapting their infrastructure to keep people safe, especially kids?<br/><br/>DENISE BALKISSOON: I mean, I'm extremely concerned. My kid is in a TDSB school. It was 33 degrees at 8 a.m. one of the weeks, because their teacher had a thermometer in there. I think it's absolutely outrageous that the province has not planned for better air conditioning in schools, in long-term care homes, you know, all these places where vulnerable populations are. It's very clear that fossil fuels are what is causing climate change. And so, therefore, I think it's very clear where the money for this mitigation should come from. And for governments to just not deal with it, it makes me really frightened, you know? And there's a teacher that I know in the TDSB where she found an elementary school kid just wandering the halls in a heat exhaustion daze. And I really fear that what it's going to take to get some movement on that is hospital visits or even the death of a child. Because I don't know what it is we're pretending. Like it's not going to change. And if we don't deal with it incrementally, which, you know, the time for that has kind of passed, but if you make a plan to do however many schools a year, that's so much more achievable than just getting to the point that we're at now where there's nothing. And our kids lost so much schooling during COVID. And are we now going to close because of extreme heat too? It's, it's pretty shameful, actually.<br/><br/>[music]<br/><br/>AJ: When we look at fires, there's a real shortage of water bombers in this country. Manitoba, for example, has had an order for three new water bombers that won't be fulfilled until 2031. Earlier this summer, the chief of Pukatawagan First Nation in northern Manitoba told CBC that the community was having to resort to using the hoses that they normally use to flood the hockey rink to stave off a major forest fire. And so, do you think, you know, is enough being done by various levels of government to adapt to the fact that these fires aren't a one-off, freak event anymore? Like this is the reality of summer in this country now?<br/><br/>DENISE BALKISSOON: I mean, I think the answer is clearly not. I think... I think that there probably are, especially inside the fire services themselves, there is year-round planning. You know, we've done enough wildfire coverage to know that there are people that think about this year-round. But if we don't have the resources, then what good is that planning? And I think actually the equipment is not even the first thing. I think the personnel is the first thing. Like here in Ontario, our fire service is understaffed by hundreds of people in Northern Ontario. And so that also means that those need to be jobs that people are willing to do. These are skilled jobs that people deserve real salaries for and they're taking care of everyone. And again, yeah, I find it quite shameful actually that we're pretending that that's not going to be the way things are from now on.<br/><br/>AJ: You know, we know that in so many ways, low-income and racialized communities are hit by all of this the hardest. You know, in cities, low-income neighbourhoods are less likely to have shade. Lower-income renters are much less likely to have air conditionings in their homes. Many Indigenous communities, as we've been talking about in Canada's North, are regularly facing evacuations from fires. You know, talk to me about how unequally people across this country, and again, kids across this country, are experiencing this.<br/><br/>DENISE BALKISSOON: I think the fact that First Nations are on the front lines of wildfire evacuations is pretty well established at this point. It's really hard to say exactly what the solution is in a proactive way. I mean, do we need better firefighting capability? 100%. What does it actually mean to mitigate fire in the short term? There are prescribed burns happening more. You know, it's so ironic this is what Indigenous communities have done for centuries, if not millennia, and because we ignored their wisdom, this is part of the reason that things have gotten so bad. And so now we are finally going a little bit back towards that way. But in the meantime, we have all these emergencies. In Ontario, there has been a movement to have a maximum temperature in buildings, in rental units, the same way that there was a minimum temperature for many years because we know that cold is bad for people's health; not safe to be in. The Ontario government has really resisted passing that. There is one municipality, which is Mississauga, that has mandated maximum temperature as of 2020. And it is that a unit cannot exceed 26 degrees Celsius. And so that means whether it's through air conditioning or some other means, a landlord has a responsibility to make sure that it doesn't go over 26. We also reported on a community in St. James Town, where, you know, it's a really old apartment building, and even if people have air conditioners, they can't always afford to run them. And there might not be an understanding of how dangerous extreme heat can be. And so they have what they call community activators, I believe, who go from unit to unit to explain to people that like when it's hot, if you cannot afford to keep your unit cool, you have to leave. You have to go to the library, you have to go to the park. You need to be cool, it's dangerous for your health to stay. And I think that's the kind of program that really needs to be replicated in every urban community. Because if people don't know then they won't take care of themselves. And then we'll have, as you said, in Montreal there's seniors that die every year in really old rental buildings -- that were made to keep us warm, right? Like, traditionally, Canada is a place where that is our biggest concern: are people warm enough? And now our buildings just aren't ready.<br/><br/>[music]<br/><br/>AJ: Just zooming out for a minute. So I didn't have my first kid till 38. I'm pregnant now at 41 with my second. And honestly, the main reason that I held off and deliberated for so long on even having kids was the prospect of bringing new life into a world on fire. And, I mean, I'm incredibly glad that I decided to go for it. But I still have to deal every day with the grief of watching my kid grow up in a world where... it's normal for his daycare to have to keep kids inside at playtime because of the heat; where we have to cut our time short at the playground because the air quality is some of the worst in the world. And where I know that like this is just the beginning. Like he's going to be growing up in something, I mean, way worse than what we're seeing right now. And I mean, how are you kind of dealing with just the reality of living in that day-to-day grief, especially as a parent?<br/><br/>DENISE BALKISSOON: Um. I mean, some days it's harder than others, for sure. I personally am very lucky in terms of climate grief specifically, that I get to spend my day with a group of incredibly smart people trying to bring as much information as we can to people in Canada about these things. Because I don't want... I don't want there to be a sense of paralysis, right? So we cannot play down the reality, which is we are on a very long trajectory of warming, and that is going to change the world. It is changing the world. But it's not inevitable that it keeps getting worse and worse and worse. We also try to like really point out that there have been very big environmental issues that have been, like, actively reversed, you know, in our lifetimes. And so that includes we used to have smog days all the time in Ontario, and then we phased out coal plants. We used to have a hole in the ozone layer, and like, a Conservative prime minister and a Conservative American president are the ones that decided that they were going to deal with that problem. We used to spray DDT on crops, and bald eagles were almost endangered because it thinned their eggs and there weren't any bald eagles being born, and now they're resurging. And so, you know, we run a lot of stories about Indigenous-led conservation, about people who, you know, their homelands already were destroyed and their environments already were destroyed, and here they are, generations later, insisting on taking care of them.<br/><br/>AJ: Something I think that a lot of parents also grapple with is how you actually talk about all of this with your kids, you know, regardless of their age, really. Like, I mean, in my case, my son is two and a half. It's not like he understands any of this. But still, we'll be outside, and I'll kind of have to remark on how smoky it is. And he'll be like, oh, yeah, very smoky. But it's not that he attaches any value judgment to that. He's just experiencing it. It's just his reality, which obviously is disturbing on its own. But, you know, as kids get older and they understand more that this is not normal, that this is a problem, how do you think that we should be talking to them about what's going on?<br/><br/>DENISE BALKISSOON: I don't know. That one I really don't know, especially because, um, my kid's 11 and quite sensitive, and so we actually don't listen to CBC Radio. My husband and I listen to them as podcasts. Because there was just a time where it was very clear that the news was affecting them in a way that they were not mature enough to, you know, like, filter. And so I think, again, for me, at least I can say I'm doing my best. I think it's important for kids also to know that there are... [emotional] there are people working on this every day. [sniffs] But also, it's not fair. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know what we say to our kids, actually. And I think that there are people that are really avoiding thinking about that or thinking about, you know, their culpability or their accountability. Because that question is kind of impossible to answer.<br/><br/>[music]<br/><br/>AJ: In the piece that you just published in The Narwhal, you talk about this dystopian novel Juice by the Australian author Tim Winton. And talk to me about like the general themes in this book, because I think it actually really relates to, you know, what we were just talking about, about kids experiencing this as their normal reality.<br/><br/>DENISE BALKISSOON: Yeah, so it's set a couple generations in the future. He's not really clear as to how many, but it is at a point where summer in Australia is unlivable. But it's when he's, I guess, like a teenager. He comes to understand that the world wasn't always like this, and that it was made this way by a technology or emissions that people knew were making the world warmer, hotter, inhospitable, and that the families or the corporations that made billions of dollars off of fossil fuels have made so many billions that even these many generations later, there are people that live hidden away in these bunkers all over the world, in air conditioning, leading still very weird lives, but at least safer, you know, and cooler. And so then he's invited to join basically a force of assassins that finds them and kills them out of revenge. Not to make the world better, that's all over. Now it's just like being really, really angry. I'm not into assassination, genuinely, but the book really does tap into an anger that I think is kind of important, because I think it's really easy to feel sad and quite frankly depressed and have all that grief. But if we don't have anywhere to put it, it only harms us, right? Whereas if we put our anger somewhere or, you know, even our love for our kids and for the natural world and all the beauty that's there, if we have somewhere to put it, I don't-- that's the thing that needs to happen. But I think this is the first time that I really read like an artistic treatment of climate that was just so quite frankly pissed off. I appreciated it.<br/><br/>AJ: I mean, talk to me more about that catharsis. Like you sort of touched on this already, but talk to me more about how that sort of has helped you kind of take this grief and think about like how to channel it into something productive.<br/><br/>DENISE BALKISSOON: You know, I think we are very much encouraged not to think of climate change as being a decision that is being made by really a very small handful of actual human beings, right? Like sure, people drive cars. We're very adamant at The Narwhal that we are not hard on people -- we are hard on systems. And so I'm not even talking about like your day-to-day oil and gas worker at all. I am talking about people that have known for very many decades where this was going and decided not to pursue other technologies and decided to pursue fortunes that are kind of made up, right? Like after one billion dollars, like what, what are we even talking about here? And there's a real hesitation to just really accept that. And at the very least, if all we're talking about [is] mitigation, if we're not talking about stopping using fossil fuels every-- every single day there's an oil executive from somewhere in the world saying, we're going to be using oil for the foreseeable future, 2050 or whatever. If that is the truth, then okay, that's a public resource and we're making billions of dollars off it. How are we going to keep people safe right now? How are we going to get air conditioning in kindergarten then if that's what we've decided we absolutely are going to do? There's-- it's not like there's no money for that.<br/><br/>AJ: What would you want people to take away from this conversation?<br/><br/>DENISE BALKISSOON: That every single day, there are communities, there are Indigenous communities, there are scientists who are working in ways that seem very small to fix one tiny part of the environment that matters to them. And it's not over yet.<br/><br/>AJ: Denise, thank you so much for this conversation.<br/><br/>DENISE BALKISSOON: Yeah, thanks for asking me. I think it's an important one to have.<br/><br/>[Music: Theme]<br/><br/>AJ: All right, that's all for today. You can find a link to Denise's new piece in The Narwhal in our show notes. I'm Allie Jaynes. Thanks so much for listening to Front Burner, and we'll talk to you tomorrow.<br/><br/>\u00a9 2025 Canadian Broadcasting Corporation<br/><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCBCT-FB2508201</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCBCT2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GJD-2PS3-RRP3-K467-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">487018</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4763\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 CBC/Radio-Canada.

My name is Nick Loris, and I am the Executive Vice President of Policy for the Conservative Coalition for Climate Solutions (C3 Solutions). C3 Solutions is a 501(c)(3) think tank focused on accelerating innovation to meet America's energy needs and environmental ambitions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Efficient permitting processes are crucial to satisfy America's energy and infrastructure demands, as well as its environmental goals. Increasing energy supplies will lower costs for families and businesses while enhancing reliability and maintaining America's leadership as an energy superpower. A clearer, more transparent process for infrastructure projects will maximize taxpayer value and speed up the construction of roads, bridges, ports, and other vital infrastructure. Accelerating forest restoration and conservation efforts will help to reduce the risks and costs associated with wildfires and other ecological challenges.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While many regulatory reforms are necessary at the federal, state, and local levels, one law in desperate need of modernization is the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Enacted in 1970, policymakers designed NEPA to ensure federal projects consider environmental impacts.</p><p>A well-intentioned \"look before you leap\" statute, NEPA has devolved into paralysis by analysis, inviting protracted legal battles.</p><p>With bipartisan, bicameral interest in permitting reform, it is an opportune moment for a policy realignment that focuses on building rather than blocking. Permitting reform must be a policy focus if the U.S. wants to maintain its economic competitiveness, energy dominance, and environmental quality.</p><p>My written testimony consists of the following four sections:</p><p>* The Need: Why permitting reform is essential to meet America's energy and infrastructure needs and environmental objectives.</p><p>* The Problem: Statistics and stories of a well-meaning law gone awry.</p><p>* The Fix: Reforms to innovate, invest, and build for a more prosperous and cleaner future.</p><p>* The Benefits: How permitting reform will benefit families, businesses, project developers, and the environment.</p><p>The Need: Why permitting reform is essential to meet America's energy and infrastructure needs and environmental objectives.</p><p>Projects that require federal permits are critical to many sectors of the U.S. economy. Expedited permitting for natural resource extraction, energy production, minerals, and linear infrastructure enables America to capitalize on its abundance of natural resources while reducing its reliance on adversarial foreign suppliers, such as China and Russia. A well-functioning transportation system is necessary to move products to businesses and consumers across the country, reducing the transportation costs associated with supply. Active land management promotes healthier ecosystems and reduces the risk of extreme weather. A more efficient permitting process will help address these needs.</p><p>Energy Demand is Rising</p><p>The United States is a global leader in energy production. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the United States generated more energy in 2024 than ever before. n1 As reported in the EIA's Monthly Energy Review, natural gas, crude oil, natural gas plant liquids, biofuels, solar, and wind all achieved domestic production records last year. n2 With abundant natural resources and advancements in innovative technologies such as advanced geothermal energy, modular nuclear reactors, and long-duration storage, the United States is well-positioned to maintain and grow its global energy leadership. This is true despite clunky, confusing, and redundant permitting processes that create a massive amount of uncertainty and slow the deployment of innovative, cleaner technologies.</p><p>Despite significant current energy production, the supply of electricity must increase urgently to keep pace with rising demand, primarily driven by the expansion of data centers. Across the U.S., electricity prices are more than double the inflation rate. n3 Although estimates vary, the EIA predicts commercial electricity demand will grow by 3% in 2025 and 4.5% in 2026. Industrial electricity use is expected to grow by 2% and 3.5% during those years. n4 Electricity demand from data centers alone could double by 2030, making up 9 percent of total U.S. consumption-- roughly 6 times the equivalent of New York City's power use. n5</p><p>Reliability is also a concern. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) is sounding the alarm with warnings of future power outages throughout critical regions of the</p><p>United States. n6 As power plants are being retired, utilities are struggling to bring new supplies online. PJM, an electric transmission operator, expressed similar concerns about the slow process of getting new generation online. If energy production can't meet this growing demand, households and businesses will face higher bills, and additional load without new generation will strain the grid.</p><p>The U.S. and global economy will also need more critical minerals. Nearly all the modern technologies Americans depend on, such as cell phones, laptops, appliances, and vehicles, require critical minerals. They serve as the foundation that allows companies to build, manufacture, and innovate. These minerals are vital inputs for producing affordable energy, maintaining stable food supplies, developing defense technologies, and advancing modern medicine. Notably, clean energy technologies require significantly more minerals than traditional ones. Comparing electricity sources to a natural gas-fired power generation, offshore wind is 13 times more mineral-intensive, onshore wind is nearly 9 times more, solar photovoltaics are almost 6 times more, and nuclear power is 4.5 times more. n7 Likewise, electric vehicles demand six times more minerals of concern than vehicles with internal combustion engines. n8</p><p>Liberating the abundance of domestic resources and improving efficiencies for private enterprises will help combat rising prices for mineral commodities, establish more secure supply chains, and diversify away from unethically sourced minerals.</p><p>Reliable Infrastructure is the Backbone of the Economy</p><p>Affordable, reliable transportation is essential for everyday life, and sound transportation policy can have profound positive effects on the economy, the environment, and the lives of all Americans. The transportation sector affects personal comfort, the cost of goods and services for families, and the communities where people choose to live. Cars and trucks provide the means to get to work, take kids to soccer practice, and go on road trips with friends. Freight rail and long-haul trucks connect farmers in the Midwest with grocers in the Southeast. Ships and planes connect American companies with global customers and enable travelers to see parts of the world easily and comfortably that our ancestors could only dream of.</p><p>Often taken for granted, the importance of efficient goods movement became highly evident when the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted U.S. supply chains for years. A complex and resilient network of highways, railroads, waterways, ports, and airports helps keep grocery stores stocked with food, hospitals supplied with medicine, homes powered with reliable energy, and materials available for construction and manufacturing. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, \"the U.S. transportation system moved a daily average of about 55.5 million tons of freight valued at more than $51.2 billion. This is equivalent to approximately 20.2 billion tons or $18.7 trillion of freight moved annually.\" n9</p><p>In addition to meeting families' daily needs and ensuring that Amazon packages arrive promptly at doorsteps, the transportation sector is a significant part of the U.S. economy. Supporting around 16 million jobs in direct and related industries (more than 10 percent of the nation's workforce) n10, the transportation sector contributed $1.8 trillion to the gross domestic product (GDP), accounting for 6.5 percent of the total U.S. GDP. n11</p><p>As policymakers work to strengthen America's infrastructure and decrease the environmental impacts of the sector, permitting reform will enhance supply chains, support American businesses, and improve consumer welfare. Importantly, permitting reform will promote private sector-driven innovation and investments in efficiency, resulting in both economic and environmental gains. Modernizing and eliminating costly, ineffective government-imposed barriers to infrastructure projects will maximize the value of taxpayer-financed projects and help deliver cleaner, more resilient infrastructure.</p><p>Enhancing Conservation Efforts for Healthier Forests and Lands</p><p>Investing in and actively managing America's natural ecosystems will create economic opportunities and reduce environmental liabilities. For instance, the U.S. has approximately 800 million acres of forests, which comprise 7.5% of the world's total forest area. Healthy U.S. forests serve as natural carbon sinks, capable of absorbing 14% of national carbon emissions each year in wood and soils. As a result, forests are a vital part of climate strategies and carbon reduction efforts.</p><p>If not appropriately managed, forests can become a major economic and environmental burden. Wildfires have a significant adverse impact on human health, ecosystems, and the environment. Fires lead to increased exposure to particulate matter, loss of wildlife, plants, habitats, and higher greenhouse gas emissions. They also trigger soil erosion, which can harm watersheds. There are economic and social costs, including children being kept indoors or out of school, businesses shutting down, and communities breaking apart. Even indoor smoke from forest fires poses a problem. More than 100 million Americans were under Air Quality Index Alerts due to smoke drift from historic wildfire activity throughout Canada in 2023. n12</p><p>A single destructive fire can erase years or even decades of climate change efforts. An estimated 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions annually come from wildfires. n13 The Canadian fires in 2023 released more carbon dioxide emissions in less than half a year than Russia and Japan emitted from fossil fuels in all of 2022. n14 California's wildfire season in 2020 wiped out nearly two decades' worth of the state's emissions reductions. n15</p><p>Currently, the Forest Service has an 80-million-acre backlog in need of restoration, and 63 million acres facing high or very high risk of wildfire. As the Forest Service emphasizes, \"Drinking water, homes, communities, wildlife habitat, historic places, sacred sites, recreation opportunities, and scenic vistas are among the many values at risk.\" The most pressing issue for forest managers and communities threatened by wildfires is density and overgrowth, which creates a greater fuel load for fires. Active forest management through prescribed or controlled burns and through timber harvesting will significantly reduce the fuel load. Still, to date, the federal government has only partially implemented recommendations from the Government Accountability Office. n16 Permitting reform will enable forest fire mitigation efforts to occur in a timely and responsible manner.</p><p>The challenge of permitting conservation efforts is not exclusive to America's forests. Maintenance by the National Park Service, rural development (i.e., USDA programs), and water and land conservation efforts can all be delayed by an arduous permitting process and too much litigation. Landowners stand to gain the most from responsible stewardship and have the most to lose from poor management. Natural climate solutions and healthy ecosystems cannot be achieved if America's forests, public lands, and watersheds are treated as museum displays. Instead, they require active attention, investment, and management.</p><p>The Problem: Stories and statistics of a well-meaning law gone awry.</p><p>Whether it is a solar array on federal lands, a freight rail expansion, or a prescribed burn, burdensome permitting processes hinder progress. One of the more significant challenges to more efficient permitting is NEPA.</p><p>How NEPA Works</p><p>NEPA is a procedural law that requires federal agencies to conduct environmental reviews for various projects, such as highways, energy development, federally funded projects, and activities on federal land, among others. The NEPA process begins when a federal agency proposes a major action that could significantly impact the environment. If the environmental impact is unknown and not excluded from consideration under the law, the agency will conduct an Environmental Assessment to determine whether the proposed action will have a significant effect on the environment. If it does not, the agency issues a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI). n17 If the agency knows or determines that there will be significant environmental effects, it must prepare a more comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). n18</p><p>In other instances, projects may be eligible for a \"Categorical Exclusion\" (CE) to allow the project to proceed with minimal paperwork. n19 Agencies may apply a CE in situations where the conditions of a project fit within pre-defined governmental exceptions to NEPA, such as having a small footprint. CEs do not require an EA or EIS, although even CEs can take months or as long as a year, particularly if agencies must consult with other agencies and conduct a public notice and comment period. n20 Agencies can rely on existing NEPA documentation and historical assessments for CEs, and Congress has directed agencies to establish CEs. There are also other instances where CEs have been established in statute. n21</p><p>Trust the Process?</p><p>President Nixon signed NEPA into law over 55 years ago. Since then, many federal, state, and local environmental laws have been enacted and amended. The result is a tangled web of unclear, overlapping, and complex requirements that delays reviews and hinders investment without delivering meaningful environmental benefits. The purpose of the original statute was to \"declare a national policy which will encourage productive and enjoyable harmony between man and his environment.\" n22 In far too many instances, NEPA is failing at both.</p><p>NEPA is often referred to as an \"umbrella law\" to facilitate compliance with all relevant federal environmental laws. While it is challenging to pinpoint NEPA's exact effect on project timelines, more comprehensive reviews and litigation adversely affect permitting timelines. In fact, the mere threat of litigation increases timelines because risk-averse agencies want to guard against lawsuits. Litigation-proofing NEPA analyses adds significant time, pages, and cost to a review without much additional benefit. n23 In fact, with respect to NEPA analyses, one Forest Service Report noted that \"Team members often believe that much of their work is 'for the courts' and not particularly useful for line officers who make decisions.\" n24 Additional challenges at the federal level include differing interpretations of NEPA requirements among agencies, failed interagency coordination, and administrative bottlenecks.</p><p>Anecdotal evidence and agency-wide data from NEPA reviews support these claims. Several studies, including a 2018 report from the Council on Environmental Quality, found that the average time to prepare an EIS was 4.5 years. n25 Out of 1,161 EISs reviewed from 2010 to 2018, 25 percent took more than six years to complete. n26 More recent studies show similar averages, with the Federal Highway Administration reporting an average of 8.6 years as of 2021. n27 Between 1997 and 2022, the average documentation time for EISs increased by 1.5 years. n28</p><p>A recent analysis by the Biden administration's CEQ found that the median time for EISs issued in 2024 was 2.2 years, and from 2019 to 2024, it was 2.8 years. n29 These figures exclude Records of Decision and focus on the Notice of Intent (NOI) to Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS). The median time from NOI to FEIS from 2010 to 2018 was 3.2 years. n30 While the 2025 CEQ report argues that the median time is a more appropriate metric, it is worth noting that 25 percent of EISs took more than 6 years to complete in the 2018 CEQ study, which appears roughly similar in the 2025 study n31</p><p>Agencies deserve praise for streamlining reviews, such as the 2.1-year timeframe for a 472-mile transmission project on BLM land. Other projects, which are much less complex, like the National Wildlife Health Center in Wisconsin or a childcare service center on an Air Force Base in Florida, arguably should not have required a comprehensive EIS and skew the numbers in favor of a faster process. n32 Furthermore, if agencies delay the publication of the NOI, the permits still take as long to prepare, but some of the work has shifted outside the evaluated metric. n33</p><p>Drawn-out NEPA processes disproportionately hinder clean energy development. A 2023 study by the R Street Institute reviewed EISs conducted by the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). DOE had twice as many clean energy projects requiring EISs compared to fossil fuels (36% vs. 18%), while BLM projects had nearly four times the number of clean energy projects compared to fossil fuels (66% vs. 18%). n34 Since fossil fuel projects have established infrastructure and benefit from CEs, it is reasonable to assume that NEPA, as it currently operates, will continue to disadvantage clean energy projects--especially if they are increasingly cost-competitive, are greater in number, and often take up more land.</p><p>Similar frustrations regarding lengthy permitting timelines exist with forest management projects. A 2022 Property and Environment Research Center study found that it takes an average of 3.6 years from start to treatment for mechanical thinning and 4.7 years for prescribed burns. The authors note, \"For projects that require environmental impact statements--the most rigorous form of review--the time from initiation to implementation averages 5.3 years for mechanical treatments and 7.2 years for prescribed burns.\"</p><p>Even after an agency invests substantial time and resources to ensure NEPA-related documents are of sufficient quality to withstand legal scrutiny, litigation can still delay projects for years or even decades. An analysis of 387 NEPA cases brought to court from 2013 to 2022 found that, on average, 4.2 years passed from the publication of the environmental review to the resolution of a legal challenge. n35 While litigation is infrequent, especially when considering all projects and actions impacted by NEPA, it has disproportionately impacted clean energy projects.</p><p>The study also emphasizes the need for reform regarding who should have standing and what challenges they can raise. Of the challenges examined, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) initiated 72 percent, with 10 organizations responsible for more than one-third of the lawsuits. n36 While some lawsuits have legitimate claims (though agencies won 80 percent of appeal cases), NEPA has been weaponized to delay, block, and effectively drain projects--including clean energy development and conservation efforts. n37</p><p>A 2023 Stanford study analyzed a sample of 355 major transportation and energy infrastructure projects from 2010-2018 requiring an EIS, with 28 percent litigated, and 89 percent of those cases alleging a NEPA violation. Solar projects experienced the highest litigation rate, followed by pipelines, transmission lines, and wind energy projects. n38</p><p>There are numerous examples of how NEPA has caused delays in projects, including many clean energy developments and conservation efforts. Jeremiah Johnson, policy director at the Center for New Liberalism, highlighted a few:</p><p>There's the congestion pricing plan in New York which was delayed by NEPA. There's the 1353 pages, 2.5 years, $1 million+ review of adding bike lanes in San Francisco. A $3 billion offshore wind project at Martha's Vineyard was delayed for years due to NEPA. A separate $2.6 billion offshore wind project off Cape Cod was ultimately cancelled after 16 years of legal wrangling. Yet another $3 billion dollar wind project in Wyoming was ultimately approved after 11 years of review process. Hydroelectric dam projects in Oregon have been delayed. A different dam modernization project in Arizona faced a five year delay for review where the executive summary of the EIS is 76 pages long.</p><p>A reservoir expansion in Denver (despite having the NEPA lawsuit ultimately dismissed) was still delayed by 2.5 years. A lake restoration effort in Utah was delayed 5-7 years. California's high speed rail plans were delayed in 2017 by CEQA, and then again in 2019 (California ultimately gave up on connecting San Francisco to Los Angeles with high speed rail). Sometimes it's \"environmental\" groups themselves who use NEPA as a tool to obstruct environmentally friendly projects. These groups used NEPA to attempt to halt a solar power project in California, to sue a different solar project in Nevada, to stop clean hydropower contracts in Maine, and to stop Minneapolis's rezoning initiative.</p><p>The examples are numerous and absurd [...] In one instance a wildfire prevention plan was delayed so long that the impacted forest, which wasn't aware of the importance of bureaucratic process, caught fire and burned 90,000 acres to the ground while the plan to stop said wildfire was still in review. Seattle's light rail expansion, crucial for fighting climate change, was delayed by an 8,000+ page EIS. The federal government can't even install solar panels on the roofs of federal buildings without a NEPA review. n39</p><p>Analysis by the Breakthrough Institute and the Institute for Progress has documented similar instances of stalled and cancelled projects burdened by lengthy processes and litigation. n40</p><p>The Fix: Reforms to innovate, invest, and build for a more prosperous and cleaner future.</p><p>There has been bipartisan support for improving permitting processes, and both Republican and Democratic administrations have acknowledged the need to improve NEPA. Previous congresses and administrations have frequently proposed reforms to NEPA, with varying degrees of success. By narrowing the scope of environmental reviews and reining in the delays imposed by protracted litigation, the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act (H.R. 4776) would help deliver more affordable power, reliable infrastructure, and a healthier environment. The SPEED Act would make several notable changes to the permitting process.</p><p>A More Efficient Process and Clearer Scope</p><p>Section 2 of the SPEED Act would eliminate the need for a NEPA analysis if the proposed agency action is reviewed under another federal statute or if a review by a state or tribal entity serves a purpose that is similar to that of NEPA. This change would not only reduce redundancies but also enable states and tribes to conduct more efficient reviews that better address the needs and concerns of local communities. States, tribes, and local communities have strong incentives to perform environmental reviews effectively because they stand to gain economically when energy, infrastructure, and conservation projects are carried out quickly. At the same time, they face significant environmental risks if the projects are poorly managed.</p><p>Section 2 would narrow the scope of environmental assessment to the \"reasonably close causal relationship to and are proximately caused by\" the project or agency consideration. This would eliminate the need to consider speculative, downstream, and indirect effects, which adds substantial time to the analysis and forces agencies into rabbit holes of \"butterfly effects\" for projects and actions. This was a critical aspect of the recent Supreme Court decision in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, Colorado, that clarified and narrowed the scope of NEPA reviews. In recent testimony, the Permitting Institute's Alexander Herrgott highlighted instances where exhaustive consideration (or failing to do so) added considerable time or sparked lawsuits. For example, a semiconductor plant in Ohio faced a lawsuit for \"failing to analyze indirect emissions from silicon suppliers in Taiwan,\" and a hydrogen hub was questioned for \"its hypothetical impact on fertilizer prices in South America.\" n41</p><p>The bill further narrows the scope and enhances the efficiency of NEPA analyses by expanding the use of categorical exclusions (such as Farm Service Agency loans and loan guarantees), allowing the use of previous studies and data to inform reviews, and clarifying that federal funding through grants, loans, and loan guarantees cannot be the sole basis to trigger a NEPA review.</p><p>Judicial Review</p><p>Section 3 of the SPEED Act would also implement several vital fixes to the judicial review process. The SPEED Act would limit the court's power to invalidate an agency action only if the agency abused its \"substantial discretion,\" and the \"agency would have reached a different result on said action without the abuse.\" The bill states that any inadequate NEPA analysis (such as a deficiency or error in an environmental impact statement) does not require a court to vacate the agency's approval of a project. Instead, the agency's action will remain in effect, and the project can move forward as the agency corrects any errors or deficiencies.</p><p>Regarding legal standing, the Act would require individuals to have actively participated in the NEPA process--such as through public comments--before filing suit, and to demonstrate direct harm, as outlined in the comments. Additionally, the bill shields categorical exclusions from lawsuits. It would also shorten the statute of limitations to 150 days, down from the current 6-year limit.</p><p>Clarification on standing and shortening the statute of limitations preserves citizens' and communities' right to challenge a project in court without misusing the process or imposing a constant threat of lawsuit on a developer for years. Genuine community engagement and addressing legitimate concerns are essential to the permitting process, but they can be conducted more reasonably and efficiently.</p><p>The Benefits: How permitting reform will benefit families, businesses, project developers, and the environment.</p><p>Measuring the overall costs of an outdated, bureaucratic permitting process is challenging, just as quantifying the total benefits of a modernized, streamlined process is. Projects that could have saved forests, lowered energy bills, and reduced emissions have never come to fruition. Additionally, it is challenging to determine the number of developers who avoided building on federal land because it would trigger certain requirements; however, instances of \"jurisdiction shopping\" do exist. n42 However, there are clear benefits to a more efficient process, including:</p><p>* Greater Certainty. Businesses seek certainty, but permitting processes and engagement with federal agencies often feel like a regulatory black box with uncertain yet seemingly increased potential for litigation. A more transparent and predictable process that enhances judicial review will help provide the certainty American businesses need to innovate, invest, and build.</p><p>* Saving Time, Money, and Taxpayer Resources. Lengthy permitting processes and extended legal battles can cost project developers significantly. For example, Williams CEO Alan Armstrong recently stated that the permitting cost for one of his company's pipelines was twice the construction cost itself. n43 With Environmental Assessments (EAs) costing hundreds of thousands of dollars and Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) costing millions, the total expenses have reached hundreds of millions, which are ultimately passed on to consumers. Permitting reform will help ensure that energy and infrastructure projects are completed on time and within budget, which is crucial not only for private sector development but also for federally funded projects.</p><p>* American families and businesses. Along with deploying shovel-ready jobs and injecting investment and capital into the U.S. economy, American consumers will benefit from increased energy supplies, more resilient infrastructure, and the deployment of more innovative technologies. Promising innovations will generate tremendous positive economic spillovers for the American people, and they should not be stuck in permitting purgatory.</p><p>* Greater Transparency and Accountability. Although clear evidence indicates that NEPA extends project development timelines, it is also true that in many cases, the data is fragmented, outdated, or missing. Some agencies do a better job than others at documenting the paperwork required by NEPA. In other instances, agencies can grant categorical exclusions without needing any paperwork. Improved data and reporting would provide a clearer picture of the full costs of NEPA delays, the economic opportunities that projects and actions facing NEPA could deliver, and the specific bottlenecks caused by the NEPA process.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>In recent years, books, podcasts, and organizations have embraced an \"abundance\" movement toimprove the planet and the lives of its inhabitants. Across the ideological spectrum, people working in the private sector, government, academia, and journalism are coming together to recognize that we need more affordable energy, food, and housing, as well as reliable infrastructure, along with more innovation that drives technological progress for the betterment of society and a healthier, safer environment. This is especially true in an era of elevated inflation. A common thread that joins the abundance left and the abundance right is the need for permitting reform. To power our nation's growth, provide energy security, meet our environmental objectives, and maintain our global competitiveness, policy reform must empower companies to build.

According to news reporting originating from Tehran, Iran, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"This study aimed to enhance the accuracy of forest fire susceptibility mapping (FSM) by innovatively applying recursive feature elimination (RFE) with an ensemble of machine learning models, specifically Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF), to identify key fire factors. The fire zones were derived from MODIS satellite imagery from 2012 to 2017.\" </p><p><br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from University of Tehran: \"Further validation of these data has been provided by field surveys and reviews of land records in rangelands and forests; a total of 326 fire points were determined in this study. Seventeen factors involving topography, geomorphology, meteorology, hydrology, and human factors were identified as being effective primary factors in triggering and spreading fires in the selected mountainous case study area. As a first step, the RFE models RF, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost were used to identify important fire factors among all selected primary factors. The SVM and RF models were applied once on all factors and secondly on those derived from the RFE model as the key factors in FSM. Training and testing data were divided tenfold, and the model's performance was evaluated using cross-validation. Various metrics, including recall, precision, F1 score, accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC), and Kappa, were employed to measure the performance of the models.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The assessments demonstrate that leveraging RFE models enhances the FSM results by identifying key factors and excluding unnecessary ones. Notably, the SVM model exhibits significant improvement, achieving an increase of over 10.97% in accuracy and 8.61% in AUC metrics. This improvement underscores the effectiveness of the RFE approach in enhancing the predictive performance of the SVM model.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Evaluating the Impact of Recursive Feature Elimination on Machine Learning Models for Predicting Forest Fire-Prone Zones.

And because each detection is about the size of 26 football fields, it can represent part of a much larger blaze, said James MacCarthy, wildfire research manager at Global Forest Watch.</p><p>Based on data from the <url normalizedValue=\"https://ciffc.net/\">Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre</url>, about 200 fires are actively burning in Canada and have consumed about 7,700 square miles (19,900 square kilometers) of terrain, most of it in the last week.</p><p>Only 2023 saw such high numbers so early in Canada's fire season, which runs from April through October. That year wildfires burned a record 67,000 square miles - more than twice the surface area of Lake Superior, the largest of the Great Lakes.</p><p>Taken together, the hot spots and acres burned mean 2025 is the second-worst start to the season in years.</p><p>\"A warm and dry finish to May and early June has created a significant fire season,\" said Liam Buchart, a fire weather specialist with the Canadian Forest Service.</p><p>The weather conditions are made more likely by climate change and encourage wildfires to start. That means even though 90% of wildfires in Manitoba this year have been human-caused, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.mb.ca/conservation_fire/Fire-Situation/daily-firesituation.html\"> according to the provincial government</url>, climate change helps enable their spread.</p><p>\"Climate change is creating the conditions that make it more likely that human-caused fires are going to spread, or even start,\" MacCarthy said. \"It might be a human starting it, but it's going to spread quickly because now there's hot and dry conditions that are occurring more frequently and more intensely than they have in the past.\"</p><p>The hot and dry weather is likely to to continue for at least the next week across Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, <url normalizedValue=\"https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/maps/fw?type=fwi\">according to Natural Resources Canada</url>. The agency's forecasts also call for \"a warmer and drier than normal July and August for large portions of Canada,\" Buchart said.</p><p>\"The remainder of the fire season looks to remain above normal, especially over the northern prairie provinces and southern British Columbia,\" he said.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

We're going to monitor that in the coming days.\"</p><p>Beyond that, expect things to heat up, possibly tempered by rain later in the week.</p><p>\"We're getting more into summertime patterns, so that means sometimes we get heat, sometimes we get thunderstorms,\" said Mr. Leonardi.</p><p>That heat, he said, is expected to start building up Tuesday, giving southwestern Pennsylvania the potential for \"one of the first notable warm events\" of 2025.</p><p>\"It's not going to be excessively hot, but we're looking at actual temperatures by Wednesday in much of southwestern Pennsylvania into the 80s,\" he said.</p><p>Currently, he said, we can't rule out that parts of Downtown Pittsburgh could reach an actual temperature of 90 degrees on Wednesday. Things should cool on Thursday and Friday, when the area might see thunderstorms - some severe.</p><p>The record high for June 4 was set in 1895, when Pittsburgh hit a blistering 98 degrees.</p><p>The numerous days of rainfall that closed out May helped to push the month just slightly over its mean 4 inches of precipitation, per NWS records dating to 2000, but just by one-tenth of an inch. The maximum rainfall for May, century-to-date, was 6.14 inches in a very wet May 2003.</p><p>As experts monitor the Canadian wildfires - 77 uncontrolled fires were burning as of May 30, per the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, including along the border provinces Manitoba and Ontario - area residents might be reminded of two summers ago.</p><p>Canada's worst wildfire season to date was in 2023, when dangerous smoke blanketed much of North America.</p><p>Area residents received a lesson in air quality rankings - green for good, red for unhealthy and so on - in June 2023, when Pittsburgh was blanketed in smoke particles wafting from our northern neighbor. That led to a crash course in air quality safety, such as keeping windows closed and monitoring high-risk groups including those with asthma. Some outdoor youth sports practices were called off at the time, and Special Olympics Pennsylvania canceled the Summer Games slated to begin that June 8.</p><p>Air quality forecasts, which are imperfect - \"Smoke modeling can be a little tricky,\" Mr. Leonardi said - show Western Pennsylvania with an Air Quality Index in the yellow, or moderate, per AirNow. Those particularly sensitive to air quality should take precautions, including limiting time spent outdoors.</p><p>The Associated Press contributed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Manitoba government via AP: Wildfires rage in Flin Flon, Manitoba, Canada, on Tuesday, May 27, 2025.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PSTGAZ-250602161480724</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PSTGAZ2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FY8-S5M3-RRTM-838X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144577</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"459\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 P.G.

According to news reporting out of Helsinki, Finland, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Forest fire dynamics are expected to alter due to climate change. Despite the projected increase in precipitation, rising temperatures will amplify forest fire risk from the present to the end of the century.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Research Council of Finland; Ulkoministerio. <br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Finnish Meteorological Institute: \"Here, we analysed changes in fire season, the number of fires, and burnt area in Fennoscandia from 1951 to 2100. Regional simulations from the JSBACH-SPITFIRE ecosystem model (where SPITFIRE stands for SPread and InTensity of FIRE) were performed under two climate change forcing scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5) and three global climate driver models (CanESM2, CNRM-CM5, and MIROC5) with a 0.5\u00b0 resolution. Simulations were forced by downscaled and bias-corrected EURO-CORDEX data. Generally, as a consequence of the projected longer fire season and drier fuel, the probability of fires is projected to increase. However, changes in fire season, the number of fires, and burnt area are highly dependent on climate projections and location. The fire season is estimated to increase on average from 20 \u00b1 7 to 52 \u00b1 12 d, starting from 10 \u00b1 9 to 23 \u00b1 11 d earlier and ending from 10 \u00b1 10 to 30 \u00b1 16 d later, compared to the reference period (1981-2010), by the end of the century (2071-2100).\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The results for Finland indicate a change in the number of fires, ranging from -7 \u00b1 4 % to 98 \u00b1 56 %, and a change in burnt area, ranging from -19 \u00b1 24 % to 87 \u00b1 42 %. These findings contribute to a better understanding of potential changes in the future fire seasons of northern Europe.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Projected changes in forest fire season, the number of fires, and burnt area in Fennoscandia by 2100.

Firefighters have achieved partial containment on several active fires, but the NWS warned Friday that any fires that develop may \"spread rapidly\" as low humidity, warmer temperatures and gusty winds create volatile conditions.</p><h>What to Know</h><p>Firefighters are continuing to battle significant fires across New Jersey, including the Jones Road wildfire, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/new-jersey-wildfire-map-live-tracker-2063638?utm_source=Synacor&amp;utm_medium=Attnet&amp;utm_campaign=Partnerships\">which has consumed 15,300 acres</url>. The New Jersey Forest Fire Service reported that as of Friday morning, the Jones Road fire <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/new-jersey-wildfire-containment-map-blaze-could-spread-jones-road-fire-2063228?utm_source=Synacor&amp;utm_medium=Attnet&amp;utm_campaign=Partnerships\">was 60 percent contained.</url> Authorities remain concerned that stronger winds forecast for Friday afternoon and evening could exacerbate the fire spread.</p><p>Wind gusts up to 20 mph, coupled with relative humidity levels between 25 and 35 percent, have created the perfect storm for rapid wildfire spread, NWS meteorologists warned. Fire officials are urging residents to avoid any activities that could spark new fires, such as outdoor grilling or discarding cigarettes improperly.</p><p>Evacuations have already impacted thousands of residents across Lacey and Ocean townships, but the evacuation orders have since been lifted.</p><p>One commercial building has been destroyed by the flames and four structures are threatened, as of the New Jersey Forest Fire Service's latest update. Multiple outbuildings and vehicles have been destroyed.</p><p>Dry conditions are not limited to the current fires; officials warn that additional wildfires could ignite elsewhere in the state. Forecasters said the combination of drought stress and windy weather significantly heightens the risk of new outbreaks in parts of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware, PennLive reported.</p><p>Earlier this week, police arrested Joseph Kling in connection with the Jones Road fire. The 19-year-old Kling was charged with aggravated arson and arson after leaving a bonfire unattended, officials said.</p><h>What People Are Saying</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NWS Mount Holly in a special weather statement on Friday:</emphasis> \"There is an increased risk for rapid fire spread this afternoon across portions of New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania. Minimum relative humidity values will be around 25 to 35 percent combined with southerly winds of 10 to 15 mph with gusts near 20 mph. High temperatures will be in the mid 70s to near 80 degrees. These conditions, along with the continued drying of fine fuels, could support the rapid spread of any fires that ignite, which could quickly become difficult to control.\"</p><p>The statement added: \"Outdoor burning is strongly discouraged. Be sure to properly extinguish or dispose of any potential ignition sources, including smoking materials such as cigarette butts.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AccuWeather senior meteorologist Brett Anderson said in a report:</emphasis> \"While it will be much cooler on Sunday, when compared to Friday, the gusty winds and very dry air will quickly dry out the brush and fallen leaves once again. That could boost the wildfire risk, depending how much rain fell on local areas from the storm earlier in the weekend.\"</p><h>What Happens Next</h><p>Some rain is expected this weekend. However, the precipitation might be too limited to significantly ease drought conditions across southern New Jersey, AccuWeather reported.</p><p>Conditions are expected to remain warm and breezy through Saturday, maintaining an elevated fire risk until the rain arrives. Fire crews are continuing to focus on containment operations in affected areas.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2633362/new-jersey-wildfire-winds-forecast.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>New Jersey wildfire winds forecast</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Adam Gray/Getty</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Vegetation smolders as television crews report nearby a destroyed business from a wildfire on April 24, 2025, in Forked River, New Jersey.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWKCOM-2064225</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWKCOM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FN7-52V3-RT79-D474-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472435</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"662\"/><timeReceived>12:05 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright \u00a9 2025 Newsweek Inc.

According to news reporting out of Oregon State University by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Climate change has increased forest fire extent in temperate and boreal North America.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Gift From Individual; U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | Nih | National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. <br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Oregon State University: \"Here, we quantified the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to human mortality and economic burden from exposure to wildfire particulate matter at the county and state level across the contiguous US (2006 to 2020) by integrating climate projections, climate-wildfire models, wildfire smoke models, and emission and health impact modeling. Climate change contributed to approximately 15,000 wildfire particulate matter deaths over 15 years with interannual variability ranging from 130 (95% confidence interval: 64, 190) to 5100 (95% confidence interval: 2500, 7500) deaths and a cumulative economic burden of $160 billion. Approximately 34% of the additional deaths attributable to climate change occurred in 2020, costing $58 billion. The economic burden was highest in California, Oregon, and Washington.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"We suggest that absent abrupt changes in climate trajectories, land management, and population, the indirect impacts of climate change on human-health through wildfire smoke will escalate.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Anthropogenic climate change contributes to wildfire particulate matter and related mortality in the United States.

This is especially useful for remote areas where no sensors are stationed.</p><p>As of Tuesday that satellite had picked up four times as many fire hot spots across Canada than is typical for early June. That\u2019s more than any year since the satellite began transmitting in 2012, except 2023, according to data from Global Forest Watch.Though the satellite has recorded thousands of hot spots so far this year, that does not mean there are actually that many active fires. Each hot spot could be detected repeatedly over the course of days. And because each detection is about the size of 26 football fields, it can represent part of a much larger blaze, said James MacCarthy, wildfire research manager at Global Forest Watch.Based on data from the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, about 200 fires are actively burning in Canada and have consumed about 7,700 square miles (19,900 square kilometers) of terrain, most of it in the last week.</p><p>[Screenshot:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://ciffc.net/\">CIFFC</url></p><p>]</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Only 2023 saw such high numbers so early in Canada\u2019s fire season, which runs from April through October. That year wildfires burned a record 67,000 square miles\u2014more than twice the surface area of Lake Superior, the largest of the Great Lakes.Taken together, the hot spots and acres burned mean 2025 is the second-worst start to the season in years.\u201cA warm and dry finish to May and early June has created a significant fire season,\u201d said Liam Buchart, a fire weather specialist with the Canadian Forest Service.The weather conditions are made more likely by climate change and encourage wildfires to start. That means even though 90% of wildfires in Manitoba this year have been human-caused, according to the provincial government, climate change helps enable their spread.\u201cClimate change is creating the conditions that make it more likely that human-caused fires are going to spread, or even start,\u201d MacCarthy said. \u201cIt might be a human starting it, but it\u2019s going to spread quickly because now there\u2019s hot and dry conditions that are occurring more frequently and more intensely than they have in the past.\u201dThe hot and dry weather is likely to to continue for at least the next week across Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, according to Natural Resources Canada. The agency\u2019s forecasts also call for \u201ca warmer and drier than normal July and August for large portions of Canada,\u201d Buchart said.\u201cThe remainder of the fire season looks to remain above normal, especially over the northern prairie provinces and southern British Columbia,\u201d he said.</p><p>The Associated Press\u2019 climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

There were 224 active fires on Tuesday -- nearly half of them classified as out of control -- and nearly 1,900 total fires so far this year burning an estimated 8.2 million acres north of the border, according to\u00a0the\u00a0Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Air patterns bringing the smoke south of the border lowered air quality Tuesday afternoon in western and central North Dakota to the \"unhealthy for sensitive groups\" and the \"unhealthy\" for all categories.\u00a0</p><p>The North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality once again advised residents -- especially those with respiratory conditions -- to consider limiting time outdoors during smoky conditions.</p><p>The National Weather Service and AccuWeather both cautioned about the smoke in coming days. And AccuWeather also warned of \"frequent rounds of milky and hazy sky conditions through the summer\" across the northern U.S., impacting millions of Americans. It listed the impact for North Dakota through August as mostly \"moderate\" to \"extreme.\"</p><p>AccuWeather long-range experts also expanded the \"high\" frequency zone for wildfire smoke impacts across parts of Washington, Idaho and Montana into portions of North Dakota, Wisconsin and Minnesota.</p><p>\u201cSome good news is on the way later this week in Canada ... as a storm is expected to sweep through and bring beneficial rain across the western and central provinces between Friday and Sunday,\"\u00a0AccuWeather Meteorologist Brandon Buckingham reported. \"The return of rain across the region can temporarily slow the rate of wildfire spread in the region and, in some cases, may be able to put some fires out.\u201d</p><p>But any relief is expected to be short-lived, not lasting past the latter half of June.</p><p>\u201cAbove-average warmth and a general continuation of below-average rainfall is expected this summer, which will further increase the risk for a smoke- and haze-filled sky at times throughout the summer season in the northern and eastern United States,\u201d Buckingham said. Summer officially begins June 20.</p><p>Wildfire smoke can be hazardous because it contains tiny pollutants that can move deep into lung tissue and enter the bloodstream. It has been linked to several health complications including asthma, heart disease and other respiratory illnesses.</p><p>Buckingham said dangerous smoke can exist in clouds even on rainy days, and that \u201cOn sunny days, especially when there\u2019s consecutive sunny days in a row with a light wind, smoke and haze in the atmosphere can be more easily broken down by the sun and sink towards the surface, which can lead to a higher frequency of ozone action days or air quality alert days.\u201d</p><p>Some tips for smoky days from DEQ include staying indoors with windows and doors closed, limiting outdoor activity, and setting\u00a0air conditioners and vehicle vents to recirculate inside air.</p><p>Information on wildfires and air quality is on the DEQ website, at\u00a0bit.ly/3OhrD7E.

But it touched on some common themes and topics already publicized by President Donald J. Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., his secretary of Health and Human Services. </p><p>\"Why does it take more than 10 years for a new drug to come to market? Why are childhood chronic diseases so prevalent? And how can regulators adapt to meet the challenges facing clinicians today? These questions are at the forefront for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,\" they wrote. </p><p>Makary summarized some of the current woes in the U.S. health care system, and the ailments affecting millions of Americans. Collectively, \"our medical system has been a 50-year failure,\" the article said. </p><p>\"Fresh new ideas are needed to address root causes and develop innovative approaches,\" they said. That means examining the role of ultraprocessed foods, food additives, environmental toxins and how those have paralleled the epidemic of chronic disease in the United States. The American health care system needs to change from a reactionary responder to a proactive, pro-health force against \"the current forest fire that is the worsening health of the U.S. population.\" </p><p>The top priorities will be: </p><p>* Accelerating cures, taking lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic, when yearlong review processes were completed in weeks. Another example is infant formula, which has gotten one new element since 1998, showing that some of FDA's legacy process \"slow down decisions and do not increase safety.\" The solution is to partner with industry while avoiding the \"cozy relationship\" to food and pharmaceutical makers FDA had in the past. </p><p>* Unleashing artificial intelligence (AI) to review FDA applications and to predict toxicity-leveraging chip technology. Those processes will save time in drug development. FDA also will modernize how it reviews AI-based technologies. </p><p>* Advocating for healthier and safer food for children, improving the nation's \"increasingly chemically manipulated diet.\" \"The FDA will restore focus on the 'F' in FDA,\" they wrote. </p><p>* Harnessing big data to research root causes of chronic diseases and to conduct postapproval monitoring of new products. </p><p>* Lowering drug prices. U.S. patients pay more for drugs than people in other countries, representing \"a great American rip-off.\" By law, FDA will not consider price in benefit-risk calculations. But the agency will use its power to address costs, for example, by expediting generic medications and streamlining burdens to create biosimilar compounds. The United States is the largest purchaser of pharmaceutical products and should have price equity with other developed nations, Makary and Prasad wrote.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>fda food drug administration hq \u00a9 Tada Images - stock.adobe.com \u00a9 Food and Drug Administration \u00a9 Food and Drug Administration</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MEDECN-364A6B8B65329B6FC8A521B8AB3CFDD6351BF5431449A475E1AD1BE820250611</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28D6956797138A MEDECN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G1D-JF63-RWT0-D238-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">483527</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"518\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 MJH Life Sciences\u00ae All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Medical Economics</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"44415\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 2025</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>FOOD &amp;

There were 224 active fires on Tuesday \u2014 nearly half of them classified as out of control \u2014 and nearly 1,900 total fires so far this year burning an estimated 8.2 million acres north of the border, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Air patterns bringing the smoke south of the border lowered air quality Tuesday afternoon in western and central North Dakota to the \u201cunhealthy for sensitive groups\u201d and the \u201cunhealthy\u201d for all categories.</p><p>The North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality once again advised residents \u2014 especially those with respiratory conditions \u2014 to consider limiting time outdoors during smoky conditions.</p><p>The National Weather Service and AccuWeather both cautioned about the smoke in coming days. And AccuWeather also warned of \u201cfrequent rounds of milky and hazy sky conditions through the summer\u201d across the northern U.S., impacting millions of Americans. It listed the impact for North Dakota through August as mostly \u201cmoderate\u201d to \u201cextreme.\u201d</p><p>AccuWeather long-range experts also expanded the \u201chigh\u201d frequency zone for wildfire smoke impacts across parts of Washington, Idaho and Montana into portions of North Dakota, Wisconsin and Minnesota.</p><p>\u201cSome good news is on the way later this week in Canada ... as a storm is expected to sweep through and bring beneficial rain across the western and central provinces between Friday and Sunday,\u201d AccuWeather Meteorologist Brandon Buckingham reported. \u201cThe return of rain across the region can temporarily slow the rate of wildfire spread in the region and, in some cases, may be able to put some fires out.\u201d</p><p>But any relief is expected to be short-lived, not lasting past the latter half of June.</p><p>\u201cAbove-average warmth and a general continuation of below-average rainfall is expected this summer, which will further increase the risk for a smoke- and haze-filled sky at times throughout the summer season in the northern and eastern United States,\u201d Buckingham said. Summer officially begins June 20.</p><p>Wildfire smoke can be hazardous because it contains tiny pollutants that can move deep into lung tissue and enter the bloodstream. It has been linked to several health complications including asthma, heart disease and other respiratory illnesses.</p><p>Buckingham said dangerous smoke can exist in clouds even on rainy days, and that \u201cOn sunny days, especially when there\u2019s consecutive sunny days in a row with a light wind, smoke and haze in the atmosphere can be more easily broken down by the sun and sink towards the surface, which can lead to a higher frequency of ozone action days or air quality alert days.\u201d</p><p>Some tips for smoky days from DEQ include staying indoors with windows and doors closed, limiting outdoor activity, and setting air conditioners and vehicle vents to recirculate inside air.</p><p>Information on wildfires and air quality is on the DEQ website, at bit.ly/3OhrD7E.

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply.

This investment is projected to expand engineered wood products capacity by 10 million cubic feet, positioning Weyerhaeuser to seize greater market share in the growing housing sector. While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.</p><p>Shareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program</p><p>Following completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.</p><p>Maintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges</p><p>Weyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.</p><p>Strengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility</p><p>The company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.</p><p>Capital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing</p><p>Management refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.</p><p>Focused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency</p><p>Excluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.</p><p>Expansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth</p><p>Weyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.</p><p>Unlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures</p><p>The announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.</p><p>Timberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base</p><p>Management advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.</p><p>Operational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures</p><p>Initiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.</p><p>Proactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities</p><p>Reserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties. By maintaining adequate coverage for contingent liabilities, Weyerhaeuser bolsters its balance sheet resilience. However, potential over-reserving may tie up capital unnecessarily and requires vigilant management assessment.</p><p>Prioritizing Workforce Stability Amid Labor Market Tightness</p><p>Recognizing a 4.1% unemployment rate as a constraint, Weyerhaeuser focused on hiring and talent retention across its segments. Stability in workforce availability ensures operational continuity and supports management's strategic initiatives. However, rising labor costs remain a potential margin-pressure risk-a critical area to monitor for sustained profitability.</p><p>SECTION 5 TODAY'S BEARISH SIGNALS</p><p>5.1 3-DAY: MODERATE MOMENTUM DOWN</p><p>WY dips 1.4% on average volume 0.99 times average.

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply. However, additional mill capacity being added in the U.S.</p><p>Press Release article 12 of 13, Source: WEC, 76 words </p><p>November 13 2024: Weyerhaeuser quarterly dividends steady</p><p>Weyerhaeuser today announced a quarterly dividend of 20.0c per share for Q3/2024; unchanged from the previous quarter (Q2/2024) dividend of 20.0c.

These include, without limitation, statements relating to: our expected future financial and operating performance; our plans, strategies, intentions and expectations; our capital structure and the sufficiency of our liquidity position to meet future cash requirements; our cash dividend framework, including our target percentage return to shareholders of Adjusted Funds Available for Distribution, including expected supplemental cash dividends and/or future share repurchases; compliance with covenants in our debt agreements; our expectations concerning our contingent liabilities and the sufficiency of related reserves and accruals including, but not limited to, cost estimates of future litigation and environmental remediation; our provision for income taxes; expected capital expenditures; expected returns on pension plan assets; expected market and general economic conditions, including related influencing factors such as the trajectory of U.S. housing construction activity, repair and remodel activity, inflation trends and interest rates; our expected lumber production operating rates in fourth quarter 2024; our expectations about our future opportunities in emerging carbon credit and carbon capture and storage markets and assumptions used in valuing incentive compensation and related expense.</p><p>Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.

This investment is projected to expand engineered wood products capacity by 10 million cubic feet, positioning Weyerhaeuser to seize greater market share in the growing housing sector. While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.</p><p>Shareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program</p><p>Following completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.</p><p>Maintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges</p><p>Weyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.</p><p>Strengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility</p><p>The company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.</p><p>Capital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing</p><p>Management refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.</p><p>Focused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency</p><p>Excluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.</p><p>Expansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth</p><p>Weyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.</p><p>Unlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures</p><p>The announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.</p><p>Timberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base</p><p>Management advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.</p><p>Operational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures</p><p>Initiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.</p><p>Proactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities</p><p>Reserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties. By maintaining adequate coverage for contingent liabilities, Weyerhaeuser bolsters its balance sheet resilience. However, potential over-reserving may tie up capital unnecessarily and requires vigilant management assessment.</p><p>Prioritizing Workforce Stability Amid Labor Market Tightness</p><p>Recognizing a 4.1% unemployment rate as a constraint, Weyerhaeuser focused on hiring and talent retention across its segments. Stability in workforce availability ensures operational continuity and supports management's strategic initiatives. However, rising labor costs remain a potential margin-pressure risk-a critical area to monitor for sustained profitability.</p><p>SECTION 6 TODAY'S BEARISH SIGNALS</p><p>Price/Earnings of 46.1 &gt; Building Materials &amp; Fixtures sector (of 24 stocks) avg of 24.9:</p><p>- The price-to-earnings ratio of 46.1 indicates overvaluation compared with sector average of 24.9 and market average of 24.4.</p><p>6.1 3-DAY: MODERATE MOMENTUM DOWN </p><p>WY dips 1.4% on average volume 0.99 times average.

Its sickly orange haze vanished hours after the blaze was doused, but a stench from the blackened landscape, including parts of the Pine Barrens, lingered for days.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">New Jersey public health experts now are trying to understand what, if any, health risks are hidden in the smoke from wildfires, whether they originate at home or faraway forests. They have limited resources for the task, but a small core of health researchers and academics are starting to gather data about illnesses related to days of uncontrolled burns.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last week, they found a fresh motivation: fire broke out Friday in Wharton State Forest, prompting evacuations in southern New Jersey. Within days, 6,400 acres had burned. The blaze was reported <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/NJForestFireService/\">90 percent contained as of Wednesday, according to New Jersey Fire Service social media posts.</url>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Brian Lippai, public information office for the Ocean County Health Department, said information about potential related hospitalizations from the Jones Road Fire, named for a street where it was first sighted, aren't yet available. That would require some cross-coordination between emergency rooms across the state, he said, which doesn't routinely happen.\u00a0</p><p>The hope, Lippai said, is that studies might emerge \"once the dust settles-no pun intended.\" Air pollution levels near the Jones Road fire, which burned in April, were recorded at more than 10 times the limit recommended by the World Health Organization, according to the U.S. Air Quality Index.\u00a0</p><p>Experts don't know how these fires are affecting long term health-and it could take some time to find out. The New Jersey Department of Health Environmental and Occupational Health Surveillance Program recently published a<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nj.gov/health/ceohs/documents/ceohs%20content/SurveillaneDuring2023WildFires.pdf\"> 15-page report that examines medical needs from air pollution that drifted from</url> wildfires in Canada in 2023. A record-number of fires charred 18 million acres from March to June, and eight firefighters died.</p><p>But most important for New Jersey health authorities, visible smoke billowed over the border and across the Northeast United States for days, and the \"wildfire smoke event caused the Air Quality Index (AQI) to reach \"unhealthy\" and \"very unhealthy\" levels across the state.\"\u00a0</p><p>The state study, released in March, collated billing data and diagnoses codes from Jersey hospitals including emergency visits and inpatient care.</p><p>Researchers found asthma-related emergency visits increased significantly on June 7. The number was 112 percent higher than the daily average of asthma patients who sought care two weeks before skies filled with Canada's smoke. The study also notes that emergency visits likely underestimate how many individuals sought help in other ways, through their primary care physicians, urgent care clinics or with home remedies.</p><p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency, in a June monitoring report on Canada, pointed to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/news/noaa-satellites-monitor-canadian-wildfires-and-smoke#:~:text=The%202023%20Canadian%20wildfire%20season,for%20more%20than%20two%20years.\">climate change</url> as affecting the vitality of the northern boreal forest. \"As global temperatures continue to rise, wildfires in these regions are becoming more frequent, intense, and longer-lasting.\" As of June 5, NOAA said, 1,746 fires have erupted in Canada this year, consuming about 10,000 square miles, or an area larger than Vermont.</p><p>In New Jersey, firefighters, too, have found that wildfires were no longer just a summer risk.\u00a0</p><p>The Jones Road fire broke out days after New Jersey Forest <url normalizedValue=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/23042025/pine-barrens-prescribed-burns-reduced-then-wildfire-hit/\">Fire Service officials had warned </url>they had delayed prescribed burns, routine for clearing brush, because of an unusually dry spring. A lack of rain and snow for some months had left the region and the expansive Pine Barrens woodlands, parts of which are a natural reserve, particularly vulnerable.</p><p>The county health department quickly issued <url normalizedValue=\"https://oceancountyhealth.gov/news/wildfire-advisory/\">public health advisories</url> as the fire, apparently <url normalizedValue=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/22/us/new-jersey-wildfire-evacuations\">traced to a bonfire</url> that had not been fully extinguished, spread and endangered main traffic arteries including the Garden State Parkway. Authorities warned of deteriorating air quality.\u00a0</p><p>NOAA tracked the blaze via satellite and later characterized it as one of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/pictures/firefighters-battle-one-worst-wildfires-new-jerseys-history-2025-04-24/\">worst fires in the state's history. Five thousand people were evacuated in its early hours. </url>About 25,000 households lost power in the first week.</p><p>Residents soon posted on social media-including the state fire service Facebook page-their fears about health risk and whether New Jersey was turning into a \"little California,\" as one writer said, referring to catastrophic <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/california-wildfires\">wildfires in Los Angeles County</url> months earlier.</p><p>Medical professionals are still sorting through the public health effects. Peter Saccone, a local pulmonologist from Sewell, N.J., estimated his office experienced an estimated 20 percent increase in patients after and around the time of the fire. Patients reported feeling sick, with running noses, dry coughs and mucus. But tests revealed no infection.\u00a0</p><p>Saccone said the symptoms were likely related to poor air quality exposure, either from wildfire smoke or allergies. It was difficult to distinguish between the sources, he said, because New Jersey then was also experiencing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/health/2025/03/11/nj-allergies-bad-2025-pollen-count-high/81990218007/\">higher-than-normal</url> pollen counts from warmer temperatures.</p><p>\"Pollen, smoke, dust, etc. can trigger it the same way,\" Saccone said. \"There's just so much of an overlap between symptoms.\"\u00a0</p><p>Philip Demoktritou, a professor in Nanoscience and Environmental Bioengineering at the Rutgers School of Public Health, pointed out that wildfire risk doesn't stop at a property line. New Jersey, like other states, will have to reconsider what may be new and recurring safety risks from faraway conflagrations, he said.</p><p>Demokritou and other Rutgers researchers found that during the 2023 Canada fires there was a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rutgers.edu/news/canadian-wildfire-smoke-cooled-new-york-3-degrees-and-trapped-air-toxicants#:~:text=Canadian%20Wildfire%20Smoke%20Cooled%20New%20York%20by%203%20Degrees%20and%20Trapped%20Air%20Toxicants,-Adobe%20Stock&amp;text=When%20smoke%20from%20Canadian%20wildfires,by%20about%203%20degrees%20Celsius.\">3-degree Celsius drop</url> in temperature in New York City. The phenomenon, known as global dimming, occurs when smoke and pollutants get trapped near the ground, and particulates within that smog are worth further study, he said.\u00a0</p><p>\"These particles, they don't know boundaries,\" said Demoktritou, one of a dozen authors of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02214-3#Sec2\">study, published</url> in April in the journal Nature. A rise in particulate matter is now a more common public health concern as a result of \"an increased intensity and frequency of these extreme events.\" And, he said, current ways of measuring particulates in the air are not ideal for the evolving wildfire scenario.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/inhalable-particulate-matter-and-health\">Particulate matter</url> is a mixture of several chemicals, solids and liquids in the air and is measured for air quality reporting. There are two main standards known as National Ambient Air Quality PM10 and PM2.5. The latter measure accounts from generally smaller and more dangerous particulates that are able to penetrate the bloodstream.</p><p>Demokritou said wildfire particles are measured primarily in the nanoscale. The PM2.5 standard, he said, does not fully grasp the scale of the smaller particles from wildfire smoke on health. More precise measures are needed. Measuring the number and surface area per cubic meter of air rather than their mass would provide a more accurate metric for human health implications, he said.</p><p>\"You cannot really compare apples with oranges,\" he said. \"So we have a problem, because the PM2.5 standard is not adequate to capture these wildfire nanoparticles.\"</p><p>The Jones Road fire unleashed its chemical mix from trees and the ruin of multiple vehicles and buildings that burned hot with man-made plastics and petroleum-based equipment, according to the New Jersey Forest Fire Service.\u00a0</p><p>Forest wildfires complicate risks for people with respiratory and heart disease, but urban fires that blend with forest burns are more complex and infused with chemicals from tars, metals, fabrics or building materials, said Savannah D'Evelyn, an environmental health scientist and bio-social scientist with the University of Washington, who has studied air quality, community health and climate adaptation.</p><p>Tiny particles from smoke can enter the bloodstream through the lungs and pass the blood-brain barrier-a membrane that protects the central nervous system from toxic substances and pathogens in blood, she said. Particles can also move through the nose and head directly to the brain. There are all sorts of health implications from days of soupy air, she said.</p><p>\"There's just kind of the domino effect,\" D'Evelyn said. \"If there's impact on your lungs, that would maybe be increasing blood pressure, then that changes how things are working throughout your body.\"</p><p>She added that health professionals have to consider what an expanded fire risk means for treatment, particularly in regions unfamiliar with repeated bouts of smoke. \"Wildfire doesn't really have a season anymore,\" she said. \"It hasn't had a season for a long time in the west, but even in places like New Jersey and New York, fires are reaching all parts of the year.\"</p><p>A NOAA report in <url normalizedValue=\"https://cpo.noaa.gov/fires-along-the-wildland-urban-interface-on-the-rise/\">2024</url> found that fires within a wildlife urban interface, or WUI, which is the meeting point between human development and undeveloped land, are on the rise. In New Jersey and other urban-adjacent areas where fires are becoming more frequent, more than 50 million U.S. homes lie within a WUI.\u00a0</p><p>D'Evelyn said wildfires, in particular, gush pollutants into the air. A fast-moving blaze will spiral pollution levels within hours and <url normalizedValue=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/14062023/new-york-er-asthma-willdfire-smoke/\">emergency room visits can spike from patients </url>downed by asthma attacks and other breathing difficulties.</p><p>More research is needed to explore whether wildfire smoke triggers an onset of a multitude of disease or health complications, D'Evelyn said. People most directly exposed-such as\u00a0 firefighters-are prime for study.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's impossible that we're going to live in a world without smoke, and so what we need to do is figure out how to live with it,\" D'Evelyn said.\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INCLNE-96250</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INCLNE2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G33-57V3-S2NX-R49B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">462782</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1609\"/><timeReceived>9:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 InsideClimate News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Inside Climate News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 19, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Justice &amp;

I'm Jake Tapper.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This hour, hearing has now been set for tomorrow morning, a legal hearing over whether President Trump can actually fire a Federal Reserve governor for the reason he is citing. This is the latest chapter in a legal battle with major implications for the Fed, for the interest rates that you pay and for the power of the presidency.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, an 11-year-old girl speaking to CNN today about surviving that horrific mass shooting at the MinneapolisCatholic school yesterday. Hear her account of sitting in the church just moments before gunfire erupted, and how she and other children ran into a nearby room and piled furniture in front of the door.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Also, did Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard revealed the identity of an undercover CIA officer?</p><p>[18:00:03]</p><p>What sources are telling CNN tonight about a recent memo made public by DNI Gabbard and how her office is responding, that's ahead.</p><p>The Lead tonight, the legal showdown over presidential power that is headed to the courts tomorrow morning. A federal judge is set to hold a hearing after Fed Governor Lisa Cook sued the Trump administration in federal court today. She calls the president's efforts to remove her from the position at the Fed, quote, unprecedented and illegal.</p><p>President Trump says he's removing Cook over allegations that she made false statements on a mortgage application. But is that sufficient cause?</p><p>CNN's Chief White House Correspondent and Anchor Kaitlan Collins' live for us at the White House. And, Kaitlan, how is the White House responding to Cook's lawsuit?</p><p>KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR AND CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Jake, they've acknowledged that she is challenging her firing, that this is going to now set up this huge legal showdown starting in court tomorrow where Lisa Cook's just trying to get that temporary restraining order where she can basically stay on the job as this is going to play out.</p><p>They knew this was going to be a legal battle, Jake. Obviously, we've never seen a president do this in the Federal Reserve Board of Governors' history before, and so this is going to be a familiar territory for them because they've done this with other people who have never really been fired by the executive branch of four and now are in this position.</p><p>And so they say they're well prepared for this legal fight, Jake. They do ultimately believe they're going to win out here. And several White House officials pointed out to me that in her lawsuit today responding to this that Lisa Cook did not deny the allegations that are being made against her exactly when it comes to these allegations of mortgage fraud. Obviously, that's going to play out in court, Jake, but the White House says, as she is prepared to fight this battle, that so are they.</p><p>TAPPER: And, Kaitlan, there's another big controversy going on, this major shakeup at the CDC, Trump firing the CDC director, other top health officials resigning in protest. What are they saying about that and what this could mean for other federal workers and for the health of the American people?</p><p>COLLINS: Yes, Jake. It's pretty remarkable actually to see this playing out because Dr. Monarez has only been the CDC director for about a month now. She was sworn in not that long ago after being confirmed by the Senate. It was just five months ago that President Trump picked her for this job after the first person that he had designated to be the CDC director was clearly just not going to get enough support up on Capitol Hill.</p><p>And so then they picked Dr. Monarez, the president put out a statement at the time calling her an amazing public servant, an amazing mother as well. Secretary Kennedy said that he handpicked her for this job and praised her MAHA credentials. But now she has been fired, obviously, Jake, something that she was even disputing last night saying she hadn't actually heard from the White House that she had been fired and was disputing whether or not Secretary Kennedy himself could actually do so, really arguing that that can only come from the president himself.</p><p>And this is obviously a huge question at today's White House press briefing, and this is what the press secretary had to say about it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KAROLINE LEAVITT, WHITE HOUSEPRESS SECRETARY: It was President Trump who was overwhelmingly reelected on November 5th. This woman has never received a vote in her life, and the president has the authority to fire those who are not aligned with his mission.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COLLINS: Now, Jake, I will note obviously she's referring to the president winning the election there, but she did get votes from Republican senators upon Capitol Hill who voted to confirm her. 51 of them voted not that long ago.</p><p>And so now, one, obviously there's real questions about who's running the CDC. Yes, they've named an acting director, but it's not someone in a permanent position. There has not been a permanent CDC director since Trump took office, obviously, as they've been having this battle play out. But now, Jake, they have to go through this process of picking someone else, nominating them, and then also getting them confirmed by the Senate, even though the person that the Senate just confirmed has now been ousted from this job.</p><p>And, Jake, I'll say, obviously we've seen so much of the reporting on the tension behind the scenes between Dr. Monarez and Secretary Kennedy over vaccine approval and what the CDC is saying about that. Obviously, they were just praising her not that long ago. And the White House hasn't explicitly said where they did not align on those areas behind the scenes. But it's clearly led to the resignation of several top officials and potentially more to come, Jake.</p><p>TAPPER: All right, Kaitlan Collins at the White House. And don't miss Kaitlan on her show, The Source with Kaitlan Collins. Tonight, she's going to be joined by three of the CDC officials who resigned in protest. That's tonight at 9:00 P.M. Eastern only here on CNN.</p><p>Joining us now, former U.S. Treasury Secretary under President Biden and former Chair of the Federal Reserve Janet Yellen. Secretary Yellen, thank you so much for being here.</p><p>So, turning back to the Lisa Cook affair, this is the first time that any president has tried to fire a governor of the Federal Reserve. You said in the Financial Times that this is dangerous and unlawful. What might you have done if this happened while you were chair of the Fed?</p><p>JANET YELLEN, FORMER TREASURY SECRETARY, BIDEN ADMINISTRATION: Well, as you mentioned, it's never happened in the Fed's entire, more than a hundred year history that a president has tried to fire a governor.</p><p>[18:05:00]</p><p>The Federal Reserve Act says that can only occur for cause. And the question here is whether or not an accusation that's been made against Lisa Cook without charge are opportunity for her to address this allegation, whether or not this represents cause.</p><p>And I'm not a legal scholar and this will have to be litigated, but I think it's important to understand the context in which this is occurring. President Trump has expressed his disagree with the policy stance that the Fed has taken. He believes that interest rates should be substantially lower, and he's mentioned on multiple occasions that his focus is on the high cost of servicing the government debt, and the higher interest rates are, the higher that debt service expense is, it's now close to a trillion dollars a year, the second largest item in the budget.</p><p>But the Federal Reserve Act clearly specifies that the Fed's mandate is to achieve price stability and maximum employment. The goals are set by Congress. The independence of the Fed just means that the Federal Reserve has the ability to decide what settings of monetary policy are appropriate. And President Trump is clearly frustrated with Powell with the monetary policy the Fed is pursuing. And I see this as part of a larger attempt to gain control of the Fed of monetary policy and to put people who agree with him and will follow his views. That's the overall goal. And --</p><p>TAPPER: Yes, he's made no secret of that.</p><p>YELLEN: The independence of the Fed.</p><p>TAPPER: Yes. I mean he's made no secret.</p><p>YELLEN: No, he has made no secret.</p><p>TAPPER: Yes, the president said the other day --</p><p>YELLEN: It's important for Americans to understand --</p><p>TAPPER: Yes. He said, I just want to read the quote, president -- the president said once we have a majority, housing's going to swing and it's going to be great. People are paying too high an interest rate. We have to get the rates down a little bit. The current Fed obviously disagrees, at least as of right now. There are seven members. There was a resignation a couple weeks ago. If he replaces Lisa Cook, he will have four members that are his appointees, not including Jerome Powell, who also was his appointee, although disagrees with him.</p><p>You say this threatens the independence of the Fed. I wonder, do you think that there are enough guardrails built into the system to protect the Fed?</p><p>YELLEN: There are a lot of guardrails. The terms of Fed governors are 14 years. They're staggered. The Fed has budgetary independence. It's answerable to Congress. But the GAO is not allowed to audit the Fed's monetary policy decisions. It was designed to be able to make independent, professional fact-based judgments, and I believe President Trump wants to change that.</p><p>It's really important for Americans to understand how dangerous this is. Once upon a time, the Fed was obligated, this was during World War II, to help the Treasury Department finance the outstanding government debt. And it held interest rates low just as President Trump wants now. And the consequence was very high inflation in the 1950s.</p><p>TAPPER: Yes.</p><p>YELLEN: There was an accord between the Treasury and the Fed then, that said that's not the job of the Fed.</p><p>And we know that Americans are tremendously concerned about inflation. This was a huge issue in the last election. They want inflation to be low. And the labor market is solid at the moment. Unemployment is very low. Job creation has generally been solid, and we're coming out of a period of high inflation. TAPPER: Right.</p><p>YELLEN: And the Fed is focusing, achieving low inflation and full employment, which is what they're mandated to do.</p><p>TAPPER: So, let me ask you, do you --</p><p>YELLEN: So, going down this path is dangerous.</p><p>TAPPER: Do you think -- I mean, one of the reasons why he's so frustrated is because the Fed has said that because of uncertainty in the economy, they're referring to the tariffs, they have not brought the interest rates lower yet because they're waiting to see what happens.</p><p>[18:10:00]</p><p>And, you know, all of us who follow the tariffs and the impact know that there could be impact in the coming months given the fact that so many businesses and small business owners have been eating the cost. Do you think that there's any justification for those who criticize Jerome Powell, who say he shouldn't even be talking about tariffs, that's political? We had somebody on the -- Steve Moore was here the other day and he said that that was political of Jerome Powell to say.</p><p>YELLEN: Well, the Fed isn't trying to tell President Trump how to set tariffs or what his tariff policy should be, but they need to forecast what will happen to the price level going forward. We had a period of very high inflation. It's come way down, but it's not even now down to the Fed's objective of 2 percent. And the labor market is not weak. The labor market is functioning at a good level. And there is objective reason to believe, and the data is beginning to show it, the tariffs are pushing up prices.</p><p>Now, Chair Powell did indicate in his speech at Jackson Hole last week that the labor market is looking a little softer. You know, so we have risks on two sides to the labor market to the downside and some upside risk to inflation because of the tariffs. And he's indicated that the balance of risk might be shifting in a way that would appropriately lead to some cut in interest rates.</p><p>But President Trump has said he wants dramatic cuts in interest rates, maybe 300 basis points, and there's really no way that the things that the Fed is considering it would be taking into account would lead very quickly to cuts of that magnitude.</p><p>TAPPER: All right. Former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, thank you so much for your views, we appreciate it.</p><p>And 11-year-old shooting survivor speaking to CNN explaining how children ran from the church during yesterday's horrific attack and barricaded themselves in a nearby room. Hear her harrowing account next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[18:15:00]</p><p>TAPPER: Just moment ago, we received this heartbreaking photo. This is a picture of eight-year-old Fletcher Merkel, forever eight-year-old Fletcher Merkel. He is one of the two children who was killed in yesterday's horrific shooting in Minneapolis. His father, Jesse, spoke earlier today, calling the shooter a coward.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JESSE MERKEL, FATHER OF FLETCHER MERKEL: Please remember Fletcher for the person he was and not the act that ended his life. Give your kids an extra hug and kiss today.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TAPPER: Absolute madness. The ten-year-old child who was killed has yet to be identified.</p><p>We also have startling new video today showing some of the harrowing moments after the shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church began.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Where's the shooter? Where's the shooter?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TAPPER: You can see children there, children running for their lives, some dumping over pews to escape, a father looking for his daughters took this video.</p><p>CNN's Shimon Perez is outside the church in Minneapolis. And, Shimon, you spoke with a child who survived the shooting. Tell us about her and what she had to tell you.</p><p>SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, she's quite remarkable, Jake. She's 11 years old. Her name is Chloe. She actually talked about Fletcher. They went on vacation with Fletcher to the Dominican Republic, the family did. So, she told us what a lovely boy he was and what a -- how much he was into sports. And she talked about the other girl who was killed. And all of these kids were such close friends and they were so looking forward to their first mass of the new school year.</p><p>And there's her story of how they reacted to the gunshots, what they did, how they hid, how they all reacted together to help each other is just so remarkable. And her retelling of everything, she was so poised and so incredible. Her dad has been telling me today how therapeutic it was for her to sit and talk to us. Take a listen to some of what she told us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHLOE FRANCOUAL, 11-YEAR-OLD ANNUNCIATION CATHOLIC SCHOOL STUDENT: So, my mind for some reason keeps on replaying that exact scenario when the teacher started, like the teacher was in the middle of saying our prayers and then we heard just one shot. It felt -- I smelled smoke before everything. But I heard one shot. I thought it was a firework like everybody else. The second shot was just everybody just covering their ears. The third shot was when everybody started ducking low and all these shots were like slow until the fourth shot. It started getting faster and faster, and then that's when everybody took into action.</p><p>PROKUPECZ: What was that action?</p><p>FRANCOUAL: When some kids, they hid under the pews the whole time and some ran off to the pre-K room. That's what I did. And in the pre-K room, everybody started to help, especially the kids and all the older buddies. We all started to help, like putting tables on the doors, locking the doors, putting all this stuff on the doors as much as we could.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PROKUPECZ: And, Jake, it's just incredible to think that these kids would know what to do. I mean, they drill for this. But when they have to react, when they have to take action, their ability to do it, it's just always so incredible. I would say she's probably the sixth or seventh school shooting survivor that I have interviewed.</p><p>[18:20:02]</p><p>And I'm always struck by what they remember. It's always the noises, the gunshots, how they cover their ears, and it's always the smell of gunfire. In this case, it was the smell of a smoke bomb that the shooter used.</p><p>But these are the things that the little kids always remember. And when they go to sleep at night, these are the things that they remember. And she talked about that. And the fear that she now lives with, and she's just hoping that, eventually, she'll be able to go back to school, there's just still so much work that needs to be done here as the healing is going to continue. But there's it's really tough. I mean, this was tough, Jake.</p><p>TAPPER: I've said it in more times than I care to. The adults of the United States are failing the children of the United States. I don't know how many times I have to say it. It's just a complete and utter failure to protect our children. And it's disgraceful and I'm sick of having to report these things, as I know you are, Shimon. It's just enough.</p><p>Shimon Prokupecz of Minneapolis, Minnesota, thanks so much.</p><p>Coming up next, what CNN is learning today about a major immigration crackdown set to start at one of the biggest cities in the United States in just days.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[18:25:00] TAPPER: In our Law and Justice Lead, the Trump administration is preparing to conduct a major immigration enforcement operation, they say, in Chicago as soon as next week. That's according to sources who tell CNN the preparations including surging agents and armored vehicles to the city.</p><p>Let's bring in CNN's Priscilla Alvarez. And, Priscilla, this would be a major escalation and certainly would not go over well with the leaders of Chicago and Illinois.</p><p>PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Jake, a major escalation, but also the latest clash. Remember, Chicago was one of the first cities the Trump administration targeted when the president returned to office for its immigration enforcement operations. This is going to be much bigger in scope, of course, as they continue to escalate on this front.</p><p>Now, the blueprint for this, according to sources I've spoken with, is Los Angeles. Los Angeles, of course, had U.S. Customs and Border Protection surge to the city, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but they also had National Guard there at the time to quell protests. And in this case, National Guard is also being prepared in the event that they are needed for what officials say would be peacekeeping presence.</p><p>Now, as part of the preparations, not only are they sending armored vehicles and mobilizing more personnel there, including CBP agents, they're also talking about using a naval base nearby as a hub for federal personnel.</p><p>Now, White House officials have told our colleague, Alayna Treene, that this is distinct from what the President has suggested as far as a crime crackdown in cities like is has been happening here in Washington, D.C. This is very much more focused on immigration enforcement in a city that did contend with an influx of migrant arrivals during the Biden administration when the Texas governor was sending migrants there.</p><p>But, certainly, this is going to be a big escalation, Jake, and one expected to kick off next Friday, though conversations are still ongoing.</p><p>TAPPER: And, Priscilla, we're also learning that the Border Patrol arrested two firefighters in the midst of their fighting wildfires in the area of Seattle. Is that true? What happened?</p><p>ALVAREZ: Yes. According to a Washington congresswoman who all confirmed these arrests, essentially, these two fire firefighters were arrested at the site where they were fighting this blaze in Washington. What is unclear, however, is the why. Why were they arrested, particularly at a moment where they, again, were at this site fighting this blaze?</p><p>Now, Washington Senator Patty Murray says that she's demanding answers from the federal government about what exactly happened here, because that still isn't quite clear. But this is a wildfire that has torched thousands of acres. And it is indicative in many ways of how the broad immigration crackdown that is happening nationwide can go on to include individuals that perhaps you may not suspect, and at moments that are inconvenient, to say the least.</p><p>So, this is something that Washington lawmakers are trying to get more answers on. But the bottom line is that they have confirmed that these two firefighters were arrested as they were fighting this blaze.</p><p>TAPPER: All right. Priscilla Alvarez, thanks so much.</p><p>Let's go right to our panel. So, we were told that they were going to focus, at least in the first year, on getting the dangerous criminals who were undocumented immigrants out of the country. And I think most people were like, great, get the dangerous criminals out. I don't know that I would consider people who are heroically, you know, braving fires and trying to save American lives to be part of this crackdown that's needed right now.</p><p>JONAH GOLDBERG, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yes. I mean, it's also kind of strange that President Trump says that he's looking at waving people who work in the hotel or agricultural business, but going after firefighters, well, that's a different matter, right?</p><p>I think though that the real significance of this story isn't so much that they detained two firefighters. It's that they detained all of the firefighters for three hours while they were checking their I.D.s. And we saw The Washington Post story on Wednesday that all, basically, Salvation Army, all these NGOs that work for disaster relief in the United States, they're going to be required to basically do I.D. checks on American citizens to make sure they're not helping illegal immigrants.</p><p>And so a lot of these strictures, it's not so much that they're detaining illegal immigrants, it's that they're gumming up the works for vast amounts of civil society and for first responders stuff to do this kind of thing. And I think it's going to eventually elicit a kind of blow back.</p><p>TAPPER: Mike, CNN has a new -- did you want to weigh in on that?</p><p>MIKE DUBKE, FORMER TRUMP WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: Well, no, just that, we'll see what that blowback is. Because I think you're absolutely right, these organizations are now going to have to add an extra step to all of this.</p><p>[18:30:01]</p><p>But I don't -- I'm not sure that we've seen the blowback yet. And with these two firefighters, one of them had an order of removal. So, it's an open question. But at what point are the American people going to say it's too far, too much? I don't know that we're there yet. That's my comment.</p><p>GOLDBERG: My point is, you can defend detaining and deporting these guys. Why wouldn't you do it after the long day of work fighting a forest fire, rather than interrupting the process of fighting a forest fire? And it's like that at scale when you think about all these other institutions that they're going to ask people to basically be de facto proxy immigration enforcement agencies that I think could actually just get to a management problem that the Trump administration's ill- equipped to deal with.</p><p>TAPPER: And you talked about how there isn't blowback, and I agree, there hasn't been like any system systemic change in Congress or anything like that, but the polling is going in favor of immigration. Like you see Republicans jump 20 points on immigration is good for America and from where they were six months ago. Like there is a subtle change going on in people thinking that maybe immigration isn't as bad, even illegal immigration isn't as bad as it was depicted because we're hearing stories about, oh, this waitress and, oh, this teacher and, oh, these firefighters.</p><p>DUBKE: Yes. But then you have The Washington Post today since I think we're going to keep quoting The Washington Post instead of --</p><p>TAPPER: It's a great paper.</p><p>DUBKE: Well, the CNN's reporting had that these firefighters, by the way, were not actively fighting, that they actually, they had pulled them -- all of them back, and that's when they did the I.D. checks. But that's CNN reporting.</p><p>But let's go to The Washington Post.</p><p>TAPPER: Yes.</p><p>DUBKE: So, they reported that Pew's got a survey out that amongst Republicans, ICE is at 60 -- I think it's 68 percent approval rating. So, to your point, we can play with these figures, but Republicans now according to Pew, believe that a majority believe DOJ is a much better place, HHS, ICE, and one other, the FBI.</p><p>TAPPER: Okay.</p><p>DUBKE: And so I think when you talk about Donald Trump, is he playing to his base? Is he playing to the American people? In some instances they're both.</p><p>TAPPER: Yes.</p><p>DUBKE: But we're seeing Republicans come around.</p><p>TAPPER: Speaking of playing to his base, we're told that the U.S. Air Force is going to provide full military funeral honors for Ashli Babbitt, Ashli Babbitt, an Air Force veteran. And she was the pro- Donald Trump rioter, who believed his lies about the election being stolen in 2020, and she was shot and killed invading the Capitol when a group was trying to get onto the floor of Congress. A law enforcement officer shot and killed her after she breached a sensitive area. So, full military funeral honors for Ashli Babbitt.</p><p>GOLDBERG: I think it's grotesque. It's trying to turn her into a martyr to this day of love stuff, and it's part of the general whitewashing January 6th. I don't really know what else to say about it except it's gross.</p><p>DUBKE: Well, here's -- she served in the military with honors. Everyone that was on the Capitol that day was given clemency. I mean, if you are under the rules, she's now eligible for that honor. And, I mean, that's what we're -- I think --</p><p>TAPPER: But do you disagree that it's all part and parcel of trying to whitewash what happened January 6th?</p><p>DUBKE: I think it's -- I don't disagree that it is part of the reimagining of what January 6th was.</p><p>TAPPER: And also, we just want to note director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard yank the security clearances of several current and former intelligence officials. The controversy is that one of those whose security credentials she yanked was actually operating undercover, a CIA operative, according to a source. And this caught the CIA and the director of the CIA, John Ratcliffe, by complete surprise. A person close to Gabbard disputes that this person was undercover. Pretty --</p><p>DUBKE: Now, look, when the Biden administration did that several years ago, it was egregious. When the Trump administration does it, it's egregious. We've got to -- you can't be too flippant with security clearances nor when you have active members in the field.</p><p>GOLDBERG: DNI -- the position of DNI should never have been created and she should never have been nominated. She should never have been confirmed, and she should have been fired a long time ago.</p><p>TAPPER: Okay, thanks to both of you. I appreciate it.</p><p>Heartbreaking stories are emerging just one day after that horrific Catholic school shooting in Minneapolis. Coming up next, I'm going to talk to a father who raced to the school to find his daughter after learning about the shooting.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[18:35:00]</p><p>TAPPER: More on our National Lead, investigators believe that the Minneapolis shooter likely intended to carry out yesterday's attack from inside the church at Annunciation Catholic School. An official tells CNN that the shooter visited the church weeks ago under the pretext likely of wanting to reconnect with the Catholic faith. But officials say that because mass had already started, the shooter may have been locked out of the church.</p><p>Joining us now to discuss is Zach Semon. His four-year-old daughter was in her classroom right below the church where the shooting happened. And, Zach, we are so glad that your daughter is okay. Four years old is very young to go through something like this. Tell us what she experienced and how she's doing.</p><p>ZACH SEMON, ANNUNCIATION SCHOOL PARENT: She's actually doing reasonably well, considering everything. I think she's too young to kind of grasp the gravity and severity of the situation. We're continuing to monitor her and make sure she's being the same as she was before.</p><p>TAPPER: Well, also terrifying for you. I mean, it must have been so frightening when you heard about the shooting. Tell us what you first heard and when you learned your daughter was okay.</p><p>SEMON: Well, I heard from my family friend who also has a daughter. She had called me, I'm a teacher in a different school district, and we were doing our professional development workshop week, and she had called me an hour before and we had a conversation and then called me again. And I thought it was odd because we had just spoken and she just told me that there was an active shooter at Kennedy School.</p><p>TAPPER: And so what did you do?</p><p>[18:40:00]</p><p>Did you get in your car and zoom over? Or how does -- how did you --</p><p>SEMON: Yes. I dropped off my -- sorry, my son's in the background.</p><p>TAPPER: No. It's -- seeing a happy kid is nice to see.</p><p>SEMON: Yes, he got out of the watch of my wife.</p><p>I got in the car, I ran to my car drove up and I had to parked a few blocks away because, obviously, the police had shut down the area. They let me through because I was a parent and I ran into the school. It seemed like there were hundreds of law enforcement and emergency response teams there.</p><p>It was organized chaos. I mean, the staff directed us go to the gym, find your child. But my kid is, you know, small compared to all the other kid you know, K through eight with all the parents, and she's four years old.</p><p>Luckily, she was able to find me before I found her. And she was safe and unscathed. And, I mean, when I, when I hugged her she said that she was worried that I got shot. And for a 4-year-old to have that kind of thought, it's just -- it's horrible.</p><p>TAPPER: Yes, that's not right. How is your community doing?</p><p>SEMON: Pretty broken up. It's a strong community. It's a smaller community like we live in Minneapolis, but you wouldn't tell by being there. It's very family-oriented. Annunciation school has been amazing and will continue to be amazing. I have high hopes that we will rebuild the community stronger. It already was.</p><p>TAPPER: You also have a son. We saw him playing in the background there. He goes to a different school.</p><p>SEMON: Yes.</p><p>TAPPER: How is he processing all of it?</p><p>SEMON: He is a little sad because he knew one of the boys that died, he -- my son participated in Annunciation's summer program, which was also really good for them. And he was -- he knew one of the boys that was -- the interview has been going around social media and he knew one of the boys that the boy that was shot.</p><p>TAPPER: The eight-year-old?</p><p>SEMON: So, he's sad. He's six, six years old.</p><p>TAPPER: Oh. So, he's -- the 6-year-old survived, but he's --</p><p>SEMON: Sorry, my son is six.</p><p>TAPPER: Your son, six-year-old, but he knew the eight-year-old? Okay, got it. Sorry about that.</p><p>SEMON: Yes, correct.</p><p>TAPPER: Let me just ask, do you have any ambivalence about sending your daughter back to school or, no?</p><p>SEMON: I have high hopes. I have full confidence in Annunciation and their community. The school is amazing. I don't know when they're going to reopen but when they do, my daughter will be there. I think it's important to show solidarity. And, yes, it's not the school's fault that this happened.</p><p>TAPPER: No, definitely not.</p><p>Zach Semon, thank you. God bless you and your daughter and your son and I assume wife out there somewhere as well. I really appreciate it.</p><p>SEMON: Yes, I appreciate the time.</p><p>TAPPER: The White House reaction to this horrific shooting is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[18:47:02]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KAROLINE LEAVITT, WHITE HOUSEPRESS SECRETARY: Young children were killed while praying in a church. It's utterly disrespectful to deride the power of prayer in this country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST: That's White HousePress Secretary Karoline Leavitt. Earlier today, she was condemning Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and others who have said we don't -- along the lines of we don't want your thoughts and prayers. These kids were praying when they were shot. It's an expression of anger at those who offer nothing more than thoughts and prayers. Instead of trying to figure out legislative ways to solve this problem, or at least security ways to solve this problem.</p><p>Let's bring in Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar from Minnesota. Her district includes the Annunciation Catholic School, where this horrific shooting took place.</p><p>Congresswoman, what's your reaction to what White HousePress Secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier today about the power of prayer?</p><p>REP. ILHAN OMAR (D-MN): Obviously, we all believe in the power of prayer. It is really important when families and communities are experiencing devastating grief that we pray for them to find relief, comfort and to ask for the Almighty to help with that healing.</p><p>But I can also understand the frustration that so many communities who have found themselves in these kind of horrifying moments feel that the only thing that's being offered is something that does not feel like there is an actionable item on the agenda. We heard from the priest and the principal of the Annunciation Catholic School, what he said yesterday is that he shared an African proverb that said, pray and move your feet.</p><p>That tells us that it is important for us to pray. But it's also important for us to take actions as well.</p><p>TAPPER: You were at the news conference today. The mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey, called for state and federal bans on what are called assault weapons and high capacity magazines.</p><p>You questioned why Americans have the power to change this problem, but don't change this problem. What do you think can realistically be done in this Congress in order for there to be some action when it comes to keeping firearms out of the hands of mentally disturbed individuals who are sure to use them to do harm to themselves or others?</p><p>OMAR: I mean, we as Americans used to have this ban and decided to let it expire. We can reinstall the ban, but we can also address mental health issues in a serious way. We can collectively think of what we have to do when we see signs, signs that tell us that there might be something wrong.</p><p>[18:50:05]</p><p>When we see these kind of videos on YouTube channels where somebody is glorifying violence, when we see them stockpiling that level of ammunition, when we see them have, you know, alarming messages written on their weapons.</p><p>It is important for us to take action in reporting those kind of disturbing videos, so that the relative agencies are able to investigate and make sure whatever action that person might be planning is not something that is going to devastate families and whole communities. Like we have been devastated and the families and the victims in Minneapolis have been.</p><p>TAPPER: You're not just a congresswoman, obviously, you're a mom. You have two sons and two daughters. As a parent, what do you even begin to say to these grieving parents? How do you even begin to process it?</p><p>OMAR: This is, you know, not the kind of thing that you can process when you are a parent. And I can't even imagine how the, how the parents who this has happened to are able to, to process it. Just, you know, Jake, you're also a parent. Imagine taking, you know, your little ones, to school. It's already hard to drop them off and leave them behind.</p><p>And moments later as they are kneeling in prayer, you learn that your little children have been assassinated by a monster. And you have to come to terms with, you know, the idea that you just dropped them off and they are no longer there, or you now are having to visit them in the hospital.</p><p>We heard about a story where one of the parents was a nurse, as she rushed to attend to the victims that were showing up at the hospital, she learned that one of her children, was part of that. I mean, this is something horrific that as Americans, we have had to deal with in, you know, countless times.</p><p>And I remember, you know, the nearly the 20th anniversary of Columbine. My daughter, who has been an active -- has been active in making sure that we end this senseless gun violence in our country, organized a walkout, and she came. I was just newly elected, and she said, mom, you were in high school when Columbine happened. You all didn't do anything and we now have to deal with this ourselves.</p><p>And so, it is really important to make sure that we address this, so no other parents, no other community, no other school and no other city or state has to experience this kind of gut-wrenching, horrifying, painful experience that we now know in Minneapolis.</p><p>TAPPER: Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, thank you so much.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[18:57:14]</p><p>TAPPER: So much going on today in our politics lead. President Trump's move to oust Fed Governor Lisa Cook tests the independence of the Federal Reserve and sets up another legal battle over President Trump's authority.</p><p>Here now is CNN's senior legal analyst, Elie Honig. He is the author of the upcoming book, \"When You Come At The King: Inside DOJ's pursuit of the President from Nixon to Trump\". It is set to release on September 16th. We will obviously have him back to discuss this juicy looking book.</p><p>But let's talk about the subject. Does President Trump have cause? Does he have a legal basis to fire Lisa Cook because there have been allegations made about her and mortgage fraud.</p><p>ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: So, we're going to start to find out tomorrow when there's a hearing. The first question is, is there any \"there\" there?</p><p>Now what the administration has so far is a referral from a federal agency that oversees mortgages that lays out the facts that Ms. Cook signed two mortgages within about three weeks of each other, one in Michigan and one in Virginia -- one in Georgia, excuse me, claiming both were her primary residence. Now, that's not nothing, but I don't think that's enough.</p><p>And I think what the judge is going to say tomorrow is you have to make a showing to me that there's enough there to show that she committed some wrongdoing. If they can show that, then the second question is, is it somehow related to her job with the Fed? And I think there's a good argument, if she did commit fraud, how can you be on the Fed if you were engaged in financial fraud? So that's going to be the first inquiry.</p><p>If there is cause to dismiss her, game over, she's dismissed and that's it. If there's not, then we're going to get into the juicier constitutional questions about whether the president has the right to fire her with or without cause.</p><p>TAPPER: This fight is headed to the U.S. Supreme Court, where recent rulings have suggested that this conservative leaning court is inclined to give the president expansive powers. Have you seen any signals on how the court might view this case?</p><p>HONIG: So, there's signals both ways. The good news for the Trump administration is the court has absolutely given him expanded powers to fire federal officials, federal employees, regardless of laws that congress has passed.</p><p>The bad news, though, for the Trump administration is in a major ruling along those lines, back in May, the Supreme Court went out of its way to say, yes, you have very broad powers, but the Fed is different. The Fed is designed to be quasi-independent. It derives from the First and Second National Bank.</p><p>And so, I read that as a pretty clear signal from the Supreme Court that, yes, were going to give you very broad power over traditional agencies in the executive branch, but the Fed, I think, is different. I think if it goes to the Supreme Court, as generous as they've been with executive power, I do think they will draw a line here and say no to Trump on this.</p><p>TAPPER: Very quickly. What if Lisa Cook says, I messed up, I didn't mean to do that, I misunderstood what was being asked for, I have returned the money that whatever tax benefits she got, paid -- sent a check to the federal treasury, sorry, I goofed? HONIG: Yeah, that's going to be up to the judge if the judge credits that, then it's not fraud. Then it's a mistake, right? But that's going to be -- the judge is essentially going to serve as the jury here. We're not going to have a full trial. It's a credibility determination for the judge.</p><p>TAPPER: Elie Honig, thanks so much. You can follow me on Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and on TikTok @jaketapper. You can follow the show on X @TheLeadCNN. If you ever miss an episode of THE LEAD, you can listen to the show whence you get your podcasts.</p><p>\"ERIN BURNETT OUTFRONT\" starts right now.

Rebecca Keltie Speak For All Colorado Republicans?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Minority Leader Rose Pugliese Owes Colorado Springs An Explanation</p><p>COLORADO SPRINGS: After far-right state Rep. Rebecca Keltie of Colorado Springs unapologetically doubled down on her expressed desire to see the state of Colorado \"burned to the ground\" following an interview last week in which Rep. Keltie also suggested that her colleagues in the Colorado General Assembly do not \"even have a soul,\" [1] ProgressNow Colorado, the state's largest multi-issue progressive advocacy organization, called on House Minority Leader Rose Pugliese to apologize to residents of Colorado Springs whose lives have been disrupted by wildfires in recent years on Rep. Keltie's behalf.</p><p>\"Waldo Canyon. The Black Forest Fire. The Meridian Fire just last March. To the people of Colorado Springs and El Paso County, wildfire is no laughing matter,\" said ProgressNow Colorado executive director Sara Loflin. \"After winning her state house seat by only three votes, Rep. Rebecca Keltie should be far more sensitive to the experience of the residents she represents in the Colorado General Assembly, and more respectful of her colleagues than to suggest they have no soul. At a moment when we need cooler heads to prevail in public office more than ever, Rep. Keltie's escalating rhetoric divides and hurts everyone, including her constituents.\"</p><p>\"If Rep. Keltie refuses to apologize for hoping Colorado is 'burned to the ground,' it falls to her Colorado Springs neighbor and House Minority Leader Rose Pugliese to make it clear that Rebecca Keltie does not speak for all Colorado Republicans,\" said Loflin. \"This isn't about censorship, it's about common decency and a basic sense of mutual respect among lawmakers. If Rep. Keltie really can't look her colleagues in the eye without suspecting they have no soul, elected office may not be the best place for her. Rep. Keltie should instead be in therapy.\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://progressnowcolorado.org/2025/05/13/release-does-rep-rebecca-keltie-speak-for-all-colorado-republicans/\">https://progressnowcolorado.org/2025/05/13/release-does-rep-rebecca-keltie-speak-for-all-colorado-republicans/</url></p><p>[Category: Sociological]</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-9243900 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR9243900</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FT8-2HT3-RSK7-Y4X8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"378\"/><timeReceived>9:00 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"05\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>May 14, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X84</classCode><className>US STATE GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001372</classCode><className>PRESS RELEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000271</classCode><className>CENSORSHIP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GX432</classCode><className>COLORADO SPRINGS, CO, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX545</classCode><className>DENVER, CO, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>GS121</classCode><className>COLORADO, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

On the 4th of September 2025, Weyerhaeuser released presentation materials for investors, emphasizing its commitment to disciplined capital allocation and sustainable practices.</p><p>The company set forth several key targets, including a significant $1 billion investment in timberlands by 2025. Additionally, Weyerhaeuser aims to grow its annual EBITDA from natural climate solutions to $100 million and increase lumber production by 5% each year. These targets reflect Weyerhaeuser's focus on fostering growth while prioritizing environmental sustainability.</p><p>Weyerhaeuser also reiterated its leadership in Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance, with a goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2040. Furthermore, the company is committed to maintaining robust shareholder returns through a sustainable dividend policy. The recent analyst rating on Weyerhaeuser stock (WY) is a Hold, with a price target set at $28.00.</p><p>According to Spark, TipRanks' AI Analyst, Weyerhaeuser's overall stock score indicates a stable financial position, backed by strong cash conversion capabilities.

This transaction, initially announced in May, includes the transfer of Weyerhaeuser's associated timber licenses in British Columbia, which are expected to be finalized in the coming months, subject to regulatory review and customary closing conditions.</p><p>As part of the sale, Weyerhaeuser received approximately $60 million USD upfront, with additional proceeds tied to the transfer of the timber licenses. The company has recognized a gain from the sale but anticipates a tax liability of about $11 million USD as a result of the transaction. This sale reflects Weyerhaeuser's ongoing strategy to optimize its operations and focus on its core business areas.</p><p>Established in 1900, Weyerhaeuser is among the largest private owners of timberlands worldwide, managing approximately 10.4 million acres in the U.S. and additional public timberlands in Canada.

The company is well-regarded for its high-value lumber products, particularly in the home finishing and renovation markets. The acquisition of Weyerhaeuser's mill aligns with Gorman Group's long-term strategy of enhancing its operational capabilities and market presence.</p><p>Weyerhaeuser's decision to divest its Princeton mill is part of a broader trend in the timber industry, where companies are reassessing their portfolios to focus on areas with higher growth potential.</p><p>Press Release article 3 of 13, Source: WEC, 75 words </p><p>August 12: Weyerhaeuser quarterly dividends steady</p><p>Weyerhaeuser today announced a quarterly dividend of 21.0c per share for Q2/2025; unchanged from the previous quarter (Q1/2025) dividend of 21.0c.

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply.

This investment is projected to expand engineered wood products capacity by 10 million cubic feet, positioning Weyerhaeuser to seize greater market share in the growing housing sector. While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.</p><p>Shareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program</p><p>Following completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.</p><p>Maintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges</p><p>Weyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.</p><p>Strengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility</p><p>The company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.</p><p>Capital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing</p><p>Management refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.</p><p>Focused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency</p><p>Excluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.</p><p>Expansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth</p><p>Weyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.</p><p>Unlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures</p><p>The announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.</p><p>Timberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base</p><p>Management advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.</p><p>Operational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures</p><p>Initiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.</p><p>Proactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities</p><p>Reserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties. By maintaining adequate coverage for contingent liabilities, Weyerhaeuser bolsters its balance sheet resilience.

According to news reporting out of Tianjin, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"This study aims to improve the accuracy of fire source detection, the efficiency of path planning, and the precision of firefighting operations in drone swarms during fire emergencies. It proposes an intelligent firefighting technology for drone swarms based on multi-sensor integrated path planning.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Fundamental Research Funds For The Central Universities For Civil Aviation University of China. <br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Civil Aviation University of China: \"The technology integrates the You Only Look Once version 8 (YOLOv8) algorithm and its optimization strategies to enhance real-time fire source detection capabilities. Additionally, this study employs multi-sensor data fusion and swarm cooperative path-planning techniques to optimize the deployment of firefighting materials and flight paths, thereby improving firefighting efficiency and precision. First, a deformable convolution module is introduced into the backbone network of YOLOv8 to enable the detection network to flexibly adjust its receptive field when processing targets, thereby enhancing fire source detection accuracy. Second, an attention mechanism is incorporated into the neck portion of YOLOv8, which focuses on fire source feature regions, significantly reducing interference from background noise and further improving recognition accuracy in complex environments. Finally, a new High Intersection over Union (HIoU) loss function is proposed to address the challenge of computing localization and classification loss for targets. This function dynamically adjusts the weight of various loss components during training, achieving more precise fire source localization and classification. In terms of path planning, this study integrates data from visual sensors, infrared sensors, and LiDAR sensors and adopts the Information Acquisition Optimizer (IAO) and the Catch Fish Optimization Algorithm (CFOA) to plan paths and optimize coordinated flight for drone swarms. By dynamically adjusting path planning and deployment locations, the drone swarm can reach fire sources in the shortest possible time and carry out precise firefighting operations. Experimental results demonstrate that this study significantly improves fire source detection accuracy and firefighting efficiency by optimizing the YOLOv8 algorithm, path-planning algorithms, and cooperative flight strategies. The optimized YOLOv8 achieved a fire source detection accuracy of 94.6% for small fires, with a false detection rate reduced to 5.4%.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The wind speed compensation strategy effectively mitigated the impact of wind on the accuracy of material deployment. This study not only enhances the firefighting efficiency of drone swarms but also enables rapid response in complex fire scenarios, offering broad application prospects, particularly for urban firefighting and forest fire disaster rescue.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Intelligent Firefighting Technology for Drone Swarms with Multi-Sensor Integrated Path Planning: YOLOv8 Algorithm-Driven Fire Source Identification and Precision Deployment Strategy.

Royce Cosmo Fuoco, 49, plead guilty on October 8, 2024, to ten counts of Distribution of Child Sexual Abuse Material, one count of Receipt of Child Sexual Abuse Material, and one count of Possession of Child Sexual Abuse Material.</p><p>According to court documents and other information presented in court, Fuoco was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) after receiving a cyber tip from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) that someone with the username \"ncfirefighter07\" on the social media application Kik had distributed at least 30 videos containing child sexual abuse material. Law enforcement executed a search warrant for the Kik account and found that user \"ncfirefighter07\" had 441 instances of distribution of child sexual abuse material to both individuals and groups on the Kik platform. Law enforcement linked that Kik account to Royce Fuoco, a former volunteer firefighter for the Wake Forest Fire Department.</p><p>Law enforcement executed a search warrant at Fuoco's house. Several digital devices seized contained child sexual abuse material and evidence of his distribution of the material. Fuoco admitted to law enforcement that he obtained child sexual abuse material in Kik chat groups. Fuoco said he was bored while working from home, and he would obtain the child sexual abuse material and then send it to other users.</p><p>Daniel P. Bubar, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina made the announcement after sentencing by Chief U.S. District Judge Richard E. Myers II. The Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated the case and Assistant U.S. Attorney Charity Wilson prosecuted the case.</p><p>Related court documents and information can be found on thewebsiteof theU.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina or onPACER by searching for Case No. 5:24-CR-229.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1127130180</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FS1-29H3-RV8S-B3R1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"367\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"05\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>May 8, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
