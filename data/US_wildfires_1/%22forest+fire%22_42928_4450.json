That might provide a buffering effect on western fires for the next few decades, but the threat of climate-driven forest fires is not diminishing, a new study shows.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Without substantial changes in how people interact with wildfire in the western U.S., climate change will increasingly put people in harm's way as fires become larger and more severe.</p><p>UCMerced professors John Abatzoglou and Crystal Kolden, with the School of Engineering, along with collaborators from the University of Washington, UCLA and the Cary Institute, recently published a paper in the journal Nature Communications Earth and Environment detailing their findings:</p><p>* Climate-driven increases in forest-fire area in the western U.S. are likely to continue in the coming few decades;</p><p>* Dynamic feedbacks between fire and fuel availability can reduce increasing fire activity, but are unlikely to ward off climate-driven increases in forest fire extent; and</p><p>* Extreme West-wide fire seasons similar to 2020 will become more common, but not every year will be that severe.</p><p>This study is the first that considers uncertainties in both climate trajectories and fire-fuel feedbacks on near-term changes in the western U.S. forest-fire areas. Many modeling efforts have ignored vegetation feedbacks in projecting fire activity, but the researchers on this study incorporated a range of plausible fire-fuel feedback scenarios.</p><p>\"We looked at them alongside climate projections to ask whether these feedbacks will sufficiently bend the curve of increasing fire activity in our forests,\" Abatzoglou said. \"We show that compared to the past three-decades -- which already saw large increases in burned areas -- the average annual forest area burned from 2021-2050 is likely to increase by 50 to 100 percent.</p><p>\"We have to buckle up and get ready for bigger fire seasons.\"</p><p>A century of fire-suppression efforts left forest floors carpeted with fuels that have interacted with a warming and drying climate to produce a dramatic increase in fire extent. The continued increase in forest fires will carve away at the accumulation of fuel, but that's not going to be enough to reverse the trend of escalating forest-fire area in the western U.S. in the coming decades.</p><p>The researchers also show that climate change will increase the year-to-year variability in area burned, leading to substantial increases in the occurrence of fire seasons rivaling the 2020 fire season.</p><p>\"Our results show that even with strong reductions in fossil fuel use, over the next 30 years warming due to climate change will greatly increase the annual averaged area burned,\" said University of Washington atmospheric sciences Professor David Battisti, a co-author of the new paper. \"Perhaps more worrying, the area burned in most severe fire seasons will increase exponentially. The total area burned in western U.S. forests in the next 30 years will be equivalent to one-third of the total forested area.\"</p><p>The findings are critical for refining near-term trajectories of direct and indirect fire effects to human-environment systems in the western U.S. and devising adaptation and mitigation strategies, the researchers said.</p><p>One way to bend the curve of rising forest fire activity is to make a larger investment in appropriate place-based strategies already being used, such as prescribed fire, forest clearing and allowing fires to burn when they pose no threat to homes or infrastructure, Abatzoglou said.</p><p>The Biden administration's recent pushes for climate change-driven infrastructure make this work all the more important.</p><p>\"The data we have can help us understand escalating fire impacts in the western U.S., as well as other fire-prone regions of the globe that have been the subject of recent fire outbreaks,\" the researchers said. \"Given the impacts of wildfire on society highlighted by recent and ongoing extreme events, efforts to understand the influences of weather and climate against the backdrop of current non-climatic factors such as land management are urgent.\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>JOURNAL: Nature Communications Earth and Environment <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-021-00239-8\">https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-021-00239-8</url></p><p>Contact: Lorena Anderson, Senior Writer and Public Information Representative, 209/228-4406, 209/201-6255, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:landerson4@ucmerced.edu\">landerson4@ucmerced.edu</email></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7670394 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7670394</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:643T-5MH1-JC11-1354-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"748\"/><timeReceived>7:40 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 18, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This research project aimed to fill the knowledge gaps related to themes of resilience/sustainability and wildland/wildland-urban interface fires. The primary objective of this research was to characterize the environmental and health impacts of wildland and structural, large-scale fire events. The research objective was carried out through the completion of four tasks: a literature review of large- scale fire incidents (Task 1), identification of current large-scale incident impact monitoring capabilities (Task 2), identification of standards and industry best practices for quantification of large-scale incident impact (Task 3), and a gap analysis (Task 4).</p><p>The literature review for Task 1 included 41 articles which identified health and environmental impacts of large-scale fire incidents such as the 2018 Camp fire in California, the 2017 Grenfell Tower fire in the United Kingdom, and the 2005 Buncefield fire in the United Kingdom. Tasks 2 and 3 composed the landscape analysis. Eleven programs used to monitor large- scale fire incidents were found within the scope of Task 2. These programs are used to track incidents in North America, Europe, Australia, and beyond. Examples of monitoring programs reviewed were NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management (FIRMS), the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS), and the Air Quality in Major Incidents (AQinMI) service. Seven standards, industry best practices, or tools were identified which aim to quantify the impact of large-scale fire events on environmental and human health as part of Task 3. Examples of standards and guides reviewed were ISO 26367: Guidelines for assessing the adverse environmental impact of fire effluents and the American Industrial Hygiene Association's Technical Guide for Wildfire Impact Assessments for the OEHS Professional.</p><p>The Task 4 gap analysis showed, while we have made considerable advancements in our knowledge and understanding of the environmental and health impacts of large-scale fires, there is still more work to be done to fully appreciate and understand all aspects of the issue. Twelve gaps were identified. Incident monitoring programs were found to be wildfire fire centric, despite evidence that non-wildland, large-scale fire incidents can be detrimental to environmental and human health. Systems that are designed for or that can be implemented to monitor non-wildland fire incidents could provide a benefit to public health. Incident monitoring programs were also found to track a limited number of emissions with no real time capabilities. In addition, programs primarily focused on the impact that large-scale events have on air quality, and to a lesser extent soil quality, with little consideration for the impact of emissions on waterways. The gap analysis showed that there is a limited understanding of messaging and shelter-in-place effectiveness and that comprehensive datasets on injuries resulting from large-scale events do not exist. Additionally, the psychological impact of large-scale events has largely focused on wildfires and PTSD symptoms. Other types of large-scale event impacts or psychological impacts have not been widely explored. There is also limited data on the secondary risks of large-scale fires, such as mudslides, floods, or consumption of contaminated food or water. Moreover, the approaches used in health and environmental impact assessment view chemicals independently and do not consider additive or synergistic interactions between chemicals. Lastly, validated methods for quantification of impact and triggers for remediation and restoration do not exist.</p><p>Given the identified gaps, there is a need for the fire protection engineering community to align research efforts and to collaborate with safety, health, and environmental professionals (SHEP) to advance our understanding of the environmental and health impacts of fire and fire suppression activities during large-scale events.</p><p>* * *</p><p>6. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS</p><p>The primary objective of this research was to characterize the environmental and health impacts of wildland and structural large-scale fire events. The research project included four tasks: (a) a literature review, (b) an analysis of large-scale fire incident impact monitoring capabilities, (c) an analysis of standards, industry best practices, and tools for impact quantification, and (d) a gap analysis. The literature review included 41 articles which identified health and environmental impacts of large-scale fire events. The most common mental health effects studied were PTSD or PTSD symptoms. The most common physical health symptoms were respiratory conditions (e.g., decreased lung function, cough, soreness of throat, irritation to the upper respiratory tract). Proximity to the fire and pre-existing conditions were the two most common factors for physical health impact. Plume position, level of exposure, and the type of role played during the fire (e.g., firefighting or assisting in cleanup) also affected physical health, which could be related to proximity as well. Gender, age, and socioeconomic differences correlated with differences between physical health impact as well.</p><p>Environmental health impact was mainly focused on pollution. Eight articles discussed air pollution, eight discussed soil pollution, and three discussed water pollution. Most articles found an elevated concentration of pollutants in the environment with PM, heavy metals, and VOCs/SVOCs being the most common. Among the VOCs/SVOCs, benzene, PAHs, dioxins, and furans were most common. Two articles discussing fire water runoff into bodies of water found elevated levels of PFAS, especially 6:2 FTS and PFOS. Overall, meteorological conditions were an important factor in pollution. Proximity to the fire site, particle characteristics (e.g., size, composition, phase), and environmental characteristics (e.g., topography, soil profile, water flow) also controlled the degree of impact. For pollution via air transport, models considered the characteristics of the fuel and fire, as well as emission factors.</p><p>Eleven programs were found which are used to monitor large-scale fire incidents. These programs are used to track incidents in North America, Europe, Australia, and beyond. The programs primarily track fire location, burnt area, air quality, and in some cases, emissions. The programs rely upon satellite imagery and in some cases, air quality monitoring stations, field personnel, and modeling to track events. Organizations managing these systems or programs include the British Columbia Center on Disease Control (CDC), Digital Earth Australia, the European Commission's (EC) Copernicus Emergency Management Service (Copernicus EMS), the Group on Earth Observations (GEO), the Secretariat General of the EC- Expert Group on Forest Fires (EGFF), the United Kingdom's Environment Agency (EA), the United States Department of Agriculture- Forest Service (USFS), the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the Western Australian Land Information Authority (Landgate). The primarily focus of the programs is on wildfire impact, and of those that report air quality, it is commonly based upon PM concentrations only.</p><p>Seven standards, industry best practices, or tools were identified which aim to quantify the impact of large-scale fire events on environmental and human health. Organizations that developed and manage these documents include the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the U.S. Forest Service, and the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA). ISO 26367 is a three-part standard which provides general guidelines for assessing the adverse environmental impact of fire effluents, methodology for compiling data on environmentally significant emissions, and sampling and analysis techniques. The USDA FOFEM programs can be used to predict tree mortality, fuel consumption, mineral soil exposure, smoke and soil heating, and emissions, and the USDA FEAT/FIREMON program is used to assist with the creation of a monitoring and sampling system to allow for the assessment of the effects of a wildland fire. Lastly, the AIHA technical guide provide occupational safety and health professionals with guidance on investigation process, sampling methodology, and analytical techniques to determine the impact of a wildfire on a structure.</p><p>Based upon findings from Tasks 1 through 3, twelve gaps were identified as it relates to large-scale fire incident knowledge, understanding, resources, and tools. Incident monitoring programs were found to be wildfire centric, despite the environmental and human health impacts that have been shown to result from non-wildland fires, particularly large-scale industrial fires. Incident monitoring programs were also found to track a limited number of emissions with no real time capabilities. In addition, programs primarily focused on the impact that large-scale events have on air quality, and to a lesser extent soil quality, with little consideration for the impact of emissions on waterways. The gap analysis showed that there is a limited understanding of messaging and shelter-in-place effectiveness and that comprehensive datasets on injuries resulting from large-scale events do not exist. Additionally, the psychological impact of large-scale events has largely focused on wildfires and PTSD symptoms; other types of large-scale event impacts or other types of psychological impacts have not been widely explored. There is also limited data on the secondary risks of large-scale fires, such as mudslides, floods, or consumption of contaminated food or water. Moreover, the approaches used in health and environmental impact assessment view chemicals independently and do not consider additive or synergistic interactions between chemicals. Lastly, validated methods for quantification of impact and triggers for remediation and restoration do not exist. Given the identified gaps, there is a need for the fire protection engineering community to align research efforts and to collaborate with safety, health, and environmental professionals (SHEP) to advance our understanding of the environmental and health impacts of fire and fire suppression activities during large-scale events.</p><p>* * *</p><p>References</p><p>Ackermann-Liebrich, U.

According to news reporting out of Lugo, Spain, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Since the adoption of European Union Council Directive 92/43 on the conservation of natural habitats and wild fauna and flora, some opposition has arisen among owners and managers of land affected by the directive.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Grupos De Referencia Competitiva Xunta De Galicia. <br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from University of Santiago de Compostela: \"Some studies have indicated that some of this opposition has found expression in subsequent arson fires in these areas. This article analyses the occurrence of arson fires in the SACs (Special Areas of Conservation) included in the European ecological network, Natura 2000, in Galicia (Spain), more specifically in the montes vecinales en mano comun (MVMCs), which are privately owned collective lands. We tested whether the declaration of SACs had a statistical impact on the forest fire regime in the period 1999-2014. The analyses focused on the sub-periods of 1999-2004 and 2005-2014, i.e., before and after the approval of the list of sites of community importance in the study area in December 2004. The results obtained show that, after the declaration of protection, there was a statistically significant increase in the area burnt by fire in these areas, mainly on private estates. We also found that the percentage of arson fires after 2004 was higher in SACs than in other territorial units.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"We found that the percentage of arson fires was reduced less in SACs than in other territorial units. Furthermore, we found that the area burnt per fire after 2004 in SACs was almost double that in the MVMC-SACs (12.04 ha versus 6.64 ha), so it can be concluded that the conservationist policies of the Natura 2000 network in Galicia have not had a positive effect on the forest fire regime.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Influence of the Declaration of Protected Natural Areas on the Evolution of Forest Fires in Collective Lands in Galicia (Spain).

The new initiative is an extension ofour partnership with One Tree Planted, a non-profit organization that partners with businesses to plant trees all over the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2182860/VisitorsCoverage_Quebec_Tree_planting.jpg\"/></p><p>\"The devastation in Quebec should be a wake-up call for all of us to do our part,\" says CEO Rajeev Shrivastava.</p><p>Why Quebec Needs Trees</p><p>Climate change is caused in major part by an overabundance of Carbon Dioxide. Trees are the single best way to reduce CO2 because they breathe it in and convert it to oxygen. Without trees, we will see a rise in deadly heat waves, droughts, and yes, wildfires.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Canada's boreal forest is one of the world's richest ecosystems, and accounts for 9% of the world's forestation. Threaded with beautiful blue lakes and streams teeming with majestic spruces, firs and pines, and home to black bears, caribou, moose and great gray owls, this forest is as much a work of art as it is a vital driver of the country's environmental health. And in Quebec the forest has been besieged by wildfires for the last four months.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>According to the Quebec Provincial Forest Fire Control Agency, 3.2 million hectares of forest have burned in Quebec since the 2023 wildfires began. To put this into perspective, the average number of hectares burned in all of Canada is 2.5 million. While Quebec needed reforestation prior to the wildfire devastation, that need has now intensified exponentially.</p><p>The Human Toll</p><p>So far, hundreds of Canadians have been forced to leave their homes. In what should be their peak season, the livelihoods of hunters and fishermen are now in jeopardy as businesses are shuttered.\u00a0</p><p>Air quality issues caused by toxic smoke from the wildfires are already impacting the health and wellbeing of many residents. Inhaling toxic smoke and ash from these wildfires could damage the lungs and heart and even weaken our immune systems.</p><p>These health concerns aren't confined to Canada's borders. Air pollution from the fires is now impacting the lives of many Americans.\u00a0</p><p>VisitorsCoverage's Promise to the Planet</p><p>VisitorsCoverage was founded on one simple goal: helping people. Whether we're helping immigrants settle in America, retirees live out their travel dreams, or students explore and learn about their world, helping and doing good is at the forefront of everything we do. We partnered with One Tree Planted to do just that.</p><p>\"The devastation in Quebec should be a wake-up call for all of us to do our part,\" says VisitorsCoverage CEO Rajeev Shrivastava.\u00a0</p><p>A Shared Mission to Protect &amp; Conserve</p><p>On the surface, a company that sells travel insurance and an organization that plants trees don't seem to have much in common. Dig a little deeper, however, and you'll find that both VisitorsCoverage and One Tree Planted are driven by a commitment to protect and educate. One company aims to protect travelers, while the other aims to protect the world they travel. We are proud to continue our partnership to ensure that travelers and Mother Earth stay protected for generations to come.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>About One Tree Planted:One Tree Planted is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit on a mission to make it simple for anyone to help the environment by planting trees. Their projects span the globe and are done in partnership with local communities and knowledgeable experts to create an impact for nature, people, and wildlife. Reforestation helps to rebuild forests after fires and floods, provide jobs for social impact, and restore biodiversity. Many projects have overlapping objectives, creating a combination of benefits that contribute to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.

With completion of the CNF project, 30% of San Diego's backcountry electric infrastructure has been fire-hardened to date.</p><p>\"This fire hardening project will not only safeguard communities within and adjacent to Forest from potential wildfire threats. It also protects priority watersheds improves sensitive wildlife habitats and scenic areas,\" said Cleveland National Forest Supervisor Scott Tangenberg. \"This project was indeed a team effort, and it strengthened relationships and fostered new partnerships that will have lasting results for the cultural and natural resources we manage.\"</p><p>The project was not only one of SDG&amp;E's first large-scale fire hardening projects but was also one of the most challenging so far due to its size, complexity, rugged terrain, remote locations, the amount of undeveloped land, and the abundance of cultural resources that were discovered during the project. Recognizing the importance of avoiding and protecting these sensitive resources, SDG&amp;E worked with the U.S. Forest Service to consult with the local Kumeyaay and Luiseao Tribes to fire harden the electric infrastructure on National Forest System lands, as well as other lands within the high fire threat district. Tribal consultation efforts continue as SDG&amp;E enters the post-construction phase of the project. The team responsible for completing the project in an environmentally and culturally sensitive manner included dedicated staff from SDG&amp;E, the CPUC and U.S. Forest Service who worked together to ensure all mitigation measures and compliance requirements were met. SDG&amp;E was able to successfully complete construction of the project with zero agency issued non-compliances.</p><p>The CNF portfolio of projects is just one of many wildfire resiliency projects included in SDG&amp;E's Wildfire Mitigation Plan (WMP) filed with the CPUC each year. In accordance with Senate Bill 901, the WMP outlines the ongoing practices and additional improvements SDG&amp;E will make beyond the investments the utility already has made to combat the effects of the changing climate and threat of year-round wildfires.

On Monday, firefighters struggled for a 10th consecutive day to contain flames ravaging the northeastern Evros region, where multiple blazes have formed a deadly inferno. Authorities say the initial fire near the port town of Alexandropoulis was likely sparked by lightning. But while anger grows , much of Greece is preoccupied with finding someone to blame. </p><p>Leading Greek politicians have sought to focus the nation's attention on catching arsonists, with some even spreading conspiracy theories about who set the fires. Vassilis Kikilias, minister for civil protection, blamed \"lowlife arsonists\" for the fires in a furious televised speech last week. \"You are committing a crime against the country, you will not get away with it, we will find you, you will be held accountable,\" he said. With more than 297 square miles razed - an area roughly the size of New York City - the Evros fire is the biggest blaze the European Forest Fire Information Service (EFFIS) has ever recorded since it began collecting data in the year 2000. It's only one of several wildfires currently burning in Greece. Across the country, the fires have ravaged vast swaths of land - more than 579 square miles this year so far, according to EFFIS. At least 20 people died. The destruction is a stark reminder of the threat climate change poses to the country: The Mediterranean region is becoming hotter and drier as the planet warms, making it easier for fires to spread. \"We must continue strengthening national [and] collective prevention and preparedness efforts in view of more brutal fire seasons,\" Janez Lenarcic, the E.U.'s crisis commissioner, warned last week in response to the Evros fire. Experts say European countries have to step up forest management in particular, as fires spread particularly quickly through large tracts of dry vegetation. Yet while Greece's government has acknowledged it needs to boost preventive efforts, its response in recent weeks has been to look for scapegoats. Most fires in the E.U. ignite due to human behavior - whether intentional or not. But the emphasis on what sparked the fires has drawn criticism from experts. V\u00c3\u00adctor Resco de Dios, professor of forest science at Spain's University of Lleida, said focusing on who or what started the fire allows governments to \"blame the fires on individuals\" rather than policy failures. \"Whereas if the discussion is around what made the fire spread, then we'd need to talk about who's responsible for managing forests - and in this case, the blame could be on politicians,\" he added. \"This is why the debate is often quickly shifted away from forest management to what caused the ignition.\" Across Greece, the fires - and the political focus on finding culprits - are stoking existing tensions. In Evros, locals have pointed the finger at migrants and refugees; the region, close to the Turkish border, is a frequent transit point for those seeking a better life in the European Union. \"We are at war,\" said Paris Papadakis, a lawmaker from the far-right Greek Solution party who represents Evros. \"They've come here in a coordinated way and the illegal migrants specifically set fire to over 10 places,\" he claimed. Several newspapers ran blaming migrants. Some locals literally hunted for scapegoats, in one case locking 13 asylum-seekers they accused of arson in a van. The Alexandroupolis prosecutor's office charged the 13 people with attempted arson; they were later released. Their capturers are awaiting trial. Greek Solution's president, Kyriakos Velopoulos, last week also blamed \"illegal immigrants\" for the fires. Last month, he sought to build on existing opposition to wind power by blaming turbines - the conspiracy theory that land is burnt to make way for wind farms is widespread in Greece. Greece has arrested dozens of suspected arsonists in recent weeks, but many of them were later released. Three out of four people detained last Thursday were released , for example. Lighters found in their possession, considered incriminating evidence, were not working, while suspicious sprays turned out to be just car deodorants. The fourth suspect is a person with serious psychological issues, according to local media. So far, no one - neither local nor migrant - has been convicted of starting fires around Evros. But authorities are fairly certain that most of the fire's victims are migrants and refugees who hid in the woods. Pavlos Pavlidis, the Alexandropoulis coroner, told Greek media that two of the 18 charred bodies in the region last week were children. \"They were all found in groups of two or three people at a distance of 500 meters,\" he said, \"apparently while trying to escape.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-0000018a41a3d2a3a3fee7bb0ecd0000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6986-X1V1-JBSK-R00V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"800\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 29, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000113</classCode><className>ARSON</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002003</classCode><className>ELECTIONS &amp; POLITICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DS5C</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>ST000DPS6</classCode><className>CONSPIRACY THEORY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp; DYING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DS5C</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>GX601</classCode><className>NEW YORK, NY, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS148</classCode><className>NEW YORK, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GT115</classCode><className>EUROPE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC319</classCode><className>GREECE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC325</classCode><className>SPAIN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

In 2022, which was marked by a severe drought that the state only now is recovering from, Rhode Island experienced more than 80 wildland fires. Parched conditions forced DEM to ban outdoor fires at all state campgrounds, parks, and management areas for a two-week period in August.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Prescribed, or planned, burning is a versatile tool that natural resources managers use for maintaining habitat and plant diversity. Along with protecting human communities from extreme fires by reducing hazardous natural fuels, the right fire at the right place and right time help to:</p><p>o Remove invasive and unwanted plant species that threaten ecosystems o Slow the spread of pest insects and disease o Restore native ecosystems such as pitch pine barrens, pine-oak woodlands, and maritime grasslands and shrublands o Promote the growth of native warm season grasses and wildflowers to diversify pollinator habitats o Recycle essential nutrients back into the soil, and o Train municipal and wildland firefighters in the methods and techniques of suppressing wildfires</p><p>DEM has burn plans in place for four areas starting this spring and stretching into the fall:</p><p>o Dutch Island, Jamestown, where DEM conducted its last prescribed burn in March 2022 o Nicholas Farm Management Area, Coventry o Pratt Farm, Arcadia Management Area, Exeter o Prudence Island, Portsmouth</p><p>\"Prescribed fire is an important land management practice DEM uses to restore degraded forestlands, promote diverse wildlife habitats, and remove hazardous fuels to protect rural communities from wildfires,\" said DEM Forest Fire Program Manager Pat MacMeekin. \"We are working to return fire to the landscape where appropriate, to improve Rhode Island's ecological systems and increase public safety.\"</p><p>By increasing its use of prescribed fire, Rhode Island will be better aligning its land management policies and practices with neighboring states. From 2018 to 2022, Massachusetts ignited 223 prescribed fires totaling 7,148 acres and Connecticut had 18 prescribed fires totaling 300 acres. In the same five-year period, Rhode Island conducted three prescribed fires totaling around 75 acres. Among other benefits, common ecological restoration goals with other states help to strengthen climate change resilience across southern New England.</p><p>More planned, prescribed fires mean fewer unplanned, extreme wildfires.</p><p>Specialists write burn plans for prescribed fires. Burn plans identify - or prescribe - the best conditions under which trees and other plants will burn to get the best results safely. Burn plans consider temperature, humidity, wind, moisture of the vegetation, and conditions for the dispersal of smoke. Prescribed fire specialists compare conditions on the ground to those outlined in burn plans before deciding whether to burn on a given day. If the weather is too hot, too dry, or the winds are too strong, prescribed fire operations are postponed until the weather is more moderate. The approved weather conditions are predetermined in the prescribed fire plan for a property and are specific to the intent of the prescribed fire and the property location.</p><p>\"DEM's main concerns in conducting prescribed burns are human safety, protection of built infrastructure, and protection of sensitive resources, especially if fire has been absent from an ecological area for many years,\" said Chief of Agriculture and Forest Environment Ken Ayars. \"DEM personnel who are trained in the use of prescribed fire, along with local fire departments, will oversee the prescribed fire. As we did with our last prescribed burn on Dutch Island last March, DEM will begin public outreach and notification efforts around 30 to 45 days before our first burn in 2023, again about a week before the event, and then again a day or two before the burn when a reliable burn window can be established based on weather and wind conditions.\"</p><p>Experts from DEM's Forest Fire Program, a subsidiary of the Division of Agriculture and Forest Environment, will lead the prescribed burns. They will employ detailed operational and safety plans. Planning is critical for every burn. A prescribed burn plan developed by a qualified burn boss must be in place before a burn is conducted. Firebreaks and other site preparations are made. Fire behavior, fuels, and weather are monitored throughout the burn, and if the prescription parameters are exceeded, the fire is shut down.

Affected communities require prompt coordination of actions to protect the health, safety or welfare of all, and limit damages to property, infrastructure, and the environment. EMAP supports impacted communities through agency response via the wildland fire and the emergency management service agreements with the Province of Alberta, resource coordination, organizational structure and evacuee supports. Once the response phase is over, the Program will provide recovery support for repairs to on-reserve community infrastructure to restore to pre-event conditions, mitigation measures to infrastructure to minimize future impacts and personal losses.</p><p>Public Health Agency of Canada's National Emergency Strategic Stockpile is engaged and has already shipped requested supplies and is standing by to provide more if required.</p><p>Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada is working with the province of Alberta and telecommunications service providers to keep people connected.</p><p>Parks Canada is sending an 18-member Incident Command Team to support the Province of Alberta. These wildland fire management specialists are trained to manage complex fires and other incidents. This deployment is being coordinated through the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.</p><p>The Government Operations Centre is working to coordinate the federal response to the wildfire situation in Alberta and across the country. Officials are working closely with federal and provincial partners to coordinate this assistance.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125896749</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6870-7MV1-DYTH-G3CH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"590\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"05\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>May 11, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This is New Jersey. And during this summer's thirsty days, undergirded by climate change, the state has gotten far too little rain.</p><p><br/>\"We're in the midst of a very dry spell,\" David Robinson, New Jersey's state climatologist, told me. \"Borderline drought in central New Jersey, and dry conditions to the north and south of there.\"<br/>In this, the Garden State is not alone. Data from <url normalizedValue=\"https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?conus\">the U.S. Drought Monitor</url> show that roughly two-thirds of the United States is facing unusually dry conditions ranging from abnormally dry to extreme drought. This includes regions typically thought of as relatively wet-parts of New York, including New York City, and much of New England, including Boston. By the standards of more arid climes, the Northeast is still fairly wet. But \"drought is relative to the normal climate regime of an area,\" Robinson said. \"They'd be thrilled with 30 inches of rain down in the Colorado basin. Here, 30 inches of rain in a year would be one of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://climate.rutgers.edu/stateclim_v1/nclimdiv/\">driest years on record</url>.\"<br/>With climate change, the destruction is in the details. The Northeast is now primed for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/07/history-flood-drought-photography-climate-change/670549/?utm_source=feed\">more frequent droughts</url> that will harm agriculture, intermittently reduce drinking-water supplies, and increase wildfire risk. The East will not emerge unscathed from the infernos that are quickly becoming a hallmark of western summers.  <br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/09/west-coast-fires-are-making-me-claustrophobic/616252/?utm_source=feed\">Read: The West has never felt so small</url>]<br/>In June, more than 13,000 acres burned in Wharton State Forest, during New Jersey's largest fire in the past 15 years. The fire, spread by strong winds and dry conditions in an area that was difficult for firefighters to access, was likely started by humans. Fortunately, it caused no human injuries, because it burned primarily on protected land with little development.<br/>This stretch of trees, New Jersey's largest state forest, is mostly pineland, and some of the increased fire risk owes to the ecology of the region. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.drought.gov/topics/soil-moisture\">Some soils, most notably clay soils, are like cotton towels</url>. They let water through, but they hold on to a good amount as well, and take a long time to dry out. Other, sandy soils are like quick-dry fabrics. More water pours through them; they hold on to less moisture.<br/>\"There's sort of an old adage, from some of the folks that worked in forest-fire organization in the early 1900s. They would say, ~You can have an inch of rain in the Pinelands region in New Jersey in the morning, and have a large fire in the afternoon,'\" Greg McLaughlin, the chief of the New Jersey Forest Fire Service and the state fire warden, told me. \"A lot of the soil is very sandy, so that water doesn't hang around. It goes through soil down to the aquifer and it's gone, perhaps within 24 hours.\"<br/>Pinelands are a fire-adapted ecosystem-they were meant to burn. These days, the Forest Fire Service deliberately sets fires in the region to promote the ecosystem's health and to reduce the risk of out-of-control conflagrations. But part of the fire risk comes from changing conditions. Hotter temperatures increase wildfire risk for the same reason they dry your clothes faster: They increase the rate of evaporation. Drier plants simply catch fire more easily. Once, April was New Jersey's peak fire season: Low humidity, high wind, increased temperatures, and less shade from deciduous trees all heightened fire risk. Now, McLaughlin said, \"we're seeing a lot of blending of the seasons  We're seeing fire behavior in June that resembles conditions of April.\" According to McLaughlin, fire season isn't just ending later; it now starts a month earlier too, in February.<br/>And New Jersey is not alone in facing these problems. Some experts predict that Pennsylvania's and West Virginia's fire risk will double in the coming years, and Georgia has recently struggled with more intense fires. Perhaps the greatest sign that the East's fire fates are shifting was the Great Smoky Mountain complex of fires, which struck near Gatlinburg, Tennessee, beginning in November 2016.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/03/wildfire-insurance-california-fair-plan/627065/?utm_source=feed\">Read: People deserve to know their houses are going to burn</url>]<br/>The region's trees give the mountains their eponymous smoky visage, by releasing compounds and water into the air. But that fall's severe drought meant that water was in short supply when two teens-who likely ignited the biggest fire-hiked a forested trail, lighting matches as they went. In the ensuing blazes, more than 14,000 people had to evacuate, 2,500 homes burned, and 14 people died.<br/>No single point of failure led to that catastrophe. The weather conditions set the groundwork, and the young people may have lit matches, but park officials declined to put that fire out, in part because they did not at first see it as a threat to the community. Suppressing wildfires has the unintended consequence of causing bigger fires down the line, so whenever possible, letting a fire burn is better than putting it out. In this case, downed power lines also started smaller fires. And as all those fires grew and grew, a windstorm arrived, turning them into a disaster.<br/>The lesson is not that the East will be as fire-prone as the West-the data don't bear that out. It is rather that, because of climate change, small risks will become larger risks.<br/>And somehow, we're going to have to prepare for them all.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-newjerseydroughtwildfirespineland671463</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66F1-NMM1-JCG7-V008-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"914\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

The need for innovative solutions and a shift in our understanding of wildfires has never been more pressing. \"Elemental\" aims to uncover these solutions, reimagining the narrative of wildfires from one of despair to one of resilience and adaptation.</p><p>On Wednesday, Oct. 18, Middlebury students, faculty and community members gathered in Dana Auditorium to explore this complex world of wildfire through the film's lens.</p><p>Though required to attend for her Earth and Climate Sciences class, Chelsea Smith '23.5 was also curious to learn more about how wildfire and climate change go hand in hand.</p><p>\"Changes in wildfire abundance and severity are quite clearly linked to human activity, and this film was another way for me to better understand our impact on the earth and what we can do to make a positive difference,\" Smith said.\u00a0</p><p>As the film opened, the audience was immediately pulled into the flames. Harrowing point of view footage and emotional recounts from residents of Paradise, Calif., who lost their homes in the Camp Fire that scorched over 150,000 acres in 2018 set the stage for the wildfire crisis at hand. The darkening skies, wind-blown flames, audio from frantic 911 calls and radio chatter from overwhelmed firefighters made the fear and heat palpable in the seats of the auditorium.\u00a0</p><p>This portrayal of the ways in which wildfire affects our society is one of the film's strengths - it gives voice to those who have been affected by the rapidly expanding fires across our country and brings their experience to people who have not felt wildfires' effects.</p><p>This narrative was balanced with a solutions-based approach that critiqued current strategies of fire management and pointed to ongoing wildfire research and generational ecological knowledge.\u00a0</p><p>Fire researchers shared methods for forest management that limit carbon emissions and promote fire as a natural entity, approaches that shift away from logging practices like clearcuts and thinning and toward the use of prescribed burns. Insights from members of the Yurok tribe shed light on how fire can be used as a tool to stimulate new vegetation growth and balance ecological dynamics for the benefit of flora and fauna.\u00a0</p><p>The film gave actionable advice for homeowners to protect their property, promoting the use of fire-proof building materials and the importance of creating defensible space between their house and the surrounding vegetation.</p><p>The success of \"Elemental\" can be traced to the expert voices that crafted its narrative. The cinematographic experience of director Tripp Jennings paired with the specialized knowledge of executive producer Ralph Bloemers created a well-balanced film that was both artful in its presentation and clear in its message.</p><p>After the screening of the film, both Jennings and Bloemers joined the audience via Zoom, along with Rick O'Rourke, a prominent voice in the film and member of the Cultural Fire Management Council, to discuss their work on the film over the past several years. Ryan Hughes, Forest Fire Management Officer for the Green Mountain and Finger Lakes National Forests, and Lauren Prinzing, an epidemiologist for the Vermont Department of Health Division of Environmental Health, participated in the panel in-person to contribute local perspectives. Facilitated by Geography Professor Joseph Holler, the panel offered more context and details about the film, related its themes to issues close to home in Vermont.</p><p>Bloemers offered a call to action, asking attendees to consider what each of us can do to reshape our relationship with wildfire, shifting away from a reliance on politicians and big-decision makers toward initiatives like Community Wildfire Protection Plans. Along that theme, Jennings emphasized the open-mindedness needed to adopt the changes required for survival in a world with wildfire.\u00a0</p><p>For O'Rourke, that starts with having conversations about wildfires at a young age, particularly in communities that lie in the wildland-urban interface, the zone of transition between human settlement and forest. He stated that this type of education will be essential to informing communities about the science behind wildfire management and how to be prepared when smoke fills the sky.</p><p>Focusing on Vermont forests specifically, Hughes underlined how we cannot control fire, stating that \"nature is far better at taking care of itself than we people are.\" We instead must use it as a management tool to proactively maintain forest health and prevent large-scale, damaging fires. This sentiment contributed to his message that fire is a benefit to the landscape and that we as humans must view it as such.</p><p>Prinzing emphasized the relevance of her work as an epidemiologist to wildfires and outlined initiatives to help people when air quality deteriorates - particularly those with existing respiratory conditions and others who may not have access to indoor shelter with clean air. The solution, Prinzing said, will come from interagency collaboration at both the national and local levels.\u00a0</p><p>When asked about her main takeaways from the evening, A.J. Rossbach '24, a member of the Middlebury Fire Department, appreciated the specific insights into wildfire in Vermont because most media tends to focus on wildfire in the west. With hopes of a career in fire management, Rossbach said that those local perspectives, as well as the research and knowledge presented in the film, provided her with information that will be useful in her future employment.</p><p>Walking away from the film, Smith expressed appreciation and a desire to take action and spread its message.</p><p>Enjoy what you're reading?

It can be to begin the educational process from state to state, city to city, no matter how close or distant from the area a fire hazard may seem to be,\" Smith said.\u00a0</p><p>At its core, \"Elemental: Reimagine Wildfire\" asks all of us to invest in a sustainable future with wildfire, sparking a paradigm shift in how we perceive and address it, while offering hope and attainable solutions in the face of climate change.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5607214</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69GJ-X7B1-JBSN-34BR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1096\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Middlebury Campus: Middlebury College</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"10\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>October 26, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Middlebury</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>VT</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"73\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Forest Lands</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTkzOTc4NEQ2MTQwNDg0Q0E0NDNFRkRDRDU1QUE0OEU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009FY2</classCode><className>ECOLOGY &amp;

In 2022, which was marked by a severe drought that the state only now is recovering from, Rhode Island experienced more than 80 wildland fires. Parched conditions forced DEM to ban outdoor fires at all state campgrounds, parks, and management areas for a two-week period in August.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Prescribed, or planned, burning is a versatile tool that natural resources managers use for maintaining habitat and plant diversity. Along with protecting human communities from extreme fires by reducing hazardous natural fuels, the right fire at the right place and right time help to:</p><p>o Remove invasive and unwanted plant species that threaten ecosystems</p><p>o Slow the spread of pest insects and disease</p><p>o Restore native ecosystems such as pitch pine barrens, pine-oak woodlands, and maritime grasslands and shrublands</p><p>o Promote the growth of native warm season grasses and wildflowers to diversify pollinator habitats</p><p>o Recycle essential nutrients back into the soil, and</p><p>o Train municipal and wildland firefighters in the methods and techniques of suppressing wildfires</p><p>DEM has burn plans in place for four areas starting this spring and stretching into the fall:</p><p>o Dutch Island, Jamestown, where DEM conducted its last prescribed burn in March 2022</p><p>o Nicholas Farm Management Area, Coventry</p><p>o Pratt Farm, Arcadia Management Area, Exeter</p><p>o Prudence Island, Portsmouth</p><p>\"Prescribed fire is an important land management practice DEM uses to restore degraded forestlands, promote diverse wildlife habitats, and remove hazardous fuels to protect rural communities from wildfires,\" said DEM Forest Fire Program Manager Pat MacMeekin. \"We are working to return fire to the landscape where appropriate, to improve Rhode Island's ecological systems and increase public safety.\"</p><p>By increasing its use of prescribed fire, Rhode Island will be better aligning its land management policies and practices with neighboring states. From 2018 to 2022, Massachusetts ignited 223 prescribed fires totaling 7,148 acres and Connecticut had 18 prescribed fires totaling 300 acres. In the same five-year period, Rhode Island conducted three prescribed fires totaling around 75 acres. Among other benefits, common ecological restoration goals with other states help to strengthen climate change resilience across southern New England.</p><p>More planned, prescribed fires mean fewer unplanned, extreme wildfires.</p><p>Specialists write burn plans for prescribed fires. Burn plans identify &amp;#150; or prescribe &amp;#150; the best conditions under which trees and other plants will burn to get the best results safely. Burn plans consider temperature, humidity, wind, moisture of the vegetation, and conditions for the dispersal of smoke. Prescribed fire specialists compare conditions on the ground to those outlined in burn plans before deciding whether to burn on a given day. If the weather is too hot, too dry, or the winds are too strong, prescribed fire operations are postponed until the weather is more moderate. The approved weather conditions are predetermined in the prescribed fire plan for a property and are specific to the intent of the prescribed fire and the property location.</p><p>\"DEM's main concerns in conducting prescribed burns are human safety, protection of built infrastructure, and protection of sensitive resources, especially if fire has been absent from an ecological area for many years,\" said Chief of Agriculture and Forest Environment Ken Ayars. \"DEM personnel who are trained in the use of prescribed fire, along with local fire departments, will oversee the prescribed fire. As we did with our last prescribed burn on Dutch Island last March, DEM will begin public outreach and notification efforts around 30 to 45 days before our first burn in 2023, again about a week before the event, and then again a day or two before the burn when a reliable burn window can be established based on weather and wind conditions.\"</p><p>Experts from DEM's Forest Fire Program, a subsidiary of the Division of Agriculture and Forest Environment, will lead the prescribed burns. They will employ detailed operational and safety plans. Planning is critical for every burn. A prescribed burn plan developed by a qualified burn boss must be in place before a burn is conducted. Firebreaks and other site preparations are made. Fire behavior, fuels, and weather are monitored throughout the burn, and if the prescription parameters are exceeded, the fire is shut down.</p><p>Beforehand, a permit is required from the town fire chief and an exemption from state air pollution control regulation Part 4: Open Fires (250-RICR-120-05-4) is required from the DEM Office of Air Resources. The burn is carried out by a skilled crew under the direction of a qualified burn boss. Abutting landowners are notified of fire dates, reasons, and expectations for the burn season.</p><p>For more information on DEM programs and initiatives, visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dem.ri.gov\">www.dem.ri.gov</url>.

According to news reporting originating in Gadanki, India, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"COVID-19 lockdown has given us an opportunity to investigate the pollutant concentrations in response to the restricted anthropogenic activities. The atmospheric concentration levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone (O-3) have been analysed for the periods during the first wave of COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 (25th March-31st May 2020) and during the partial lockdowns due to second wave in 2021 (25th March-15th June 2021) across India.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include DST INSPIRE Scholarship for Higher Education (SHE), Department of Science &amp; Technology (India). <br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from National Atmospheric Research Laboratory, \"The trace gas measurements from Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and Atmosphere InfraRed Sounder (AIRS) satellites have been used. An overall decrease in the concentration of O-3 (5-10%) and NO2 (20-40%) have been observed during the 2020 lockdown when compared with business as usual (BAU) period in 2019, 2018 and 2017. However, the CO concentration increased up to 10-25% especially in the central-west region. O-3 and NO2 slightly increased or had no change in 2021 lockdown when compared with the BAU period, but CO showed a mixed variation prominently influenced by the biomass burning/forest fire activities. The changes in trace gas levels during 2020 lockdown have been predominantly due to the reduction in the anthropogenic activities, whereas in 2021, the changes have been mostly due to natural factors like meteorology and long-range transport, as the emission levels have been similar to that of BAU. Later phases of 2021 lockdown saw the dominant effect of rainfall events resulting in washout of pollutants.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"This study reveals that partial or local lockdowns have very less impact on reducing pollution levels on a regional scale as natural factors like atmospheric long-range transport and meteorology play deciding roles on their concentration levels.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Spatial Variability of Trace Gases (No2, O-3 and Co) Over Indian Region During 2020 and 2021 Covid-19 Lockdowns.

The Minister urged the G20 nations to move ahead with a profound agenda to excel in inclusive, equitable and sustainable growth.</p><p>Referring to the fact that a number of Member States are represented at the highest level in their national science hierarchy, Dr Jitendra Singh said, this group has potential to address major global challenges, as we did recently while combating Covid pandemic. He emphasized that during Indias G20 Presidency, we stand committed to advancing global research and innovation for a better tomorrow.</p><p>Dr Jitendra Singh said, in recent times, Scientists and Researchers have been at the forefront of cutting-edge discoveries and advancements across multiple disciplines like space exploration to artificial intelligence, from biotechnology to nanotechnology and have pushed the boundaries of scientific understanding and have fostered innovation that benefits humanity as a whole.</p><p>Dr Jitendra Singh said, as the world grapples with the challenges of climate change and depleting natural resources, it becomes imperative to harness renewable energy sources efficiently. He emphasized that G-20 members should remain committed to our Net Zero goals and continue to work on sustainable development and renewable energy and expressed satisfaction that the world has witnessed substantial growth in solar and wind power installations in recent years. Our scientists have been working tirelessly to discover and create materials that can revolutionise the energy sector, making it cleaner, more affordable, and accessible for all, the Minister added.</p><p>Dr Jitendra Singh underscored that G20 nations must harness the power of technology and innovation to drive the transition towards cleaner energy sources and promote eco-innovations, such as smart grids, energy-efficient buildings, and sustainable transportation systems, as these initiatives not only mitigate environmental impact but also foster economic growth and create new avenues for job creation.</p><p>Dr Jitendra Singh also pointed out that G-20 community has advanced space technologies to predict and monitor various natural hazards, like cyclone, tsunami, landslides, forest fire, space technologies also help a lot in communication. He underlined the need to share products of these technologies to countries, outside G-20 also, so that they can better prepare themselves against such calamities.</p><p>Indias Science Minister told the delegates that developing quantum technologies, exploring quantum communication, cryptography, and quantum algorithms are our next level of G-20 research agenda. We aim to scale up scientific and industrial RandD, for accelerating Quantum Technology-led economic growth and leverage several economies into a leading nation supporting sustainable development, he added.</p><p>Dr Jitendra Singh said, Scientists have made significant contributions to genetic research and biotechnology and researchers focused on studying the genetic basis of diseases, developing personalized medicine approaches, and advancing genetic engineering techniques. He said, these efforts hold immense potential for improving healthcare outcomes and addressing genetic disorders. The Minister also pointed out that as immunity is directly linked to our health and food, several systems encourage us to develop immunity through food we eat instead of medication.</p><p>Dr Jitendra Singh highlighted that FinTech ecosystems of the world have grown in a tremendous way. Few economies have adopted virtual currencies, whereas few others are using virtual transactions to a large extent. He said, as the world is witnessing rapid digital transformation, cyber-security has become a critical focus and called upon the scientific community to develop algorithms which are difficult for hackers to break. We need to strengthen our cyber-security infrastructure, developing advanced systems to protect critical digital assets and data, he added.</p><p>Dr Jitendra Singh said, during these testing times, the world also witnessed rise of several technologies-based startups and these companies excelled in developing AI-based solutions for various sectors, including healthcare, finance, agriculture, and education. He added that the integration of AI and data analytics has helped improve decision-making processes, enhance productivity, and drive innovation in diverse industries.</p><p>Dr Jitendra Singh drew the attention of G20 delegates towards the immense potential of our oceans and seas, in terms of mineral resources, energy solutions and marine food and asserted that all are committed to promoting sustainable practices in fisheries, marine research, coastal tourism, and renewable energy generation. He said, by harnessing the potential of the Blue Economy, we can ensure the well-being of our oceans while driving economic development in a sustainable and responsible manner. We are also concerned about increased plastics and microplastics in our oceans, another important area to focus as it enters into our food chain as several marine organisms consume them.</p><p>Dr Jitendra Singh expressed concern that while some of the G20 members are facing water scarcity and challenge of water quality, some others are moving in that direction. He said, Precision irrigation, Innovative clean water technologies, such as water purification systems, desalination techniques, and wastewater treatment technologies are to be further augmented and implemented.</p><p>The Minister added that as we move towards a more sustainable future, it is crucial to explore innovative approaches that minimise waste generation and maximise resource efficiency. We recognize the importance of adopting circular economy principles in the bio sector, which focuses on reducing waste, recycling valuable materials, and promoting a sustainable and regenerative approach to economic growth. He said, we also recognize the role of research and innovation in the adoption of Lifestyle for the Environment (LiFE) as accelerators that can advance the progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and commit to support actions in promoting the same.</p><p>In his concluding remarks at G20 Research Ministers Meeting, Dr Jitendra Singh expressed satisfaction that during the RIIG meetings, member states discussed various topics including, challenges related to energy materials and devices, solar energy utilisation and photovoltaic technology and materials and processes for green energy; and policy issues like role of research, development and innovation in creating new resource-efficient, sustainable and more circular bio-based technologies, products and services; understanding the blue economy science and services; blue economy sectors and opportunities; observation data and information services; marine ecosystems and pollution; blue economy management and perspectives; coastal and marine spatial planning; marine living resources and biodiversity; deep sea ocean technology; and blue economy policy perspectives.</p><p>Dr Jitendra Singh thanked G20 delegates for their constructive and fruitful deliberations, which marked the end of series of RIIG meetings and conferences which India hosted during last 5-6 months, starting from Kolkata to Ranchi to Dibrugarh to Dharamshala to Diu and now to Mumbai under Indias G20 main theme of Vasudhaiva-Kutumbakam or One-Earth One-Family One-Future. We identified Research and Innovation for an Equitable Society, as the main theme of RIIG-2023, he informed.</p><p>The Minister thanked the members for their active participation and supporting Indias RIIG agenda with valuable inputs and comments on our priority areas. India is fully committed to contribute in attaining the UN SDG-2023 by way of Research and Innovation through International collaboration and partnerships.</p><p>India hosted a total of 5 meetings and conferences across India under priority topics of i) Materials for sustainable energy; ii) Circular bio-economy; iii) Eco-innovations for energy transition; and iv) Scientific challenges and opportunities towards achieving sustainable blue-economy, which signifies the importance of Research and Innovation for inclusive societal development and growth.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126005907</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68MG-NDS1-DYTH-G4W3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1678\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 5, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Reaching a peak point in late June, the city held the worst air quality in the United States. Visible smog and haze blanketed the entire state for multiple days, caused\u00a0by chronic pollution issues and the rampant wildfires in Northern Michigan and Canada.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One particular wildfire, near Staley Lake, Michigan, began as an unconfined campfire that burned over 2,400 acres of land. The smoke from this and Canada's wildfires made their way across the Great Lakes to settle in the air.\u00a0The wildfires created a perfect storm of hot temperatures, low precipitation, dirt and dust that coalesced into a remarkably poor season for air quality. Many experts in the scientific community feel the uptick in negative natural phenomena has a direct correlation to the effects of years of climate change.</p><p>According to Elena Lioubimtseva, a Professor of Geography and Sustainable Planning at Grand Valley State University, extreme wildfires and record-breaking air pollution are just the beginning of what could be the future effects of climate change. Acute causes in air quality change can be attributed to the wildfires, though the greater sum of these forest fires can be followed back to man-made causes.</p><p>\"There is no question about it,\" Lioubimtseva said. \"We have been experiencing more and more wildfires every year. It is very clearly linked to higher temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns, the same is happening along the Western Coast and the Mediterranean as well. Wildfires are very clearly correlated with climate change.\"</p><p>An increase of rainfall throughout the summer generated perfect conditions for the devastating smog. The future of air quality in the United States and the world at large is a growing concern.\u00a0</p><p>\"It will get worse before it becomes better,\" Lioubimtseva said. \"With the higher temperatures and the higher levels of water vapor in the air, all the chemicals from the wildfires create a very unhealthy substance in the air.\"</p><p>The community of Grand Rapids has been paying attention. Morgan Weststrate, a junior at GVSU, was surprised to see the city on the radar for pollution, especially when smog has been widely reported internationally.</p><p>\"I remember as a kid seeing something in the newspaper about air pollution, but in a foreign country outside of the U.S.,\" Weststrate said. \"This is my first summer experiencing and hearing about it in the U.S.\"</p><p>This kind of air pollution became more personal for many in the community when the haze covered Grand Rapids, though not every citizen was moved enough to stay indoors or change their summer plans.</p><p>\"Personally the air pollution has not affected my plans in any way, but I have seen how it affects more people nowadays,\" Weststrate said.</p><p>The severity of the smog, especially the visual effects, have prompted citizens and experts alike to call for change in human behavior as a civilization to prevent this from continuing in the future.</p><p>\"I do think climate change contributed to the air pollution,\" Weststrate said. \"However I feel like this isn't an easy answer. We can always be better and do better, but it's a question of if we are willing to give up our lifestyles for the sake of our climate.\"</p><p>Lioubimtseva said the fires themselves are mostly unpreventable if Earth's temperatures continue to rise over the next few years.\u00a0</p><p>\"There is not that much we can do to prevent forest fires without addressing what causes them in the first place,\" Lioubimtseva said. \"We can try to adapt, we can try to mitigate the effects of forest fires with better forest management. I don't think there is really a recipe for first management that can prevent wildfires with longer and longer dry seasons.\"</p><p>Lioubimtseva believes protecting those who are able to mitigate the effects of forest fires and air pollution in their own communities is a good place to start as far as relieving the overall effects of these fires. Focusing on the human impact is also step for forest fire relief: placing special focus on communities who are most at risk, such as elderly people or those with respiratory diseases.\u00a0</p><p>\"We also need to think about the socioeconomic aspects of this vulnerability because people who don't have access to air conditioning and those who work outdoors and can't hide inside and those who are inevitably exposed really need to be protected,\" Lioubimtseva said. \"At this point, we need to focus more on the measures of social justice, making sure that those populations are protected.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5535123</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68X0-G651-JBSN-31F5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"758\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Lanthorn: Grand Valley State University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 7, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Allendale</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>MI</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000057</classCode><className>AIR QUALITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001348</classCode><className>POLLUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001956</classCode><className>POLLUTION &amp;

The Ministry supports the States/Union Territories for carrying out various afforestation activities through Centrally Sponsored Scheme for conservation, development and promotion of forests under its major schemes namely, National Mission for a Green India (GIM) and Forest Fire Protection and Management Scheme (FFPM). Compensatory afforestation under CAMPA has also been used to increase forest cover across the country. State Governments also implement various schemes for tree plantation/afforestation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Further, the promotional measures are being implemented through a Central Sector Scheme under National Coastal Mission Programme on Conservation and Management of Mangroves and Coral Reefs. Under this programme, annual Management Action Plan (MAP) for conservation and management of mangroves are formulated and implemented in all the coastal States and Union Territories.</p><p>The Government has undertaken a number of measures to combat land degradation and desertification in the country. These are as follows:</p><p>Desertification and Land Degradation Atlas of India, published by Space Applications Centre (SAC) Indian Space Research Organisation, Ahmedabad, which provides the extent of land degradation and desertification in India, states that the land degradation and desertification in the country has been estimated to be 97.84 million hectares in 2018-19. It provides state-wise area of degraded land which is helpful in planning and implementation of schemes aimed at restoration of land by providing important data and technical inputs.</p><p>An online portal has been developed with the help of Space Application Center(SAC), Ahmedabad for visualization of degraded area of land with the processes causing degradation.</p><p>A Centre of Excellence has been envisaged at the Indian Council for Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE) Dehradun for enhanced South-South Cooperation. It aims at knowledge sharing, promotion of best practices, sharing of Indias experiences with cost-effective and sustainable land management strategies, developing ideas for transformative projects and programs and capacity building.</p><p>International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) - India, has been assigned for reporting Indias progress on achieving Bonn Challenge target.</p><p>At the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties (COP), 2015 in Paris, India joined the voluntary Bonn Challenge pledge to bring into restoration 13 million hectares (mha) of degraded and deforested land by the year 2020, and additional 8 mha by 2030. This pledge to restore of 21 m.ha by 2030 has been increased to 26 mha, during the COP14 to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) in 2019.</p><p>The area of land covered through afforestation is reported under the Twenty Point Programme, which is approximately 18.94 million hectares during the period 2011-12 to 2021-22. This includes the afforestation achievements under concerted efforts of the State Governments through various central and state specific schemes.</p><p>As informed by Tamil Nadu state, the Rehabilitation of Coastal habitat through the formation of bio shield is being implemented for three years (2023-24 to 2025-26) in all coastal districts of Tamil Nadu including the districts such as Thanjavur, Mayiladuthurai and Nagapattinam, wherein the eco-restoration of existing Mangroves ecosystem to an extent of 11.25 Sq.km and new planting of mangrove to an extent 3.28 Sq.km has been envisaged. Further, the tree species which act as bio shield such as Casuarinas, Cashew, Mangrove spp, Palmyrah and other specialized species are being raised in these districts for planting as part of massive afforestation initiative. The training, awareness, local community involvement is also being carried out as part of this scheme.</p><p>The Ministry has not signed any MoU with any NGO to tackle the issue of land degradation. However, tree Plantation/Afforestation being multi departmental activity are also taken up cross-sectorally by various Departments, NGOs, Civil Society, Corporate bodies etc. under various Central and State Plan/Non Plan Schemes.</p><p>This information was given by Union Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126066054</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68WH-PFN1-JCBF-S42M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"796\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 7, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, ranking member of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, issued the following news release on Dec. 5, 2023:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">U.S. Senate Commerce Committee Ranking Member Ted Cruz (R-Texas) today took to the Senate floor requesting unanimous consent to pass his bipartisan, bicameral AM Radio for Every Vehicle Act. The legislation, which he introduced with Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), would require automakers to keep AM broadcast radio in vehicles, a tool critical to keeping the American public safe in times of emergency.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The bill, which was approved by the Senate Commerce Committee earlier this year, was on the verge of Senate passage before being objected to by Senator Rand Paul (R-KY).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(WATCH: <url normalizedValue=\"https://youtu.be/SjziFTVg47I?si=zjLaacdKhLLg9rdS\">https://youtu.be/SjziFTVg47I?si=zjLaacdKhLLg9rdS</url>)</p><p>Sen. Cruz's remarks as delivered are available below:</p><p>I rise today in support of free speech, and in support of AM Radio. It is widely enjoyed by Americans across the country. Over 80 million Americans listen to AM radio every month. They rely on it.</p><p>And, yet, earlier this year, we saw eight major automakers announce that they were stripping AM radio from new cars and trucks, taking away the option of AM radio for consumers. That decision, I believe, was a serious mistake. A mistake that would hurt Texans and that would hurt Americans in all 50 states.</p><p>As a result, I joined with my colleague, the Senator from Massachusetts, Ed Markey, in introducing legislation, AM Radio for Every Vehicle Act. I would note that Senator Markey is one of, if not the most liberal senator in this chamber, and I am one of, if not the most conservative Senator in this chamber. I don't recall another bill where we have joined forces, and it speaks to the power of this issue that you see such deep agreement across ideological lines.</p><p>When Senator Markey and I introduced that legislation, within days, one of the eight major car companies, Ford Motor Company, reversed course and announced they would now include AM radios on new cars and trucks. I think they viewed this coalition as a sign of the apocalypse.</p><p>I would note that this bill has overwhelming bipartisan support. It has 44 cosponsors, 22 Democrats and 22 Republicans.</p><p>When we took it up in the Commerce Committee, it passed out of the Commerce Committee with overwhelming bipartisan support. And why is that? Because on the merits, this bill is the right thing to do for the American people.</p><p>Number one, in times of disaster, AM radio is the single most reliable medium for communicating about a natural disaster. I remember when Hurricane Harvey hit my home city of Houston and the entire Texas Gulf Coast. The enormous challenges. People relied on AM radio when other forms of communications go down, AM radio is consistently the most resilient to help people get out of harm's way, whether it is getting out of the way of a hurricane or getting out of the way of a tornado or getting out of the way of a forest fire or any other disaster, AM radio is there to help people know where to go and how to keep their families alive.</p><p>But secondly, AM radio is particularly important for rural America. Texas has enormous quantities of our state that is rural. And in rural America there are many parts of Texas, many parts of other states where farmers and ranchers, the only thing they can get is AM radio. And when they're out on their farms or ranches, they rely on AM radio for weather reports, crop reports, for news, sports, and entertainment.</p><p>Taking away the option for rural America of AM radio is bad, bad for farmers and ranchers in America, but number three, diversity.</p><p>AM radio promotes a diversity of views. Why? Because the barriers of entry to getting into AM radio are relatively low. To start an FM station is quite expensive. An AM station is much cheaper to start and to operate and as a consequence, we see a beautiful array of diversity of views reflected on AM radio nationally...</p><p>... And, I would note that one aspect of AM radio is particularly important to Texans and to the citizens of Kentucky and the people all across this country, which is that AM radio is a haven for free speech. AM radio is a haven for people to speak, even if their views are disfavored by the political ruling class. Talk radio is an oasis for conservative speech. Rush Limbaugh would not exist without AM radio. The views of my friend, the Senator from Kentucky, would be heard by many fewer people without AM radio. Whether Mark Levin or Sean Hannity or Glenn Beck, allowing free speech is important.</p><p>I believe these automakers stood up to remove AM radio as part of a broader pattern we see of censoring views that are disfavored by Big Business.</p><p>I think this is consistent with what Big Tech has done, silencing views they disagree with. And so this bill is all about preserving consumer choice--letting consumers decide. If you don't want to listen to AM radio, turn it off. But you know what? If the automakers all come together and say, 'you can't turn it on because we're not going to put it in your car, we're not going to put it in your truck, you don't have the right to choose what you will listen to.'</p><p>I think that's profoundly harmful for our country and profoundly harmful for free speech. And so I hope this body can actually act in support of Americans in harm's way in a disaster, and support of farmers and ranchers who rely on AM radio, and in support of a diversity of views speaking online, and in support of free speech for whatever your views whether they're Right-wing, Left-wing, or no wings at all, AM radio lets people speak and make the case in John Stuart Mill's marketplace of ideas.\"</p><p>The AM Radio for Every Vehicle Act would:</p><p>* Direct the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to issue a rule that requires automakers to maintain AM broadcast radio in their vehicles without a separate or additional payment, fee, or surcharge beyond the base price of the device;</p><p>* Require any automaker that sells vehicles without access to AM broadcast radio before the effective date of the NHTSA regulation to clearly disclose to consumers that the vehicle lacks access to AM broadcast radio; and</p><p>* Direct the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to study the reach and effectiveness of AM broadcast radio for alerting the public to emergencies relative to other technologies.</p><p>The AM Radio for Every Vehicle Act is supported by the AARP, National Association of Broadcasting, All 50 State Broadcasting Associations, National Association of Black Owned Broadcasters, National Religious Broadcasters, Big City Emergency Managers, International Association of Fire Chiefs, National Emergency Management Association, International Association of Emergency Managers, IHeart Media, National Association of Counties, National Hispanic Media Connection, Screen Actors Guild-American Foundation for Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA), Independent Beef Association of North Dakota, Independent Cattlemen's Association of Texas, Latino Farmers &amp;

James writes, \"How great a forest is set ablaze by such a small fire! And the tongue is a fire, a world of unrighteousness.\" </p><p>(James 3:5-6 ESV) It many be hard to judge which is more destructive \u2014 our tongues or our nation's 750-plus active forest wildfires. It is hard not to agree with James when he writes, \"The tongue is set among our members, staining the whole body, setting on fire the entire course of life, and set on fire by hell.\" (James 3:6 ESV) Solomon also writes, \"A worthless man plots evil, and his speech is like a scorching fire. A dishonest man spreads strife, and a whisperer separates close friends. A man of violence entices his neighbor and leads him in a way that is not good.\" (Proverbs 16:27-29 ESV) The Greek moralist Plutarch used an illustration of a runaway fire in describing the destructive and uncontrollable nature of loose speech. The childhood saying, \"Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me,\" is an attempt to defend against a bully. But those words still hurt and for many those words are etched permanently in their minds. Our words and speech when used for evil violates the following commands: \"You shall have no other gods.\" Something other than God has become our god when our words are used in an evil manner. \"You shall not take the Lord's name in vain.\" Here God's name is blasphemed, or we use His name to curse, lie, cast magical spells, teach falsely, or we fail to pray. James again writes, \"From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so.\" (James 3:10) The last commandment that we break with our tongue is \"You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.\" This includes lies, gossip, slander, belittling, insults, not keeping a neighbor's words confidential, failure to defend our neighbor's reputation, negligent and faulty journalism and falsely testifying in a court of law. Families, churches, businesses, neighborhoods, our towns, and our nation have suffered because of the misuse of our tongues. It behooves us all to examine the speech we use. Good speech and listening ears can put out fires, create bridges, show honor and respect for both God and our fellow man. Jesus rightly points out that the problem starts in the heart when He says, \"But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this defiles a person.\" (Matthew 15:18 ESV) The heart \u2014 not the tongue \u2014 is needed to be fixed. In the cross the sins of our heart and tongue have been forgiven. All the evil you have spoken has been cleansed. In repentance the Holy Spirit creates a new heart in us that guides the tongue. The Spirit by Word and sacrament maintains a life of repentance that bears the fruit of love that will be found in our words. May the love of Christ rule your heart and guide your tongue. * David Otten is pastor of Faith Lutheran Church in Eldorado.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHDLY-0001304374</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHDLY2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63KY-J4Y1-JBRC-V3YT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163823</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"489\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Paddock Publications, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Daily Herald</publicationName><edition>WEB EditionNC1 EditionNC2 EditionMF12 EditionNC3 EditionNM1 EditionNC EditionNC14 EditionMC1 EditionMC3 EditionMD1 EditionML2 EditionNL1 EditionNC14C EditionNC4 EditionCLFM EditioneBlast EditionDaily Register (Harrisburg) Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 14, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00099LP</classCode><className>CHRISTIANS &amp; CHRISTIANITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A0PN</classCode><className>PROTESTANTS &amp; PROTESTANTISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001464</classCode><className>RELIGION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST00001168</classCode><className>PERJURY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DRDX</classCode><className>NEGATIVE MISC NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX001027</classCode><className>LIBEL &amp; SLANDER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX001712</classCode><className>TESTIMONY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX001849</classCode><className>WITNESSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX001203</classCode><className>NEGLIGENCE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

DW has the latest on the areas affected and what is being done to fight the fires.The summer vacation season in resorts across the Mediterranean has turned into a nightmare of apocalyptic proportions as deadly wildfires have broken out across the region fueled by dry weather conditions and soaring temperatures. </p><p><br/>Scientists rank the Mediterranean region as a climate crisis \"hot spot,\" with the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warning of more heatwaves, crop failures, droughts, rising seas and influxes of invasive species. <br/>In response to the threat to lives, livelihoods and ecosystems, the EU has stepped in to provide much-needed support for countries fighting wildfires after Greece and Tunisia both activated the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. <br/>Ten countries \u2014 Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, France, Italy, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Serbia \u2014 are contributing to the EU's response to the wildfires in Greece, with over 490 firefighters and seven planes sent to different areas of the country. Two planes from the EU's firefighting reserve (rescEU) hosted by Spain are being deployed to northwest Tunisia. Egypt has also supplied helicopters to Greece.  <br/>Island evacuations in Greece<br/>The southern European country has been particularly hard hit by wildfires this year, with residents and tourist forced to flee inferno-like conditions on the country's usually idyllic islands. <br/>\"I will state the obvious: in the face of what the entire planet is facing, especially the Mediterranean which is a climate change hot spot, there is no magical defense mechanism. If there was we would have implemented it,\" said Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. <br/>Some 20,000 people were forced to evacuate the Greek island of Rhodes, a popular tourist destination known for its sandy beach resorts and ancient ruins, after fires reached coastal resorts on the southeast of the island. <br/>Hundreds of firefighters there have been helped by forces from Turkey and Slovakia, as well as two planes from Turkey, one from Croatia and three helicopters from Egypt. About 10% of land on Rhodes has burned, according to state broadcaster ERT, with satellite images showing a huge \"burn scar\" across the island. <br/>Wildfires also led to forced evacuations on the island of Corfu off of Greece's northwest coast, another tourist hotspot with rugged mountains and spectacular coastlines, over the weekend. Nearly 2,500 people were offered emergency shelter as airlines cancelled flights and helicopters scooped water out of the Ionian Sea to dump onto the flames. <br/>Emergency services have also been battling fires on the island of Evia, east of Athens, and Aigio, southwest of Athens. Two Greek air force pilots were killed after their plane crashed into a hillside while fighting a forest fire near the village of Platanistos on Evia, the sixth largest island in the Mediterranean. A three-day period of mourning has been declared by the Greek armed forces. <br/>Elsewhere in Greece, a wildfire west of the capital Athens has been burning since July 17, damaging more than 100 houses and businesses. Crete, the largest Greek island, has also now been put on high alert, with residents warned there is an \"extreme risk\" of fire as a third successive heatwave pushed temperatures back above 40 degrees Celsius in parts of the country. <br/>Hundreds of wildfires in Turkey<br/>Greece's Aegean neighbor has also been affected by the intense summer heatwave as temperatures exceeded 40 degrees Celsius in most parts of the country this week. Firefighters are battling a wildfire in the pine forests near the seaside resort of Kemer in the southern province of Antalya. The flames spread quickly through woodland as a result of strong winds and low humidity, the Antalya governor's office said. <br/>Some 120 hectares of woodland burned in the Kemer area, with 10 firefighter planes, 22 helicopters and about 1,000 emergency workers deployed to fight the fires. <br/>\"While we encountered 265 wildfires between June 1 and July 24 last year, there have been 358 wildfires in the same period of this year,\" said Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. <br/>Wildfires and storms ravage Italy<br/>Italian firefighters reported nearly 1,400 fires between July 23 and 25, including 650 on the southern island of Sicily, and 390 in the southern mainland region of Calabria. <br/>Sicily, home to the Mount Etna volcano and ancient monuments, has been ravaged by wildfires at the peak of its tourist season. Three elderly people died in the fires, with Sicilian President Renato Schifani describing the \"scorching heat and unprecedented devastating fires\" of July 25 as \"one of the most difficult days in decades.\" <br/>Canadian-built Canadair planes have been in operation to try to douse the flames on the hills around the Sicilian city of Palermo, which has been encircled by fires. Palermo airport was forced to close temporarily due to the fires. <br/>But it's not just wildfires that have ravaged the country: Italy has also been hit by extreme weather in the north where violent storms have ripped through the north of the country, uprooting trees and lifting roofs off buildings. Last week, 100 people were injured after hail stones the size of tennis balls pelted the Veneto region. <br/>Exploding landmines in Croatia<br/>Around 130 firefighters are currently battling fires in the country on the Balkan Peninsula, where tourism accounts for around 20% of GDP. The area most affected is that just 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) south of the medieval city of Dubrovnik, a top tourist destination facing the Adriatic Sea. <br/>Hurricane southerly winds are preventing the deployment of aircraft and, according to local media reports, landmines left from the war in the 1990s are also exploding in the area. Up to 16 fire engines and 95 firefighters have been deployed to the area, as well as two specialized planes from the country's air force. Another bushfire broke out in Split-Dalmatia county on July 25, with 65 firefighters and three aircraft deployed to fight the blaze. <br/>Mass evacuations in Spain<br/>In the first half of 2023, almost 70,000 hectares of forest burned down in Spain \u2014 an area greater than the size of the capital Madrid and over half of all the land burnt by wildfires in the EU. Thousands were evacuated from volcano-dotted La Palma in the Canary Islands earlier this month as wildfires tore through 4,500 hectares of land. <br/>Now a rapidly spreading wildfire has broken out at the center of the Spanish island of Gran Canaria, forcing authorities to evacuate several hundred villagers from their homes, close roads and deploy helicopters to fight the blaze. Antonio Morales, head of the Island Council of Gran Canaria, told reporters that about 100 firefighters and nine aircraft were working to put out the blaze that has so far burned through 200 hectares of forest. <br/>Spain's Balearic Islands \u2014 including Mallorca, Menorca and Ibiza \u2014 are the latest area to be put on red alert due to the risk of wildfires breaking out. <br/>Natural park ablaze in Portugal<br/>More than 600 firefighters, aided by local residents, scrambled to put out flames sweeping across parkland near the popular tourist destination of Cascais late on July 25. The fire started in a mountainous area of the Sintra-Cascais Natural Park west of the capital Lisbon. The mayor of Cascais, Carols Carreiras, said gusts of up to 60 kmph were the biggest challenge ahead. EU data shows that Portugalhas so far escaped the recent heatwave in southern Europe, despite the fact that it is usually one of EU's worst-hit countries by wildfire. <br/>Low ground-water levels in France<br/>About six small-scale blazes have been recorded in the regions of Nouvelle-Aquitaine, Occitanie, Grand Est, Bouches-Du-Rhone and the tourist hotspot island of Corsica. In April, the French geological service BRGM said that very low groundwater levels had put France on course for a worse summer drought than last year, mainly in the southern part of the country. Several dozen firefighters used aircraft to battle a wildfire close to Nice international airport in the south of the country on July 25. <br/>At least 34 people dead in Algeria<br/>Algeria has also been affected by a major heatwave, with temperatures as high as 49 degrees Celsius. Wildfires have swept across the north African country, killing at least 34 people and forcing another 1,500 to evacuate their homes. To date, outbreaks of 97 blazes across 16 provinces have been recorded, mostly affecting forest, crops and farmland. The most extensive fires are in the mountainous Kabyle region east of Algiers. <br/>High winds have calso aused these fires to spread to residential areas in the coastal provinces of Bejaia, Bouira and Jijuel. Authorities said about 8,000 firefighters, including aerial support teams, were battling the fires. Ten soldiers from the People's National Army (ANP) were killed fighting fires in Bejaia, the Algerian defense ministry said. The Interior Ministry reported that over 80% of the fires which began over the weekend have been extinguished. <br/>Forest fires in Tunisia<br/>Fires have raged through 450 hectares of the dense Melloula pine forest near the coastal town of Tabarka overlooking the Mediterranean Sea and close to the border with Algeria. Forest fire tankers and bulldozers were deployed to extinguish the fires. Algeria's north African neighbor has also seen temperatures of up to 49 degrees Celsius.

Crossover is the date by which a bill must pass its chamber of origin to remain eligible for consideration for the remainder of the biennial session. Exemptions to the crossover deadline are the same as the exceptions for the bill filing deadline.

The bill passed the Senate Agriculture Committee on Wednesday and has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=2127ac40-738c-461e-8759-01070a72683b\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXJD-JSUP105411168208956511825876100052</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JSUP-5263</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:682G-J5F1-JCMN-Y47K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484257</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"491\"/><timeReceived>3:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

The legislation, which he introduced with Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), would require automakers to keep AM broadcast radio in vehicles, a tool critical to keeping the American public safe in times of emergency.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The bill, which was approved by the Senate Commerce Committee earlier this year, was on the verge of Senate passage before being objected to by Senator Rand Paul (R-KY).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(WATCH <url normalizedValue=\"https://youtu.be/SjziFTVg47I?si=zjLaacdKhLLg9rdS\">https://youtu.be/SjziFTVg47I?si=zjLaacdKhLLg9rdS</url>)</p><p>Sen. Cruz's remarks as delivered are available below:</p><p>I rise today in support of free speech, and in support of AM Radio. It is widely enjoyed by Americans across the country. Over 80 million Americans listen to AM radio every month. They rely on it.</p><p>And, yet, earlier this year, we saw eight major automakers announce that they were stripping AM radio from new cars and trucks, taking away the option of AM radio for consumers. That decision, I believe, was a serious mistake. A mistake that would hurt Texans and that would hurt Americans in all 50 states.</p><p>As a result, I joined with my colleague, the Senator from Massachusetts, Ed Markey, in introducing legislation, AM Radio for Every Vehicle Act. I would note that Senator Markey is one of, if not the most liberal senator in this chamber, and I am one of, if not the most conservative Senator in this chamber. I don't recall another bill where we have joined forces, and it speaks to the power of this issue that you see such deep agreement across ideological lines.</p><p>When Senator Markey and I introduced that legislation, within days, one of the eight major car companies, Ford Motor Company, reversed course and announced they would now include AM radios on new cars and trucks. I think they viewed this coalition as a sign of the apocalypse.</p><p>I would note that this bill has overwhelming bipartisan support. It has 44 cosponsors, 22 Democrats and 22 Republicans.</p><p>When we took it up in the Commerce Committee, it passed out of the Commerce Committee with overwhelming bipartisan support. And why is that? Because on the merits, this bill is the right thing to do for the American people.</p><p>Number one, in times of disaster, AM radio is the single most reliable medium for communicating about a natural disaster. I remember when Hurricane Harvey hit my home city of Houston and the entire Texas Gulf Coast. The enormous challenges. People relied on AM radio when other forms of communications go down, AM radio is consistently the most resilient to help people get out of harm's way, whether it is getting out of the way of a hurricane or getting out of the way of a tornado or getting out of the way of a forest fire or any other disaster, AM radio is there to help people know where to go and how to keep their families alive.</p><p>But secondly, AM radio is particularly important for rural America. Texas has enormous quantities of our state that is rural. And in rural America there are many parts of Texas, many parts of other states where farmers and ranchers, the only thing they can get is AM radio. And when they're out on their farms or ranches, they rely on AM radio for weather reports, crop reports, for news, sports, and entertainment.</p><p>Taking away the option for rural America of AM radio is bad, bad for farmers and ranchers in America, but number three, diversity.</p><p>AM radio promotes a diversity of views. Why? Because the barriers of entry to getting into AM radio are relatively low. To start an FM station is quite expensive. An AM station is much cheaper to start and to operate and as a consequence, we see a beautiful array of diversity of views reflected on AM radio nationally...</p><p>... And, I would note that one aspect of AM radio is particularly important to Texans and to the citizens of Kentucky and the people all across this country, which is that AM radio is a haven for free speech. AM radio is a haven for people to speak, even if their views are disfavored by the political ruling class. Talk radio is an oasis for conservative speech. Rush Limbaugh would not exist without AM radio. The views of my friend, the Senator from Kentucky, would be heard by many fewer people without AM radio. Whether Mark Levin or Sean Hannity or Glenn Beck, allowing free speech is important.</p><p>I believe these automakers stood up to remove AM radio as part of a broader pattern we see of censoring views that are disfavored by Big Business.</p><p>I think this is consistent with what Big Tech has done, silencing views they disagree with. And so this bill is all about preserving consumer choice--letting consumers decide. If you don't want to listen to AM radio, turn it off. But you know what? If the automakers all come together and say, 'you can't turn it on because we're not going to put it in your car, we're not going to put it in your truck, you don't have the right to choose what you will listen to.'</p><p>I think that's profoundly harmful for our country and profoundly harmful for free speech. And so I hope this body can actually act in support of Americans in harm's way in a disaster, and support of farmers and ranchers who rely on AM radio, and in support of a diversity of views speaking online, and in support of free speech for whatever your views whether they're Right-wing, Left-wing, or no wings at all, AM radio lets people speak and make the case in John Stuart Mill's marketplace of ideas.\"</p><p>The AM Radio for Every Vehicle Act would:</p><p>* Direct the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to issue a rule that requires automakers to maintain AM broadcast radio in their vehicles without a separate or additional payment, fee, or surcharge beyond the base price of the device;</p><p>* Require any automaker that sells vehicles without access to AM broadcast radio before the effective date of the NHTSA regulation to clearly disclose to consumers that the vehicle lacks access to AM broadcast radio; and</p><p>* Direct the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to study the reach and effectiveness of AM broadcast radio for alerting the public to emergencies relative to other technologies.</p><p>The AM Radio for Every Vehicle Act is supported by the AARP, National Association of Broadcasting, All 50 State Broadcasting Associations, National Association of Black Owned Broadcasters, National Religious Broadcasters, Big City Emergency Managers, International Association of Fire Chiefs, National Emergency Management Association, International Association of Emergency Managers, IHeart Media, National Association of Counties, National Hispanic Media Connection, Screen Actors Guild-American Foundation for Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA), Independent Beef Association of North Dakota, Independent Cattlemen's Association of Texas, Latino Farmers and Ranchers International, Inc., Livestock Marketing Association, National Grange, National Farmers Union, North Dakota Farmers Union, Rural and Agriculture Council of America, U.S. Cattlemen's Association, Multicultural Media, Telecom and Internet Council, ALLvanza, National Urban League, OCA - Asian Pacific American Advocates, National Association of Farm Broadcasting, Texas Farm Bureau, Cox Media Group, Salem Radio Group, Bryan Broadcasting.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2023/12/sen-cruz-we-can-t-let-big-auto-kill-life-saving-am-radio\">https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2023/12/sen-cruz-we-can-t-let-big-auto-kill-life-saving-am-radio</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CODUPB-COSSPC05314A2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69T9-VCM1-DYVR-P1N5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1238\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"12\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>December 5, 2023</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The governor also signed Senate Bill 683.</p><p>House Bill 4171 would amend the Worker's Disability Compensation Act to include forest fire officers, and fire/crash officers under the First Responder Presumed Coverage Fund. This enables forest fire officers and fire/crash officers who develop certain cancers to claim worker's compensation benefits from the First Responder Presumed Coverage Fund.</p><p>\"Michigan's brave firefighters go above and beyond every day, sacrificing so much to keep us safe. We have to work together to ensure that they get the benefits they deserve, and I am proud that we came together to make a difference in their lives,\" said Gov. Whitmer. \"First responders and their families should know that we will have their back in their time of need. Extending the First Responder Presumed Coverage Fund to include forest fire officers and fire/crash officers means that these first responders are taken care of when they get hurt. This bill puts Michiganders first and supports first responders when they need it most.\"</p><p>\"Everyone knows the inherent risks our firefighters face daily, whether it be a fire or technical rescue. What many may not realize is the health effects that can occur years later due to the exposures of environmental contaminants and carcinogens,\" said Jeff Roberts, President of the Michigan Association Fire Chiefs. \"We greatly appreciate the efforts by legislators and the Governor to provide an opportunity for our forest firefighters and airport crash-fire rescuers to qualify for the First Responder Presumed Cancer Fund.\"</p><p>House Bill 4171 was sponsored by Rep. Sue Allor, R - Wolverine, and a copy of the bill can be found here.</p><p>The governor also signed Senate Bill 683.</p><p>Senate Bill 683 amends the Juvenile Code to clarify which courts have jurisdiction on cases involving 17-year-olds due to Raise the Age legislation taking effect October 1, 2021. This helps ensure that cases involving 17-year-olds are tried in the appropriate court.</p><p>Senate Bill 683 was sponsored by Sen.

Paul Getty as he talked about the source of the windfall.</p><p>\"Getty supposedly said ... his formula for financial success [was]: 'Rise early, work late and strike oil,' \" said Propst, adding oil and gas revenue is estimated to increase by nearly 38% in fiscal year 2024.</p><p>Oil and gas revenue increased 51%, or $741.4 million, to $2.19 billion total from fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2023.</p><p>The source of the bulk of the state's revenue boom drew both praise and criticism.</p><p>\"Thank you New Mexico Oil and Gas,\" state Senate Republicans tweeted after the release of the revenue forecast.</p><p>A prominent environmental group was much less enthusiastic.</p><p>\"NM has doubled our oil extraction in the last 5 years leading to windfall incomes to the state. What's the cost? To our communities, to workers, to our health, to our land,\" the Rio Grande chapter of the Sierra Club tweeted a short time later, along with pictures of a forest fire and a digital billboard promoting a $12.5 million oil field injury settlement.</p><p>Stephanie Schardin Clarke, secretary of the state Taxation and Revenue Department, said New Mexico can take steps to protect the environment for future generations while also taking care of the oil and gas industry.</p><p>\"We don't have to choose, necessarily, between being friendly to oil and gas and protecting our environment and water and things like that,\" she said. \"A lot of this has to do with geology, and the geological formations for oil and natural gas production in New Mexico are world-class.\"</p><p>A handful of committee members urged their colleagues to exercise fiscal restraint as they prepare to develop a budget during next year's 30-day legislative session, which begins Jan. 16. They reminded their fellow lawmakers it was only about seven years ago the state had to cut budgets and take money out of cash accounts to keep the lights on.</p><p>\"Probably for most of us, this is one of the most dreaded but most [exciting] presentations you get - it can be one way or the other,\" said Rep. Gail Armstrong, R-Magdalena. \"Now it's exciting. But I've been there when it was the dreaded, and so I, too, want to reiterate the dreaded when I was first in office, sweeping [money] from every corner, and it was awful.\"</p><p>The state's economists warned the forecast came with risks, from a recession to volatility in the oil and gas industry.</p><p>The revenue outlook presented Wednesday found the economic forecast improved \"with resilient consumer spending and a robust market taming worries of a recession as the Federal Reserve battles inflation.</p><p>\"A growing oil production outlook and elevated oil prices in the short term further contribute to a positive revenue forecast,\" the report states.</p><p>The state's rainy day fund is estimated at $5 billion, or 52.5% of recurring appropriations, though the number is likely to change pending legislative appropriations.</p><p>Sen. George Mu\u00f1oz, a Gallup Democrat and chairman of the Legislative Finance Committee, said the state needs to invest its revenues wisely, not go on a spending spree. In recent years, lawmakers have invested some of the state's revenues in permanent funds as part of a strategy to turn what they call \"now money\" into \"future money.\"</p><p>\"We need to see past the dollar signs and focus on planning for the future because these high-revenue years won't last,\" he said in a statement. \"We still have much work to do for New Mexicans, but we have an opportunity as well to move the state toward less reliance on oil and gas.\"</p><p>Follow Daniel J.

In 2006, we experienced more than 96,000 fires, including the Esperanza Fire in California that burned nearly 40,000 acres. In 2015, wildfires across the country destroyed more than 10 million acres of land.<br/>But recent years have proven climate scientists' worst predictions about wildfires and their link to climate change.<br/>As the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently pointed out: \"Research shows that changes in climate create warmer, drier conditions, leading to longer and more active fire seasons. Increases in temperatures and the thirst of the atmosphere due to human-caused climate change have increased aridity of forest fuels during the fire season.\"<br/>NOAA says drought and persistent heat were responsible for \"the doubling of forest fire burned area over the period of 1984 to 2015,\" and that new projections show \"an average annual 1 degree (Celsius) temperature increase would increase the median burned area per year by as much as 600% in some types of forests.\"<br/>Climate scientists and activists have been telling us what we need to do to turn things around - or, at the very least, to not make an already bad situation unlivable for our children.<br/>\"To avoid the worst consequences of climate change, we'll need to reach 'net zero' carbon emissions by 2050 or sooner. Net zero means that, on balance, no more carbon is dumped into the atmosphere than is taken out,\" according to the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"To achieve net zero emissions, we need a massive transformation in how we produce and consume electricity. We need a newer, better transportation system. We need to stop deforestation. We need a climate-friendly agricultural system.\"<br/>One way to transform how we produce electricity is to shift from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy.<br/>Not only do renewable energy sources help reduce the amount of carbon being released into the atmosphere, they also cost less than fossil fuels in the long run. In fact, a recent report by the International Renewable Energy Agency showed that nearly two-thirds of the renewable power installed in 2021, had \"lower costs than the world's cheapest coal-fired option\" and estimated that \"given the current high fossil fuel prices, the renewable power added in 2021, saves around $55 billion (USD) from global energy costs in 2022.\"<br/>Currently, city and school district leaders in Camas and Washougal are considering buying into the Port of Camas-Washougal and Clark Public Utilities' new community solar project, which will install solar panels at the Port's industrial park in Washougal and allow cities, nonprofits, businesses and individual residents to buy into the solar energy without having to install their own panels on their individual buildings. The investments will pay for themselves in about 12 years, and the panels are projected to have an additional 13 years' worth of life in them after that point.<br/>City and schools leaders should definitely take advantage of the Port's community solar opportunity, and Camas-Washougal residents who can afford to purchase shares in the project - and who want to invest in renewable energy and help do their part in controlling climate change - should seriously consider joining in and pushing for more community solar projects in east Clark County.<br/>To learn more about the local community solar project, visit clarkpublicutilities.com/community-environment/what-we-do/green-programs/community-solar.\u00a0\u00a0The following fields overflowed: REFERENCE = 08-24 A4 Editorial _ Shift to renewables_A04<br/></pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COLMBN-8261157</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COLMBN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6914-SV41-JBSN-02HC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">145264</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"725\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Columbian Publishing Co.

The details are enclosed at Annexure-I.</p><p>The CAMPA funds are utilised for compensating the loss of forest land and ecosystem services by raising of compensatory afforestation, improving quality of forests through assisted natural regeneration, enrichment of biodiversity, improvement of wildlife habitat, control of forest fire, forest protection and soil and water conservation measures. The Compensatory Afforestation Fund (CAF Act), 2016 and Rules, 2018 provide elaborate guidelines and activities for utilization of CAMPA Fund. CAMPA also supports creation of nurseries for multiplication of quality planting material of locally suitable plant species.The monitoring and evaluation of CAMPA activities is provided in the CAF Act, 2016. The monitoring of CAMPA activities in States/UTs are carried out through Internal and Third Party monitoring and e-Green watch web portal.</p><p>The State and Union territories are required to submit the Annual Plan of Operations (APO), prepared by State CAMPA in accordance with the provisions of CAF Act, 2016 and Rules. The details of State-wise APOs approved by the National Authority are attached at Annexure-II.</p><p>CAMPA activities are implemented by engaging local communities in afforestation, nursery raising, soil-water conservation and forest protection activities.TheNational Authority does not maintain any information related to job creation under various Projects/Schemes funded under National Fund, CAMPA.</p><p>The Compensatory Afforestation Fund (CAF) Act, 2016 provides for audit of the accounts of both National and States/UTs CAMPA Authorities by the Comptroller and Auditor- General of India (CandAG).The CandAG audit of Annual Accounts of National Authority of last three financial years i.e. 2019-20, 2020-21 and 2021-22 has been conducted. The Audit of States CAMPA is done by CandAG through respective Accountant General Office.</p><p>The share of State CAMPA is transferred to Public Accounts of respective States and Union Territories from time to time after reconciliation of receipts of compensatory levies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125779106</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67S6-0HJ1-DYTH-G4HD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"418\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>March 13, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It is no surprise that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/senate?utm_source=Synacor&amp;utm_medium=Attnet&amp;utm_campaign=Partnerships\">Senate</url> Majority Leader <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/chuck-schumer?utm_source=Synacor&amp;utm_medium=Attnet&amp;utm_campaign=Partnerships\">Chuck Schumer</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/2023/09/14/senators-ai-forum-schumer-musk\">hosted</url> an AI Insight Forum earlier this month, with elected officials and business leaders now discussing federal legislation to regulate AI.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Corporate America is taking notice, with Silicon Valley actively pursuing the disclosure of so-called synthetic content. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/google?utm_source=Synacor&amp;utm_medium=Attnet&amp;utm_campaign=Partnerships\">Google</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-66739858\">recently required political advertisers</url> to disclose the use of AI in audio clips and images.</p><p>As Americans wade into the deep end of the 2024 election cycle, we are navigating uncharted waters. AI-generated content can have real-world and real-time consequences, which were all too apparent when a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/misinformation/fake-picture-explosion-pentagon-spooks-twitter-rcna85659\">fake picture of a Pentagon explosion</url> shook social media and the stock market this past May. What if <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/joe-biden?utm_source=Synacor&amp;utm_medium=Attnet&amp;utm_campaign=Partnerships\">Joe Biden</url> or <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/donald-trump?utm_source=Synacor&amp;utm_medium=Attnet&amp;utm_campaign=Partnerships\">Donald Trump</url> is the victim next time around? Or, worse yet, the culprit?</p><p>People are right to wonder, but these are the real questions to ask: Are there common-sense practices or policies that will help us accurately sift through a flood of AI-generated material, and discern what is real or not? And who is responsible to enforce such policies?</p><p>It is not difficult to imagine the following scenario: Candidate A pulls away in the polls and looks like a shoe-in. Candidate B's team generates a scathing, but fake, piece of AI-generated content, just before ballots drop. The salacious content goes viral and severely hampers Candidate A's electability. A week or two after the election has been called for Candidate B, it comes out that the whole scandal was fake and Candidate A was wrongly cheated out of an election.</p><p>This is perhaps an even likelier scenario: A piece of compromising information comes out about Candidate A, but the accusation is denied, claiming the candidate is the victim of an AI-generated scheme. Candidate A goes on to win, but when it comes out later that the accusation was actually true, Americans have all moved on to more important items, such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/netflix?utm_source=Synacor&amp;utm_medium=Attnet&amp;utm_campaign=Partnerships\">Netflix</url> making <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Suits</emphasis> popular again.</p><p>In terms of regulation, many solutions will be retroactive, after a malicious act of AI usage has occurred and presumably caused significant damage. A proactive approach is more uncertain, but undoubtedly worth considering.</p><p>Here's one answer to the AI question: the back-burn solution. One common technique in fighting wildfires is called \"back burning,\" which means starting smaller fires along a man-made or natural firebreak in front of a larger fire front. In practice, the controlled fires eliminate the fuel in the path of a broad wildfire, erecting a barrier in front of an oncoming forest fire as it uses up all available fuel.</p><p>In a similar sense, we can fight the spreading AI fire with more fire. If it is possible to train AI to manufacture fake images and audio clips, it is also possible to train AI to identify and flag AI-generated content. There are already <url normalizedValue=\"https://crossplag.com/ai-content-detector/\">tools</url> that can distinguish one form of content from another, making it transparently known to the people consuming the content. At that point, the content can either be viewed or heard with caution, put up for review, or removed (let's say, by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/facebook?utm_source=Synacor&amp;utm_medium=Attnet&amp;utm_campaign=Partnerships\">Facebook</url> or X).</p><p>A centralized database of \"known offenders\" could also be created and checked to ensure that previous hoaxes don't make the rounds again. This type of solution would solve the short-term issue of reputational damage while also eliminating the likelihood of repeat offenses down the road. The integration of an up-to-the-minute monitoring mechanism against a database of known falsehoods\u2014combining both AI identification and centralization\u2014essentially serves as a digital firebreak. And so, the fire is contained.</p><p>Technology companies, for starters, should consider the back-burn solution as our election year nears. After all, who knows generative AI better than generative AI?</p><p>Any attempt to stop AI-wielding bad actors in 2024 will be far from complete. Bad actors do exist, and that isn't going away\u2014not now, not ever. There are important free-speech issues to consider, so individual liberties are not needlessly infringed by government regulators and other entities. Any regulation also raises ethical and moral questions regarding generative or even predictive AI's ability to identify \"truth,\" and those questions should be taken seriously. But one thing is clear: This election cycle, we need to be prepared to stop AI-generated misinformation on a broad scale.</p><p>The fire-fighting-fire strategy appears to be an efficient, effective approach in the short run, as bigger-picture questions are answered. While AI quietly fights against itself, Americans can all go back to politics as usual, and more episodes of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Suits</emphasis>. Who knows: After the writer's strike is settled, perhaps Netflix will give us another season of shocking lawsuits and serious-looking file folders\u2014all AI-free, of course.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ryan Waite is vice president, creative and advertising strategist for </emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://pushdigitalgroup.com/\">Push Digital Group</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The views expressed in this article are the writer's own.</emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2285482/voting-stickers.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Voting stickers</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>A volunteer election official holds stickers.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWKCOM-1829103</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWKCOM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6985-9RW1-JBR6-9182-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472435</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"901\"/><timeReceived>7:15 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright \u00a9 2023 Newsweek Inc.

Forest Service has issued a ban on all open burning and has canceled all burning permits statewide effective at 5 p.m. today until further notice.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is fall wildfire season in North Carolina, and we are seeing wildfire activity increase due to dry conditions, said Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler. With these ongoing conditions, a statewide burn ban is necessary to reduce the risk of fires starting and spreading quickly. Our top priority is always to protect lives, property and forestland across the state.</p><p>Under North Carolina law, the ban prohibits all open burning in the affected counties, regardless of whether a permit was previously issued. The issuance of any new permits has also been suspended until the ban is lifted. Anyone violating the burn ban faces a $100 fine plus $183 court costs. Any person responsible for setting a fire may be liable for any expenses related to extinguishing the fire.</p><p>Local fire departments and law enforcement officers are assisting the N.C. Forest Service in enforcing the burn ban.</p><p>The N.C. Forest Service will continue to monitor conditions. Residents with questions regarding a specific county can contact their N.C. Forest Service county ranger or their county fire marshals office.</p><p>Answers to FAQ</p><p>Q: What is open burning?</p><p>A: Open burning includes burning leaves, branches or other plant material. In all cases, burning trash, lumber, tires, newspapers, plastics or other nonvegetative material is illegal.</p><p>Q: May I still use my grill or barbecue?</p><p>A: Yes, if no other local ordinances prohibit their use.</p><p>Q: How should I report a wildfire?</p><p>A: Call 911 to report a wildfire.</p><p>Q: How should I report a person who intentionally starts a wildfire?</p><p>A: Call 911 to report a wildfire.</p><p>Q: My local fire marshal has also issued a burn ban for my county. What does this mean?</p><p>A: The burn ban issued by the N.C. Forest service does not apply to a fire within 100 feet of an occupied dwelling. Local government agencies have jurisdiction over open burning within 100 feet of an occupied dwelling. The N.C. Forest Service has advised county fire marshals of the burning ban and has asked for their consideration of also implementing a burning ban. If a fire within a 100-foot area of a dwelling escapes containment, a North Carolina forest ranger may take reasonable steps to extinguish or control it. The person responsible for setting the fire may be liable for any expenses related to extinguishing the fire.</p><p>Q: Are there other instances which impact open burning?</p><p>A: Local ordinances and air quality regulations may impact open burning. For instance, outdoor burning is prohibited in areas covered by Code Orange or Code Red air quality forecasts. Learn more about air quality forecasts at <url normalizedValue=\"https://deq.nc.gov/about/divisions/air-quality/air-quality-outreach-education/air-quality-forecast\">https://deq.nc.gov/about/divisions/air-quality/air-quality-outreach-education/air-quality-forecast</url>.</p><p>Q: Can I have a campfire when I go camping?</p><p>A: Campfires would be considered open burning and are not exempt from the burn ban. During a burn ban, portable gas stoves or grills are alternate methods for cooking food while camping.</p><p>Q: What can I do to protect my house against the risk of wildfire?</p><p>A: Learn about wildfire risk assessments and preparedness and prevention plans on the N.C.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124871063</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6469-BKD1-JCBF-S0YB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"558\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 29, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Since then, researchers at CSU have been working to understand how these high-elevation fires have impacted ecosystem recovery.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To share some of this research with the public, CSU's Geospatial Centroid and Radical Open Science Syndicate (ROSS) will host From Burn to Bloom: The Art + Science of Wildfire Recovery on Saturday, Aug. 19, at Odell Brewing Company. Burn to Bloom attendees will have the opportunity to make art while learning about post-fire science.</p><p>While investigating the effects of the 2020 fires on water quality in the Poudre River watershed, Matt Ross, associate professor of Ecosystem Science and Sustainability and faculty director of the Geospatial Centroid, a hub for geospatial work on campus, saw an urgent need to connect his colleagues doing similar work across the university. Through a grant from the Office of the Vice President for Research, the Centroid hosted a series of workshops, convening researchers studying everything from post-fire vegetation regrowth to the effects of forest fire on trout populations.</p><p>Caitlin Mothes, research and program coordinator at the Centroid, developed an open-source interactive web application that connects all the disparate post-fire data generated at CSU. Ross wanted to find a new, interdisciplinary way to share this research with the broader public.</p><p>\"Part of our work at the Centroid is to visualize complex geospatial data,\" Ross said. \"Data visualization is an effective way of communicating, but it is not always affective, it doesn't always bring in people who don't have an interest in the topic. We wanted to know, 'how can we increase engagement with more people to communicate the complex responses that landscapes have to fire?'\"</p><p>To find the answer, Ross and his colleagues are inviting the public to join CSU researchers and organizations working in fire mitigation, recovery or conservation for an afternoon of learning, making and reflecting.</p><p>The Colorado State Forest Service, based in CSU's Warner College of Natural Resources, will bring Smokey Bear for selfies and demonstrations.</p><p>Some scientists are building their own artistic activities, like Yoichiro Kanno and Dan Preston from the Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology. Alongside graduate students Emma Svatos, Taylor Stack and Fernando Carvallo, they will share how the fires have affected riparian ecosystems while participants make prints from blocks carved by Svatos.</p><p>In a transdisciplinary experiment, scientists and artists will co-create activities. Art and Art History Professor Erika Osborne collaborated with Daniel White, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, to develop a \"river resiliency charm bracelet\" activity. White investigates why certain areas around streams and rivers bounce back more robustly and quickly after fires. Inspired by some of the terms associated with White's research, like \"pearls\" and \"beads,\" Osborne suggested gathering materials to make charms and then finishing them over open fire. White will share his research findings with event attendees while Osborne guides them in bracelet making.</p><p>While wildfire is inherently destructive, the researchers' findings hold valuable lessons about adaptation and recovery. Inviting scientists and artists to work together on creative communication has opened new possibilities for engaging the community on a subject that could otherwise seem daunting or even depressing.</p><p>\"Science is traditionally expressed and shared through peer-reviewed publications. This is tremendously limiting if one considers the vast realm of science and the unlimited potential for diverse communications,\" said Sophia Linn, head of the Geospatial Centroid and co-organizer of the event. \"Inviting scientists to work directly with artists to express their work together is very exciting -- and will ultimately make science more accessible to the public and to diverse learners.\"</p><p>RSVP for From Burn to Bloom: The Art + Science of Wildfire Recovery (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/from-burn-to-bloom-the-art-science-of-wildfire-recovery-tickets-620224276507\">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/from-burn-to-bloom-the-art-science-of-wildfire-recovery-tickets-620224276507</url>)</p><p>Learn more and see a full list of activities and participants on the event page (<url normalizedValue=\"https://gis.colostate.edu/from-burn-to-bloom/\">https://gis.colostate.edu/from-burn-to-bloom/</url>).</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://newsmediarelations.colostate.edu/2023/08/02/artists-scientists-and-smokey-bear-share-science-of-post-fire-recovery-through-art/\">https://newsmediarelations.colostate.edu/2023/08/02/artists-scientists-and-smokey-bear-share-science-of-post-fire-recovery-through-art/</url></p><p>Contact: Jayme DeLoss, 970/491-8904, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:jdeloss@colostate.edu\">jdeloss@colostate.edu</email></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>T40-MgEditor-8233998 T40-MgEditor</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8233998</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68VN-B6Y1-DYG2-R4CM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"791\"/><timeReceived>10:47 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 3, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Financial Statements for continuing and discontinued operations under IFRS. Please refer to Note 4 - Discontinued Operations, in the Company's Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 for further information.</p><p>2Adjusted EBITDA is a Non?GAAP measure and does not have standardized meaning under GAAP or IFRS. As a result, it may not be comparable to information presented by other companies. For an explanation and reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to related comparable financial information presented in the Financial Statements prepared in accordance with IFRS, refer to the Non-GAAP Measures section in the MD&amp;A for the year ended December 31, 2023.</p><p>3Includes net sales to external parties only.</p><p>The Company reported net sales from continuing operations of $103.2 million during Q4 2023, an increase of $7.5 million or 8%, compared to Q3 2023. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher volumes shipped as a result of increased demand driven by positive macroeconomic indicators for housing, along with central banks being committed to holding interest rates. This was partially offset by lower lumber pricing, as prices in Q3 2023 were higher as a result of forest fire related disruptions. Paper segment sales also increased due to higher volumes but partially offset by the continued decline in paper pricing.</p><p>The Company reported cost of sales of $115.7 million during Q4 2023, an increase of $26.0 million or 29%, compared to Q3 2023. This increase reflected the impact of higher lumber and paper shipments in Q4 2023 along with higher charges related to inventory net realizable value recorded and higher maintenance costs at the Kapuskasing paper mill.</p><p>The initial duty deposit rate, totaling 20.23%, had remained in effect since the Company's acquisition of its sawmill and paper mill assets and has resulted in a higher payment in relation to our Canadian peers as at December 31, 2023, totaling US$22 million. The Company became eligible for the rate applied to all other lumber exporters from August 1, 2023 onwards, calculated by the US DOC to be 8.05%, following the results of the US DOC's Fourth Administrative Review.</p><p>The Company reported selling, general and administration expenses for continuing operations of $5.7 million during Q4 2023 which was an increase of $0.7 million compared to Q3 2023. This was primarily due to the prior quarter being impacted by credits related to recoveries on fringe benefits.</p><p>Cost Improvement at the Paper Mill and Operational Decentralization</p><p>The paper mill improved its cost profile with two operational paper machines and increased efficiencies in 2023. The paper mill continues to face many headwinds, primarily price pressures related to the secular decline of its paper products.</p><p>GreenFirst's paper mill operation has key operational and performance metrics that are very different from the lumber mill operations. As such, in 2023 the Board of Directors determined to separate the lumber mill assets from the paper mill assets. It is believed that this separation of businesses and decentralization of management will provide for more expedient decision-making, better alignment of incentives and more entrepreneurialism. This corporate decentralization was completed, with the appointment of a new paper mill CEO in January 2024.</p><p>Liquidity and Borrowings</p><p>At December 31, 2023, the Company had $28.9 million, less $5.4 million for standby letters of credit, of excess availability under the asset based lending (\"ABL\") portion of the Credit Facility and an additional $25.0 million of equipment financing under the Credit Facility. Subsequent to Q4 2023 the Company made net borrowings of $20.8 million against the Credit Facility, including $5.3 million on its equipment lending facility to finance a key strategic project. The borrowings are primarily to support the Company's seasonal harvesting activities.</p><p>New Board of Directors Slate</p><p>The Board of Directors has unanimously agreed to reduce its size to five directors at the next Annual General Meeting of our Shareholders on April 19, 2024 (The \"AGM\"). As previously disclosed, this reduction in the size of the Board of Directors is necessary to align with the reduced size and location of GreenFirst's operations. Three Board members graciously volunteered for this reduction, Barbara Anie, Sean Willy and Candice Bergen, and as such they will not be put forward on the slate for re-election at the AGM. Ms. Anie and Mr. Willy will continue to the AGM and Ms. Bergen has resigned.</p><p>\"On behalf of the Board of Directors and the entire staff of GreenFirst, we want to thank Barbara, Sean and Candice for their dedication and service to the company,\" said Paul Rivett, GreenFirst's Executive Chair.</p><p>Outlook</p><p>High interest rates, macroeconomic concerns and tensions in Middle East and Europe continue to negatively impact lumber demand and pricing. The positive impact on new home builds in the US, due to lack of activity in the resale market, has also subsided as affordability continues to be negatively impacted by higher interest rates. However, there is indication from the US Federal Reserve and Bank of Canada for interest rate cuts in 2024, which could positively impact lumber demand.</p><p>In the longer-term, lack of available housing inventory, record levels of immigration in Canada, aging of homes in the US and demographic driven demand are expected to positively impact lumber markets.</p><p>Despite continued curtailment of lumber production in British Columbia and some other regions of North America, short-term pricing benefits have not been material. Reduced lumber demand and low inventory maintenance continue to balance out supply side pressures in the short-term. However, these curtailments may provide a positive effect in the long-term.</p><p>Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA</p><p>References to EBITDA in this document are measures of earnings (loss) before interest and finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, while references to Adjusted EBITDA reflect EBITDA plus other non-operating costs such as impact of valuation changes on the Company's investments, the impact of foreign exchange on the Company's long-term debt, loss on extinguishment of debt, loss on sale of assets and other non-operating losses. Management believes that certain lenders, investors, and analysts use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a common valuation measurement and to measure the Company's ability to service debt and meet other payment obligations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to replace net earnings (loss), or other measures of financial performance and liquidity reported in accordance with GAAP. For more information on non-GAAP measures, please see the Company's MD&amp;A.</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"9\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\"

Efforts to dampen the flames werre hampered because of old munitions in the area.Authorities in Brandenburg said the small communities of Kosilenzien and Kr\u00f6beln, on the border with Saxony, had to be evacuated on Friday as a forest fire raged nearby. </p><p><br/>The flames, which had been fanned by unfavorable winds, were largely brought under control and citizens were later allowed to return. <br/>According to a spokesman for the emergency control center, a forest area in Saxony was first to start burning on Thursday evening before spreading across the border. <br/>The evacuation was declared in the afternoon after a large-scale emergency was declared for the two communities. <br/>Some 450 emergency crews were said to have been deployed to deal with the fire with some 800 hectares (almost 2,000 acres) in flame at one point. <br/>However, efforts were partly hampered by the crews having to avoid a large former military training area still littered with potentially explosive munitions. <br/>\"We've never had anything like this here in recent years,\" said Dorit Riedel, a spokeswoman for the Zeithain fire department. <br/>The evacuation was eventually lifted at about 9 p.m. On the Saxon side of the border, the situation had already eased some time earlier, according to the fire department there. <br/>rc/sms (dpa, AFP) <br/></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) called for Republican House committees to 'go after' judges who sentenced January 6th participants.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The exchange took place on the Monday edition of Bannon's War Room on Rumble with host Steve Bannon. A clip from the conversation began circulating on Twitter via <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/patriottakes\">Patriot Takes</url> .</p><p> Greene explained that as the Republicans took control of the House, they discovered there were so many things going wrong, that they now have to pick and choose what to tackle first.</p><p> 'Imagine that you're a team of firefighters and you're in the middle of a forest fire and you don't know which area to tackle first. That's how bad things are,' Greene claimed.</p><p> 'So we get in a room and you pull out the list of what should we cut, where do we need to cut spending? You know, we have our five families meetings and we've been working very hard on the upcoming debt ceiling issue. And we're putting out our list of things to negotiate on. Well, the list is so gigantic that it's hard to even \u2014 it's almost hard to \u2014 which ones do we pick and choose? And that is where things are so complicated,' Greene said.</p><p> She also highlighted the actions of specific committees.</p><p> 'The list of investigations on the Oversight Committee. We have the biggest staff in Congress for our Oversight Committee, but we need a staff almost five times bigger than that to really do what we need to get done,' Greene explained.</p><p> 'Same with Judiciary. What they're doing in New York is great. They're exposing the horrific crime in Manhattan. And a George Soros radical communist DA that all he cares about is trying to affect the next 2024 presidential election. And thank God they're up there doing that,' she added.</p><p> But Greene also had a suggestion about combating the weaponization of the government by going after certain federal judges.</p><p> 'You know, what else they need to be doing and on weaponization and so forth, is we need to be going after these federal judges that are persecuting people that walked around in the capitol on January 6th and pro-life prayer warriors at abortion clinics, and parents at school boards holding their school boards accountable,' she said.</p><p> 'We should be impeaching those judges.

No, wait, it's worse than that. While some GOP legislators and presidential candidates are just fiddling a la Nero, others are actually fanning the flames. Science shows the emission of greenhouse gases as a byproduct of using coal, oil and natural gas for power and heating leads to global warming. </p><p>A hotter planet leads to droughts which in turn leads to drier plants that catch fire more easily and burn more intensely. A hotter planet also leads to melting ice in the polar regions, which in turn leads to rising oceans and flooding coastlines. The past eight years have been the warmest on planet Earth since records have been kept. The hottest month in the last thousand centuries was last month. Phoenix sizzled this summer with the temperature reaching 110 degrees Fahrenheit for 31 consecutive days. The ocean temperature off the coast of Florida set new records while soaring over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. We've seen the effects of global warming in Hawaii, too, whose average temperature today is 2 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than in 1950. It's not a certainty that the recent fire on the Hawaiian island of Maui was directly caused by this climate change, but climate change is a likely suspect for triggering its fierceness. With over 100 deaths, the fire is the deadliest wildfire in the United States since 1918. A recent study found human-caused climate change nearly doubled the forest fire area between 1984 and 2015 in the western United States. President Joe Biden, the clear leader for renomination by the Democratic Party, wants to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in half by the end of the decade. And what do the two leading contenders for the Republican nomination for president want to do about climate change and global warming? In 2017, then-President Donald Trump announced the United States was withdrawing from the 2015 Paris climate accord designed to cap the rise in global warming. (The Biden administration has rejoined the accord.) On the campaign trail this year, Trump claimed global sea levels are rising about an eighth of an inch every three centuries. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, global sea levels are rising that much each year. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, the other leading contender for the GOP nomination, has rejected calls to do something about the warming planet, calling any such initiatives \"left-wing stuff.\" Former Vice President Mike Pence, another contender, accused \"radical environmentalists\" of exaggerating the threat of global warming. Rising seas are coming as a result of global warming as well. According to an article in Scientific American, \"an estimated 4.3 million acres \u2014 an area nearly the size of Connecticut \u2014 will be under water by 2050, including $35 billion worth of real estate.\" GOP Sen. Tommy Tuberville, whose state of Alabama borders the Gulf of Mexico, has co-sponsored legislation to prohibit any U.S. spending on the Paris climate accord, to promote oil and gas leases on federal land and to direct the government to ignore any environmental costs from use of carbon-based fuels. Last year in West Virginia v. EPA, the six justices of the Supreme Court appointed by Republican presidents voted to cut off the Environmental Protection Agency's ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. In an angry dissent, Justice Elena Kagan wrote, \"Whatever else this Court may know about, it does not have a clue about how to address climate change.\" But it's not just Republicans on the national stage who are taking positions that fuel global warming. This year, for example, GOP lawmakers in Texas passed laws to spend billions to subsidize gas-fueled power plants on the one hand, while making nonpolluting wind and solar power in rural areas more expensive on the other. Speaking at a U.N. conference, renowned naturalist David Attenborough warned, \"If we continue on our current path, we will face the collapse of everything that gives us our security\" from food production, access to fresh water and habitable ambient temperature to ocean food chains. It's hard to say whether Republican politicians are influencing the voters or vice versa, but neither group seems to be listening to such warnings. A survey this month showed Republican voters by a 3-1 margin think that economic growth should be given priority over dealing with climate change. (Democrats rate climate change the higher priority by a 4-1 margin.) In his song \"Who by Fire,\" Leonard Cohen riffs on an ancient prayer and asks who will die \"by fire\" and who \"by water.\" Here's hoping \u2014 despite today's politics \u2014 that the future holds a third and happier alternative for us humans. \u00a9 Creators, 2023</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHDLY-0001474245</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHDLY2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:690P-Y771-JBRC-V0JX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163823</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"805\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Paddock Publications, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Daily Herald</publicationName><edition>WEB EditioneBlast EditionCLFM EditionMC1 EditionML2 EditionNC EditionNC1 EditionNC14 EditionNC14C EditionNC2 EditionNC3 EditionNC4 EditionNL1 EditionNM1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 22, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Energy &amp;

For Saturday at least, the weather was milder, providing some help for fire teams battling to contain the flames of Canada's worst fire season on record that destroyed structures, fouled the air with thick smoke and prompted evacuation orders for tens of thousands of residents. Officials said a huge wildfire again had been kept from advancing closer than 9 miles to Yellowknife, the capital of the Northwest Territories that was left virtually empty when nearly all of its 20,000 residents fled for safety. \"We're by no means out of the woods yet,\" Mike Westwick, wildfire information officer for the city, told the Associated Press. </p><p>\"We still have a serious situation. It's not safe to return.\" To the south, in British Columbia, raging flames were also kept away from Kelowna, a city of 30,000 people about 90 miles north of the United States border. The Kelowna fire is among more than 380 blazes across the province, with 150 burning out of control. The blaze near Yellowknife is one of 237 wildfires burning in the Northwest Territories. At a Saturday evening news conference, Shane Thompson, the minister of environment and climate change for the Northwest Territories, said the fires near Yellowknife had not grown very much in the past few days thanks to breaks in the weather. \"But I want to be clear, a little bit of rain doesn't mean it's safe to come back home,\" he said. Others warned that incoming hot weather would make the battle more challenging. Yellowknife Mayor Rebecca Alty encouraged residents to stay away to ensure their safety and help with firefighting efforts. She assured people that patrols were monitoring streets and homes to protect against looting. The city has become a virtual ghost town since residents fled following an evacuation order issued Wednesday evening. Long caravans of cars choked the main highway and people lined up for emergency flights to escape the blaze. The last 39 hospital patients were flown out Friday night on a Canadian Forces plane, officials said. On Saturday, officials said the escape route out of Yellowknife was safe, for the time being. About 2,600 people remained in town, including emergency teams, firefighters, utility workers and police officers, along with some residents who refused to leave. Charlotte Morritt was among those who left Thursday, reaching that decision because of the unbearable smoke that she feared would be unhealthy for her 4-month-old son. Morritt, a journalist with the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network, and her son took an evacuation flight some 950 miles west to safety in Whitehorse, Yukon, while her partner stayed behind to monitor their property and help create firebreaks and fight fires. \"We knew it was only a matter of time,\" said Morritt, who had been following media updates and satellite images of the approaching wildfires. Air tankers dropped water and fire retardant to keep the flames from Yellowknife. A 6-mile fire line was dug, and firefighters deployed 12 miles of hose and a plethora of pumps. Canada has seen a record number of wildfires this year that have caused choking smoke in parts of the U.S. All told, there have been more than 5,700 fires, which have burned more than 53,000 square miles from one end of Canada to the other, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. All of British Columbia was under a state of emergency Saturday. About 35,000 people had been ordered to evacuate wildfire zones across the province and an additional 30,000 people were under an evacuation alert, meaning they should be prepared to leave, Premier David Eby announced. Eby told reporters Saturday that the situation was \"grim\" and warned that the \"situation changes very quickly.\" He said he was restricting nonessential travel to fire-affected areas to free up accommodations such as hotels, motels and campgrounds for displaced residents and firefighters. Ian Stewart and his wife made the \"anxiety-producing\" decision Friday to evacuate Kelowna with their 4-year-old border collie and drive 210 miles to the British Columbia town of Clearwater. \"The smoke was really oppressive, and there were big chunks of ash falling everywhere,\" he said Saturday. They packed a couple of suitcases, passports, laptop computers and dog food, and drove in bumper-to-bumper traffic to escape. A shift in the wind carried smoke and haze from British Columbia into the Seattle area Saturday, said Dustin Guy, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. The Puget Sound region was just recovering from record heat, and air quality could reach unhealthy levels through Monday, Guy said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CLIWRE-0000018a1322d7f7a5ffb7a7808b0000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CLIWRE2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:696H-4ND1-JDGB-04F6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388351</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"815\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ClimateWire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 21, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection says it has a new tool to battle wildfires before they explode - artificial intelligence.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I think it is a game changer ... It has enhanced our abilities to validate situational awareness and then respond in a quick fashion,\" Phillip SeLegue, Cal Fire's staff chief for fire intelligence, told CNN.</p><p>Deep in the California wilderness of the Cleveland National Forest in San Diego County, a fire started in the middle of a July night. No fire officials were in the area, but AI was watching and alerted the authorities.</p><p>\"The dispatch center there was not aware of the fire,\" said Scott Slumpff, battalion chief of the intel program at Cal Fire, who was testing the new technology at the time and received the initial alert.</p><p>Cal Fire, in partnership with the University of California at San Diego's Alert California program and its network of more than 1,000 cameras across the state, is using the technology to spot fires early.</p><p>\"The camera had done its 360 [degree turn], identified an anomaly, stopped and was zoomed in,\" Slumpff explained. He then confirmed it was a fire and immediately dispatched resources. \"They were able to hold it to a 10 by 10 [foot] spot out in the middle of the forest.\"</p><p>\"The next morning, that fire would have been a fire of significance\" without the AI detection, SeLegue said.</p><p>The cameras, usually placed in the mountains so they have a higher vantage point, are constantly scanning their surroundings in 2-minute rotations; AI looks for any changes which it highlights in a red rectangular box on the screen.</p><p>\"Once the camera system detects an anomaly, which is a different version of the last image, it red flags it,\" said Dean Veik, a fire department liaison for Alert California and a former firefighter. \"It's predominantly looking for smoke.\"</p><p>The cameras themselves are not new - Cal Fire has used them for years to watch for fires. They are also <url normalizedValue=\"https://cameras.alertcalifornia.org/?pos=37.2382_-119.0000_6\">publicly accessible</url>: anyone can watch the network of view sheds to see weather conditions in real time or catch a glimpse of a curious creature like a bald eagle using the tower as a perch.</p><p>After detecting smoke, Cal Fire continues to monitor the video streams for \"situational awareness\" of a fire - where it's heading and whether it is \"encroaching on critical infrastructure,\" said SeLegue. Law enforcement can even use it to identify suspected arsonists. </p><p>The pilot program was so successful, Cal Fire expanded the technology at the beginning of September to all 21 of its dispatch centers across the state.</p><p>\"Our goal as an agency is to keep 95% of our fires at 10 acres or less, so this tool increases our ability to ensure that we're keeping those fires small in the incipient phase,\" said SeLegue, adding the cameras can see about 70 miles out during the day and approximately 110 miles out at night. \"We have multiple successes of fires at night that had gone undetected that we were able to suppress before a 911 call had even come into the command centers.\"</p><p>Cal Fire says 40% of fires since July 10 have been detected by AI before a 911 call was received - and the technology is continuing to learn and improve. </p><p>The system is looking for changes on the horizon, said Alert California's Brian Norton, who spent 35 years in the fire service. Sometimes it's going to be smoke from a wildfire. Other times it's going to be something harmless, like mist or dust. </p><p>The trick is teaching the AI to know the difference.</p><p>\"The learning part of it comes in with the human intervention to say 'that looked like smoke, but that wasn't smoke; it was dust,'\" Norton told CNN. \"Then the next time the camera picks something up, it's less likely to say that that is smoke.\"</p><p>Traditionally, people in the dispatch centers would have to endlessly watch those video feeds looking for \"a needle in a haystack,\" Slumpff said. \"Eye fatigue\" was always a concern as officials were constantly scanning possibly hundreds of feeds at a time. </p><p>Now, with the help of AI, they spend time focusing on the anomalies the technology has detected.</p><p>There are also lookout towers throughout the state, some staffed by fire personnel, others with volunteers. At Boucher Hill lookout tower in San Diego County, volunteer Bill Angel of the Forest Fire Lookout Association is in his second season of keeping an eye out for wildfires. His tower is just a few yards away from where the cameras are positioned on a communications tower.</p><p>The AI technology has \"enhanced looking for fires but it still requires humans,\" he said while keeping watch over the vast valley below, often raising his binoculars to his eyes. \"If lightning strikes the tower, they're blind but we are here.\" </p><p>The firefighters agree, convinced this new technology is making a difference - and won't threaten human jobs.</p><p>\"Nothing can take the place of the boots on the ground,\" said Slumpff. \"We absolutely are able to, in my opinion, save lives and property.\"</p><p>\"The fires you don't hear about in the news is the greatest success,\" SeLegue said.         </p><p>             By Stephanie Elam, CNN         </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

For real respite, it can be worth seeking out the parks less traveled, such as North Cascades National Park in northwest Washington. The park attracted 30,000 visitors in 2022, compared with the Grand Canyon's 4.7 million and Yosemite's nearly 3.3 million.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The 500,000-acre North Cascades National Park is part of a \"complex\" that also includes Lake Chelan National Recreation Area and Ross Lake National Recreation Area. The park offers boating, hiking, camping and about 18 miles of the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail, which runs from Southern California at the Mexican border to northern Washington at the Canadian border. There are also 260 prehistoric sites that offer information about the native people of the Northwest Coast, including mines and mining camps, fire lookouts, sheepherder camps and more.</p><p>NCSL asked Rep. Sam Low (R) and Sen. Keith Wagoner (R), whose District 39 includes the national park, about the scenic beauty of this less-crowded gem.</p><p>What does North Cascades National Park mean for your district?</p><p>Low: North Cascades National Park is truly one of the best-kept secrets not only in the Pacific Northwest but across the U.S. The North Cascades National Park brings hiking, recreational and tourist opportunities through Skagit County when the road is normally open between early May and mid-November. Five months of the year, the main roadNorth Cascades Highwayis covered in snow, sometimes as much as 10 feet.</p><p>Wagoner: NCNP is a scenic wonderland that brings thousands of visitors to our district annually. Since the only highway access through the park runs through the 39th Legislative District, our local businesses benefit directly from the tourism. But the park is not without controversy, particularly when local sentiments do not align with federal policies. Case in point is a controversial plan to increase the grizzly bear population by importing bears from out of state. Residents living near the park are generally opposed to the plan and prefer to let the existing grizzlies multiply naturally.</p><p>Have you been to the park? What is your favorite part?</p><p>Low: I have been to the park many times over the years. My favorite part is the turquoise blue waters of Diablo Lake and Dam. My wife and I are looking forward to one day doing the two- to three-day overnight remote wilderness hike to the inaccessible-by-car community of Stehekin. The only other way to get there is by a four-hour boat ride from Lake Chelan. We planned a trip a couple of years ago and had to cancel due to a forest fire.</p><p>Wagoner: I have been to the park's interpretive center, which is very informative. My hiking has been limited to the national recreation area, which is distinct from the national park proper. There is a reason the mountains are called the Cascades: the amazing cascading waterfalls. The Pacific Crest Trail is a big draw. In fact, my sister completed the entire northbound hike a few years ago. There was a big drop in use due to COVID-19, but permit application numbers are on the rebound. It feels like there is a lot of pent-up desire to get out and do things after COVID-19, and that translates to more visitors on day hikes and a return to normal levels of thru-hikers.</p><p>What else is great about your district? What else should visitors see?</p><p>Low: Fly in to the brand-new, international award-winning Seattle Paine Field airport, located just 10 minutes from the district. You can visit Sedro Woolley, Concrete and the majestic Skagit River in the north part of the district. The beauty of gorgeous Lake Stevens, historic Marysville, Granite Falls and Sultan in Snohomish County occupy the southern part of the district. The 39th Legislative District is one of the most diverse when it comes to mountains, rivers, waterfalls and farmland. Ebey Island, just below sea level due to diking, is the lowest point in the district; the highest point is the active volcano Glacier Peak at 10,541 feet.</p><p>Wagoner: We have some of the best bird-watching opportunities in the state, including bald eagles, snow geese and the largest concentration of trumpeter swans in the lower 48. We are also home to the mighty Skagit River, the largest and most biologically important river feeding the Puget Sound. The Skagit is the only river in Washington that supports all five species of salmon and is incredibly important to our orca population.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126057886</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68VF-VR51-DYTH-G3YV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"762\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 1, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection says it has a new tool to battle wildfires before they explode - artificial intelligence.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I think it is a game changer ... It has enhanced our abilities to validate situational awareness and then respond in a quick fashion,\" Phillip SeLegue, Cal Fire's staff chief for fire intelligence, told CNN.</p><p>Deep in the California wilderness of the Cleveland National Forest in San Diego County, a fire started in the middle of a July night. No fire officials were in the area, but AI was watching and alerted the authorities.</p><p>\"The dispatch center there was not aware of the fire,\" said Scott Slumpff, battalion chief of the intel program at Cal Fire, who was testing the new technology at the time and received the initial alert.</p><p>Cal Fire, in partnership with the University of California at San Diego's Alert California program and its network of more than 1,000 cameras across the state, is using the technology to spot fires early.</p><p>\"The camera had done its 360 [degree turn], identified an anomaly, stopped and was zoomed in,\" Slumpff explained. He then confirmed it was a fire and immediately dispatched resources. \"They were able to hold it to a 10 by 10 [foot] spot out in the middle of the forest.\"</p><p>\"The next morning, that fire would have been a fire of significance\" without the AI detection, SeLegue said.</p><p>The cameras, usually placed in the mountains so they have a higher vantage point, are constantly scanning their surroundings in 2-minute rotations; AI looks for any changes which it highlights in a red rectangular box on the screen.</p><p>\"Once the camera system detects an anomaly, which is a different version of the last image, it red flags it,\" said Dean Veik, a fire department liaison for Alert California and a former firefighter. \"It's predominantly looking for smoke.\"</p><p>The cameras themselves are not new - Cal Fire has used them for years to watch for fires. They are also <url normalizedValue=\"https://cameras.alertcalifornia.org/?pos=37.2382_-119.0000_6\">publicly accessible</url>: anyone can watch the network of view sheds to see weather conditions in real time or catch a glimpse of a curious creature like a bald eagle using the tower as a perch.</p><p>After detecting smoke, Cal Fire continues to monitor the video streams for \"situational awareness\" of a fire - where it's heading and whether it is \"encroaching on critical infrastructure,\" said SeLegue. Law enforcement can even use it to identify suspected arsonists. </p><p>The pilot program was so successful, Cal Fire expanded the technology at the beginning of September to all 21 of its dispatch centers across the state.</p><p>\"Our goal as an agency is to keep 95% of our fires at 10 acres or less, so this tool increases our ability to ensure that we're keeping those fires small in the incipient phase,\" said SeLegue, adding the cameras can see about 70 miles out during the day and approximately 110 miles out at night. \"We have multiple successes of fires at night that had gone undetected that we were able to suppress before a 911 call had even come into the command centers.\"</p><p>Cal Fire says 40% of fires since July 10 have been detected by AI before a 911 call was received - and the technology is continuing to learn and improve. </p><p>The system is looking for changes on the horizon, said Alert California's Brian Norton, who spent 35 years in the fire service. Sometimes it's going to be smoke from a wildfire. Other times it's going to be something harmless, like mist or dust. </p><p>The trick is teaching the AI to know the difference.</p><p>\"The learning part of it comes in with the human intervention to say 'that looked like smoke, but that wasn't smoke; it was dust,'\" Norton told CNN. \"Then the next time the camera picks something up, it's less likely to say that that is smoke.\"</p><p>Traditionally, people in the dispatch centers would have to endlessly watch those video feeds looking for \"a needle in a haystack,\" Slumpff said. \"Eye fatigue\" was always a concern as officials were constantly scanning possibly hundreds of feeds at a time. </p><p>Now, with the help of AI, they spend time focusing on the anomalies the technology has detected.</p><p>There are also lookout towers throughout the state, some staffed by fire personnel, others with volunteers. At Boucher Hill lookout tower in San Diego County, volunteer Bill Angel of the Forest Fire Lookout Association is in his second season of keeping an eye out for wildfires. His tower is just a few yards away from where the cameras are positioned on a communications tower.</p><p>The AI technology has \"enhanced looking for fires but it still requires humans,\" he said while keeping watch over the vast valley below, often raising his binoculars to his eyes. \"If lightning strikes the tower, they're blind but we are here.\" </p><p>The firefighters agree, convinced this new technology is making a difference - and won't threaten human jobs.</p><p>\"Nothing can take the place of the boots on the ground,\" said Slumpff. \"We absolutely are able to, in my opinion, save lives and property.\"</p><p>\"The fires you don't hear about in the news is the greatest success,\" SeLegue said.         </p><p>             By Stephanie Elam, CNN         </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Lowe, Michael Kellett, Sam Stearns, Davis Mounger and Lauren Kallmeyer <br/>Sonia Demiray is with the Climate Communications Coalition; Sam Davis is with the Dogwood Alliance; Zack Porter is with Standing Trees; Lea Sloan is with the Sierra Club Grassroots Network Forests &amp; Climate Team; Julia B. Lowe is with the Sierra Club Hoosier Chapter Conservation Committee; Michael Kellett is with RESTORE: The North Woods; Sam Stearns is with Friends of Bell Smith Springs; Davis Mounger is with Tennessee Heartwood; and Lauren Kallmeyer is with Kentucky Heartwood. </p><p><br/>Over half a million Americans[1] responded to the U.S. Forest Service's request for public comment before late July's deadline for the Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. The question: 'How should the Forest Service implement the President's Executive Order to protect mature and old-growth in our national forests in the face of climate change?' <br/>The request for public input ended with a 'virtual listening session' on July 24, which hosted a well-informed and engaged, yet often exasperated and frustrated audience because the Forest Service (USFS) continues to log the most important tool we have to help with climate change and to save wildlife: mature forest ecosystems. <br/>This outrage comes as no surprise to people tracking forestry. The latest report by the Climate Forests shows that federal agencies have not corrected the course on any of the original logging projects that the group highlighted last summer. Rather, 'America's Vanishing Climate Forests'[2] spotlights 22 egregious examples, which add up to hundreds of thousands of acres of mature and old-growth logging, set to take place in federal forests despite President Biden's order to protect them. This prompted several attendees to identify the USFS as the biggest threat to our mature forests and call for an immediate logging moratorium on mature and old growth trees. <br/>Most tree species reach maturity and peak financial interest between 50-80 years. When left alone, however, many species can become centuries old and massive in size. The largest and oldest trees are the most effective means to sequester and store the biggest amounts of CO2[3] as they continue to grow and store pollution in their mass and in the soil until they die. Mature trees also ensure forest resiliency and support biodiversity in the face of climate change. <br/>While many believe wildfires to be the biggest threat to forests and to our air, many mature and old growth trees survive a natural fire, while logging alone releases 150-800% more carbon per acre into[4] the atmosphere than a forest fire. With the exception of isolated local habitats and southern coastal areas prone to lightning, fire generally was uncommon before European settlement. <br/>Also in the Eastern U.S., where forests have been kept artificially young for centuries due to intensive logging, there is particularly high untapped potential for forests to accumulate more carbon over time if we simply allow them to continue to grow. In Maryland, for example, where 78% of forests have reached maturity,[5] elected officials have a choice: will they cave in to the forest product and biomass energy industry's massive lobbying efforts, or instead incentivize the preservation of forests for Marylanders' future and as our main tool to battle climate change? <br/>We respectfully ask the USFS to observe climate science, the presidential order, and IPCC recommendations[6] and limit timber sourcing to tree farms, sparing mature and old growth forest ecosystems held in the public trust. Business as usual cannot continue. Today's most important forest products are clean air, clean water, fertile soils, and wildlife habitat. <br/>The post Commentary: Government officials need to do more to protect mature forests \u2014 and fight climate change[7] appeared first on Maryland Matters[8]. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.climate-forests.org/take-action\">https://www.climate-forests.org/take-action</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.climate-forests.org/_files/ugd/ae2fdb_b5a2315e3e8b42498b4c269730c3955a.pdf\">https://www.climate-forests.org/_files/ugd/ae2fdb_b5a2315e3e8b42498b4c269730c3955a.pdf</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usgs.gov/news/large-old-trees-grow-fastest-storing-more-carbon\">https://www.usgs.gov/news/large-old-trees-grow-fastest-storing-more-carbon</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ffgc.2022.867112/full\">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ffgc.2022.867112/full</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://agnr.umd.edu/technical-study-changes-forest-cover-and-tree-canopy-maryland\">https://agnr.umd.edu/technical-study-changes-forest-cover-and-tree-canopy-maryland</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ffgc.2019.00027/full\">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ffgc.2019.00027/full</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.marylandmatters.org/2023/08/01/commentary-government-officials-need-to-do-more-to-protect-mature-forests-and-fight-climate-change/\">https://www.marylandmatters.org/2023/08/01/commentary-government-officials-need-to-do-more-to-protect-mature-forests-and-fight-climate-change/</url> [ 8]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.marylandmatters.org\">https://www.marylandmatters.org</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.marylandmatters.org/2023/08/01/commentary-government-officials-need-to-do-more-to-protect-mature-forests-and-fight-climate-change/\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-STNW10010126169088673415625876100048</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STNW-10010126</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68V6-RKJ1-F03R-N3RM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"779\"/><timeReceived>10:45 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.
