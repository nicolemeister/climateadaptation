Another fire about an hour away in Jackson Township was less than half contained when the blaze broke out in Evesham, threatening 50 homes, the New Jersey Forest Fire Service said. It could not immediately give a size estimate for the Evesham blaze. </p><p>\"This is the driest we've been in the agency's history,\" said Jeremy Webber, a supervising fire warden with the Fire Service, which was established in 1906. Lack of significant rainfall since August contributed to the dry conditions, which prompted the state to impose strict restrictions on outdoor fires. Details about the Evesham fire were scarce Thursday morning, as the fire had only recently been reported. The fire service said the 50 threatened homes have not needed to be evacuated yet. The fire in Jackson, in the central portion of the New Jersey Pine Barrens, had grown to less than half a square mile and was 40 percent contained as of midmorning Thursday, said Deale Carey, incident commander for the fire service. He said conditions were so dry that new spot fires were continuously breaking out as wind-blown leaves fall onto burning or smoldering areas. About 25 homes were evacuated near the Jackson fire, although residents were permitted to return Wednesday night. Joann Bertone, who lives near that fire, described animal and horse owners scrambling to arrange trailers to carry them to safety. \"It was extremely scary,\" she said. \"I was up all night. It was nerve-wracking.\" The causes of both fires remain under investigation. Dry conditions have helped spark many wildfires in New Jersey in recent weeks. Since Nov. 1, the state has seen 102 forest or wildfires that burned less than a square mile, the fire service said. The state has not seen significant rain in over a month, and that trend was expected to continue for at least the next few days. Not even some promised rain Sunday night into Monday was expected to make much of a difference, Webber said. \"We're going to need inches of rain, not just one or two,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EENWPM-000001930859d9dcadbf2a79663d0000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EENWPM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DK6-BS01-F066-G0KY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">302445</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"363\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>E&amp;E News PM</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 7, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DVSL</classCode><className>EMERGENCY EVACUATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N115300CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000CFDI</classCode><className>HORSES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N115300CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GS146</classCode><className>NEW JERSEY, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Through an interconnected series of fabulist tales, Krow explores forest fires, volcanoes, time travel, and the lives of octopuses with verve and wit, while also warning of environmental perils to come. In the opener, \"The Twin,\" new parents Troy and Jenna discover a baby identical to their son, Jace, alongside him in his crib, sparking anxiety in Jenna. </p><p>\"What, exactly, was I afraid of?\" she wonders. \"It is difficult to fear an abstraction.\" The twin, whom they name Nicholas, along with Jace and their older sister, Ruby, become recurring characters throughout these 16 stories. In \"Egret,\" Ruby, now grown, crashes her car into a fence, killing a neighbor's dog. \"Ruby maintained,\" Krow writes, \"that the accident happened not because she was drunk but because she badly needed to pee.\" Even in the midst of familial or environmental tragedies, Krow's prose maintains a playful spirit. After the dog's death, Nicholas realizes he has the ability to create birds and wildlife; he desperately conjures animals in the aftermath of a forest fire to combat the damage. Krow's writing is at its strongest in moments like this: descriptive, heartfelt, without polemics. When the family members all pile into a big hug, Krow describes them as being \"like a geode in a rock, rings in a tree, a nut in the shell-like everything good in nature that comes in layers.\" Though Ruby and her brothers can't always communicate with each other, they show us that while \"seasons seem to be going out of fashion,\" love is not.   A playful yet earnest examination of how people interact with each other and the world.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Publication Date: </emphasis>2025-01-28</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Publisher: </emphasis>Penguin</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stage: </emphasis>Fiction</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ISBN: </emphasis>9780593299654</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Price: </emphasis>$18.00</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Author: </emphasis>Krow, Leyna</h></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KIRKUS-2000269056</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KIRKUS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DS1-D463-RSGN-0460-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"299\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Kirkus Media LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Kirkus Reviews (Print)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30101\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"01\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>January 1, 2025, Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX000199</classCode><className>BOOK REVIEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000631</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001839</classCode><className>WILDLIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp; DYING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000187</classCode><className>BIRDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX000199</classCode><className>BOOK REVIEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009Y84</classCode><className>NORTHWEST USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

These wildfires not only damage the ecosystem but also impact the lives of those who own homes in regions where these fires are the most prevalent. The trend continued this year during the month of October, in which several hundred wildfires were reported across the Garden State. The weather has been a major factor in the prevalence of wildfires, as most of the state has reported no rain for several weeks. First responders and other personnel work to mitigate the fires and help those affected.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In recent weeks, the National Weather Service has issued a Red Flag Warning for the weather conditions across the state. This warning is issued when \"the combination of dry fuels and weather conditions support extreme fire danger.\" This warning is meant to let land and fire managers know of an increased risk of a wildfire in a certain area.</p><p>The drought that has been affecting NJ for the past month has turned worse. At the beginning of October, \"more than 87% of New Jersey was classified as 'abnormally dry,' with 26% of those areas having moderate drought conditions and 4% having severe drought conditions,\" reports Len Melisurgo of True New Jersey. By the 15th, the entire state was classified as abnormally dry, with 59% having moderate drought conditions and 12% having severe drought conditions, according to the US Drought Monitor map. The areas that have been most affected by the drought are Atlantic, Burlington, and Ocean counties, with portions of Camden and Gloucester counties also being affected.</p><p>The drought has caused trees to be brittle and susceptible to insect invasions and fires. The drought has diminished both the size and yield of crops. Water quality across the state has gotten worse as groundwater diminishes and irrigation ponds dry. State fire officials have issued a Level Three fire restriction, prohibiting all forms of outdoor fires except those done in an elevated stove, with the only allowed fuel being propane, natural gas, or electricity.</p><p>By September 15, the New Jersey Forest Fire Service had responded to 334 wildfires burning 650 acres of land. By mid-October, 242 of those fires were still burning. Winds blowing between 5 and 10 miles per hour have also been responsible for the spread of these fires, as they contribute to the dry conditions of the land. Firefighter crews across the state have been working together to extinguish or control the fires that have arisen, attempting to keep them from progressing far into residential areas.</p><p>During the Weekend of October 25, at least three other wildfires were reported in Essex County, with one of the fires burning an acre of the 53-acre forest preserve of Drew University. In addition to that, residents of Glassborro's Elsmere Park in Gloucester County, one mile away from Rowan University, were warned about a fire burning roughly 16 acres of the surrounding woods. By that Monday, the fire had been 80% contained. In south NJ, a wildfire was reported in Seaville, which is located in the Upper Township of Cape May County. Officials report that this fire reached three acres before being completely contained.</p><p>As of October 21, New Jersey has reported roughly 900 wildfires for the year, with four of them being severe fires, burning roughly 100 acres each. This fall season has brought about unusual weather conditions, as the climate has been exceptionally hot and dry in the past months. For five months, rainfall has been the lowest it has ever been, and the drought has had large-scale effects on agriculture and quality of life for people across the state. Wildfire season usually occurs between mid-October and mid-November, but this year saw it starting earlier due to a large number of factors. State officials are working to extinguish the fires still burning and prevent new ones from starting. All people must obey the warnings issued and do their part in preventing fires.</p><p>A fire burns in Rockaway Township on November 2 Courtesy of NJ Forest Fire Service</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5978024</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DCB-P691-JBSN-33W7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"685\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Stute: Stevens Institute of Technology</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 8, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Hoboken</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>NJ</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

This study investigates spatial-temporal and seasonal variations in Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) across six regions of Thailand (2007\u20132022). Results reveal distinct regional and seasonal characteristics, with significant negative correlations between LST and NDVI (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">R</emphasis> = 0.61 dry; 0.39 rainy; 0.72 winter). The strongest negative correlation occurred during the rainy season in 2017, highlighting complex interannual variations. Seasonal LST fluctuations (winter-summer: 1.24, winter-rainy: -1.54, summer-rainy: -2.78, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.001) and NDVI variations (winter-summer: 0.09, winter-rainy: 0.07, summer-rainy: -0.03, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.001) were statistically significant. These findings emphasize monitoring LST and NDVI as vital for understanding ecological impacts of climate change and urbanization. The study specifically explores whether increased vegetation consistently is associated with lower temperatures, underscoring the importance of strategies to mitigate heat and enhance climate resilience, particularly in rapidly urbanizing regions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>In recent decades, the dynamics of vegetation and its interaction with climatic variables have become increasingly important in understanding the impact of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems1, 2\u20133. Urban expansion is recognized as a major factor influencing changes in land use and land surface temperature (LST). LST refers to the temperature experienced at the interface between the surface and the atmosphere, where long-wave radiation and turbulent heat fluxes are exchanged4.</p><p>LST and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are the key environmental indicators used in environmental and climate change studies5,6which are critical indicators of environmental health and urbanization effect. Moreover, NDVI is widely used to assess plant health and biomass7. The relationship between LST and NDVI is characterized by a generally negative correlation, indicating that increased vegetation cover tends to lower surface temperatures. This relationship has been extensively documented across various geographical contexts, emphasizing the role of vegetation in mitigating heat, particularly in urban areas. Many studies have indicated that urbanization leads to increased LST due to the replacement of vegetation with impervious surfaces, which absorb and retain heat. The analysis of long-term vegetation index data, such as the NDVI, can give useful information about the spatiotemporal variations in vegetation cover1. It is particularly important for regions where vegetation growth is sensitive to changes in precipitation and groundwater availability, as in arid and semi-arid areas8. The paper emphasizes how NDVI serves as a major indicator in urban climate studies, revealing a consistent negative correlation with LST9. This correlation is significant for urban heat island (UHI) studies and can vary seasonally, as indicated by the findings. Although their study suggests that the relationship may be weaker in certain contexts10the seasonal variations in NDVI can influence the effectiveness of vegetation in moderating LST, particularly during periods of drought or excessive heat11,12. Moreover, the impact of land cover transitions on LST is well-documented. Many studies in China indicate that converting cropland to urban land significantly increases LST due to alterations in surface albedo and evapotranspiration processes12,13. However, Kaleem Mehmood\u2019s study indicates that higher LSTs are a fire risk factor because they dry out vegetation and speed up ignition, especially during the dry season in northern Thailand14. Moreover, environmental changes and sustainable development are associated with LST15. This aligns with findings that urban expansion correlates with increased LST, further exacerbating UHI effects16. NDVI is sensitive and allows for a comprehensive assessment of how land cover changes impact LST across different environments, from rural to urban settings. The study highlights that LST established a strong correlation17 as 80.4% of significant correlations were negative, especially in tropical regions, according to a global analysis conducted between 2000 and 202418. Studies conducted in the Masai Mara ecosystem reveal a negative correlation19. The use of NDVI and LST data can thus offer helpful perspectives on the ecological impacts of urbanization and climate change20.</p><p>Urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI) is a common indicator used to assess the urban heat island effect and can be a useful tool in finding possible heat-prone areas14,21.The significant adverse effect of UTFVI reduce urban comfort, increase mortality, and have a major impact on local wind patterns, humidity, air quality, and indirect economic losses, reduces urban comfort, and increase mortality, including more approaches to identify the hot areas in the city22,23.</p><p>The objective of this study is to analyze the spatiotemporal and seasonal variations of land surface temperature and vegetation indices, such as NDVI, in order to use these indicators for monitoring the impacts of climate change and urbanization. This analysis focuses on their interrelationship across six regions in Thailand from 2007 to 2022. The study aims to identify patterns in NDVI and LST distribution across different seasons and years within these regions. The findings could provide helpful suggestions for developing effective urban environmental management strategies, derived from these satellite-based indicators, to mitigate the effects of increasing temperatures and facilitate adaptation to climate change in urban settings.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Material and method</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Study area</emphasis></p><p>Thailand, located in Southeast Asia, has a tropical climate with distinct dry wet and winter seasons. The country covers a total area of 513,120 km2and ranges between latitudes 5\u00b0 37\u2019 and 20\u00b0 27\u2019 North, and longitudes 97\u00b0 22\u2019 and 105\u00b0 37\u2019 East (Fig. 1). The weather is influenced by seasonal monsoon winds. The southwest monsoon (mid-May to mid-October) delivers heavy rainfall from the Indian Ocean, reaching its peak in August and September, often alongside tropical cyclones. Thailand can be divided into six geographical regions: the north, northeast, central, east, west, and south regions. These six regions differ in climate, geography, and culture. The northern region is the highest in the country, with landscapes of mountains and forests cut through by river valleys. The northeastern region is a vast plateau with dry, sandy soil and less fertile land, and is primarily used for agriculture. The neutral region is a flat and fertile basin surrounding the Chao Phraya River. With conditions ideal for rice cultivation, it is the center of Thailand\u2019s agriculture. The smaller eastern region is a coastal area with fertile plains and tropical orchards, bordered by the Gulf of Thailand. The western region is mountainous and forested, featuring dense jungles and national parks, and forms a natural border with Myanmar. Lastly, the Southern region is a narrow peninsula with coastal plains, limestone hills, and numerous islands flanked by the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand.</p><p>Fig. 1</p><p>Location map (left) and Digital Elevation Model (right) with the 6 regions boundaries of Thailand (right).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Data sets and satellite data processing</emphasis></p><p>Figure 2 illustrates the methodology utilized for this study. The datasets were collected from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument on board the Terra satellite. MOD11A1 was selected for Land Surface Temperature (LST) as it provides daily LST data at a spatial resolution of 1 km, which allows for the analysis of temporal trends over a long period while maintaining sufficient spatial detail for national-scale studies. Its high temporal frequency is particularly valuable for detecting seasonal and interannual LST variations. MOD13A3 was chosen for Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) because it offers monthly composites that reduce noise from clouds and atmospheric conditions, making it suitable for long-term vegetation trend analysis. Although it has a coarser temporal resolution, the monthly data are more stable and reliable for examining vegetation patterns across large geographic extents24 like Thailand. Both datasets are readily available for analysis on the Google Earth Engine platform25. These datasets cover the (March to May), rainy season (May to October), and winter season (November to February) in the years 2007, 2012, 2017, and 2022 at a spatial resolution of 1 km. LST images and NDVI images have been composited into a seasonal dataset for each year using pixel-averaging statistical methods. Additionally, cloud-screening processes were applied to LST and NDVI data to eliminate cloud cover from MODIS imagery. Thus, seasonal MODIS data free of cloud contamination appears suitable for detection and monitoring in this study. To ensure data quality, both the LST (MOD11A1) and NDVI (MOD13A3) datasets were subjected to the usual MODIS Quality Assessment (QA) flags. For LST, only daily observations designated as \u201cgood quality\u201d in the QA layer were chosen, and pixels affected by cloud cover, atmospheric disturbances, or poor retrieval circumstances were removed. Similarly, for NDVI, monthly composite data that had already been adjusted to minimize cloud impacts were used. This method ensured that only accurate and high-quality data were used in the study, reducing the impact of cloud contamination and other noise in long-term spatiotemporal assessment. The MOD11A1 daily LST data, originally in Kelvin (K), were filtered for clear-sky daytime observations and subsequently converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) using the standard relation LST (\u00b0C) = LST (K) \u2013 273.15 26. Subsequently, these values were aggregated into seasonal periods. Similarly, the monthly MOD13A3 NDVI values were selected and composed of seasonal periods.</p><p>Fig. 2</p><p>Flow chart of the methodology applied.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Data analysis</emphasis></p><p>LST and NDVI values for the six regions of Thailand were processed and extracted using ArcMap (version 10.4) was used for mapping and spatial analysis. Statistical techniques were employed to analyze the spatiotemporal and seasonal variations in NDVI and LST distributions. In the analysis, descriptive statistics including mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation were calculated for all regions each year. Additionally, an analysis of the relationship was performed to examine seasonal variations in the relationship between NDVI and LST data using Python (version3.10) via Jupyter Notebook and Rstudio software (Version: 2025.05.0 + 496) were applied to visualization and statistical testing. In particular, the ANOVA and Pearson\u2019s correlation tests.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thermal hot-spot detection</emphasis></p><p>This research applied a hotspot analysis to differentiate regions with significant LST classify by season and focus on the areas of vigorous thermal anomalies. The Getis-Ord Gi* statistic method was used to identify spatial clustering of hot and cold spots of LST values. The Getis-Ord Gi* yields two primary statistics: the z-score, and the p-value27. High z-scores combined with low p-values indicate hot spots, low z-scores with low p-values indicate cool spots. Higher magnitude absolute z- scores indicate stronger clustering28. The method determines statistically significant thermal clusters by calculating the local aggregation of LST values in comparison to nearby features using this formula:1</p><p>where  is the value of attribute for feature j;</p><p>is the spatial weight between feature i and j;</p><p>is the total number of features;</p><p>X and S are the mean and variance values, respectively:23</p><p>The Gi* statistic also gives you the probability (Gi* p-value) and standard deviation (Gi* z-score) values for each feature or area. These tell you how statistically significant each one. The higher (or lower) the z-score, the more intense is the clustering29. Thus, three macro groups of thermal patterns were identified:</p><p>(1) Cool-spot: a clustering of low LST values that is statistically significant (Gi* z-score of less than \u2212 1.65).</p><p>(2) Hot-spot: a clustering of high LST values that is statistically significant (Gi* z-score exceeding 1.65).</p><p>(3) Neutral Areas: other areas where there is no discernible spatial relationship, (\u22121.65 &lt; Gi* z-score &lt; 1.65.)</p><p>The statistical significance of hot and cool regions is determined by the confidence level at 90%, 95%, and 99% thresholds. Regions were classified like \u201cCool-spot99 (cool-spot LEVEL-3)\u201d, \u201cCool-spot95 (cool-spot LEVEL-2)\u201d, \u201cCool-spot90(cool-spot LEVEL-1)\u201d, \u201cHot-spot90 (hot-spot LEVEL-1)\u201d, \u201cHot-spot95 (hot-spot LEVEL-2), \u201cHot-spot99 (hot-spot LEVEL-3)\u201d.</p><p>An appropriate bandwidth (meters) should be selected for Getis-Ord Gi* program processed via GIS environment to perform a reliable hot-spot analysis. For each feature/area, the output of the Gi* statistic also includes the statistical significance of the probability (Gi* p-value) and standard deviation (Gi* z-score). The strength of feature/area clustering is visualized as the Gi* z-score, while assembly patterns are statistically different from what would be expected by a random spatial process and the probability of the observed hotspot patterns being randomly distributed are represented by the Gi* p-value. Table 1 This classification offers a comprehensive view in the area of thermal dynamics. The extreme value zones (LEVEL-3) indicating the concentration of the highest or lowest LST values with a 99% confidence level were classified based on the highest standard deviation class (Gi* z-score &gt; 2.58 or Gi* z-score &lt; 2.58 or Gi* p-value &lt; 0.01).</p><p>Table 1</p><p>Hot-spot classification by applying gi*etis-Ord gi** approach.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"136\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"168\"/><thead><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">Thermal zone categories</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\">Confidence levels</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\">Probability(Gi* <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis>- value)</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\">Standard deviation range(Gi* z-score)</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Cool-spot99 (LEVEL-3)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">99%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">&lt; 0.01</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">&lt;?2.58</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Cool-spot95 (LEVEL-2)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">95%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">&lt; 0.05</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">&lt;?1.96</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Cool-spot90 (LEVEL-1)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">90%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">&lt; 0.10</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">&lt;?1.95</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Other areas</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Not significant</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?1.65 &lt; z-score &lt; 1.65</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Hot-spot90 (LEVEL-1)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">90%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">&lt; 0.10</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">&gt; 1.65</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Hot-spot95 (LEVEL-2)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">95%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">&lt; 0.05</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">&gt; 1.96</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Hot-spot99 (LEVEL-3)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">99%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">&lt; 0.1</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">&gt; 2.58</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Determination of ecological status by urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI)</emphasis></p><p>This study has applied the Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI), based on the principle that the local LST is compared to the mean temperature of the overall study region. The employed UTFVI to measure the surface urban heat island effect29. In addition, the surface urban heat island effect is likely stronger in cities than in suburban and rural areas because of a greater number of impervious surfaces and a smaller amount of natural soil and vegetation. This generates significant urban thermal anomalies according to how the city is arranged. It was estimated by the following Eq. (1).4</p><p>where UTFVI = Urban Thermal Field Variance Index;</p><p>LST (oC) = Land Surface Temperature;</p><p>LST<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">mean</emphasis> = Average of Land Surface Temperature (oC).</p><p>The main physical motivation of UTFVI is that regions with much higher temperature than the local average represent thermal stress, which are generally caused by urban heat islands (UHI). Positive UTFVI scores indicate locations that are hotter relative to the local average, potentially indicating ecological stress zones. In contrast, negative UTFVI values identify cooler, more ecological friendly areas. The ecological assessment threshold values (Table 2) are derived from general classifications widely used in urban climatology research17,21,30,31. These limits are experimentally determined to represent different levels of ecological well-being and heat stress. In particular, threshold ranges were structured to separate subtle (weak), moderate (middle), strong and extreme (strongest) thermal anomalies.</p><p>Table 2</p><p>The threshold of ecological evaluation index and UTFVI.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"168\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"328\"/><thead><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">Threshold value</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\">UTFVI class</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\">Ecological evaluation index</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">&lt; 0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">None</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Excellent</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">0?0.005</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Weak</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Good</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">0.005?0.010</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Middle</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Normal</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">0.010?0.015</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Strong</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Bad</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">0.015?0.020</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Stronger</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Worse</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">&gt; 0.020</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Strongest</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Worst</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Results and discussion</emphasis></p><p>The annual mean changes in Land Surface Temperature (LST) across four years (2007\u20132020<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">)</emphasis> illustrated Fig. 2, characterized by three seasons of Thailand such as dry, rainy, and winter. The study also found that the mean LST increased in all six regions between 2007 and 2022 as shown in Table SS1. The distribution of LST for a specific year and season, along with the interquartile range (IQR) and median values, is clearly illustrated. The dry season exhibits a slight increase in LST over time, with relatively stable distributions. Throughout the rainy season, LST remains consistent, although 2007 shows a wider range. The winter season displays a downward trend, with the median LST consistently decreasing from 2007 and particularly in 2020. The potential seasonal and temporal variations in temperature patterns are relevant for climate studies. Figure 3 presents the annual mean Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) across three seasons. The results show the median, quartiles, and range of NDVI values for each seasonal year. NDVI values are generally highest during the rainy season and lowest during the dry season. The interannual variability is apparent, with some years exhibiting notably higher or lower NDVI values compared to other years.</p><p>Fig. 3</p><p>Annual distribution of LST across 2007 to 2022.</p><p>Fig. 4</p><p>Annual distribution of NDVI across 2007 to 2022.</p><p>A comparative analysis of LST and NDVI across three seasons from 2007 to 2022, separated by regions (Fig.SS1). The LST remains relatively stable, with some variations observed between regions, particularly in the rainy and winter seasons. The seasonal LST variation in Thailand is largely a function of climatic and physical processes. In the dry season (March\u2013May), high solar radiation, cloudless conditions, and low soil moisture lead to an increase in LST. Loss of vegetation also lowered the albedo, leading to an even more increased heat absorption. During the wet season (May\u2013October), both cloud cover and precipitation amplify evapotranspiration, cooling the surface. November to February, winter months, were cooler due to low solar elevation angle and intrusion of cold air mass especially in the northern highlands. Such patterns are conditioned on the monsoon and filtered by land cover as well as the joint effect between climate and surface properties on LST variations. However, NDVI values establish little fluctuation over the years, remaining consistently high for most regions, stable vegetation health during this period. The highlight was seasonal and regional differences, with central regions maintaining higher LST and NDVI values throughout the years compared to other regions. Moreover, the spatial distribution of NDVI trends can be influenced by various environmental factors, including topography, climate, and human activities. Many studies have shown that NDVI trends exhibit spatial heterogeneity, particularly in the terrains complex as the Tibetan Plateau, where altitude and climate gradients significantly affect vegetation responses32,33. Additionally, the impact of anthropogenic factors on NDVI has been explored, indicating that human activities can alter vegetation dynamics and consequently affect the LST-NDVI relationship33,34. Human activities, particularly urban expansion, significantly alter LST\u2013NDVI relationships. Landscape transformations of LST Urban LULC and LCC change play a significant role in the increasing LST; while LST and NDVI exhibit a negative relationship35. It is suggested that human actives, especially urban expansion, are significantly responsible for the changes in vegetation cover and productivity, thus playing an important role in shaping NDVI patterns36impervious landcover density grows and vegetated areas are reduced, leading to higher urban surface temperatures.</p><p>Interannual variability in NDVI across Thailand was not solely driven by seasonal climatic patterns but was also influenced by major climatic events. For instance, the pronounced NDVI decline observed in 2010 and 2015 corresponded with strong El Ni\u00f1o events, which are typically associated with reduced rainfall and prolonged drought conditions in Southeast Asia37,38. Conversely, higher NDVI values recorded in 2011 and 2017 aligned with La Ni\u00f1a phases39during which increased precipitation likely promoted vegetation growth. Additionally, extreme flood events, such as the widespread floods in late 2011, may have temporarily reduced NDVI in affected lowland areas due to waterlogging stress. These findings suggest that interannual NDVI variability reflects the complex interplay between seasonal climate patterns and large-scale climatic anomalies.</p><p>The Association between LST and NDVI across three seasons for the four years indicates a strong negative correlation present in Fig. 4. Particularly, Fig.SS2 found that correlation coefficients were 0.52 and 0.61 in dry season of western and northern regions, respectively. The central region shows a correlation coefficient of 0.39 was highest in rainy season, while the northern region exhibits the strongest negative correlation at 0.72 during the winter season. The comparison of the various studies is shown in Table 3 showed the results were according to negative relationship with LST and NDVI in all study accept the study in Europe is found positive relation. The study in Imphal city had in line with the strong negative correlations that were discovered during the winter (North: R2 = 0.72; West: R2 = 0.46). Weak winter correlations (Central, East, and South: R2 = 0.03\u20130.16) are consistent with findings that vegetation-temperature coupling decreases during cool or dry seasons. The patterns of land use and seasonal changes observed in tropical climates are supported by the moderate correlations (R2 \u2248 0.26\u20130.61) found in dry is similarity with Hyderabad, India and transitional areas in all regions except the south. However, a negative LST-NDVI relation indicates locations were rising temperatures lower vegetation activity. Not all map pixels, though, show statistically significant relationships at a p-value cutoff of &lt; 0.0518.</p><p>A significant seasonal fluctuation of LST is confirmed for all seasons, as winter-summer was 1.24, winter-rainy was \u2212 1.54, and summer-rainy was \u2212 2.78 (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.001). With Welch\u2019s 8397.1, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.001, and Games-Howell post hoc tests revealed pairwise differences (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.001) for all season combinations. Similarly, post hoc comparisons revealed clear variations of NDVI as 0.09 of winter-summer, 0.07 of winter-rainy, and \u2212 0.03 of summer-rainy, and Welch\u2019s ANOVA showed highly significant differences across seasons (Welch\u2019s 3833.4, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.001). These findings highlight how statistically significant seasonal differences in both variables provide context for the observed connections between LST and NDVI.</p><p>The seasonal fluctuation of LST-NDVI correlation over time, for the rainy season shows a fluctuation with a peak in 2012 (Fig.SS3), followed by a decline, and while the winter season demonstrates relatively stable but moderate negative correlations. These findings suggest that LST and NDVI are inversely related, with varying intensities across seasons and years, reflecting the complex interaction between climate and vegetation dynamics. It is essential to highlight the importance of differentiating between LST and near-surface air temperatures, noting that urbanization can decouple these temperatures significantly, sometimes by as much as 20 \u00b0K40. Similarly, there was a strong negative relationship (R\u00b2 = 0.83) between mean LST and NDVI was reported in the Netherlands, reinforcing the idea that vegetation effectively reduces surface temperatures41. In this study, although no formal sensitivity analysis was conducted, we qualitatively examined the spatial correspondence between UTFVI classes, NDVI values, and land surface temperature (LST) distributions across various regions and seasons. The consistency observed between high UTFVI values, low NDVI zones, and areas of intensive urbanization or land degradation supports the general applicability of these thresholds in the Thai context. Several previous studies have demonstrated a strong relationship between the Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI), Land Surface Temperature (LST), and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), supporting the validity of using UTFVI to assess ecological thermal stress, particularly in urban environments. UTFVI typically shows a strong positive correlation with LST and a negative correlation with NDVI, reflecting the influence of land cover and vegetation density on local thermal conditions. A study in Gazipur, Bangladesh found a perfect positive correlation between UTFVI and LST, while NDVI showed a negative relationship with LST42. Similarly, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, NDVI was found to be strongly and negatively correlated with LST (R\u00b2 = 0.98), indicating the cooling effect of vegetation in urban areas43. In another case in China reported that UTFVI had a significant positive correlation with urban areas and NDBI, and a negative correlation with NDVI, reinforcing its applicability in urban thermal assessment44. These findings support the robustness of UTFVI classification thresholds when used in conjunction with NDVI and LST, even in diverse climatic contexts. Therefore, while thresholds should be interpreted with caution in tropical climates like Thailand, previous research provides a strong basis for their continued use in evaluating urban ecological conditions. Nevertheless, to enhance the precision of ecological stress assessments, future studies should consider conducting localized sensitivity analyses or calibrating UTFVI thresholds specifically for tropical environments. This would help refine interpretations of thermal stress across diverse land use types, particularly in regions where natural climate variability, such as seasonal monsoon cycles, may significantly affect surface temperature dynamics.</p><p>Table 3</p><p>Summary of correlation coefficients between LST and NDVI from different studies across various regions.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"128\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"408\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><thead><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">Location</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\">Correlation (LST-NDVI)</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\">Reference</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Thailand</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">?

A study carried out in Hyderabad, India reported that the negative relationship between LST and NDVI was strongest during monsoon season and weakest during winter47. Moreover, the strongest negative correlation was obtained in 2017 (0.82) indicating that increased vegetation cover in this season reduces surface temperatures strongly. Weaker negative correlation between the weighted NDVI in May 2012 and temperature in the rainy season (0.48) in contrast indicated less contribution of vegetation at reducing the surface temperature in this year and season. Moreover, there was no correlation between NDVI and ENSO in southern Africa. Plant growth was delimited during El Ni\u00f1o years. However, NDVI levels were higher during La Ni\u00f1a, demonstrating the varying impacts of these climate anomalies50. In Thailand, a major climate anomaly like the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) had a significant impact on interannual variability in LST and NDVI in addition to seasonal climatic patterns. Significant NDVI declines and LST increases were noted in high El Ni\u00f1o years, particularly 2010 and 201551, which corresponded with widespread drought conditions recorded during these years. Image processing techniques were employed to estimate LST from the collected satellite data. The accuracy of these estimates is supported by previous research demonstrating robust correlation between satellite-derived LST and ground-based measurements from the Meteorological Department52. Their analysis, using correlation methods, showed a strong correlation coefficient (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">R</emphasis> = 0.99), indicating a high degree of consistency between satellite and observational data. The strong correlation between satellite-derived LST data and ground-based measurements validates the accuracy of MODIS satellite data for assessing surface temperature patterns. This confirms the effectiveness of remote sensing for large-scale environmental monitoring, particularly in areas lacking comprehensive ground-based data.</p><p>Fig. 5</p><p>The season regression equations of NDVI with LST on six regions.</p><p>Figure 5 illustrates the association between LST and NDVI for six regions of Thailand during the dry, rainy, and winter seasons. The regional points appear in all panels with NDVI on the x-axis and LST (\u00b0C) on the y-axis. The negative relationships between NDVI and LST in all regions across seasons were clearly seen from the regression lines and fitted equations, which indicate that land areas with higher vegetation density tend to have lower surface temperatures. The degree of this relationship is different for each deme and from season to season. The slope of the regression line is more negative in the North (13.5\u201318.7), Northeast (12.8\u201314.6), and West regions (14.7\u201316.8), indicating a stronger cooling effect of vegetation. In contrast, the negative relationship in the South tends to be much weaker, implying a limited cooling effect of vegetation on surface temperature. There are also seasonal changes and the highest LST is during the wet and the lowest during the winter months. In general, the result shows a moderate effect of the vegetation in retarding LST over various climatic and geographical regions of Thailand.</p><p>Figure 6 displays changes in mean Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) over time and space, as well as variations that occurred with the seasons during the research period. The spatial analysis of vegetation cover, conducted using satellite data from the MODIS sensor to examine the NDVI, revealed notable regional variations across Thailand. The results indicate that the Northeast region consistently exhibited the lowest NDVI values among the six regions studied, with values below 0.5, signifying limited vegetation cover in this area. In contrast, the southern region recorded the highest NDVI values, reflecting a more extensive vegetative cover. These findings align with the region-specific topography and land use patterns. According to land use data from the Land Development Department, the southern region contains more agricultural and forested land compared to the northeast, which explains the higher NDVI values observed. The NDVI, therefore, effectively mirrors the distribution of vegetation across these regions. Seasonal differences were examined, and in almost every region, the rainy season produced the highest NDVI readings, indicating the time of year when vegetation grows at its highest rate. It is a well-known fact in ecology and agriculture that plants grow in the rainy season, taking over woods, agricultural grounds, and even regions that were previously devoid of flora, allowing weeds to proliferate. Consequently, seasonal NDVI patterns reinforce the notion that Thailand\u2019s rainy season is the optimal time for plant growth53 demonstrating how variations in vegetation index values are closely linked to changing seasons and land use patterns.</p><p>This seasonal variability is crucial for urban planning and management, as it highlights the need for adaptive strategies to mitigate the adverse impacts of urbanization on local climates and ecosystems47. Similarly, Guha46 demonstrated that seasonal changes in LST and NDVI significantly influence ecological health, suggesting that the correlation analysis is vital for understanding land use and land cover (LULC) dynamics.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Spatial distribution and LST variation among hot-spot classes</emphasis></p><p>Descriptive statistics of hotspots and their spatial representation are given in the Supplementary Material (Table SS2). There are hot spots that are nearly double the number of cool spots, and more than an area of 20% in the metropolitan has thermal anomalies. The mean LST min and LST max values of cool spots are between 20.7 \u00b0C and 39.0 \u00b0C in dry season, 12.0 \u00b0C and 44.3 \u00b0C in rainy season and 16.3 \u00b0C and 35.9 \u00b0C in winter season while the mean LST values for hot spots are between 20.7 \u00b0C and 39.0 \u00b0C (dry season), 12.0 \u00b0C and 44.3 \u00b0C (rainy season) and 16.3 \u00b0C and 35.9 \u00b0C (winter season). Nearly half of the communities exceeded the mean coverage threshold for cool spots in urban areas. The ratio of hot spot coverage above average as 35% of municipalities had a hot spot coverage value greater than the value for metropolitan areas. Northeast region (85 km2) was the region with the largest surface area in cool or hot conditions and low temperatures. The other two surface areas accounted for only 3.7% of the total cool and hot spots area in all 3 seasons across the entire metropolitan area in this region. For the whole metropolitan area, the average increase in the LST between hot spots and cold (LEVEL-3 or 99% confidence level) was about 31.2 \u00b0C for rainy, 30.1 \u00b0C in dry season, and 28.4 \u00b0C for winter times. When we compared these two groups, the cold spot in north region showed the lowest mean LST values (about 23.8 \u00b0C), while the high spot in central region (35.0 \u00b0C) in rainy season, east region (33.5 \u00b0C) in dry season, north region (31.5 \u00b0C) in winter were recorded the highest mean LST values.</p><p>Fig. 6</p><p>Spatiotemporal and seasonal distribution of LST across four years.</p><p>Fig. 7</p><p>Spatiotemporal and seasonal distribution of NDVI across four years.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ecological and thermal status of Thailand</emphasis></p><p>The evaluating Thailand of ecological and thermal conditions was one of the aims of the study. UTFVI values, which are categorized into six ecological evaluations as indicated in Fig. 8, were used to assess the country\u2019s thermal state. The evaluation of Thailand\u2019s ecological and thermal conditions using the Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI) revealed clear spatial patterns related to land cover characteristics. The areas with high UTFVI values show low NDVI is similar with a study in India31. Areas exhibiting high UTFVI values, which correspond to lower NDVI values, indicate zones of degraded ecological quality and increased thermal stress. These findings highlight the strong influence of vegetation cover on local thermal environments. Although UTFVI is a widely used indicator for assessing urban heat island (UHI) effects, its application beyond urban areas, such as in agricultural lands and forests, must be interpreted with caution. In these non-urban landscapes, high land surface temperature (LST) variability may stem from natural factors, including seasonal vegetation cycles, soil moisture fluctuations, and land management practices, rather than urbanization-driven heat emissions. Therefore, high UTFVI values in rural areas may not necessarily represent anthropogenic thermal stress. In this study, UTFVI interpretation was primarily emphasized in urban and peri-urban contexts, where urban development is the dominant driver of thermal anomalies. Future research should consider adapting or refining thermal indices to better account for natural variability across diverse land cover types, enhancing the robustness of ecological and thermal assessments at the national scale.</p><p>Fig. 8</p><p>Thermal status of Thailand in three seasons using UTFVI across four years.</p><p>Table 3 shown result is according to the study in India has identified two extreme categories for ecological and thermal status \u201cworst\u201d (UTFVI &gt; 0.020) and \u201cexcellent\u201d (UTFVI &lt; 0). These categories apply across all seasons31. The worst category of the ecological evaluation index was also prevalent, occurring in approximately 30\u201361% of the central, eastern, northeastern, and western regions. Areas with bad and worse thermal conditions (0.010 &lt; UTFVI &lt; 0.020) accounted for a few proportions (4%). Similarly, the percentage of areas classified as \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018normal\u2019 was around 4%. In contrast, the highest proportion of areas with excellent thermal conditions (UTFVI &lt; 0) were most common in the southern (90%) and northern (84%) regions. Both regions constantly maintained excellent environmental quality from 2007 to 2020, with some fluctuations observed. This consistent excellence can likely be attributed to effective ecological planning and environmental management strategies.</p><p>Table 3</p><p>The percentage of UTFVI values categorized into six

regional patterns of heat stress and ecological degradation. These findings highlight key recommendations for lawmakers and city planners for effective interventions and measures to mitigate54. To address extreme urban heat, cities most affected by heat stress should focus on developing more interventions such as green spaces, including parks, green roofs, and tree-lined streets to cool their neighborhoods55. Moreover, restoring degraded lands and encouraging the planting of seasonal vegetation are examples of adaptive land management techniques that can increase ecosystem services and thermal comfort. Finally, in order to facilitate proactive adaptation in the face of growing climate variability, UTFVI data ought to be incorporated into early warning systems and urban climate resilience planning56. These UTFVI based evaluations are an essential instrument for coordinating Thailand\u2019s urban growth with the objectives of sustainable climate adaptation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conclusion</emphasis></p><p>In conclusion, the relationship between LST and NDVI in Thailand is influenced by various factors, including seasonal variations, spatial heterogeneity, and anthropogenic activities. Future research should continue to refine methodologies for analyzing LST-NDVI dynamics, particularly using advanced remote sensing technologies and long-term datasets to capture these complex interactions comprehensively. This study emphasizes the significant role of land cover characteristics in shaping local thermal environments, with UTFVI proving to be an effective tool for assessing urban heat island effects.</p><p>This analysis of climate change effects on LST and NDVI highlights the complex interplay between temperature, vegetation health, and climatic variables. Our research determines the importance of considering climate variability to understand its impact on vegetation, an area that has received relatively little attention to date. In revealing novel associations between LST and NDVI, this study contributed significantly to the field. The use of satellite data has proven essential in advancing our understanding of these climatological processes. While satellite data (MODIS data) provide useful long-term observations for specific regions, the 1 km detail may not be enough to see small differences in diverse urban areas. This limitation can lead to potential underestimation or overgeneralization of LST-NDVI relationships, particularly in areas where land cover types vary sharply within a single pixel. Sub-pixel heterogeneity, such as mixtures of vegetation, built-up areas, and water bodies, may influence the thermal and vegetation signals recorded. Several studies have explored the integration of higher-resolution datasets. For instance, combining Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 imagery has been shown to enhance the spatial resolution of LST and NDVI measurements, providing more detailed insights into urban heat islands and vegetation patterns57\u200b. Future research could benefit from integrating these higher-resolution datasets and downscaling methods to more accurately capture localized urban thermal dynamics and vegetation cover patterns. This approach would help to further refine the understanding of LST-NDVI relationships in complex urban landscapes. Addressing the challenges of climate change impacts on vegetation requires a comprehensive approach that accounts for both environmental and anthropogenic factors. Furthermore, the accuracy of thermal assessments will be increased by creating region-specific indices that take into consideration the variety of the natural landscape. In order to reduce heat effects, improve resilience, and facilitate successful climate change adaptation, this study emphasizes the significance of sustainable urban planning solutions that take thermal stress into account and integrate green infrastructure.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>This research project was supported IRDR International Centre of Excellence Taipei 2024, and National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT) support this research project: E-Asia Joint Research Program: Climate change impact on natural and human systems (N33A650979) to KT, the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC; GNT2000581), we also thank the Department of Social and Environmental Medicine, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Thailand.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><p>[1].Liu, X., Tian, Z., Zhang, A., Zhao, A. &amp; Liu, H.

Forests have the largest potential for NbCS, aligned with broader sustainability benefits, but\u2014unfortunately\u2014a broad body of literature has revealed widespread problems in forest NbCS projects and protocols that undermine the climate mitigation of forest carbon credits and hamper efforts to reach global net zero. Therefore, there is a need to bring better science and policy to improve NbCS climate mitigation outcomes going forward. Here we synthesize challenges to crediting forest NbCS and offer guidance and key next steps to make improvements in the implementation of these strategies immediately and in the near-term. We structure our Perspective around four key components of rigorous forest NbCS, illuminating key science and policy considerations and providing solutions to improve rigour. Finally, we outline a \u2018contribution approach\u2019 to support rigorous forest NbCS that is an alternative funding mechanism that disallows compensation or offsetting claims.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A strategy to improve the implementation of nature-based climate solutions in global forests for climate mitigation is described, comprising four key components to highlight notable science and policy considerations and providing solutions to improve rigour.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Main</emphasis>Terrestrial ecosystems play an important role in contributing to climate mitigation, acting as a substantial carbon sink and absorbing an estimated 31% of anthropogenic carbon emissions per year (ref. 1). Ambitious efforts to rapidly reduce fossil fuel emissions remain the most important components of climate mitigation, but there is growing interest in interventions that reduce emissions from and/or increase carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems through NbCS to supplement and accelerate climate mitigation2, 3, 4\u20135. Of all the proposed NbCS management actions, those implemented in forests have the largest potential for further climate mitigation2,6. Given that deforestation at present leads to 1.9 GtC year\u22121 of emissions1, actions to halt and reverse deforestation are a critical part of climate stabilization pathways7.</p><p>NbCS in forests are increasingly funded by a range of public and private sources8, using various management actions, including avoided forest conversion/deforestation, reforestation (sometimes combined with afforestation; Supplementary Information Box 1), improved forest management and agroforestry. Substantial interest by the private sector to meet climate commitments has spurred further sources of funding, often channelled towards buying NbCS carbon credits from voluntary and compliance markets9,10. Forest NbCS can also provide climate adaptation benefits for local communities, as well as other important co-benefits for people and biodiversity4,11, but to succeed specifically as \u2018climate solutions\u2019, NbCS must provide rigorous and effective climate mitigation, defined here as emissions reductions and/or carbon removals that decrease global net radiative forcing through global peak warming (Fig. 1).Fig. 1</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Key criteria for effective climate mitigation in forests.</emphasis></p><p>Central pathways of avoided emissions and carbon removal and four central criteria for rigorous and effective climate mitigation in NbCS in forests. We note that \u2018No net loss of ecosystem carbon\u2019 under the \u2018Durable\u2019 category means losses beyond what an insurance or compensation mechanism, such as a buffer pool, would cover.</p><p>At present, carbon credits are an important way for private contributors and governments to invest in NbCS and could potentially play a larger role in the future. Unfortunately, a broad body of literature has identified widespread problems with how forest NbCS initiatives through carbon credit markets have accounted for their climate impact12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25\u201326. Many programmes have issued credits that achieve only a small fraction of what they claim in terms of climate mitigation benefits, which undermines climate progress, particularly when claimed as offsets. Driven by widespread concerns around effectiveness, the present price of carbon credits from tropical forestry NbCS projects fell from a high of more than $21 per ton CO2e to around &lt;$1\u20132 per ton CO2e in 2024 (ref. 27). Thus, there is an urgent need to bring better science and policy to bear in directing private and public funds to NbCS that deliver effective climate benefits at scale.</p><p>Although several recent publications have developed core principles for improving NbCS quality5,6,11,15,28, 29, 30, 31\u201332, we lack a clear vision for doing so at present. Improvements are needed for programme design and for funding mechanisms and the claims made by those buying credits. Here we describe how substantial improvements in NbCS effectiveness and rigour could be made immediately and over the near-term (for example, the next 5 years) (Supplementary Table 1). We first review four critical components (net climate cooling, durability, additionality and leakage) required for NbCS effectiveness and rigour. For each component, we provide an overview of the concepts, problems with present approaches used by carbon crediting methodologies and how better science and data can help address these problems in the near-term (Supplementary Table 1). Finally, we conclude with structural reforms needed to drive rigorous NbCS and illustrate how an alternative to the traditional offsetting approach\u2014a contribution approach\u2014could sidestep many structural challenges in an offsetting framework. We refer readers to Supplementary Information Box 1 for clarification of key terms and concepts.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Four key components of improved NbCS</emphasis></p><p>To succeed with climate mitigation, forest NbCS efforts must satisfy four key components (Fig. 1). Activities must lead to a net global climate cooling by integrating both changes in atmospheric greenhouse gases and biophysical feedbacks, store carbon for a sufficiently long period while accounting for the risk of losses, result in further climate mitigation benefits relative to what would have occurred without the intervention and avoid substantial negative impacts from leakage or the shifting of activities to other parcels of land5,28. There are other important social and ethical considerations to take into account, including responsible ecological design, doing no harm to biodiversity or people and respecting community land rights and indigenous communities, which have been covered extensively in other reviews4,5,11,33. We focus this Perspective on how to deliver these key scientific components for rigorous and effective forest NbCS climate mitigation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Net climate cooling</emphasis></p><p>Forests alter climate at local to global levels by modulating water, energy, carbon, volatile organic compounds and aerosols in the atmosphere34. These impacts can be loosely binned into \u2018biogeochemical\u2019 and \u2018biogeophysical\u2019 effects, although interactions between the two types of effects occur (Fig. 2). Biogeochemical effects describe how forests influence carbon and nutrient cycles, as well as volatile organic compound emissions, aerosol formation and atmospheric chemistry. Biogeophysical impacts capture how forests mediate water and energy exchanges between the land and atmosphere.Fig. 2</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Key fluxes that mediate climate benefits of forests.</emphasis></p><p>Illustration of multiple key land\u2013atmosphere interactions that mediate net climate impacts in energy, water and carbon cycles. Additional relevant feedbacks around clouds and circulation are not shown here.</p><p>Albedo is an important biogeophysical effect and exerts first-order control on the net surface radiative balance of the Earth system. Forests tend to have lower albedo than other land surfaces34, 35\u201336 and absorb a larger fraction of incident solar radiation, warming the climate. Thus, persistent changes in forest cover\u2014both losses and gains\u2014will change albedo and will affect the climate mitigation benefit of both avoided forest conversion and reforestation initiatives35, 36, 37\u201338. Some landscapes are particularly reflective\u2014such as places with persistent snowpack, bright soils or grasslands. In these landscapes, trees can substantially reduce albedo. The relative importance of albedo depends on carbon storage within the forests. In places in which carbon storage is high and albedo change is low, accounting for albedo will not substantially alter climate mitigation estimates of a project. But there are places in which the reduction of albedo can outweigh the carbon storage within the system, such as boreal forests or semi-arid drylands with sparse vegetation38,39. Quantifying this albedo change is thus essential for understanding where forest projects might provide a net climate benefit.</p><p>For improved forest management, the degree to which albedo is a concern remains uncertain but is probably small. The relationship between stand age and albedo tends to be nonlinear and saturating37,40,41. As a result, activities that maintain forest cover for longer periods of time (for example, extended rotations) may not result in substantial changes to albedo, but quantification of the albedo impacts of most improved forest management practices is scarce37.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Solutions and research needs</emphasis></p><p>Despite the potential for albedo to reduce or even negate the climate mitigation benefits of avoided conversion and reforestation, it is not considered in any carbon crediting protocols so far. Fortunately, albedo is readily measured by many remote-sensing platforms, and datasets that transform albedo changes into information relevant for carbon accounting now exist36,38,42. Moving forward, albedo would ideally be incorporated in climate mitigation quantification of NbCS in two prominent ways (Supplementary Table 1). First, carbon projects should not be allowed in places in which warming induced by lowered albedo outweighs the carbon storage benefit38. A second method for accounting for albedo change would be to fractionally reduce the expected climate mitigation benefit (for example, credits) from individual projects based on the expected changes in albedo. More detailed sampling of albedos for a range of land cover, land management and land-use conditions in unique geographies is needed to improve rigour and accuracy. More robust consideration of effective radiative forcing (after dynamic Earth system adjustments) and its efficacy (the spatiotemporal patterning of its magnitude) relative to well-mixed, long-lived greenhouse gases is also important.</p><p>Key near-term future research needs include improved understanding, models and maps of the impacts of cloud feedbacks, volatile organic compounds and aerosol effects on climate43. Research is needed to distinguish the direction and relative importance of different feedbacks (surface albedo, volatile organic compounds and aerosols and clouds) at local and global scales (Supplementary Information). Finally, although a single project in isolation is unlikely to cause large changes in cloud cover and other hydrologic cycle feedbacks, implementing forest NbCS at large scales (such as jurisdictional REDD+ initiatives) is likely to cause substantial changes in cloud cover that may accentuate or reduce changes in surface albedo44. Therefore, such hydrologic cycle feedbacks should be quantified and considered in albedo accounting at regional scales.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Durability</emphasis></p><p>The durability of carbon storage refers to the length of time over which carbon remains outside the atmosphere. Forests face increasing disturbance risks that can drive carbon losses and compromise durability13,15,45, such as wildfire, drought, biotic agents (pests and pathogens), wind events, severe storms, sea-level rise and invasive species45. Forests frequently regrow after these disturbances\u2014but not always46,47. Thus, the most critical disturbance risks for NbCS initiatives are those that are climate-sensitive, widespread, severe and increasing, leading to lower regional carbon stocks over decades15. Also, forests face a wide range of socio-economic risks that can lead to their conversion to other land uses and/or prevent reforestation.</p><p>The dynamics of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere have important implications for the climate mitigation value of NbCS and, in particular, the durability outcomes needed to realize different climate mitigation benefits. On societally relevant timescales, owing to the long-lived nature of CO2, burning fossil fuels causes an effectively permanent change to atmospheric CO2 concentrations48,49. As a result, long-term global mean temperature outcomes are expected to be driven by cumulative CO2 emissions, rather than the timing of those emissions50, 51, 52, 53, 54\u201355. To reduce peak global temperature, carbon must be stored outside the atmosphere for at least as long as it takes to reach global peak temperature (50\u2013100+ years, depending on the emission scenario) and only as a complement rather than a substitute for rapid fossil fuel emissions reductions56,57.</p><p>The durability of carbon storage needs to match the claim being made for a given NbCS intervention or carbon credit55,58. Many carbon crediting programmes today equate the climate mitigation value of forest NbCS with the effectively permanent damages from fossil CO2 emissions59. Durability commitments\u2014the period of time over which a project or programme commits to preserve and monitor credited carbon\u2014in carbon credit protocols are not permanent and usually in the range 1\u2013100 years (refs. 18,19,60). Most forest carbon credits issued so far have been under protocols with a minimum project lifetime of 20 years (Supplementary Table 2). Thus, in physical terms, nearly all real-world durability commitments are incommensurate with the climate impacts from CO2 emissions.</p><p>The most common durability risk-management tool is called a buffer pool. To construct a buffer pool, the programme administrator establishes guidelines for assessing the risk of reversal (that is, carbon loss) from natural and social/economic factors across the durability commitment period and then projects set aside a percentage of the carbon credits based on the level of anticipated risk16. When there is a qualified reversal in the carbon crediting programme, the programme administrator retires carbon credits from the buffer pool equal to the calculated net carbon losses. The buffer pool of a programme functions like an insurance programme and is designed to compensate for unintended reversals of carbon credits over the durability commitments of enrolled projects.</p><p>Several studies have found that present buffer pools are probably inadequate13,15,16,61. Across all protocols and credits issued up to December 2023, the credit-weighted average buffer pool size was 13.7% of credits issued and the most common value was about 12% (Supplementary Fig. 1). By contrast, Haya et al. (2023) found that about 26% was probably a conservative floor for stand-clearing disturbance and timber harvest disturbances in REDD+ projects. Wu et al. (2023) observed that roughly 36% of area in California\u2019s compliance offset projects was projected to lose carbon over the twenty-first century in a mid-range emissions scenario.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Solutions and research needs</emphasis></p><p>The buffer pool contributions used by considerable forest NbCS efforts are not at present based on current, rigorous science and need to be revised15,16,19 (Supplementary Table 1). More rigorous disturbance and reversal data are now available and should be directly incorporated into policies and protocols immediately by updating buffer pool contributions16,61, 62\u201363 (Supplementary Information). Disturbance return intervals can be estimated from historical data and combined with simple demographic models to estimate carbon trajectories over 100-year periods64, although this approach does not directly include future climate change impacts. Detailed integrated 100-year reversal risk estimates and buffer pool contributions are forthcoming for US forests and early estimates for global forests as well62. Instead of the present piecemeal approach, it would be more robust and consistent to use a spatially explicit durability risk map based on the latest science and developed by independent scientists.</p><p>Key data gaps for assessing durability risk include independent, open-source tools based on peer-reviewed studies that provide consistent and spatially explicit risk maps and buffer pool sizes for each disturbance type that include projected trends in occurrence and severity owing to climate change, higher specificity or granularity for the risks by species, forest and/or project type, revised data-constrained estimates of the social risks to forest projects and more research and syntheses on which management actions can meaningfully influence disturbance risk in specific biomes and regions. Considering the enormous uncertainty in natural and social durability risks, we recommend conservative buffer pool allocations that protect against more extreme scenarios. Finally, given the present uncertainty about how effectively and under what conditions management interventions can reduce natural reversal risks, we further suggest that any deductions to buffer pool contributions based on management interventions be minimal or zero unless risk-specific science is available. Projects could be rewarded post hoc if management actions reduced risks relative to previous expectations. This approach would be conservative with respect to the net climate mitigation benefits achieved by NbCS projects65,66.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Additionality</emphasis></p><p>Additionality addresses whether the NbCS activity leads to further climate benefit compared with what would have happened without the climate investment67. Because additionality depends on effectively estimating an alternative outcome (that is, a baseline counterfactual of what would have occurred without the NbCS investment), it can involve marked uncertainty68 and, so far, has been the source of a substantial portion of overcrediting from NbCS carbon crediting protocols19,20,22,23.</p><p>The challenges of appropriately determining baselines and additionality differ by project category. Additionality in reforestation/afforestation projects requires action\u2014for example, tree planting or supported natural regeneration\u2014beyond what would have occurred without the climate finance. Although additionality and baseline concerns are generally perceived to be lower with reforestation projects compared with avoided conversion or improved forest management, they still apply. Uncertainty remains around natural recovery, land-use change (for example, would previous land uses have continued or changed without the NbCS) and whether reforestation would have happened without the climate finance. For avoided conversion and improved forest management, which involve changes in practice over time rather than a particular action such as planting trees, additionality is largely defined as a change from the baseline. Avoided conversion baselines hinge on predictions of forest loss without the NbCS investment22,69. Additionality in improved forest management projects depends on projects changing land management practices as a result of NbCS investment (for example, NbCS funding led to extended timber harvest intervals or reduced impact logging)19. In practice, additionality and baseline requirements are handled in a variety of ways, but present tools have generally been inaccurate owing to uncertainty in true baselines and flexibility given to project developers\u2019 selection of baseline scenarios17, 18\u201319,70,71.</p><p>A broad body of recent peer-reviewed literature using post hoc evaluations has documented inaccurate and inflated additionality claims in projects across the world17,20,23,24,26,70,72, 73\u201374. For example, several research papers on California\u2019s compliance improved forest management offset protocols have documented extensive overcrediting and little or no evidence of additionality across projects in the USA17,20,23,24. For a subset of 16 substantial tropical REDD+ avoided conversion projects, a recent large study estimated that only about 6% of estimated credits were probably additional and that inaccurate historic baselines of deforestation rates drove this notable overcrediting22. An extensive analysis of 182 reforestation projects in Australia\u2019s carbon offset scheme found little evidence of additionality, as project areas largely mirrored non-project areas26.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Solutions and research needs</emphasis></p><p>A range of recommendations have been made recently for improving additionality and baseline assessments for improved forest management19, reforestation/afforestation26 and avoided conversion/REDD+ (ref. 70) projects. Here we discuss two main trends in baseline setting for forest projects that could improve additionality if done well (Supplementary Table 1).</p><p>First, a move towards dynamic baselines should, in theory, improve additionality. Dynamic baselines involve matching project sites with control sites that are theoretically identical except for the project activity. The additionality within the project site is then evaluated relative to the control sites, rather than a historical counterfactual. Dynamic baseline methods are considered best practice for research assessing the performance of a forest programme or intervention70 and are still fairly new in carbon crediting programmes, although their use is growing (Supplementary Information).</p><p>The value of dynamic baselines, however, will hinge on the appropriateness of the control sites, which hinges on the robustness of data sources within both the project and control sites. Dynamic baselines only make sense for project-level interventions in which appropriate control sites (for example, synthetic controls) are available. Advances in remote-sensing data and modern ground-based measurements to map carbon stocks and fluxes continuously over time (that is, annually) at relevant spatial scales will improve identification of appropriate control sites and dynamic baseline estimates28,75,76. Ultimately, full transparency of selection processes, algorithms, remote-sensing data quality and control plots will enable independent evaluation of the appropriateness of the comparison. Improved maps of past and present management practices, including timber harvest return intervals, location and type of agroforestry practices, will help improve rigour. Moreover, maps of management practices in the grasslands and agricultural lands are needed, as these are the baselines in most reforestation and avoided deforestation projects.</p><p>Second, there is growing interest in supporting avoided deforestation efforts at the jurisdictional level\u2014across an entire country, state or province\u2014rather than at individual parcels. Proponents argue that jurisdictional programmes can better account for leakage and reduce the potential for adverse selection77,78. Although well-designed jurisdictional programmes can be more effective than a mosaic of individual projects, jurisdictional baselines remain subject to marked uncertainty79 that cannot be mitigated with dynamic baselines owing to the lack of appropriate controls. Many jurisdictional programmes, including ART TREES, set baselines using historical deforestation rates. Because these rates can change greatly from year to year in response to changes in global commodity prices and policies in other countries80,81, the choice of benchmark historical rates is uncertain and any fixed approach could lead to adverse selection82, 83\u201384. Also, accurate evaluation of programme effectiveness needs assessments of how well programmes address the drivers of deforestation in the particular jurisdiction. Historical baselines can also be inaccurate as applied to countries with stochastic trends in deforestation rates, including those with low historical deforestation rates that may face higher deforestation in the future85. And although jurisdictional programmes better address domestic leakage, none of the methodologies used today accounts for international leakage effects, such as market-mediated effects on commodity prices18,86,87.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Leakage</emphasis></p><p>Leakage occurs when an NbCS activity causes a shift in activity between the project area and another area outside the project area, which reduces or increases the net effect of the intended intervention. Two general types of leakage are considered in the literature: activity leakage (sometimes termed \u2018activity shifting leakage\u2019) and market leakage. Activity leakage occurs when a specific activity being reduced by an NbCS project (for example, deforestation) moves to another area. Market leakage occurs when an NbCS activity changes market conditions, for example, by reducing supply of timber in one region, which creates incentives for increasing timber supply elsewhere. Activity leakage can potentially be monitored directly, whereas market leakage cannot be monitored at the project level and instead must be estimated with economic modelling88. With market leakage, information is often transmitted through price. In interconnected markets, the results of outputs by various producers of different products are complex.</p><p>Activity leakage can theoretically be tracked by monitoring changes in deforestation or timber harvest rates with satellite imagery in a pre-established leakage zone around the project area18. Present NbCS methodologies estimate market leakage at the beginning of the project and typically apply the rate throughout the course of the project. Some, but not all, REDD+ methodologies estimate market leakage. In REDD+ methodologies that do estimate market leakage, only domestic market leakage is assessed and deducted, and international leakage is ignored, despite international leakage being known to occur with forest commodities18.</p><p>Methodologies apply a leakage deduction to adjust the amount of credits issued to a project. Leakage deductions applied by Verra REDD+ projects are typically slightly low: 2.6% for activity leakage and 4.4% for market leakage18. The scientific literature suggests that market leakage varies between 10% and 70% for REDD+ projects and a meta-analysis found an average of approximately 40% carbon leakage across studies in the forest sector18. This suggests that projects generating credits under present market-based NbCS protocols are probably substantially underestimating leakage effects18,88,89.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Solutions and research needs</emphasis></p><p>Project developers should have less flexibility to define leakage zones and estimate baseline deforestation rates within it (Supplementary Table 1). Protocols should require a market leakage deduction when a project involves reduced production of a commodity. International market leakage should be accounted for and leakage rates should conservatively reflect rates documented in the literature based on independent datasets and tools. Market leakage should be deducted around the same time as the production is assumed to be reduced to avoid substantial overcrediting19.</p><p>Distinguishing the drivers of natural and anthropogenic forest loss over a region, particularly at project-relevant scales, is a crucial research need90,91. Such datasets could be used to track whether anthropogenic drivers of forest loss increase in rate in areas beyond project boundaries as a result of the project. These rates should be characterized at relatively high spatial resolution (that is, 30 m) over time (for example, decades) before the establishment of a project to identify leakage as a period of increased forest loss relative to the typical background rates of loss. A combination of forest economic models and remotely sensed patterns of land management, timber harvest and deforestation could potentially be used to provide better data constraints on leakage. Models will probably need to capture the drivers of land-use change or forest management in a given region, be extensively validated on independent datasets to ensure confidence on projections over future decades and provide a detailed characterization of uncertainty.</p><p>Finally, given enormous uncertainty in leakage estimates at present and challenges in robustly estimating leakage rates in the near-term, protocols should focus on projects (types, regions and characteristics) for which there is greater confidence that the benefits are unlikely to be undone by leakage (Supplementary Information). Such projects increase carbon storage or reduce carbon storage loss with little decrease in production or usable land or are paired with activities that reduce leakage pressure (for example, pairing avoided conversion projects around urban areas with policies that increase urban density).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NbCS programme structural reforms</emphasis></p><p>As well as the crucial scientific reforms needed for rigorous forest NbCS described above, structural reforms that affect both the supply and demand sides of NbCS initiatives are urgently needed. Voluntary reporting standards have required separate reporting of an organization\u2019s direct emissions and purchased carbon credits, but public disclosure is still limited, although requirements are coming in some jurisdictions10,92,93. To enable independent analysis of the effectiveness of corporate climate action and increase confidence, the location and nature of NbCS interventions used as offsets\u2014as well as all information that an external analyst would need to independently recalculate the benefits and understand the source of data and assumptions\u2014should be publicly available (Supplementary Information), as is now required for carbon credits under California\u2019s new law, AB-1305 (ref. 93).</p><p>Better transparency in methodology and measurements of NbCS projects and activities will also be crucial to developing rigour in NbCS initiatives. Although required transparent data will probably vary depending on the activity and protocol, we suggest that a minimum floor of required data for NbCS projects and initiatives include the digital geospatial data that accurately define geographic boundaries of the interventions, either the proposed intervention activities and how those depart from the previous 20+ years of land management for projects using a historical baseline or selected control plots/regions for projects using a dynamic baseline, carbon crediting modelling/graphs that clearly show the assumed baseline for each individual project, and how that baseline was calculated, and forest composition of the intervention area at the initiation of the project necessary for independent reproduction of crediting and baseline scenarios. Funding for the creation and maintenance of these transparent, open and easily usable datasets is important and could be game-changing if provided by public and/or philanthropic sources.</p><p>Structural independence of NbCS project verifiers is a crucial design change needed to remove potential or perceived conflicts of interest. Instead of the present structure of credit-producing programmes in which verifiers are hired by project developers, verifiers should be hired by programme administrators or separate independent parties94. Alternatively, verifiers could be required to be chosen randomly from a common pool, hired from pooled resources and rewarded for accuracy95.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The contribution approach to NbCS</emphasis></p><p>There are several reasons why considering an alternative approach to NbCS may be valuable. Existing NbCS carbon credits have marked challenges with quality, as discussed above, making it legally and reputationally risky for corporations and other buyers to make emission reduction claims using many of those credits96. Corporations increasingly face legal complaints and greenwashing accusations for making offsetting-related claims that are considered misleading or unsubstantiated, which can violate consumer laws97,98.</p><p>Conventional offsetting is based on a ton-for-ton model, in which a person or company buys an equal number of carbon credits as the emissions they seek to \u2018offset\u2019. This approach can drive demand for high-volume, low-cost carbon credits99, which can have benefits by encouraging economies of scale, innovation and renewed investment, but also at present probably have less real climate mitigation impact100. The present offsetting approach has structural incentives built into it such that many actors involved in producing carbon credits benefit from inflated estimates of project climate benefit18,32,101. Thus, it remains an open question whether the existing system can be meaningfully reformed to deliver rigour and effectiveness in the next 5\u201310 years.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Opportunities in a contribution approach</emphasis></p><p>The contribution approach is an alternative framework for corporations and other organizations to support NbCS without claiming the resulting emissions reductions or removals offset or neutralize their own greenhouse gas emissions102. Under a contribution approach, instead of using carbon credits to report lower net emissions, a buyer would claim that they have only made a financial contribution to global climate mitigation. The largest incentives for companies and other organizations to buy into a contribution approach are that contribution claims are more scientifically accurate, straightforward and legally defensible, reducing legal and reputational risks. Also, the alternative funding models in a contribution approach can help channel the financial resources of an organization to potentially more strategic and high-impact efforts to reduce emissions inside and outside traditional carbon markets.</p><p>A contribution claim can be more scientifically accurate and legally defensible than a conventional offsetting claim because it does not presume equivalence between the climate mitigation benefits of NbCS with the harms of greenhouse gas emissions. Given the difficulty of precisely quantifying NbCS interventions and the incommensurability of the CO2 temporarily sequestered within NbCS to fossil fuel emissions55,103, this approach allows stakeholders to recognize the climate and co-benefits of NbCS without claiming equivalence of emissions reductions.</p><p>Although contribution claims cannot support statements that companies have achieved carbon neutrality or net zero, companies might nevertheless consider a shift from offsetting to contribution claims to reduce legal and reputational risks. Consumer protection and false advertising laws prohibit false or misleading statements, which could present legal risks if a company relies on low-quality carbon credits to substantiate a carbon-neutrality or net-zero marketing claim. By contrast, contribution claims may be more responsive to, and present fewer compliance risks under, existing and emerging regulatory measures. For example, the European Parliament\u2019s recent revision to its Unfair Commercial Practices Directive104 prohibits conventional offsetting claims for consumer products and suggests that contribution-type claims may be appropriate.</p><p>The contribution approach is compatible with many beyond value chain mitigation (BVCM) guidelines105, 106\u2013107. BVCM guidelines help corporations more credibly set science-based targets and engage with BVCM activities in a more transparent manner. These guidelines typically include recommendations that companies assign priority to direct emissions reductions, raise funds through ton-per-ton, money-per ton or money-per-money models, assign priority to the spending of such funds on effective climate mitigation and transparently making contribution and other more accurate claims.</p><p>When companies follow such BVCM guidelines, the contribution approach offers several potential advantages for advancing rigorous NbCS. The first advantage is that it facilitates fundraising strategies that could drive demand for higher quality NbCS, specifically by disconnecting demand for NbCS from a ton-for-ton compensation model. Alternatively, companies could use a money-per-ton approach in which they set an internal carbon fee (or tax) on their own emissions to encourage reductions and use fee revenues to fund NbCS or other BVCM approaches. BVCM guidelines recommend an internal carbon fee be set at the social cost of carbon, generally considered to be $100 to &gt;$283 per ton108, 109, 110\u2013111 and higher in wealthy regions if equity weighting is used112. Alternatively, under a money-per-money fundraising approach, a corporation would commit a percentage of its annual profits or revenues to support rigorous NbCS. Both of these alternative fundraising approaches could change the incentive structure of demand for carbon credits to allow corporations to focus their set budget on high-quality climate mitigation initiatives. This could potentially create a \u2018race to the top\u2019 for high-quality NbCS initiatives both inside and outside carbon markets, rather than the present incentive for quantity. It also provides flexibility to channel financial resources to a wider pool of critical investments, for example, towards efforts that broadly decarbonize economic sectors and/or protect natural resources through system change, including advocacy for stronger climate and forest protection policies.</p><p>A second advantage of the contribution approach is that, if buyers shifted their focus to high-quality NbCS initiatives, project developers may have less incentive to inflate an initiative\u2019s climate benefit and more incentive to rigorously quantify it. Thus, project developers could be more open to the structural shift in third-party certification described above32. Such an incentive structure could also promote the development of, and demand for, NbCS quantification methods by independent analysts without conflicts of interest.</p><p>A third advantage is that the contribution approach allows entities to fund NbCS while quality issues and uncertainty around NbCS carbon credits remain. This is especially useful if revisions to incorporate the rigour outlined in this synthesis are delayed or not fully implemented in NbCS carbon crediting protocols. One example of contribution approaches already driving companies to financially support potentially high-quality initiatives as an advanced market commitment is the \u2018Frontier\u2019 initiative focused on accelerating the development of durable carbon-removal technologies.</p><p>Critics may argue that corporations might stop investing in NbCS if they can no longer make offsetting claims. However, research shows that corporations engage in carbon markets for reasons beyond reaching emission reduction targets96,113. Corporations also engage in carbon markets for market competitiveness (for example, as a branding tool) and to uphold and embody corporate values (for example, supporting the Sustainable Development Goals and to do their part for climate mitigation). In a recent study, about 31% of companies listed market competitiveness and about 32% listed corporate values as reasons for purchasing carbon credits113. These findings illustrate that, although some corporations may want to maintain an offset-claiming approach, many corporations already buy carbon credits for reasons that can be aligned with a contribution approach. Furthermore, it is not clear that consumers are swayed towards offsetting claims more than other types of claim. Rather, research indicates that public comprehension of green claim terminology\u2014including climate claims\u2014is low, even among the most environmentally engaged consumers114,115. This suggests that corporations can differentiate themselves from their competitors, potentially with more flexibility to tailor to their interests and values, and that consumers may not be strongly swayed one way or another between the advertising of a corporation making an offsetting versus contribution claim.</p><p>Another common concern is that the contribution approach could allow corporations to focus on charismatic (for example, compelling narratives around social or biodiversity benefits) projects with limited climate benefit. This is indeed an open question. In this scenario, the cost of funding the charismatic project itself is that the corporation\u2019s money has been spent less effectively on climate mitigation than it could otherwise have been. This is arguably better for the climate than when companies use ineffective carbon credits in lieu of real emissions reductions, which results in an increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and climate damages26. Such risk can also be mitigated as third-party watchdogs, including civil society organizations, academic researchers and institutions, journalists and private sector ratings agencies, continue to examine the impacts of corporate climate funding116.</p><p>Relatedly, a risk of the contribution approach is the decoupling of a corporation\u2019s residual emissions from support for climate mitigation elsewhere when the money-per-money fundraising pathway is chosen. This could potentially decrease the amount of funding channelled towards NbCS initiatives, at least initially. However, if rigorously identified and quantified NbCS initiatives were strategically funded, the real climate-mitigation impact-per-dollar would probably go up. Best practices recommend that the money-per-ton fundraising pathway should be used by high-profit companies, whereas the money-per-money pathway could be useful for the small percentage of heavy-emitting companies (for example, utilities, air travel, cement) that generate profits of less than $100 per tCO2 of emissions117. An estimated US$27 billion per year could be generated if just 141 high-profit companies spent $100 per ton they emit, representing a small percentage of their profits117.</p><p>Contribution approaches are gathering interest around the world. Contribution claims are considered within the UNFCCC\u2019s Paris Agreement in both Article 6.4 as \u2018mitigation contribution units\u2019 and in Article 6.8 as \u2018non-market contributions\u2019. In the voluntary context, the contribution approach is already being promoted and implemented by companies (for example, Klarna, Ocean Outdoor and United Airlines), climate finance project curators (for example, Milkywire and Pinwheel) and registries (for example, the Gold Standard). For the approach to be implemented more broadly, more demand for the approach could be generated if corporate climate standards required contribution claims. Also, third-party accreditation would help mainstream the approach. Nevertheless, the contribution approach is an increasingly promoted option for corporations and others interested in investing in BVCM in a more credible way and could contribute impactful, needed funding to rigorous NbCS.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>This article is the product of the Wilkes Center for Climate Science and Policy at the University of Utah\u2019s Working Group on Rigorous Nature-based Climate Solutions in Forests.

A Pew Research Center poll found more men than women are opting out of college.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Many careers that don't require a degree offer a livable wage but require an apprenticeship or training program for technical skills.</p><p>USA TODAY explored some of the careers the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics says are growing in demand. Here is a glimpse at some of those fields and what it takes to pursue them.</p><p>Elevator and escalator installation and repair</p><p>People who can install and fix elevators and escalators are in demand, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Most states require these employees to obtain a license.</p><p>People interested in this job can enroll in four-year apprenticeship programs to learn the necessary skills.</p><p>Training programs offered by unions teach about safety, elevator and escalator parts and electrical and digital theory among other skills, according to the bureau's data.</p><p>As of May 2023, the average median wage for these workers was $102,420.</p><p>This job often requires employees to \"work in cramped areas inside crawl spaces and machine rooms\" or at heights in elevator shafts and it may require overtime work, according to the bureau's data.</p><p>Subway and streetcar operators</p><p>The U.S. workforce needs people who can operate subways and trains that transport passengers. People who do this job earned an average median wage last year of $84,270, federal data shows.</p><p>To obtain the skills to operate a subway or streetcar, you should prepare for a few months to a year of on-the-job training, according to a description provided by the career website O*NET OnLine.</p><p>People in the training program learn how to drive and control the vehicles, operate the controls that open and close doors and regulate the speed of trains. They also learn about safety precautions, according to the career website's description.</p><p>Costume attendants</p><p>Demand for costume attendants also is on the rise.</p><p>The role could be a good fit for people interested in helping \"select, fit and take care of costumes for cast members and entertainers\" in plays and performances, according to the bureau's job description. People often learn skills for these jobs while working for a performance arts company, high school or college drama or film department, or in the motion picture, television or video industries.</p><p>Professional costume attendants earned a median wage of $52,370 last year, according to federal data.</p><p>Forest fire inspectors and prevention specialists</p><p>Forest fire prevention and inspection is another lucrative field for people without a college degree. The skills for this job include detecting fire hazards, identifying fire prevention measures and investigating the cause of fires.</p><p>The first step is to get experience as a firefighter. People who pursue these careers typically get on-the-job training after they've been hired, according to the bureau's data. Certification may also be required.</p><p>Last year, forest fire inspectors and prevention specialists made an average of $71,420, data shows.</p><p>Airline operations specialists</p><p>Airlines are also looking for people to help ensure commercial planes have safe takeoffs and landings.</p><p>Airline operations specialists help with \"maintaining flight records and applying knowledge of weather information,\" according to the bureau's description of the role.</p><p>To learn the skills for the job, people usually need to complete an apprenticeship program in airfield management or operations resource flight or jump management, according to a description provided by the career website O*NET OnLine.</p><p>These workers made a median annual wage of $51,140 in May 2023, federal data shows.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USATDY-usa2999161996</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USATDY2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D9F-S551-DXGX-6307-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8213</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"637\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 USA Today All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>USA Today</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"10\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>October 30, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST00097CK</classCode><className>LABOR DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008XK2</classCode><className>APPRENTICESHIPS &amp;

In addition to DLA procurement of essentials like hoses, batteries, and ready-to-eat meals for federal firefighting caches, DLA Disposition Services reverse logisticians provide used and surplus military equipment and vehicles that for decades have helped support volunteer fire stations and sustain rural response personnel around the country through the Firefighter Property Program, or FPP, and the older Federal Excess Personal Property, or FEPP, program that began in the 1950s.</p><p>The U.S. Forest Service estimates DOD equipment originally valued at close to $3 billion has flowed from the services through DLA to firefighters over time via FPP and FEPP. The items they receive were purchased for warfighting applications, but thanks to a partnership between the state of Michigan and the National Association of State Foresters, engineers at the Forest Fire Experiment Station in Roscommon, or REC, have developed and shared dozens of plans for firefighting apparatus conversions and still keep a watchful eye on equipment they hope to see transferred through the USFS from DLA in the future.</p><p>One multi-use example of wildfire reutilization is the M915A2 tactical truck, and its predecessors, which have been a mainstay of Army transport for decades. Engineers at the REC and firefighters across the country have converted hundreds if not thousands - of the haulers to serve non-warfighting purposes, saying the conversions involve super simple changes that meet a lot of needs for firefighters.</p><p>Things go in, things go out, said Matt Feldpausch, a Michigan official who helps funnel used items to the states network of volunteer firefighting stations. Theres always a rotation thats whats important.</p><p>Feldpausch said Michigan has received about $40 million in FPP equipment and currently has more than 4400 items in its inventory. He said the 915s get picked up by volunteer stations in his state and nationwide who save a huge amount of money by strapping 3,500-gallon tanks to them. With new paint, floodlights, and some ingenuity, these vehicles have proven that they can continue serving taxpayers long after their military use has ended.</p><p>Dave Stockoski has served as the RECs lead for the past five years. He said the center has created and published about 80 engineering projects during its run and five big projects since hes been a part of it. His team conducts 3D modeling and printing, has a computer numerical control mill, and advertises its capacity to help its partners across the nation to figure out how to make military surplus and other material work for their fire response needs.</p><p>The centers Project 56 is titled Evaluating the Hummer and HMMVW-series chassis for wildland engine use. In it, theres guidance on cab, bumper, grill guard, electric system, and tank design that can help turn a repurposed military Humvee into a go-anywhere first response vehicle. Project 72 is the conversion of the Oshkosh R11 Fuel Tanker, which the center determined could be converted to safely transport 4,600 gallons of water and costed less than $6,000 in new equipment when the plans were first developed in 2016. All the center's projects are available online or at request.</p><p>Firefighting applications of the militarys Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles, or FMTVs, are a current agenda item. The REC team is considering how to best convert the transport platform to equip military excess requisitions with 900-gallon tanks at the lowest possible cost for volunteer departments. The Marine Corps has used an FMTV variant called the Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement, or MTVR, and the centers staff is looking at applications for those, as well.</p><p>Engineers at the REC said they recently took a special request from Florida, essentially asking how big of a water tanker can you make? To find out, the team converted a former military airport refueling truck received from DLA into a 6500-gallon water tanker that came with its own pumping system. Leaders at REC said Florida seemed to really like it and it worked out well for them.</p><p>Center leaders said FPP remains an invaluable resource for wildfire response and prevention, and they are ready to consider any potential military excess vehicle conversion projects the states send their way. For its part, DLA Disposition Services personnel continue working each day to ensure taxpayer dollars and the equipment they procure provide benefit for as long as possible. Transfer of military equipment to federal entities like the Forest Service happens only if military units who are screening DLA's used and surplus inventory do not request the items first. After the reutilization and transfer periods end, items are offered for donation and, eventually, for auction.</p><p>Recent annual statistics from DLA Disposition Services Reutilization, Transfer and Donation office show that FPP recipients received equipment originally valued at $98 million in fiscal 2022, $61 million in 2023, and just under $60 million in 2024. The agency considers FFP as a special program, meaning firefighters can view and request used and excess items that appear in DLAs surplus inventory in the first 14 days of the 42-day property screening cycle, alongside qualifying recipients like law enforcement agencies, Civil Air Patrol and DODs Humanitarian Assistance Program.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126931677</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DYD-9763-RSCD-64MK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"989\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"01\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>January 21, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news reporting originating in Delft, Netherlands, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Accurately assessing forest fire susceptibility (FFS) in the Similipal Tiger Reserve (STR) is essential for biodiversity conservation, climate change mitigation, and community safety. Most existing studies have primarily focused on climatic and topographical factors, while this research expands the scope by employing a synergistic approach that integrates geographical information systems (GIS), remote sensing (RS), and machine learning (ML) methodologies for identifying and assessing forest fire-prone areas in the STR and their vulnerability to climate change.\" </p><p><br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from the Delft University of Technology, \"To achieve this, the study employed a comprehensive dataset of forty-four influencing factors, including topographic, climate-hydrologic, forest health, vegetation indices, radar features, and anthropogenic interference, into ten ML models: neural net (nnet), AdaBag, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBTree), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Random Forest (RF), and its hybrid variants with differential evolution algorithm (RFDEA), Gravitational Based Search (RF-GBS), Grey Wolf Optimization (RF-GWO), Particle Swarm Optimization (RF-PSO), and genetic algorithm (RF-GA). The study revealed high FFS in both the northern and southern portions of the study area, with the nnet and RF-PSO models demonstrating susceptibility percentages of 12.44% and 12.89%, respectively. Conversely, very low FFS zones consistently displayed susceptibility scores of approximately 23.41% and 18.57% for the nnet and RF-PSO models. The robust mapping methodology was validated by impressive AUROC (&gt;0.88) and kappa coefficient (&gt;0.62) scores across all ML validation metrics. Future climate models (ssp245 and ssp585, 2022-2100) indicated high FFS zones along the northern and southern edges of the STR, with the central zone categorized from low to very low susceptibility. Boruta analysis identified actual evapotranspiration (AET) and relative humidity as key factors influencing forest fire ignition. SHAP evaluation reinforced the influence of these factors on FFS, while also highlighting the significant role of distance to road, distance to settlement, dNBR, slope, and humidity in prediction accuracy.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"These results emphasize the critical importance of the proposed approach for forest fire mapping and provide invaluable insights for firefighting teams, forest management, planning, and qualification strategies to address future fire sustainability.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Integrating Geospatial, Remote Sensing, and Machine Learning for Climate-induced Forest Fire Susceptibility Mapping In Similipal Tiger Reserve, India.

According to news originating from Gliwice, Poland, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"We propose a Hybrid Support Vector Regression (SVR) with Flattening-Samples Based Augmented Regularization (Hybrid FSR-SVR) architecture for multi-sensor fire detection and forest fire risk assessment. The Hybrid FSR-SVR is a lightweight architecture built upon the novel Flattening-Samples Based Augmented Regularization (FSR) approach and temporal trends of environmental variables.\" </p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the Polish Academy of Sciences, \"The FSR approach augments l2 norm based smoothing term into an l1-l2 combination, facilitating the integration of l1 regularization into the SVR method, thereby enhancing generalization with minimal computational load. We evaluate the performance of Hybrid FSR-SVR using two distinct datasets covering indoor and forest fires, benchmarking against 15 machine learning models, including state-of-the-art techniques, such as Recurrent Trend Predictive Neural Network (rTPNN), Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Gradient Boosting. Our findings demonstrate that Hybrid FSR-SVR effectively assesses the risk of forest fire, enabling early preventive measures. Notably, it achieves a remarkable accuracy of 0.95 for forest fire detection and ranks third with 0.88 accuracy for indoor fire detection. Importantly, it exhibits computation times significantly lower - by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude - than the majority of compared techniques.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The superior generalization ability of Hybrid FSR-SVR, facilitated by flattening-samples based augmented regularization, allows for high detection performance even with smaller training sets.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Fire Detection and Risk Assessment Via Support Vector Regression With Flattening-samples Based Augmented Regularization.

A third plane from Croatia was also expected.</p><p>The Greek fire service said more than 400 firefighters, assisted by 22 aircraft, were engaged against the blaze in the rugged mountains of Corinthia in the Peloponnese region.</p><p>The authorities were optimistic that progress had been made as the main front of the blaze was out, leaving a large number of scattered fires. However, it remained unclear whether that success could be expanded on before winds whipped up and spread the blaze again.</p><p>Greece's minister for climate change and civil protection, Vassilis Kikilias, said so far up to 5,000 hectares (12,300 acres) had been affected by the blaze.</p><p>\u201cThe situation is very difficult,\u201d he told a press conference. \u201cWe didn't expect that at this time of year ... there would be so many wildfires and that they would be so difficult to handle.\u201d</p><p>While wildfires are common in the summer, this year the season started much earlier than usual, in April, and has extended well into the fall. The fire service said a total of 41 wildfires broke out all over the country over the past 24 hours.</p><p>Government spokesman Pavlos Marinakis said firefighters had been hampered in their initial response Sunday by the difficult terrain and poor road network.</p><p>\u201cDuring the first, crucial stage of the fire, firetrucks had great difficulty approaching (the blaze) because of the narrow roads,\u201d he said. \u201cThe many ravines and the gale-force winds blowing that day greatly impeded\u201d the firefighting effort, Marinakis added.</p><p>Officials ordered that another village be evacuated as a precaution Tuesday, a day after half a dozen similar orders were issued. A major highway that was closed overnight as flames swept close by was reopened on Tuesday.</p><p>The blaze destroyed a historic church in the mountains and reportedly damaged buildings outside the threatened villages, but the fire service was not immediately able to provide further details.</p><p>The two victims were identified as local residents who got trapped late Sunday by the fast-advancing blaze.</p><p>Greece, like other southern European countries, is plagued every summer by <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/europe-climate-risk-assessment-report-disasters-a229d11b378df08b93ab77a2e27250c9\">destructive wildfires that have been exacerbated by global warming</url>. Over the past few months, the fire service has had to cope with more than 4,500 wildfires \u2014 which Kikilias said was the highest number ever recorded in a single fire season.</p><p>This year's had been flagged as the most dangerous season in two decades after the countryside was left parched by a <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/greece-water-reservoir-sunken-village-drought-climate-83e3cae3145b4b8a51c99d7ff12e1b76\">protracted drought and early summer heatwaves</url>.</p><p>Still, Greece's big investments in extra water-bombing aircraft, warning drones and other equipment have led to most blazes being extinguished shortly after they broke out.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-cfeb415e491edbdce660490bae5aeb3f20241001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D38-96G1-DYMD-650D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"514\"/><timeReceived>4:18 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>October 1, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news reporting out of National Pingtung University of Science and Technology by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Forest fires have become a vital issue causing various hydro-meteorological disasters. Many parties have carried out efforts.\" </p><p><br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from National Pingtung University of Science and Technology: \"This study aimed to analyze the impact of land covers due to reforestation on infiltration rate and other soil physical properties related to hydrological conditions. The research was conducted in the Cempaka Forest area. There are four observed land covers, i.e., Timber Forest Products (TFP), Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFP), Pine, and Shrub. The results showed that land cover significantly affected the infiltration rate (p &lt;0.05). The infiltration rate of Pine was not significantly different from NTFP but significantly different from TFP and Shrubs. The infiltration rate of Pine, NTFP, TFP, and Shrub land cover was 76.2 cm hr-1, 48.1 cm hr-1, 32.7 cm.hr-1, and 40.0 cm hr-1, respectively. The infiltration correlated with soil bulk density at two depths (0-15 cm and 16-30 cm) with r values of 0.614 and 0.595, respectively. Infiltration rate also significantly correlated with water content at pF 0 and pF 2.5 in the second soil depth.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Additionally, soil bulk density is correlated with soil particle density with r = 0.621. Soil particle density also correlated with clay content with r equal to 0.726.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Impact of Reforestation After Forest Fire on Infiltration and Other Soil Physical Properties.

It slowly descended. At first, I thought the cloud was fog, but the air was not damp. I continued walking. I noticed people were covering their mouths and noses with their shirts or jackets. Some of them were coughing. I chose to breathe deeply. My throat was not itching. My eyes were not burning. I breathed deeply again. I wondered, is the air full of incinerated medical waste? Asbestos or some other <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/chicago-dust-storm-chemicals-illinois-b2756323.html\">poison that will give me cancer</url>? Smoke from a forest fire miles away? Was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/science/weird-science/conspiracy-theories-abound-u-s-military-closes-haarp-n112576\">HAARP</url> or some other weather control device that the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2024/10/07/im-sick-and-tired-of-this-crap-officials-debunk-truly-dangerous-hurricane-helene-lies/\">conspiracy theorists</url> have long been obsessed with malfunctioning? I laughed out loud. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I then asked myself: Given how bad things are in America right now, what is the worst that can possibly happen to me from this bad air? I quickly realized the answer: a lot. So I covered my mouth and nose like everyone else. </p><p>Eventually, my phone buzzed with a weather alert. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/17/weather/chicago-dust-storm.html\">Chicago was experiencing a historic dust storm</url>. In the Middle East, such a storm is called a \"haboob.\" I walked several more blocks and looked up at Trump Tower. The dust cloud was now hovering below the huge \"Trump Tower\" sign. I smiled at the absurdity and power of the metaphor that is the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/topic/age-of-trump\">Age of Trump</url> and its oppressive toxicity that has confused and disoriented so many Americans.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://salon.com/topic/donald_trump\">Donald Trump</url> is a master propagandist and agent of chaos and distraction with power and influence over a vast propaganda and disinformation machine. Trump's ability to dominate the 24/7 media and this age of spectacle is likely unprecedented in modern (if not all of) American history. He is a defining personality and character of this era.</p><p>In a 2023 conversation, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2023/09/19/we-are-in-an-information-war-on-disinformation-and-why-we-cant-expect-journalists-to-save-us/\">Lee McIntyre, author of the book \"On Disinformation: How to Fight for Truth and Protect Democracy,\" explained</url> to me: \"I doubt that Trump has ever taken a course in psyops or that he reads disinformation training manuals in his spare time, but he is nonetheless a master, near-genius-level propagandist. He uses the exact same techniques of disinformation on an American audience that Putin uses on his citizens.\"</p><p>When Donald Trump, his MAGA Republicans and the larger antidemocracy movement encounter difficulties with their \"shock and awe\" campaign and blitzkrieg against American democracy and society, they amplify the power and reach of their disinformation and propaganda experience machine. The mainstream news media, the Democrats and other members of the responsible political class (and many among the general public) have been conditioned to respond almost like Pavlov's dogs. They chase the newest outrage or spectacle and react like it is a surprise instead of focusing on the bigger picture and goals that these controversies and \"shocking\" events are advancing and/or hiding.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-trump-column-read.html\">In a recent New York Times opinion essay, Ezra Klein explained how disorientation and a lack of focus</url> are the intended outcome of Donald Trump and his agents' \"flooding the zone\" strategy and tactic:</p><p>Focus is the fundamental substance of democracy. It is particularly the substance of opposition. People largely learn of what the government is doing through the media - be it mainstream media or social media. If you overwhelm the media - if you give it too many places it needs to look, all at once, if you keep it moving from one thing to the next - no coherent opposition can emerge. It is hard to even think coherently....</p><p>The flood is the point. The overwhelm is the point. The message wasn't in any one executive order or announcement. It was in the cumulative effect of all of them. The sense that this is Trump's country now. This is his government now. It follows his will. It does what he wants. If Trump tells the state to stop spending money, the money stops. If he says that birthright citizenship is over, it's over.</p><p>Or so he wants you to think. In Trump's first term, we were told: Don't normalize him. In his second, the task is different: Don't believe him.</p><p>Trump knows the power of marketing. If you make people believe something is true, you make it likelier that it becomes true...</p><p>It is a strategy that forces you into overreach. To keep the zone flooded, you have to keep acting, keep moving, keep creating new cycles of outrage or fear. You overwhelm yourself. And there's only so much you can do through executive orders. Soon enough, you have to go beyond what you can actually do. And when you do that, you either trigger a constitutional crisis or you reveal your own weakness.</p><p>Trump's \"big beautiful bill\" is set to take trillions of dollars away from the American people and give it to the richest people and corporations. If enacted, it will be one of the largest - if not the largest - transfers of wealth in American history and further gut the social safety net. Trump's \"big beautiful bill\" is unpopular with the American people and would likely trigger a huge backlash - given any sustained attention.</p><p>While the GOP-controlled House passed Trump's bill, the media's attention was mostly focused on Trump's \"gifted\" 400-million-dollar jetliner, a literal flying palace and king's court, from the government of Qatar. This is part of a much larger pattern of conflict of interests and corrupt power in apparent violation of the Constitution's Emoluments Clause and other ethics laws in which Donald Trump, his family and inner circle have leveraged the office of the presidency for personal enrichment. </p><p>Meanwhile, the United States Supreme Court has ordered a pause on Trump's mass deportation program under the Alien Enemies Act. There have been a series of lower court rulings that have also ordered a pause or outright stop to key parts of the Trump administration's actions and policies. A series of public opinion polls recently showed that Trump's support at this point in his presidency among the American people has collapsed at a rate not seen in 80 years. However, new public opinion polls show that Trump's support may have stabilized and is crawling back to his ceiling of approximately 45% to 47%. In total, Donald Trump's policies and behavior remain widely unpopular. </p><p>Donald Trump's historic global tariff regime has not created a new \"golden age\" for the United States and the American people. Leading economists and other business leaders continue to warn that the shocks from Trump's tariffs will cause disruptions to the economy if not a recession (or worse). <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/19/us-treasury-yields-moodys-downgrades-us-credit-rating.html\">Moody's has downgraded the credit-rating of the United States</url> from AAA (the highest level). </p><p>Donald Trump and his administration's foreign policy -- and his brand as a \"dealmaker\" - continues to falter. Most notably, the war in Ukraine continues and the United States' role as the world's leading democracy and an indispensable nation has been greatly diminished in just the first four months of Trump's return to power.</p><p>Trump and his agents responded by turning their firehose of distraction, falsehoods and spectacle on full blast. The water is rising very quickly.</p><p>In a recent Truth Social post, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/05/19/trump-celebrity-investigations-feud-taylor-swift-beyonce-bruce-springsteen\">Donald Trump continued his attacks against singer Taylor Swift</url> (\"Has anyone noticed that, since I said 'I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,' she's no longer 'HOT?'\"). He also turned his rage against Bruce Springsteen, Beyonce, Bono and Oprah Winfrey by accusing them of being part of a vast anti-Trump conspiracy. On Wednesday, Trump shared a video on his Truth Social platform of him hitting Bruce Springsteen with a golf ball that then causes the singer to stumble on stage.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-wants-investigations-springsteen-beyonce-oprah-bono-rcna207723\">MSNBC's Steven Benen sorts through Trump's conspiracy theories and warns</url>:</p><p>To the extent that reality still has any meaning in situations like this, let's just briefly note that there's literally no evidence of Harris or her campaign paying anyone for endorsements; there was nothing \"unlawful\" or \"corrupt\" about the support the then-Democratic nominee received from celebrities during the 2024 campaign; Beyonc \ufffd did not face \"loud booing\" after she endorsed Harris; and there's nothing \"illegal\" about public figures publicly backing a presidential candidate.</p><p>It's also probably worth mentioning in passing that Trump's hysterical online communications don't do any favors to his \"very stable genius\" description of himself.</p><p>But of particular interest was the president's interest in \"a major investigation into this matter.\"</p><p>All things considered, there's no reason to get too worked up about every Trump tantrum, his rage toward celebrities who've dared to criticize him, his weird approach to pop culture, or his use of the word \"illegal\" as a synonym for \"stuff I don't like.\" What I do care about, however, is the president's willingness to use the power of the state to pursue critics in authoritarian-style fashion.</p><p>This is especially true now with the Justice Department led by an attorney general who apparently sees herself as an extension of the White House and its political agenda - which raises the prospect of a federal investigator actually initiating a probe into celebrities that Trump doesn't like.</p><p>Trump also shared an AI-generated video of himself as a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-78-posts-bizarre-ai-video-of-himself-rocking-out-to-journey/\">member of the rock band Journey</url> playing their iconic song \"Don't Stop Believing\" before a huge crowd of his MAGA people. In keeping with his drive for unlimited power, Trump also recently shared a series of AI-generated images of himself as the new Pope and a Sith Lord or other supremely powerful evil Jedi from George Lucas' \"Star Wars\" universe.</p><p>Relatedly, former <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/19/james-comey-seashell-instagram-photo-trump\">FBI director James Comey posted an image on the social media platform Instagram of the numbers \"86 47\" formed from seashells</url> on a beach. Trump responded that Comey was making a coded threat against his life (\"Eighty-six\" is slang for \"replace\" or \"get rid of\"; Donald Trump is the 47<sup>th</sup> president of the United States). The MAGA chorus dutifully amplified Trump's paranoid conclusions. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/us/politics/secret-service-comey-social-media-trump.html\">The Secret Service is now investigating Comey's alleged threat against Donald Trump</url>. Comey has responded that this is all so much nonsense, and he was just sharing an image of seashells on the beach. </p><p>In her newsletter, <url normalizedValue=\"https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/may-16-2025\">historian Heather Cox Richardson offered this context</url>for Donald Trump and his forces' coordinated distraction campaign and attempts to dominate the information space: </p><p>[R]etired entrepreneur Bill Southworth tallied the times Trump has grabbed headlines to distract people from larger stories, starting the tally with how Trump's posts about Peanut the Squirrel the day before the election swept like a brushfire across the right-wing media ecosystem and then into the mainstream. In early 2025, Southworth notes, as the media began to dig into the dramatic restructuring of the federal government, Trump posted outrageously about Gaza, and that story took over. When cuts to PEPFAR (the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) and the U.S. Agency for International Development threatened lives across Africa, Trump turned the conversation to white South Africans he lied were fleeing \"anti-white genocide.\"</p><p>Southworth calls this \"narrative warfare,\" and while it is true that Republican leaders have seeded a particular false narrative for decades now, this technique is also known as \"political technology\" or \"virtual politics.\" This system, pioneered in Russia under Russian president Vladimir Putin, is designed to get people to vote an authoritarian into office by creating a fake world of outrage. For those who do not buy the lies, there is another tool: flooding the zone so that people stop being able to figure out what is real and tune out.</p><p>The administration has clearly adopted this plan. As Drew Harwell and Sarah Ellison of the Washington Post noted in early March, the administration set out to portray Trump as a king in order \"to sell the country on [Trump's] expansionist approach to presidential power.\"</p><p>Richardson adds:</p><p>Dominating means controlling the narrative. That starts with perceptions of the president himself. Trump's appearances have been deeply concerning as he cannot follow a coherent thread, frequently falls asleep, repeatedly veers into nonsense, and says he doesn't know about the operations of his government.</p><p>Donald Trump and his forces' ability to \"flood the zone\" as part of their larger propaganda and disinformation campaign is not some \"unknown unknown,\" a mystery, an impenetrable black box, a form of magic or a supernatural power. Information about how to effectively counter such strategies and tactics is readily available to almost anyone who wants to seek it out.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Want a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.</emphasis></p><p>For example, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PE198.html\">a free 2016 report from the Rand organization offers this advice</url>:</p><p>We are not optimistic about the effectiveness of traditional counterpropaganda efforts. Certainly, some effort must be made to point out falsehoods and inconsistencies, but the same psychological evidence that shows how falsehood and inconsistency gain traction also tells us that retractions and refutations are seldom effective. Especially after a significant amount of time has passed, people will have trouble recalling which information they have received is the disinformation and which is the truth. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Put simply, our first suggestion is don't expect to counter the firehose of falsehood with the squirt gun of truth.</emphasis></p><p>The Rand report continues:</p><p>Our second suggestion is to find ways to help put raincoats on those at whom the firehose of falsehood is being directed.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Don't expect to counter Russia's firehose of falsehood with the squirt gun of truth. Instead, put raincoats on those at whom the firehose is aimed.</emphasis>[My emphasis added]</p><p>Another possibility is to focus on countering the effects of Russian propaganda, rather than the propaganda itself. The propagandists are working to accomplish something. The goal may be a change in attitudes, behaviors, or both. Identify those desired effects and then work to counter the effects that run contrary to your goals...</p><p>That metaphor and mindset leads us to our fourth suggestion for responding to Russian propaganda: Compete! If Russian propaganda aims to achieve certain effects, it can be countered by preventing or diminishing those effects.</p><p>In our 2023 conversation, Lee McIntyre offered this additional advice about how to resist and win an information war:</p><p>[D]isinformation has three goals. First is to try to get you to believe a falsehood. Second is to polarize you around a factual issue so that you begin to distrust, and even hate, the people who do not also believe this same falsehood. But finally comes the third and in some ways the most insidious goal of all they want you to give up. I think one message people get from disinformation is that everyone is biased, and that all speech is political. Or that things are so confusing - and there are so many voices out there who disagree - that it's just impossible to know the truth. People become confused and then cynical. They begin to feel helpless. And that is precisely the type of person that an authoritarian wants you to be.</p><p>They want you to give up. The easiest way to control a population is to control their information source. But you are not powerless. There is something you can do to fight back against disinformation. That's why I wrote the book.  </p><p>But even before you read the book, I want you to know this: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">the most important step in winning an information war is first to admit that you are in one</emphasis>. [My emphasis added]</p><p>In the end, howling and complaining that \"the other side is not playing fair\" instead of adapting and overcoming is no real defense and a path to defeat.</p><p>Unfortunately for the American people and the future of their democracy and freedom, throughout the long Age of Trump, the Democratic Party, the so-called Resistance, the mainstream news media and other supposed defenders of democracy and \"the institutions\" have not learned and internalized that lesson. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SALON-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SALON2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FX2-55S3-S21W-400T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">243527</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2643\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Salon.com, LLC.

According to news reporting originating from Bogor, Indonesia, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"The Patrol Information System for the Prevention of Forest Land Fires (SIPP Karhutla) in Indonesia is a tool for assisting patrol activities for controlling forest and land fires in Indonesia. The addition of Karhutla SIPP users causes the need for system scalability testing.\" </p><p><br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from IPB University: \"This study aims to perform non-functional testing that focuses on scalability testing. The steps in scalability testing include creating schemas, conducting tests, and analyzing results. There are five schemes with a total sample of 700 samples. Testing was carried out using the JMeter automation testing tool assisted by Blazemeter in creating scripts. The scalability test parameter has three parameters: average CPU usage, memory usage, and network usage. The test results show that the CPU capacity used can handle up to 700 users, while with a memory capacity of 8GB it can handle up to 420 users.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"All users is the user menu that has the highest value for each test parameter The average value of CPU usage is 44.8%, the average memory usage is 69.48% and the average network usage is 2.8 Mb/s. In minimizing server performance, the tile cache map method can be applied to the system and can increase the memory capacity used.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Scalability Testing of Land Forest Fire Patrol Information Systems.

One forest fire near Myrtle Beach has burned upwards of 1,600 acres and is about 30 percent contained now. Residents who were evacuated, they were allowed to be back into their homes Sunday evening. So, some good news there.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Several fires were also reported in North Carolina, threatening some of the areas still recovering from the disaster that was left behind from Hurricane Helene.</p><p>Let's talk about that. Joining me right now is Bobby Arledge. He's the director of the Polk County Emergency Management in North Carolina.</p><p>Thank you so much for taking some time.</p><p>What is the very latest on the fires, on the situation in your county right now?</p><p>BOBBY ARLEDGE, POLK COUNTY, NORTH CAROLINA EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT: Good morning. In Polk County this morning, the fire is 481 acres. We're about 30 percent containment as of this morning.</p><p>BOLDUAN: I've seen that the weather forecast is supposed to improve today kind of by and large. Winds dying down. Cooler temperatures setting in. What's that going to mean for your crews?</p><p>ARLEDGE: It's a big help for our crews, especially with the winds. On the first day of the - the first day of the - of the fire, you know, winds were pushing the fire everywhere. With the winds being calmed down, we're able to get lines in, reinforce lines we've already got, do some back burn operations and, you know, protect structures that are in danger.</p><p>BOLDUAN: Now we're also - as I mentioned, we're also talking about an area that is still recovering from the horrible effects of Hurricane Helene. Now, add all of this now in. I mean, what have these natural disasters done to the region? What have they meant for your county?</p><p>ARLEDGE: This county and this - this area that it hit, it was one of the hardest hit by Helene. The whole county was hit. But this area that we're in, with this fire up here, was - was one of the worst - worst areas impacted by Helene. So, they're still in the midst of cleaning up. You know, we still have damage to structures. We still have people trying to get their lives back together and now we have this. So, it's just - it's heartbreaking for - for us, as emergency responders, for these folks that's still trying to get their lives back together.</p><p>BOLDUAN: I mean are we talking about, you know, people who lost, you know, everything in Hurricane Helene, they're trying to pick up the pieces, trying to, you know, many of them trying to rebuild their homes. I know these are some of the very same homes that are now threatened by these fires?</p><p>ARLEDGE: Some are, yes.</p><p>BOLDUAN: Do - do you have everything - do you have everything you need? Do you need help? How's the - what's the coordination with the state? What about with - from the federal government as well?</p><p>ARLEDGE: State has been great. They've offered, you know, additional fire resources for us. So, they're here on the ground with us working. We've had, you know, tremendous turnout from our mutual aid partners throughout North Carolina and South Carolina. We've got - you know, we've got fire departments from North and South Carolina here working the fire, trying to give some of our local guys a break that were here for the first couple days. So, we've had really good luck, you know, with state partners.</p><p>BOLDUAN: That's great to hear.</p><p>Bobby Arledge, thank you very much for taking the time. Good luck out there.

This study uses attribution analysis to evaluate the contributions of atmospheric circulation patterns and human factors to the heatwave's probability and intensity. The 2023 heatwave is a 1-in-130-year event and a 1-in-65-year event, with and without considering the 2023 heatwave in the fitting, respectively. The large-scale meteorological analysis revealed that the heatwave was driven by an anomalously high-pressure system that formed a heat dome from dry, hot air columns. ALL (all-forcing scenario) and GHG (greenhouse gas scenario) simulations indicate the likelihood of future extreme heatwaves increases by 28.45% [27.60%, 29.30%] (90% confidence interval) and 30.42% [29.51%, 31.33%] (90% confidence interval), respectively, based on data from 1850 to 2014. Insights from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models emphasize that human-induced warming significantly contributes to heatwaves, which highlights the need for effective climate adaptation and mitigation strategies.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>The trends of climate change, variability, and extreme events with severe impacts at global and regional scales are becoming increasingly evident1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\u20137. Specifically, heatwaves are expected to increase in frequency by the end of the 21st century in this region and other parts of the world that have experienced prolonged periods of insufficient precipitation, particularly in SA (including the Amazon Basin, Pantanal wetlands, Argentina, and Uruguay)8. In 2023, the average temperature in South America reached a historic high, exceeding the 1991\u20132020 average by 0.81 \u00b0C (with an anomaly range of 0.75\u20130.96 \u00b0C). Relative to the 1961\u20131990 baseline, the temperature in 2023 was 1.37 \u00b0C higher (with an anomaly range of 1.17\u20131.62 \u00b0C). Due to the influence of the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, the warming trend in the region in 2023 was more pronounced compared to 2022. The period from 1991 to 2023 showed the highest warming trend (~0.2 \u00b0C or more per decade) since 1900 in South America, compared to the previous 30-year periods of 1900\u20131930, 1931\u20131960, and 1961\u201319909. The Amazon, as one of the world's largest biodiversity and carbon reserves, experienced relentless heatwaves in 2023, with many areas experiencing at least 20 more heatwave days than the average from 1991 to 202010. The heatwave affected not only Amazonia\u2014especially southern Amazonia\u2014but also central South America, with higher intensity than in Amazonia. These record-breaking events include unusually hot winters and springs in South America11,12, characterized by their unique intensities, durations, and impacts. These catastrophic heatwaves have led to widespread agricultural droughts, severe wildfires, and accelerated carbon loss from tropical rainforests in South America13, 14, 15, 16, 17\u201318. Climate variability and change-induced heatwaves and droughts severely affect local agriculture, ecosystems, and residents' lives19, 20, 21\u201322. Human influences and climate change have increased the vulnerability of terrestrial ecosystems to extreme climate events and fires, leading to increased heatwave intensity, frequency, and duration23. These trends are expected to worsen with the intensification of global warming24. Understanding regional heatwave trends is crucial for assessing their impacts on biophysical and human systems25. Studies on heatwaves have provided essential scientific insights into their multifaceted impacts on climate, ecology, and socioeconomic systems; in this way, they support the formulation of effective adaptation strategies and boost resilience.</p><p>The increasing frequency of heatwaves and their adverse impacts\u2014particularly on sectors such as agriculture (due to crop stress), public health (through heat-related illnesses), water resources (leading to drought conditions), and energy (increasing demand for cooling)\u2014highlight the mechanisms behind regional heatwave occurrences and their physical processes26. From the perspective of large-scale circulation, heatwaves can be analysed from both thermodynamic and dynamic angles. They are often associated with summer blocking high-pressure systems, which lead to subsidence and clear sky conditions, causing adiabatic warming of the air and allowing radiative warming near the surface27,28. This condition typically results in regional heat domes, which are linked to high-altitude high-pressure systems that prevent the ascent of warm air below, further increasing temperatures29,30. These phenomena are also related to abnormally high-pressure systems, primarily due to enhanced land\u2012sea thermal contrasts and atmospheric teleconnections in response to El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) transitions31, 32, 33\u201334.</p><p>Furthermore, human-induced greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions (and land use changes, such as deforestation) have amplified heatwaves, a trend anticipated to persist in the coming years35, 36\u201337. In summary, the interplay between natural atmospheric circulation fluctuations and external factors can disrupt the Earth's energy balance and water cycle, leading to intensified heatwaves across various timescales and regions38. Accurately quantifying the contributions of different physical processes is essential for comprehending the lifecycle of heatwaves39,40. This includes examining atmospheric dynamics such as horizontal and vertical advection, surface latent and sensible heat fluxes, and radiative factors like solar insolation, surface albedo, temperature, water vapour, clouds, and aerosols41.</p><p>Although many researchers have examined the causes and development of heatwaves, the specific roles of atmospheric circulation and human-induced warming in extreme events are still not fully understood23. While climate models aid in decomposing temperature anomalies into internal and external factors, they often struggle to accurately represent regional internal variability patterns. Consequently, estimating the role of internal atmospheric circulation variability in extreme temperature events via climate models remains a challenge42.</p><p>Given South America\u2019s critical role in the global climate system, climate change attribution research in this region has expanded significantly in recent years, making extensive use of observational data and climate models (e.g., the CMIP series) to examine the causes and influencing factors of extreme events\u2014particularly heatwaves and droughts43, 44, 45\u201346. Researchers often separate natural variability (such as El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation) from anthropogenic factors (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions, land-use changes) to quantify their relative contributions to temperature and precipitation anomalies8,47, 48, 49, 50, 51\u201352. Multiple studies have shown that human activities have markedly intensified the frequency and severity of heatwaves over the past few decades, while land-use changes affecting surface energy balance and hydrological cycles may further exacerbate these extreme events47,53,54. Overall, these attribution studies provide essential scientific insights into the mechanisms driving climate evolution in South America, offering valuable guidance for risk assessment, adaptation strategies, and mitigation measures.</p><p>Given these complexities, this paper aims to explore the following scientific inquiries: (a) How unprecedented was the extreme heatwave in South America in 2023 when viewed in a historical context, particularly from the long-term perspective of 1979 to 2023? (b) What atmospheric conditions were linked to this heatwave? (c) How do atmospheric circulation patterns and human-induced warming impact regional heatwaves in the context of climate change, and what changes in these influences might we anticipate in the future?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Results</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Characteristics of changes in South American heatwaves</emphasis></p><p>The year 2023 was the hottest year on record for SA. The year 2023 was the warmest on record in many parts of the region, which is reflected by the high temperature anomalies at the country level. Station data for 2023 relative to 1991\u20132020, In South America, above-normal temperature anomalies of around +2 \u00b0C, up to +3 \u00b0C in some locations, were observed in central and northern Argentina, the central and southern Andes of Peru, Bolivia, northern Chile and Paraguay, the Peruvian and Bolivian Amazon, and the entire tropical zone of South America, some of them reflecting the heatwaves that affected the region, Negative temperature anomalies of \u20130.5 to \u22121.0 \u00b0C were observed in the extreme south of Argentina and Chile9. This extraordinary heatwave was characterized by three main indicators: HWM, HWL, and HWD, with anomaly values generally exceeding twice the standardized deviation of the 1979\u20132010 climatology (Fig. 1b, c and Supplementary Fig. 1). Additionally, in 2023, an event occurred that was unprecedented in the historical record (Fig. 5 in Supporting Information), i.e., the highest recorded regional average HWL and HWM from 1979 to 2023 (Fig. 1d). The two heatwave indicators were strongly correlated, with Pearson correlation coefficients exceeding 0.89 and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> values &lt; 0.05, and demonstrated notable increasing trends over time. On average, HWL and HWM have risen by 1.2 days and 0.1 \u00b0C per decade. Additionally, the spatial distributions of SAT and heatwave attributes underscored a marked trend of extremely high temperatures in SA. Figure 1e, f show the progression of the 2023 heatwave, where the average SAT for SA was significantly above the climatological mean throughout the spring season. Furthermore, from November 10 to 20, 2023, the SAT anomaly exceeded the 90th percentile of climatological anomalies. Most of the northern and central regions of SA were affected by heatwaves, with areas impacted by high temperatures aligning with the peak in SA's average SAT anomaly in November (Fig. 1e).Fig. 1</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Spatiotemporal features of the 2023 heatwave in SA.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> Population density in SA, highlighted in green. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis> Anomalies in the duration of the longest heatwave event (HWL) in 2023 compared to 1979\u20132010, with stippling for one standard deviation and hatching for two. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis> Anomalies in average heatwave event intensity (HWM) are shown similarly. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis> Historical area-weighted HWL and HWM anomalies from 1979 to 2023 are displayed, including regression lines and Pearson correlation coefficients with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis>-values. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">e</emphasis> Temporal shifts in regions affected by heatwaves in 2023. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">f</emphasis> Progression of area-weighted mean SAT in spring 2023; the black line indicates current SAT, the blue line shows climatological SAT from 1979 to 2010, and the pink line marks extreme high-temperature thresholds based on the 90th percentile for a 5-day range.

The black line represents the FWI for 2023, showing its variation over time. The orange line indicates anomalies in near-surface temperature (T2m_ano), while the green line represents anomalies in vapour pressure deficit (VPD_ano). The blue line depicts the climatological average FWI, with the shaded area indicating one standard deviation to reflect the climatic trend. The purple shaded region marks the periods of wildfire activity, whereas the red area highlights FWI levels associated with high fire risk. Additionally, the top left corner of the graph presents the correlation coefficients and significance levels between the FWI, T2m anomalies, and VPD anomalies.</p><p>In stark contrast to climate model projections, the FWI exhibited anomalous changes in the spring of 2023, varying from September to November, peaking on October 7, then gradually decreasing, with a minor peak occurring on November 19. Under conditions of drought, high temperatures, and low relative humidity, the incidence of wildfire has increased since 2010. Moreover, the daily FWI variations were correlated with changes in the SAT and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) anomalies, with correlation coefficients of 0.64 and 0.56, respectively (Fig. 2).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Atmospheric mechanisms of heatwaves in South America</emphasis></p><p>To statistically estimate the unprecedented nature of the 2023 heatwave in SA, we analysed the spring SAT and three heatwave characteristics via both stationary and nonstationary GEV fits. Compared with those of stationary models, this approach generally yields better results. For most variables, the nonstationary GEV location models were insufficient to capture the nonstationary characteristics of SA temperature changes, except for HWD. Specifically, the SAT anomalies increased significantly at rates of 0.68 and 0.75 with GMST when the 2023 heatwave in SA was considered and not considered (Fig. 3a\u2013b). This intensified warming results from the diverse regional responses of local temperatures to global climate change. The rate of land temperature increase in spring is faster than that in the ocean and therefore faster than the global average55.Fig. 3</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nonstationary statistical estimation of the 2023 heatwave in SA and temperature extremes and return levels analysis for Val de Cans and Viracopos (1950\u20132023).</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> This chart illustrates the relationship between average surface air temperature (SAT) in South America (SA) and smoothed changes in global mean surface temperature (GMST), with red stars marking the 2023 event.

The black dots represent recorded annual maxima, the red line indicates the fitted GEV distribution, and the red dashed lines illustrate the confidence intervals, similar to Fig. 3c. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">f</emphasis> This panel describes the estimated return levels for Viracopos. The reference return levels are highlighted, following the same format as panel (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>), and they include the relevant data and conclusions. Descriptions of the sites can be found in Supplementary Material 3, the verification of the heatwave duration data can be found in Supplementary Fig. 5.</p><p>In the statistical analyses, including or excluding the 2023 heatwave in SA significantly affects the estimated return period. When the 2023 event is excluded. The nonstationary GEV model applied to the observed data suggests that the heatwave is an extremely rare phenomenon, with an estimated occurrence probability of about once in 130 years. Specifically, HWM is expected once every 40 years, while both HWD and HWL occur less frequently than once every 1000 years. However, when the SAT of the 2023 heatwave is included, it is reclassified as a once-in-65-year event (HWD once every 100 years, HWL once every 465 years, and HWM once every 54 years) (Supplementary Fig. 3). These findings underscore that the 2023 heatwave in South America set new records for surface air temperature anomalies and heatwave characteristics. Ignoring this event might result in a substantial overestimation of return periods.</p><p>Based on the analysis of Fig. 3c\u2013f regarding different sites, Val de Cans International (representing the Amazon region) and Viracopos (representing the Southeast region of Brazil) show a significant upward trend in annual maximum temperatures. Notably, extreme temperature events in the Amazon are expected to occur every 252 years, compared to every 1766 years for Viracopos. This indicates that Amazon faces a greater threat from climate change, as its ecosystem is more sensitive to extreme temperature fluctuations, which may lead to increased frequency of forest fires, disruption of ecological balance, and loss of biodiversity. Additionally, the rainfall patterns in the Amazon rainforest could also be affected, exacerbating droughts and extreme weather events, which pose severe risks to local communities' livelihoods and food security. Therefore, the impacts of climate change in the Amazon region are particularly severe and urgent compared to those in Southeast Brazil.</p><p>To investigate the physical mechanisms behind the causes of heatwaves, we explored the climatic conditions and circulation characteristics, Figure 4 shows the climatic conditions and circulation characteristics over SA in 2023, highlighting both horizontal and vertical structures. In 2023, the eastern and central regions of SA experienced suppressed precipitation, resulting in a 13.65% reduction in total annual rainfall compared with the climatological average. This prolonged low precipitation significantly reduced the soil moisture and dried the air, leading to surface warming. Consequently, the regions, except for southern SA, exhibited significantly positive maximum temperature anomalies, averaging 1.33 \u00b0C above the climatological mean (Fig. 4a\u2013b).Fig. 4</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The circulation characteristics of the 2023 heatwave in SA.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> Precipitation anomalies, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis> surface temperature maximum anomalies, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis> water vapour flux and divergence, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis> composite pattern of Z500 (500 hPa geopotential height) and UV850 (850 hPa wind anomalies).

A significant area of water vapour divergence was observed in central and eastern SA (Fig. 4c). Figure 4e illustrates the cross-sectional view of the geopotential height in a vertical-meridional orientation across SA, which is typically marked by substantial positive geopotential height anomalies. This \"dome\" structure is centred in the mid-to-upper troposphere, spanning the 100\u2013150 hPa pressure levels. The South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ) and the South American Low-Level Jet (SALLJ) play vital roles in the development of spring heatwaves in South America56. An active SACZ can lead to subsidence and anticyclonic circulation primarily over southeastern Brazil and nearby areas during specific periods, resulting in higher temperatures57. Increased (decreased) convection in the SACZ is associated with a weakened (strengthened) SALLJ.</p><p>Moreover, Fig. 4f presents a notable column of positive temperature anomalies spanning from 200 to 1000 hPa over South America (SA), with a warming center emerging at higher altitudes between 20\u00b0S and 30\u00b0S. This pattern suggests the presence of a high-pressure system (500 hPa) between 20\u00b0S and 30\u00b0S, as indicated in Fig. 4d, and a reduction in relative humidity at ~10\u00b0S, expanding the thermal dome (Fig. 4g). This is because heatwaves increase atmospheric temperatures, thereby increasing the capacity of air to hold more water vapour.</p><p>Interannual variability also plays a role in the formation of heat waves in South America. The El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a major factor influencing interannual variability in global weather patterns58. The ENSO cycle has a substantial effect on surface temperature anomalies59. Against the backdrop of global warming, atmospheric anomalies induced by El Ni\u00f1o events have intensified60. Extreme El Ni\u00f1o events cause accelerated warming of the equatorial Pacific, especially in the eastern part, leading to extreme equatorial swings in the Pacific convergence zone, which exacerbates continental warming58.</p><p>In atmospheric dynamics, wave activity flux is commonly used to diagnose the propagation of Rossby waves. Wave activity flux can be employed to analyse how synoptic-scale transient waves regulate stationary waves over a period, diagnose the evolution characteristics of wave activity during a weather event, and examine the three-dimensional propagation characteristics of stationary Rossby waves. The T-N wave activity flux is an improvement over the Plumb wave flux, with an enhanced meridional component. This enhancement allows for a better description of large-amplitude Rossby longwave disturbances in the westerlies within zonally nonuniform airflow.</p><p>From the vector changes in wave activity flux, it is evident that the heatwave is consistently accompanied by the presence of an Atlantic blocking high. Thermal forcing is a crucial factor in the formation of blocking highs. In the plumb flux, blocking highs form over the Pacific, whereas in the southwestern Pacific and central SA, blocking highs develop and cross the Andes Mountains. On the eastern side of the Andes, an extreme heat dome forms, trapping the generated heat in the atmosphere and thus leading to the accumulation of heatwaves and further increases in temperature (Fig. 5).Fig. 5</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Analysis of atmospheric wave flux and height field in the Southern Hemisphere (300 hPa).</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> T-N wave activity flux and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis> plumb wave activity flux.</p><p>From the analysis of surface maximum temperature anomalies and climate factors. Figure 6a shows that the anomaly distributions across all periods are roughly normally distributed. The shift of the red line (1985\u20132023) to the right compared with the blue line (1950\u20131984) indicates an increase in temperature anomalies. During the heatwaves from November 15 to 21, 2023, the temperature anomalies were above historical averages, indicating a significant recent rise in temperature and suggesting that extreme temperature events may have become more frequent. Figure 6b reveals an overall increasing trend in the temperature anomalies. The linear trend line (black dashed line) indicates a rising trend in the temperature anomalies. From 1950 to 1984 (blue line), the temperature anomalies were relatively stable with little change. However, from 1985 to 2023 (red line), the temperature anomalies increased significantly, indicating a stronger warming trend. The grey line illustrates the volatility of temperature anomalies, with particularly greater fluctuations in recent times. Figure 6c and d demonstrate that surface temperature anomalies in northern and central SA are positively correlated with NINO3, whereas those in most northern and central regions are negatively correlated with the Southern Oscillation (SO). This finding suggests that El Ni\u00f1o events significantly affect surface temperatures across much of SA, whereas the SO may either counteract or create a negative feedback effect on surface temperatures.Fig. 6</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Correlation analysis of surface maximum temperature anomaly trends with climate indices.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> The frequency distribution of the climatological 6-day running mean sequence of SON T2m anomalies in SA is illustrated.

Carbon dioxide emissions from human activities are a major greenhouse gas that acts as a blanket over the Earth, trapping more solar heat near the surface. Compared with the randomness of natural variability, studies have indicated that human activities significantly increase the likelihood of record-breaking heatwave events. Global warming increases background temperatures, increasing the likelihood of extremely high-temperature events, which have significantly increased in SA over recent decades19,53.</p><p>Figure 7 shows climate change trends and the significance of signal detection under different emission scenarios. In Fig. 7a, the trends in surface maximum temperature anomalies under various emission scenarios are shown. The picontrol (grey line) represents preindustrial control simulations used to assess natural variability in the climate system without human interference, showing inherent natural variability trends towards stability. The surface maximum temperature trends in the SSP585 (red line) and SSP126 (blue line) scenarios reflect the potential impacts of different socioeconomic development paths on climate change. The high-emission scenario (SSP585) shows a significant temperature increase trend, whereas the low-emission scenario (SSP126) depicts a more moderate increase, highlighting the importance of emission reduction in mitigating climate change. Figure 7b shows the changes in the maximum temperature trends based on the natural baseline period from 2000 to 2015. CTL denotes the control scenario, which remains relatively stable, indicating natural variability fluctuations without human influence. OBS represents the observed trend of surface maximum temperature changes, and FP indicates the high emission change trend, especially in the latter half of the 21st century, where maximum temperatures will rise dramatically under high emission scenarios. Figure 7c displays the changes in the amplitude <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03b2</emphasis> of the spatiotemporal fingerprint, which is used to identify and quantify the strength and detection time of climate change signals. The red line indicates the amplitude of the climate change signal, whereas the grey shading represents the uncertainty range. The <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03b2</emphasis> value reached the detection threshold at ~2055, indicating a significant climate change signal. As time progresses, the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03b2</emphasis> value continues to rise, indicating that the climate signal gradually intensifies. Figure 7d shows the residual consistency test, which was analysed via the total least-squares (TLS) regression method. The AS03 testing method is adopted for consistency testing. The results indicate that after 2020, the model achieves high accuracy and consistency in simulating climate change, owing to the low p-values.Fig. 7</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate change trends and signal detection significance under different emission scenarios.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> Time series data of daily maximum surface temperatures from 1850 to 2100.

The PDF is estimated via kernel smoothing functions. Figure 8a shows the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">T</emphasis>max anomaly PDFs simulated for ALL (HIST), NAT (HIST), GHG (HIST), and AER (HIST) from 1951 to 2020, as well as for ALL (SSP245), NAT (SSP245), GHG (SSP245), and AER (SSP245) from 2021 to 2100. On the basis of a two-sided Kolmogorov test, there is no significant difference at the 0.05 level between the observed and ALL-simulated PDFs for 1951\u20132020. This finding indicates that the CMIP6 model can effectively simulate the PDFs of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">T</emphasis>max anomalies in SA during this period. In Fig. 8a, the black dashed line represents the observed <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">T</emphasis>max anomaly in SA in 2023. The area enclosed between the dashed line and the distributions of the PDFs reflects the probability of such extreme events occurring under different external forcings. In Fig. 8b, both two-signal and three-signal analyses demonstrate the dominant role of anthropogenic factors in recent extreme heat events. The three-signal approach further reveals that greenhouse gas emissions have a more pronounced impact on maximum temperatures, while the cooling effect of aerosols partially offsets the warming trend. Although natural factors contribute to high-temperature events, their influence is relatively smaller compared to anthropogenic forcings and is associated with greater uncertainty. Human influence on heatwaves, such as increased greenhouse gas concentrations, has increased the likelihood of warming events. Compared with those from 1951 to 2020, the PDFs for the ALL and GHG simulations exhibit a more pronounced rightward shift from 2021 to 2100. Under the ALL and GHG simulations, the future probabilities of such extreme events increased by 28.45% and 30.42%, respectively.

This analysis included the calculation of the probability ratios (PRs) of these extreme events and the fraction of attributable risk (FAR), both within the 95% confidence interval, as observed during the 2023 heatwave.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Discussion</emphasis></p><p>This paper presents an examination of the unprecedented 2023 heatwave in SA, emphasizing its extreme features in terms of duration, intensity, and effects (refer to Fig. 1). Heatwaves have significant consequences for ecosystems and human societies. The stable analysis of spring SAT indicates that when considering or not considering the 2023 heatwave in SA via statistical simulations, it is regarded as a once-in-every-65-year or once-in-every-130-year event, respectively (Fig. 3). Ignoring the 2023 heatwave may lead to a severe overestimation of its recurrence period, undermining accurate risk assessments and precise predictions related to climate risks. Importantly, owing to the short observation period, the choice of statistical distribution models, and the extreme nature of the event, these recurrence periods may be significantly exaggerated. Therefore, we recommend the use of long-term observational and assimilated data to thoroughly understand the physical mechanisms behind extreme climate events to reliably estimate their recurrence periods.</p><p>From the perspective of weather behaviour and the broader climate context, the 2023 heatwave in SA was largely driven by a high-pressure system (Fig. 4d), which facilitated descending air movements in its central area, resulting in the formation of a heat dome. During the downward movement of the air, anticyclone interactions and adiabatic heating led to atmospheric warming. The stronger the heat dome is, the higher the near-surface temperature62,63. On the other hand, a lower water vapour flux resulted in fewer clouds and less precipitation, increasing the amount of solar radiation at the surface. The divergence of water vapour (positive divergence) leads to dry weather conditions, exacerbating the intensity and duration of heatwaves64. This heatwave was also influenced by the terrain; on the eastern side of the Andes, the descending air transformed into hot, dry winds, creating the Foehn effect. The westerlies were blocked by the Andes, preventing Atlantic moisture from reaching the Brazilian and Patagonian plateaus, which intensified the heatwave65.</p><p>Interannual variability in the mechanisms of SA heatwaves also contributed to their development. The ENSO significantly influences global weather pattern variability57. Circulation anomalies, which are part of extensive Rossby wave trains across the South Pacific, are linked to convective irregularities in the equatorial western and central Pacific. Furthermore, the subsiding conditions encouraged by the SACZ within the subtropical anticyclonic circulation intensified warming in subtropical areas experiencing relatively dry conditions31. Subsiding in the southwesterly low-level jet (SALLJEX) and non-adiabatic warming caused temperatures to rise in the subtropical regions of South America56. During the heatwave event, northerly winds prevailed in regions surrounded by eastern Argentina, Paraguay, southern Brazil, and Uruguay. These north winds were promoted by frontal systems advancing towards the equator from higher latitudes, predominantly raising temperatures to extreme levels through advection processes. The heatwave was accompanied by increased solar radiation and reduced precipitation, specific humidity, and cloud cover. The timing of heatwaves is correlated with atmospheric circulation anomalies, which often present as abnormal high-pressure systems66. The heat dome, which is an anomalous high-pressure system, led to significant temperature increases. Extreme high temperatures are also linked to soil moisture deficits, where land\u2012atmosphere feedback could amplify heatwaves, particularly as warming climates favour the occurrence of heatwaves42,67, 68\u201369.</p><p>The heatwave in South America in 2023 resulted from a combination of factors, including the strengthening of high-pressure systems, the impact of severe drought, and the influence of El Ni\u00f1o. The high-pressure systems led to stable weather conditions, suppressing cloud formation and causing ground temperatures to rise abnormally70. Simultaneously, the drought exacerbated soil moisture evaporation, further increasing temperatures and creating a feedback loop. Additionally, the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon contributed to warmer sea surface temperatures in the Pacific, which can alter weather patterns across South America and intensify heat events71. This heatwave is closely linked to global climate change, as the rise in greenhouse gases likely makes extreme heat events more frequent and intense. Consequently, this heatwave not only significantly affected ecosystems and agricultural production but also highlights the serious challenges posed by climate change and El Ni\u00f1o, underscoring the need for greater attention and research on the interactions between heatwaves and other meteorological phenomena.</p><p>By integrating the heatwave maps (Fig. 1b, c) with the anomalies of sensible and latent heat flux presented in the supplementary materials (Fig. 3a, b), we can gain in-depth insights into the mechanisms of climate change in South America. The anomalies in sensible heat flux (HWL) reveal positive regions, particularly in the northern and central areas, indicating an increase in heat accumulation that may lead to more frequent heatwave events. This significant rise in heat in these areas contributes to elevated surface temperatures and exacerbates drought conditions, which in turn affect vegetation moisture status and ecosystem health. Furthermore, the anomalies in latent heat flux (HWM) highlight variations in evaporation and transpiration, especially in negative anomaly regions, suggesting a link between reduced precipitation and insufficient water evaporation. This disruption of the hydrological cycle exacerbates climate instability, resulting in soil drought and decreased ecological resilience. Overall, these interactions create a negative feedback loop of climate change, potentially leading to a significant increase in the frequency and intensity of heat waves.</p><p>We will continue to track El Ni\u00f1o events and their effects on regional climates and implement suitable strategies to address their challenges, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing climate adaptability and resilience. These initiatives aim to alleviate the effects of El Ni\u00f1o events on the global climate and ecosystem, safeguarding both human and environmental health. CMIP6 climate models suggest that greenhouse gases significantly contribute to the increase in daily maximum temperatures in SA, both historically and in the future. However, these models are not specifically designed to simulate individual heatwave events in SA. According to the ALL and GHG simulations, the likelihood of future extreme heatwave occurrence increases by 28.45% (confidence interval [27.60%, 29.30%]) and 30.42% (confidence interval [29.51%, 31.33%]), respectively. Regional and short-term climate changes, including heatwaves, require greater focus and research.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methods</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Definition, characteristics, and statistical methods of heatwaves</emphasis></p><p>To gain a thorough understanding of heatwave activity, this study utilizes data from the fifth-generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis (ERA5) dataset72. The analysis focuses on heatwaves that primarily occurred during spring of 2023, covering the period from September to November from 1979 to 2023. During heatwave events, surface air temperature (SAT) is represented by the temperature at 2 m above ground level (T2m). This study identifies several key characteristics of heatwaves, including the yearly count of heatwave days (HWD, days), the length of the longest event each year (HWL, days), and the mean intensity of all events annually (HWM, \u00b0C). The HWD is determined for each grid point as the number of days when the maximum temperature (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">T</emphasis>max) exceeds the 90th percentile threshold for that specific day of the year, which is based on a 5-day window from the 1979 to 2010 baseline, Among these metrics, heatwave intensity (HWM) is defined as the average daily maximum temperature over the heatwave period, effectively capturing the event\u2019s overall severity and enabling straightforward comparisons across different heatwaves. The HWL and HWM are then statistically analysed on the basis of the identified HWD11.</p><p>During the 2023 heatwave in South America, extensive wildfires occurred, marking a year of intense wildfire activity across the region9. The combination of El Ni\u00f1o events and climate warming created conditions for fires to spread uncontrollably73. According to the European Forest Fire Information System, the FWI is divided into six risk levels: very low (FWI &lt; 5.2), low (5.2 &lt; FWI &lt; 11.2), moderate (11.2 &lt; FWI &lt; 21.3), high (21.3 &lt; FWI &lt; 38.0), very high (38.0 &lt; FWI &lt; 50.0), and extreme (FWI &gt; 50.0)74.</p><p>Global temperature increases cause atmospheric thermal expansion, triggering circulation changes that affect regional climates75. Temperature fluctuations play a role in the occurrence of extreme events. The influence of changes in these circulation patterns on the probability of extreme temperatures is studied by examining the dynamic and thermodynamic impacts of global warming to assess the likelihood of extremely high-temperature events28.</p><p>To investigate the atmospheric circulation characteristics of the 2023 heatwave in SA, composite anomalies of relevant atmospheric variables are computed to discern weather patterns and circulation dynamics. The analysed variables include precipitation, maximum surface temperature, water vapour flux and divergence, temperature (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">T</emphasis>), geopotential height (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Z</emphasis>), sea-level pressure (SLP), and relative humidity. Climate anomalies are determined by contrasting the original measurements with climatological averages from 1979 to 2010. The impact of human-induced forcing on SAT changes can be assessed via climate model simulations from the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6)42,50, which evaluate observed and simulated temperature trends under various forcings, the results of detection and attribution studies, and observationally constrained future projections. This approach provides deeper insights into the mechanisms and uncertainties of anthropogenic climate change.</p><p>Variations in global mean surface temperature (GMST) anomalies effectively capture the changing nature of local temperature patterns76,77. This dynamic approach considers the location parameter of the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution as dependent on the GMST, while the scale (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03c3</emphasis>) and shape (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03b5</emphasis>) parameters are assumed to be constant. To ensure that the increasing variability in the SAT with changes in the GMST does not affect the nonstationary model fit, this study allows both location and scale parameters to be adjusted in relation to the GMST covariate. We apply three nonstationary GEV models to investigate the nonstationarity of the SAT and alterations in heatwave characteristics. The GEV distribution is commonly used to model hydrometeorological extremes, and combining models that have shape parameters dependent on climate indices with time-dependent scale parameters can significantly improve the goodness of fit78.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nonstationary frequency analysis</emphasis></p><p>This study employs a nonstationary frequency analysis method. Given that heatwaves are considered extreme climate events with distinct characteristics, influenced by both natural and human activities, it is crucial to consider these nonstationary factors for accurate future climate predictions79,80. We adopt a nonstationary generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution to model surface air temperature (SAT) and heatwave characteristics (HMD, HWL, HWM). Previous studies have shown that GEV can accommodate changes in the location parameter (\u03bc) in response to anomalies in global mean surface temperature (GMST)76,77.</p><p>We utilize the location parameter (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03bc</emphasis>) and scale parameter to model the impact of GMST on local SAT. To characterize the nonstationarity of heatwaves, we employ four methods: a traditional stationary model and three nonstationary models.</p><p>Stationary GEV model: In this model, the parameters <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03bc</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03c3</emphasis>, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03b5</emphasis> remain constant.</p><p>Nonstationary GEV location model: Here, the location parameter <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03bc</emphasis> is permitted to change linearly with GMST, while the parameters <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03c3</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03b5</emphasis> are held constant.</p><p>Nonstationary GEV scale model: In this case, the scale parameter <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03c3</emphasis> varies linearly with GMST, while the location and shape parameters (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03bc</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03b5</emphasis>) remain constant.</p><p>Nonstationary GEV location and scale model: This model accommodates changes in both \u03bc and \u03c3 concerning GMST, with the shape parameter \u03b5 held constant.</p><p>To evaluate the effectiveness of each GEV model, we apply the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), defined by the formula AIC = 2<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis>\u22122 ln(<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L</emphasis>'), where <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis> denotes the number of parameters being estimated, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L</emphasis>' is the maximum likelihood for the respective model. We assess the uncertainties associated with the nonstationary frequency analyses, computing a range from 5% to 95% using 1000 bootstrap samples. In light of the infrequency of events akin to the 2023 South America heatwave, we also examine earlier instances within the same period. This analysis considers the outcomes both when including and excluding the 2022 South America heatwave in the GEV fitting procedure, with temperature data illustrated in Fig. 3, and heatwave characteristics depicted in the Supporting Information.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Optimal fingerprint method</emphasis></p><p>Detection and attribution methods are employed to determine the causes of climate change76,81,82. These methods depend on climate models to precisely replicate the physical processes within the climate system. Optimal fingerprinting is applied via generalized multivariable linear regression, where the observations (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Y</emphasis>) are regressed against multimodal parallel signal patterns (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">X</emphasis>), represented as . In this equation, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03b2</emphasis> denotes the scaling factor or regression coefficient, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03bd</emphasis> accounts for residual internal variability from <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">X</emphasis>, and  is the residual, representing internal variation. To derive scaling factors, the total least squares (TLS) method is utilized, employing regularized instead of empirical covariance estimates. A forced response is identified at a 5% significance level if the 90% confidence interval of the scaling factors does not include zero. If the detected signal\u2019s 90% interval includes unity, the observed and externally forced signals are considered consistent. For analysis, both single and dual-signal methods are employed. In single-signal analysis, observations are regressed onto a single factor (including ALL and ANT) multimodal mean to estimate the ALL signal. The ANT signal is inferred from the difference between the ALL and NAT signals. This method uses available data to estimate ALL and NAT signals, although changes can represent all modes. Alternatively, models generated by the ALL and NAT signals simplify the process and reduce the number of simulations. Consistency in detection outcomes is indicated. In dual-signal analysis, observations are regressed simultaneously onto ALL and NAT responses, with their scaling factors transformed linearly to evaluate the relative contributions of natural forcings (NATs) and anthropogenic forcings (ANTs) to the observed data. This method determines whether ANT and NAT signals are distinct and separates the effects of ANT forcings from NAT signals and inherent system variability83,84.</p><p>The probability ratio (PR) and fraction of attributable risk (FAR) were defined by Fischer and Knutti85. These metrics are employed to compare event probabilities between counterfactual natural scenarios (from simulations excluding human influence) and factual scenarios (including human influences). PR measures how much human impact alters the probability of an event, whereas FAR estimates the portion of an event's occurrence due to human activities2. Uncertainties in PR and FAR are determined with the bootstrap confidence interval method, with median values providing the best estimates.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 42305184), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2024M752693), and the \u201cTianchi Talents\u201d Plans of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><p>[1].Domeisen, DIV.

(Photo courtesy of the N.H. Forest Protection Bureau)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 2024, New Hampshire wildfire numbers climbed 24%, burning nearly double the acres compared to 2023, according to the state Department of Natural and Cultural Resources. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rapidly changing weather conditions in the fall brought about the bump, said Chief Steven Sherman, head of the state's Forest Protection Bureau. The flames threatened 37 structures and destroyed four, the department said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">#8216;We had really dry, low relative humidity conditions, and the forest fuels just dried out so quick that we ended up with a lot of acres in the fall,#8217; Sherman said, #8216;which isn't completely unheard of, but last year was just the way everything changed so quick, I think, is what was surprising to everybody.#8217;</p><p>With Gov. Kelly Ayotte declaring this week Wildfire Awareness Week, it's a reminder of the dangers the fires pose in New England, where wildfire risk is considered relatively low. While the flames can bring destruction, the smoke alone can cause serious health problems, even for residents far from the site of the fire. Granite Staters experienced this up close in 2023 when <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.des.nh.gov/news-and-media/blog/summer-2023-marked-canadian-wildfire-smoke\">Canadian wildfire smoke prompted air quality concerns in the state. </url></p><p>Changes in the climate, driven by human use of fossil fuels, are creating the warmer, drier conditions in which wildfires thrive, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.noaa.gov/noaa-wildfire/wildfire-climate-connection\">scientists say. </url></p><p>#8216;I think it's a really fair expectation that one of the most widely experienced impacts of global warming will be reductions in air quality from wildfire,#8217; said Justin S. Mankin, an associate professor in Dartmouth's Department of Geography.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://newhampshirebulletin.com/centennial-fire-heading-uphill-white-mtn-national-forest-shelburne-nh-may-2022/\"> The Centennial Fire burns in the White Mountain National Forest in May 2022. (Photo courtesy of the N.H. Forest Protection Bureau)</url></p><p>#8216;There's been a lot of compelling science that has shown that the particulate matter \u2014 so these are little, little aerosols from burned fuels \u2014 that can then get mobilized throughout the atmosphere, carried extremely long distances, thousands of kilometers, deposited elsewhere, and affect the air quality of people very far away from from the wildfires,#8217; he said. #8216; And it poses some, you know, real cardiovascular and pulmonary issues, particularly for people that have pre-existing conditions of some kind, or for the young as well.#8217;</p><p>Though 2024 saw higher activity, Sherman said the number of wildfires in the state has remained consistent, with the average sitting at over 200 fires a year and between 220 and 250 acres burned. </p><p>#8216;Really, what we're seeing happen more often now is that we just have these extreme shifts in weather,#8217; Sherman said. Even with rain in the state so far this spring, he said, #8216;conditions can change just so rapidly, where before we get into green up, we'll probably have a period here, it looks like we might be entering one, where we're going to have those lower relative humidities, and conditions will just change very rapidly.#8217;</p><p>Sherman attributed the #8216;quicker shifts in extreme weather#8217; to the impacts of climate change. He said those shifts are the biggest change he's seen since he started doing this work in the late 1990s. He also noted the impact of lower snowpack in the winter.</p><p>#8216;It used to be more common that your snowpack would get you out of that drought situation with the slow melt in the spring, and you'd go into a nice, lush spring,#8217; Sherman said. #8216;And this year, you can still look at the drought monitor and see that that drought in the southern part of New Hampshire is still hanging on.#8217;</p><p>Mankin said the #8216;ingredients for wildfire#8217; are fairly straightforward: fuel, ignition, and a way for the fire to spread.</p><p>#8216;The way climate change is really most saliently impacting wildfire risk is by altering the fuel loadings on the ground and kind of creating the conditions that give the wildfire time to spread, #8216; Mankin said, #8216; so often by altering precipitation patterns, because it's really precipitation that puts out wildfires.#8217;</p><p>Mankin emphasized that wildfires are #8216;an essential and natural part of ecosystems,#8217; and an #8216;important sign of ecosystem health.#8217;</p><p>New England in general has historically been described as #8216;the asbestos forest, meaning it took a lot to get it to burn,#8217; said Steven Roberge, a professor of natural resources and the state specialist of forest resources for the University of New Hampshire Extension. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://newhampshirebulletin.com/nh-forest-ranger-uses-a-drip-torch-at-a-prescribed-fire-nh-forest-protection-bureau/\"> A New Hampshire forest ranger works on a prescribed fire. (Photo courtesy of the N.H. Forest Protection Bureau)</url></p><p>But there are forest types and ecosystems in the region that rely on periodic burning, #8216;historically, either by Indigenous people or just natural events like lightning strikes and things like that,#8217; Roberge said. Prescribed fires \u2014 carefully planned, managed fires set for a purpose \u2014 are used as management tools today, but #8216;I think most folks who do prescribed fire would probably tell you that they don't have a chance to do it enough,#8217; Roberge said.</p><p>The Northeast is full of fuel for wildfires, and #8216;it likely has a wildfire deficit owing to the way we've managed wildlands in the Northeast and our kind of history of fire suppression,#8217; Mankin said. #8216;And at some point, that deficit will likely be recouped by the climate system and by those ecosystems.#8217;</p><p>The changing conditions raise questions about the status quo of management practices. </p><p>#8216;I think the risk is increasing, and I think we need to be prepared for that,#8217; Mankin said. #8216;You know, to the extent that we are acclimatized to the status quo, the status quo is no longer right, and to the extent that we are adapted to a wildfire regime that we had, that regime is no longer, and so that requires a real careful interrogation of current practices and how they should be altered to accommodate a rapidly changing climate system.#8217;</p><p>To monitor the fires, each town has a forest fire warden appointed by the state, Sherman said. Local fire departments are the first to respond to the fires, with the state there to offer support, he said. And each day, working in conjunction with the National Weather Service, the state puts out an updated fire risk. </p><p>If a wildfire starts in the state, the response is 100% suppression, Sherman said. But about two to three times a year, the state will do a prescribed fire. These fires follow detailed burn plans, and are done under #8216;very strict guidelines,#8217; he said. </p><p>The White Mountain National Forest runs its own program and does significantly more burning than the state. But #8216;in the past few years, we've actually hired a prescribed fire coordinator, so we're building up our capacity more,#8217; Sherman said.</p><p>Spring is the start of wildfire season, prompting the awareness week in late April. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/wildfire-causes-and-evaluation.htm\">Research shows that the vast majority of wildfires are caused by humans. </url></p><p>Residents need to obtain fire permits for any outside burning, such as bonfires, Sherman said. Additionally, they should be aware of weather conditions and avoid burning on hot, windy, dry days, he said. And it's vital to extinguish fires completely; #8216;that means stirring it up, putting water, stirring it up again, and doing that until it's out cold,#8217; Sherman said. </p><p>The department also recommends residents clear pine needles and leaves from gutters and roofs, as well as keeping wildfire fuel (such as twigs, branches, firewood, shrubs, or other flammable materials) at least 5 feet away from buildings. </p><p>While wildfire risk in New England is considered relatively low, #8216;these hazards are experienced locally and need to be managed locally,#8217; Mankin said. </p><p>#8216;It's hard to kind of get wildfire intensities that look anything like the American West, but we are not invulnerable to it,#8217; Mankin said, #8216;and I think this last year and the last several years have actually really been salient examples of that.#8217; </p><p>The most obvious way to mitigate these risks, Mankin said, #8216;is decoupling human well-being from carbon emissions, which means, you know, investing in the energy transition and the decarbonization of our economy away from this ancient, fossilized way of sourcing energy. That will prevent future climate change, which alters the risks of wildfire massively.#8217; </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://newhampshirebulletin.com/prescribed-fire-nh-forest-protection-bureau/\"> Prescribed fires are set for a purpose and carefully planned.

Both trends are aided by rapid warming in the high northern latitudes, which is happening twice as fast as the global average.</p><p>The study reveals a worrying increase in not only the extent of forest wildfires over the last two decades, but also their severity. The carbon combustion rate, a measure of fire severity based on how much carbon is emitted per unit of area burned, increased by almost 50% across forests globally between 2001 and 2023.</p><p>The work involved an international team of scientists - from the UK, the Netherlands, US, Brazil, and Spain - who warn that further expansion of forest fires can only be averted if the primary causes of climate change, such as fossil fuel emissions, are tackled.</p><p>Lead author Dr Matthew Jones, of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at UEA, said: \"Increases in both the extent and severity of forest fires have led to a dramatic rise in the amount of carbon emitted by forest fires globally. Startling shifts in the global geography of fires are also underway, and they are primarily explained by the growing impacts of climate change in the world's boreal forests.</p><p>\"To protect critical forest ecosystems from the accelerating threat of wildfires, we must keep global warming at bay and this underscores why it is so vital to make rapid progress towards net zero emissions.\"</p><p>Threats to carbon storage</p><p>Forests are of worldwide importance for carbon storage, with their growth helping to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and reduce rates of global warming. They also play a crucial role in meeting international climate targets, with reforestation and afforestation schemes being implemented to remove carbon from the atmosphere and offset human CO2 emissions from hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and certain industries.</p><p>The success of these schemes relies on carbon being stored in forests permanently, and wildfires threaten that. Extratropical fires are already emitting half a billion tonnes more CO2 than two decades ago, and the long-term effect depends on how forests recover. More widespread and severe forest fires are a sign that emissions are now out of balance with the carbon captured by post-fire recovery.</p><p>Dr Jones, a NERC Independent Research Fellow, said: \"The steep trend towards greater extratropical forest fire emissions is a warning of the growing vulnerability of forests and it poses a significant challenge for global targets to tackle climate change.</p><p>\"We know that forests rebound poorly after the most severe fires, so there is huge interest in how the observed increases in fire severity will influence carbon storage in forests over the coming decades. This demands our close attention.\"</p><p>Escalating wildfire impacts masked until now</p><p>Significantly, the increased emissions from forest fires contrasts with the reduced burning of the world's tropical savannahs during the same period. Previous studies have shown that, since 2001, the area burned by all fires (forest and non-forest) fell by a quarter globally, mainly due to this.</p><p>The latest findings are important because forest fires burn more severely and release larger amounts of harmful smoke to the atmosphere than savannah grassland fires, presenting major threats to those living near fires and to more distant communities exposed to poor air quality caused by smoke.</p><p>The authors say the study debunks the narrative that falling overall annual area burned by fire globally means falling wildfire impact.</p><p>\"Until now, reduced burning in the already fire-prone savannahs and grasslands has masked increases in forest fire extent and severity that are hugely consequential for society and the environment,\" said Dr Jones. \"Our work shows that fires are increasingly happening where we don't want them to - in forests, where they present the greatest threat to people and to vital carbon stores.\"</p><p>Managing wildfires</p><p>Machine learning was key to unlocking new observations about the shifting global geography of forest fires. It was used to group the world's forest ecoregions into 12 distinct pyromes, allowing the researchers to isolate the effects of climate change from other influencing factors such as land use.</p><p>This knowledge also reveals new insights into which strategies can be most effective for mitigating wildfires and protecting forests. Dr Jones said: \"Substantial financing is required to support strategic programs of forest management, stakeholder engagement, and public education, all of which represent a meaningful shift of fire management strategy from largely reactive to increasingly proactive.</p><p>\"For example, priority areas for forest management and fire breaks must be defined based on proactive monitoring of forest productivity, particularly in the extratropics. Managing fuel loads in places where they could present greatest danger during fire-favourable weather is a key priority for limiting the severity and impact of fires when they do occur\".</p><p>The work was supported by funders including the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), European Commission Horizon 2020 programme, and European Space Agency.</p><p>'Global rise in forest fire emissions linked to climate change in the extratropics', Matthew W Jones et al, is published online in Science on October 17.</p><p>* * *</p><p>JOURNAL: Science <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adl5889\">https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adl5889</url></p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.uea.ac.uk/about/news/article/global-co2-emissions-from-forest-fires-increase-by-60-per-cent\">https://www.uea.ac.uk/about/news/article/global-co2-emissions-from-forest-fires-increase-by-60-per-cent</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-8884707 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8884707</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D74-80J1-JC11-149B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1129\"/><timeReceived>9:02 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"10\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>October 19, 2024 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The study, which modeled cholera transmission after interventions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), highlights how long-term strategies like improving access to clean water and sanitary infrastructure could be particularly effective in locations where cholera is endemic due to the contribution of an environmental reservoir.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A paper describing the research, led by researchers at Penn State, was published in the journal PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases.</p><p>\"When conducting interventions for an infectious disease, public health officials must decide how to allocate resources and prioritize strategies that will have the most impact,\" said Alexandre Blake, first author of the paper, who completed the work when he was a postdoctoral researcher in biology in the Penn State Eberly College of Science and the Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics (CIDD). \"We are particularly interested in how to allocate resources in endemic situations. If an epidemic is like a forest fire, with transmission burning intensely before coming to a stop, then an endemic disease is more like a slow burn, with transmission constantly in the background with occasional flare ups. We used statistical modeling to better understand cholera transmission in the city of Kalemie in the DRC, where it is endemic. We specifically focused on the two years following a series of interventions to evaluate the impact of those interventions.\"</p><p>Cholera is a bacterial disease that can be transmitted when the bacteria are ingested. The disease can cause severe diarrhea, which can potentially contaminate water sources with the disease-causing bacteria and lead to increased transmission, especially in areas with poor sanitation or limited infrastructure to treat drinking water. Although many people who become infected have no symptoms or mild symptoms, symptomatic cases of cholera can progress quickly, leading to severe dehydration that can be fatal. One study estimated that 1.3 million to 4 million cholera cases worldwide cause between 21,000 and 143,000 deaths each year. The Global Task Force on Cholera Control has created a road map to eliminate cholera in 20 countries by 2030, particularly targeting sub-Saharan Africa, where cholera has been endemic since the early 1970s.</p><p>Interventions for cholera often include vaccination, which can be rapidly implemented, as well as water, sanitation and hygiene improvements, collectively called WASH. Large scale WASH strategies, such as improving infrastructure for sanitation and access to clean water, are more expensive and take months to years to implement.</p><p>\"We know that WASH and vaccination are great tools to prevent cholera,\" Blake said. \"But the impact of vaccination has largely been studied in epidemic situations as a rapid response. WASH is slow and costly to implement which makes it hard to accomplish in low-income settings. To eliminate cholera, we need to better understand the many factors that drive transmission as well as the impact of different interventions in endemic settings.\"</p><p>From late 2013 to early 2016, Doctors Without Borders led intervention efforts in Kalemie, including vaccination and WASH efforts. WASH efforts focused on improving access to clean water, for example by installing pipes, water reservoirs and public drinking fountains, as well as distributing water filters and, during outbreaks, chlorinating drinking water to kill bacteria.</p><p>The researchers built several statistical models to determine which combination of factors best explained cholera transmission during this period. They used satellite images of light at night to track seasonal occupancy of the city, which impacts the number of people in the area capable of becoming infected with or transmitting the bacteria. They also included rainfall and other environmental variables that might impact the bacteria's ability to survive in the nearby lake and infect more people.</p><p>Although the researchers did not find much impact of the seasonal movement of people in Kalemie, they did find that a large portion of transmission resulted from the environment, likely because the lake acts as a reservoir for the cholera bacteria.</p><p>\"Because the bacteria persist in the lake, some residents of the city may have opportunities to be regularly exposed and may ultimately develop some level of immunity, which shapes transmission dynamics and eventually the impact of some interventions,\" Blake said.</p><p>The researchers estimated that most of the cholera transmission could be avoided if environmental exposure or contamination was prevented. The researchers also estimated that the majority of residents had some immunity during this period due to regular outbreaks and persistent exposure in the environment. Taken together, the researchers said that vaccination would have a smaller impact on preventing transmission compared to WASH in such settings.</p><p>Blake said that early in epidemic situations, most people in the area are assumed not to be immune to the disease, so fast-paced responses like vaccination can be a good choice for management -- but endemic infections require a more comprehensive approach.</p><p>\"In an epidemic setting, it's almost never a wrong decision to vaccinate because the majority of the population is susceptible to the disease, so vaccinating early in the outbreak can quickly increase immunity levels,\" he said. \"But in endemic settings, this assumption may not be true. Vaccines are ideal for people who do not already have some level of protection from previous exposure, but testing to see if an individual is already immune can be costly or impractical. So, in areas like Kalemie where there may be relatively high levels of immunity due to environmental transmission, we estimate a higher proportion of cases can be avoided from long-term strategies like WASH if both strategies are competing because of limited resources.\"</p><p>An additional benefit of WASH, Blake said, is its positive impact on general health.</p><p>\"Whether it's talking to people on the street about hygiene or improving sanitation and access to clean water, WASH provides basic needs and can reduce transmission of more than just cholera,\" he said. \"WASH efforts have greater up-front costs but have long-lasting impacts.\"</p><p>Blake noted that studies to confirm the level of immunity in Kalemie and other endemic areas are needed. Ultimately, he said, this information could be used to refine intervention strategies targeting endemic diseases that have an environmental reservoir that contributes to transmission.</p><p>\"Vaccination and WASH efforts are both critical tools in controlling the spread of diseases like cholera,\" said Nita Bharti, associate professor of biology, who is also affiliated with CIDD at Penn State and senior author of the paper. \"But a 'one size fits all' approach is not going to work across epidemic and endemic situations. We need a location-specific understanding of the role of the environment and transmission routes to control cholera and other infectious diseases in endemic areas.\"</p><p>In addition to Blake and Bharti, the research team at Penn State includes Adam Walder, who has since graduated with a doctoral degree in statistics, and Ephraim Hanks, associate professor of statistics, both affiliated with CIDD. The team also includes Placide Okitayemba Welo at Programme National d'Elimination du Cholera et de lutte contre les autres Maladies Diarrheiques in the DRC; Francisco Luquero at Epicentre in France; and Didier Bompangue at the University of Kinshasa in the DRC.</p><p>Funding from the U.S. National Institutes of Health, U.S. National Science Foundation, and the U.S. National Institute of Food and Agriculture supported this research.</p><p>***</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.psu.edu/news/eberly-college-science/story/focus-sanitation-and-clean-water-may-improve-control-endemic-cholera\">https://www.psu.edu/news/eberly-college-science/story/focus-sanitation-and-clean-water-may-improve-control-endemic-cholera</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-9189251 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR9189251</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FKV-TT53-RS2X-7005-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1392\"/><timeReceived>8:17 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 18, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This study examines drought effects on forest and rangeland ecosystems across three bioclimatic zones in the Hyrcanian region of Iran. MODIS-derived Leaf Area Index (LAI) data (2001\u20132022) and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) were used with a generalized linear model (GLM) to assess vegetation responses. The findings indicate that rangeland ecosystems, especially in Zones II and III, are susceptible to drought, with SPI accounting for over 80% of the observed LAI variability in these regions. Forests better withstand dry conditions, with SPI explaining about half of the changes in LAI Zone III, with high elevation and snow-dominated precipitation, is drought-sensitive. Zone I near the Caspian Sea has higher humidity and more stable conditions. Zone II, with a semi-humid cold climate, exhibits the largest LAI fluctuations due to its strong dependence on moisture. Elevation, vegetation type, and climate critically influence drought responses. Targeted land management, including water optimization and conservation, is essential. Future research should integrate additional factors such as soil moisture, land cover change, and anthropogenic pressures such as deforestation, overgrazing, and environmental degradation alongside predictive modeling to enhance ecological sustainability.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>The northern forests of Iran, particularly within the Hyrcanian region, encompass a broad range of climatic conditions, spanning from humid temperate forests to semi-arid rangelands. This ancient region, dating back to the Tertiary period, is recognized globally as a biodiversity hotspot. However, rapid land-use changes, climate variability, deforestation, and widespread wildfires, which are often intensified during drought episodes, pose serious threats to these ecosystems1, 2, 3, 4\u20135. Despite its ecological significance, the Hyrcanian region\u2019s diverse bioclimatic zones have not been sufficiently studied in terms of their ecological responses to drought. Many existing studies have examined drought impacts at broader spatial scales or have relied on indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)6. While NDVI is widely used for monitoring vegetation health, it tends to saturate in areas with dense vegetation and does not directly reflect the biophysical properties of plant canopies. Consequently, the LAI, a biophysical parameter closely related to canopy structure, is considered a more accurate and reliable metric for monitoring vegetation and assessing drought impacts particularly in densely forested areas like northern Iran7. LAI is especially useful in evaluating the effectiveness of ecosystem restoration efforts and in monitoring vegetation responses under drought conditions8, 9, 10\u201311. LAI represents the ratio of total leaf surface area to the ground surface area and offers valuable insights into the structural and functional characteristics of plant canopies12. It is extensively employed in ecological and environmental research, playing a pivotal role in assessing vegetation health and productivity, as well as regulating key ecological processes such as photosynthesis, evapotranspiration, and energy exchange within ecosystems13.</p><p>There is a limited number of studies that have used long term satellite-derived data such as MODIS LAI in combination with standardized drought indices like the SPI to evaluate vegetation decline. Additionally, no comprehensive research has yet compared the responses of forest and rangeland ecosystems across different bioclimatic zones of the Hyrcanian region over an extended temporal scale. This gap in the literature presents a barrier to evidence-based, localized strategies for managing ecosystems under increasingly unstable climatic conditions. Drought is a naturally occurring and slowly developing phenomenon caused by prolonged periods of insufficient precipitation. Over recent decades, its frequency and severity have risen globally, primarily due to increased water demand and climate change. Drought has widespread implications for agriculture, economies, and ecosystems14,15. In Iran, the frequency and intensity of drought events have shown a significant upward trend over the past three decades, posing substantial challenges to environmental sustainability and resource management. To systematically evaluate drought characteristics, indices such as the SPI, Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) are commonly used16. In addition to drought indices, numerous studies have investigated the impact of drought on vegetation health and productivity, revealing that severe droughts can cause substantial declines in ecosystem function. However, climate adaptation measures and enhanced land management practices have improved ecosystem resilience (see Table 1 for specific examples). Despite these findings, there is still limited research on how regional bioclimatic characteristics, ecological thresholds, and vegetation types influence ecosystem responses to drought. Among the various drought indices, the SPI is the most widely used due to its simplicity in calculation and flexibility across different time scales, making it a practical and reliable tool for regions with high climatic variability, such as northern Iran17. Remote sensing data, particularly MODIS-derived LAI, provide valuable insights into temporal changes in vegetation cover and enable accurate assessment of drought impacts at regional scales17,18.</p><p>Table 1</p><p>Overview of studies on vegetation and drought assessment methods.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"200\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"312\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"104\"/><thead><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">Approach</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\">Notable features</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\">Reference</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Investigating the loss of vegetation in the region due to drought, its effects on plant species, and the impact of drought on productivity</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Increased severity of drought since the late 1990s has resulted in a significant reduction in vegetation productivity; however, the impact of drought on vegetation health, assessed using various vegetation indices, indicates that despite rising thermal stress, drought stress on vegetation health has decreased, partly due to compensatory effects from climate warming and improved land management practices.</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">19, 20?21</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Drought impacts on U.S. forests and rangelands.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Assessment of drought impacts on U.S. Forest and rangeland ecosystems, emphasizing drought characteristics, disturbances such as insect outbreaks and wildfires, socioeconomic consequences, and providing scientific foundations for managing drought resilience and adaptation.</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">22</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Climate change effects on rangeland vegetation and management strategies</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Focus on the effects of extreme droughts on vegetation dynamics, physiological stress, species shifts, critical thresholds, and long-term ecological changes.</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">23</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Forest responses to drought using global vegetation water content (VWC) observations</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">This study highlights the potential of remote sensing-derived vegetation water content (VWC) to improve understanding of forest responses to water stress.

The research focuses on three distinct bioclimatic zones within the region, each with differing moisture regimes and ecological sensitivities. Zone I, located near the Caspian Sea, is characterized by high humidity, whereas Zones II and III are relatively drier and more susceptible to drought stress. The main objectives of this study are as follows: (1) To analyze the temporal trends of LAI in forest and rangeland ecosystems from 2001 to 2022 across different bioclimatic zones; (2) To examine the relationship between vegetation dynamics and drought severity within these zones over the long term; (3) To compare the responses of forest and rangeland ecosystems to drought across the diverse bioclimatic zones of the Hyrcanian region.</p><p>The findings of this study aim to enhance understanding of drought\u2019s impact on vegetation in northern Iran and provide practical recommendations for the conservation and sustainable management of forest and rangeland ecosystems.

This region has outstanding biodiversity value and is recognized as a unique area in many environmental studies. According to the classification by Khatibi and Saberi (2020), this region includes three bioclimatic zones that were selected for this study30 (Fig. 1) These three zones were selected based on multivariate statistical and cluster analysis, which examined 137 climatic parameters across Iran between 1981 and 2018. These analyses led to the identification of 26 bioclimatic regions in the country, which were then compared with the vegetation cover map of Iran.

(\u201cMODIS/061/MYD15A2H V6.1\u201d) to analyze LAI dynamics (<url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MYD15A2H.061\">https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MYD15A2H.061</url>). The product\u2019s algorithm selects the best pixel from all the images captured by the Aqua sensor within 8-day time periods. In this study, we used a maximum-value composite procedure (MVC) to extract the maximum values of the LAI index monthly. This approach effectively eliminated noise and unwanted signals, significantly enhancing the final data quality.</p><p>The MODIS LAI product has been extensively validated in numerous field studies and used in the intercomparison of various LAI products. This product demonstrates high accuracy and has been widely validated in studies, including those by Yan et al. and other reputable scientific sources31. MODIS LAI data are recognized as accurate and reliable for long-term vegetation studies.</p><p>The Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform extracted LAI data from 2001 to 2022. GEE\u2019s filtering capabilities defined the relevant dataset, study period, and spectral bands. To ensure accuracy, a scale factor of 0.1 was applied to refine the LAI values, and a 1-kilometer spatial resolution was maintained for consistency with other environmental datasets incorporated in this study.</p><p>Monthly precipitation data from <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">28</emphasis> synoptic stations, evenly distributed across the study area, were obtained from the Islamic Republic of Iran Meteorological Organization (IRIMO, 2022; <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.irimo.ir\">www.irimo.ir</url>) from 2001 to 2022. To estimate the average monthly precipitation for each homogeneous bioclimatic region, a Thiessen polygon network was first constructed based on the spatial distribution of the selected synoptic stations (see Supplementary Fig. S1 online). Using this network, the mean monthly precipitation for each bioclimatic sub-region was calculated through a weighted averaging approach, where the contribution of each station was determined by the area of its corresponding Thiessen polygon within that sub-region. The land use map of the country\u2019s rangelands and forests was also obtained from Iran\u2019s Research Institute of Forests and Rangelands (R.I.F.R., 2022; <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.rifr-ac.ir\">www.rifr-ac.ir</url>).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trend analysis</emphasis></p><p>The Mann-Kendall (MK) test is a widely used nonparametric approach for detecting trends in time series data. However, when a time series exhibits positive autocorrelation, the MK test may overestimate trend significance, potentially leading to false detections32. To mitigate this issue, they introduced the concept of \u201cprewhitening\u201d the time series before applying the MK test, effectively reducing the influence of autocorrelation and improving the reliability of trend detection33,34.</p><p>The method applies the following relationship based on the proposed whitening technique to eliminate autocorrelation in time series data35.</p><p>Where: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Yt</emphasis> is the prewhitened time series, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Xt</emphasis> is the original time series, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">r</emphasis>1 is the lag-1 autocorrelation coefficient.</p><p>Researchers demonstrated that when a time series exhibits positive autocorrelation, trend detection tests such as the MK test tend to overestimate the statistical significance of trends. This can result in false identification of trends that are not truly present. To address this issue, they proposed a preprocessing step known as pre-whitening before conducting any trend analysis33.</p><p>Following their recommendation, subsequent studies, including those by Douglas et al. and Zhang et al., successfully applied the pre-whitening technique to detect temporal trends in streamflow data across the United States and Canada. The standard procedure for applying this method involves the following steps: (1) Calculate the lag-1 serial correlation coefficient, denoted as r\u03021, (2) If r\u03021 is not statistically significant at the chosen significance level \u03b1L, apply the trend detection test directly to the original time series (y1, y2, \u2026, yn), (3) The trend identification test is applied to the pre-whitened time series (y2 - r\u03021y1, y3 - r\u03021y2, \u2026, yn - r\u03021yn-1). This study employed the \u201cmodifiedmk\u201d package in R (10.32614/CRAN.package.modifiedmk) to implement the PW-MK test36.</p><p>The Theil-Sen estimator was utilized to determine the slope magnitude of the detected trends. Renowned for its robustness, the Theil-Sen method does not assume a specific data distribution and remains resistant to outliers. It calculates the median slope across all possible pairs of data points within the time series, ensuring a reliable and unbiased estimation of the trend. The primary strength of the Theil\u2013Sen median trend analysis is its ability to effectively manage nonnormal distributions and outliers, making it a robust alternative to conventional trend estimation techniques. By employing this method, we ensured that the trend analysis results remained accurate, reliable, and resistant to noise or extreme data variations.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Meteorological drought</emphasis></p><p>Our study employed the SPI to assess meteorological drought, the most widely utilized among the various drought indices due to its adaptable timescale and relatively simple calculation process38. As SPI quantifies drought conditions by comparing current precipitation levels with historical records over a specified period, it is well-suited for application in northern Iran, as they have highlighted18 Positive SPI values indicate above-average moisture levels, whereas negative values signify drier-than-normal conditions. The SPI was computed for each bioclimatic subregion at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12-month timescales using the weighted average of monthly precipitation specific to each subregion.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Drought frequency</emphasis></p><p>The SPI at a 12-month scale was employed to identify drought and wet periods, as this time scale reflects a complete annual climatic cycle. In this study, monthly SPI values were calculated for each bioclimatic region from January 2001 to December 2022 (a total of 264 months).</p><p>Drought frequency was defined as the percentage of months in which SPI values were less than \u2212 1, relative to the total number of months in the study period. Similarly, wet frequency was calculated as the percentage of months with SPI values greater than + 1.</p><p>To distinguish the severity levels of drought and wetness, the classification thresholds presented in Table 3 were applied39. Based on this classification, the frequency of each drought/wetness class (moderate, severe, and extreme) was separately calculated and analyzed for each bioclimatic region.</p><p>Table 3</p><p>Drought categories are defined by standardized precipitation index values.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"272\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"352\"/><thead><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">SPI values</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\">Drought category</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">2.0 or more</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Extreme wet</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">1.5 to 1.99</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Severe wet</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">1.0 to 1.49</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Moderate wet</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">0 to 0.99</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Mild wet</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">0 to -0.99</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Mild drought</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-1.0 to -1.49</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Moderate drought</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-1.5 to -1.99</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Severe drought</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-2.0 or less</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Extreme drought</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Effective SPI.</p><p>This study investigates the relationship between LAI in rangeland and forest ecosystems and meteorological drought, as represented by the SPI. Different types of droughts can variably affect the ecological conditions of these ecosystems, with impacts varying across bioclimatic regions and time scales (e.g., SPI at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months). Additionally, ecological responses may reflect a temporal delay influenced by past drought events. To understand these dynamics, it is critical to identify the SPI component most significantly affecting LAI variations in each bioclimatic region and month. To this end, cross-correlation analysis was conducted between SPI values (with time lags of 0 to 12 months) and corresponding LAI values for each bioclimatic sub-region and month. The SPI component with the highest correlation coefficient, defined by its specific time scale and lag, was identified as the \u2018effective SPI\u2019 for each sub-region and month. This \u2018effective SPI\u2019 is used throughout the study to represent the SPI value most closely associated with LAI variability.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Vegetation modeling via the GLM</emphasis></p><p>The average LAI values for rangeland and forest ecosystems from 2001 to 2022 were examined to evaluate vegetation\u2019s spatiotemporal patterns and its response to drought. For this purpose, the LAI anomaly was calculated monthly for each bioclimatic zone from January 2001 to December 2022. This analysis aimed to evaluate the strength of the relationship between LAI anomalies and SPI over varying temporal periods. Subsequently, the effective SPI was computed separately for each month. The responses of vegetation within rangeland and forest ecosystems to the effective SPI were then examined using a GLM for each subregion. This methodology offers valuable insights into how vegetation dynamics in these ecosystems are affected by drought conditions over time.</p><p>GLMs help capture complex associations between response and predictor variables. In this study, the variables under investigation are the LAI and SPI indices based on monthly time series data. Given the nature of the SPI, the number of observations for each time scale (i.e., 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months) is equal to the number of monthly LAI observations. The LAI variable is a continuous variable taking values 0 \u2264 LAI. Therefore, for regression GLM models, we need to use continuous distributions on )0, \u221e). The Gamma and Gaussian distributions with a \u201clog\u201d link function can satisfy that. The gamma distribution is generally used to gather heavy-skewed data. However, our results revealed that the LAI is not too skewed and tends to follow a normal distribution. Hence, we used the Gaussian distribution with a \u201clog\u201d link function for GLM models.</p><p>To evaluate the predictive performance of the GLM models given the relatively small sample size (22 observations per model), we applied a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) approach, also known as Jackknife. In this method, one observation was excluded in each iteration, and the model was trained on the remaining data to predict the excluded value. This process was repeated until each observation had been left out once and predicted accordingly40.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Results and discussion</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Seasonal LAI trends and green seasons by bioclimatic zone</emphasis></p><p>LAI reflects key aspects of vegetation dynamics, including seasonal variation, phenology, and productivity. As shown in Fig. 2, across bioclimatic zones, LAI trends follow predictable seasonal patterns shaped by climatic drivers and vegetation type. Forests exhibit low LAI from November to March due to dormancy, while rangelands reach their minimum between July and February, driven by water and temperature stress. Based on LAI anomalies above the 75th percentile (2001\u20132022), green seasons vary: March\u2013June in R_II, April\u2013June in R_III, May\u2013July in R_I, and May\u2013August in forests. These patterns underscore the role of temperature, precipitation, and dormancy in regulating productivity41. Long-term LAI monitoring enhances our understanding of climate impacts and supports informed land management, as observed in similar Central Asian rangelands.</p><p>Fig. 2</p><p>Box Plot of LAI Distribution Across Different Months for Each Bioclimatic Zone in the Rangeland and Forest Ecosystems of the Study Area.</p><p>LAI trends across bioclimatic zones.</p><p>Table 4 provides a quantitative summary of monthly and seasonal LAI trends across different forest and rangeland zones. Among the studied regions, Zone R_III exhibited the strongest and most consistent positive trends throughout the year. Notably, its annual trend (Zmk = 3.12**, Sen\u2019s slope = 0.03) and green season trend (Zmk = 2.31*, slope = 0.03) were the highest among all zones. During autumn, R_III showed significant increases, especially in October (Zmk = 3.28**, slope = 0.17) and September (Zmk = 2.80**, slope = 0.15), indicating an extension of the growing season likely linked to warming conditions. Similarly, Zone R_I showed high seasonal sensitivity, with statistically significant increases during spring and summer months notably in May (Zmk = 2.48*, slope = 0.64) and June (Zmk = 2.38*, slope = 0.46) resulting in the second-highest annual trend (Zmk = 2.85*, slope = 0.02). In contrast, Zone R_II exhibited lower trend magnitudes and fewer significant changes, reflecting greater vegetation stability and potential adaptation to higher temperature regimes.</p><p>F_I showed modest but significant increases in forested zones in autumn (October: Zmk = 2.11*, slope = 2.00) and over the year (annual: Zmk = 2.11*, slope = 0.07). F_II and F_III displayed weaker or inconsistent trends, suggesting varied responses to climatic drivers such as temperature and precipitation. These findings highlight notable spatial heterogeneity in LAI dynamics across bioclimatic zones. The highest LAI increases are concentrated in R_III and R_I, emphasizing their sensitivity to seasonal and interannual climate variability. In contrast, R_II appears more stable, possibly due to its ecological resilience or slower response to recent climatic shifts. This analysis enables more direct comparison and supports a clearer understanding of vegetation responses across ecoregions by including significance levels and slope magnitudes.</p><p>The results demonstrated Google Earth Engine-derived indices\u2019 high accuracy and practical applicability for large-scale LAI estimation, supporting improved vegetation monitoring and land management strategies. However, it should be noted that the spatial resolution of MODIS LAI data may limit the detection of fine-scale ecological changes, which could introduce uncertainties into the interpretation of localized vegetation dynamics.</p><p>As a result, combining remote sensing with field measurements provides a comprehensive understanding of vegetation dynamics and productivity42. Our results align with other studies, showing that LAI trends are highly responsive to climate, with forest and rangeland ecosystems exhibiting distinct seasonal and regional variations. These shifts emphasize the role of climate change, moisture, and temperature in regulating vegetation phenology, stressing the need for long-term monitoring and adaptive land management strategies43, 44\u201345.</p><p>Table 4</p><p>Test statistics for the mann\u2012kendall trend tests and sen\u2019s slope for various LAI time series in each studied bioclimatic zone.

drought classes across different bioclimatic zones is illustrated (Fig. 3), along with a pie chart showing their proportional distribution (Fig. 3a). A 22-year analysis reveals significant regional differences in climate extremes. Region III, which experienced the highest drought frequency (17.3%), showed a predominance of Severe Drought (SD) events, highlighting increased environmental stress. However, this does not uniformly affect vegetation. Despite frequent drought conditions, rangelands in Region III display significant positive trends in LAI, particularly in the spring and late summer, suggesting that seasonal moisture inputs such as early snowmelt and late-summer rainfall mitigate drought effects and support vegetation growth during key periods.</p><p>In contrast, forests in Region III show no significant long-term LAI trend, although there are positive monthly trends, with a notable increase in December. This indicates a responsive but insufficient reaction to seasonal moisture. Thus, the vegetation in Region III, especially in rangelands, shows resilience that is more influenced by moisture timing and sources (e.g., snowpack) than by drought class frequency alone. In Region I, which experiences the highest frequency of Moist-Wet (MW) conditions, a significant upward trend in LAI aligns with improved moisture availability and increased vegetation productivity. This positive correlation between LAI and frequent wet conditions indicates a robust ecological response in this low-elevation region near the Caspian Sea. Region II, however, shows no significant trend in LAI, despite experiencing a higher frequency of Extreme Wet (EW) and Moderate Drought (MD) conditions compared to Region I. The alternating extremes of wet and dry conditions may cause instability in vegetation growth, preventing a clear trend in LAI. Additionally, the frequent Severe Wet (SW) conditions in Region II, similar to Region III, suggest high variability in precipitation patterns.</p><p>These findings are consistent with studies from Central Asia and the French Alps, which highlight the role of water availability in moderating the impacts of climatic extremes46,47. In our research, regions with limited water (II and III) showed increased sensitivity to climatic changes, reflecting broader global patterns of vegetation stress due to water scarcity. Elevation also plays a significant role in shaping local climates48. Region I, located at lower elevations near the Caspian Sea, experiences higher humidity and reduced drought stress. In contrast, at higher elevations, Region III supports drought-tolerant species that help maintain ecosystem stability. Finally, our study\u2019s weak correlation between long-term drought indices and surface water changes echoes previous research. This suggests that human activities and water management practices are crucial factors in determining water resource availability, highlighting the need for adaptive water resource management strategies in vulnerable regions49.</p><p>Fig. 3</p><p>Frequency of droughts in the bioclimatic zones over 22 years.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Selection of the effective SPI for the LAI</emphasis></p><p>Cross-correlation analysis of the SPI and LAI time series across bioclimatic zones shows significant spatial and temporal variations in the relationship between precipitation and vegetation growth. Results indicate that the effect of SPI on LAI varies depending on the month and the bioclimatic zone. The Spearman correlation coefficients between LAI and various SPI timescales have been calculated (see Supplementary Fig. S2 online). In summary, the matrix of Spearman correlation coefficients and the selected effective SPI (eSPI) values for each month of the year across the studied regions are displayed (Fig. 4). Rangeland ecosystems show a stronger SPI-LAI correlation than forest ecosystems, suggesting that precipitation variability has a more immediate impact on vegetation in these areas. In bioclimatic Zone II, the highest correlations occur from May to October, particularly with the 6-month and 9-month SPI with a one-month lag. This highlights the importance of medium-term droughts in driving LAI variations in rangelands. The dynamics of soil moisture and its response to precipitation are highly complex and depend not only on the amount of rainfall but also on factors such as evapotranspiration, runoff, vegetation type, soil properties, meteorological conditions, and topography50,51. Therefore, vegetation response to precipitation variability is influenced by long-term soil water storage resulting from the cumulative and interactive effects of these factors. As a result, the impact of precipitation on vegetation is often observed with a time lag. Similarly, Zone III exhibits a peak correlation between May and July, aligning with the growing season and indicating that early to mid-spring precipitation influences vegetation productivity. These months, shown in green (Fig. 4), represent the period when SPI most effectively explains LAI fluctuations. In forest ecosystems, the strongest SPI-LAI correlations occur from May to September, during peak growth months, indicating the crucial role of spring and summer precipitation in forest photosynthesis and biomass production. Lower correlations in winter months (e.g., January and February) suggest that winter precipitation has less direct influence on LAI fluctuations due to the dormant phase of forest vegetation. The study of Balochistan Province, Pakistan, is relevant to our work, as it also examines the SPI-vegetation productivity relationship, validating our findings by showing how SPI timescales affect vegetation productivity during mid-term droughts. Both studies emphasize the strong SPI-vegetation correlation during peak growing seasons, confirming SPI\u2019s effectiveness as a drought-monitoring tool across ecosystems52.</p><p>Fig. 4</p><p>Most influential SPI component on LAI across months, time scales (1\u201312 months), and lag times (L_01 to L_12) in Hyrcanian Forest and rangeland bioclimatic zones.

The findings highlight the seasonal variations in LAI response to drought conditions, with the regression models indicating varying degrees of correlation across different months and regions. The adjusted R\u00b2 values demonstrate how well the SPI explains variations in LAI, with some regions and months showing stronger correlations than others. For example, such regions as R_II and R_III exhibit higher adjusted R\u00b2 values in certain months, suggesting a more substantial predictive capacity of the SPI for LAI in these areas. Additionally, the root mean square error (RMSE) values provide insights into the model\u2019s accuracy, with lower values indicating better model performance. The results suggest that SPI significantly influences LAI trends, particularly in months with more pronounced drought effects. These findings have important implications for environmental monitoring and agricultural management, providing a framework for assessing vegetation responses to climatic variability. By demonstrating the effectiveness of GLM in analyzing LAI-SPI relationships, the study contributes valuable knowledge for predicting vegetation dynamics in response to drought stress, which can inform sustainable land and water resource management strategies.</p><p>Table 5</p><p>Relationships between the LAI and drought components across bioclimatic zones via the GLM model.

Table 5. The GLM analysis results indicated that in certain months, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) explained more than 80% of the variations in the LAI in bioclimatic zones R-II and R-III (Table 5). This strong statistical association highlights the dominant role of temporal precipitation fluctuations, as captured by SPI, in driving vegetation canopy dynamics across these ecosystems. The high explanatory power of the model reflects the sensitivity of canopy structure and leaf area to drought conditions, particularly in regions where water availability is a primary limiting factor for vegetation growth. In forests, the SPI also explained up to about 50% of the variations in LAI in certain months, although this value is lower than that observed in rangelands. This difference may be attributed to the distinct physiological characteristics of plant species and their specific adaptations to environmental stress46. Rangeland ecosystems are typically more sensitive to moisture fluctuations due to their reliance on surface and near-surface soil moisture, which is directly influenced by short-term and seasonal precipitation patterns. In contrast, forest ecosystems exhibit a more complex response to drought conditions, as their deeper root systems enable them to access water from deeper soil layers. Understanding these differences is essential for developing targeted management strategies that can effectively mitigate the impacts of climate change and ensure the sustainability of ecosystem health and function. A study conducted in the Khansar region also supports our findings by indicating that rangelands are more drought-sensitive. This emphasizes the importance of understanding ecosystem-specific responses to drought for effective land management53.</p><p>A graphical representation of the results presented in Table 5 is provided, illustrating the relationships between the LAI and the SPI across different bioclimatic zones using exponential regression models (Fig. 5). The regression equations and adjusted R\u00b2 values displayed in each panel indicate the strength of the relationship between SPI and LAI, while the green shaded areas represent confidence intervals, reflecting the reliability of each model.</p><p>Each panel represents a separate month and bioclimatic zone combination, showing the fitted exponential model along with its associated confidence intervals (green shading). Model equations and adjusted R\u00b2 values are reported in each panel. This visual representation complements the detailed statistics in Table 5 and facilitates easier comparison of vegetation responses to drought conditions across different months and ecosystems.</p><p>Fig. 5</p><p>Monthly exponential relationships between LAI and drought indices (eSPI) across different bioclimatic zones in rangelands and forests.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Model diagnostics and assumption checking</emphasis></p><p>We used the Gaussian distribution with a log link function for the GLM models, as the LAI values are continuous and non-negative. To support this choice, the histograms of the observed LAI values for each month of the year and each study area, along with their corresponding theoretical Gaussian distributions, can be found as Supplementary Fig. S3 online.</p><p>The standardized residuals of the GLM models closely followed a normal distribution, confirming the validity of the normality assumption and suggesting good model fit with no major misspecification issues (see Supplementary Fig. S4 and Fig.S5 online).</p><p>Furthermore, analysis of residuals indicated no visible patterns when plotted against fitted values or independent variables, supporting the assumptions of residual independence and homoscedasticity across the range of predictors (see Supplementary Fig. S6 and Fig.S7 online).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cross-validation of GLM models</emphasis></p><p>The results of the Jackknife cross-validation indicated that model performance was generally better in rangeland areas than forest areas. This was supported by lower prediction errors (e.g., RMSE and MAE) and higher correlation coefficients between predicted and observed LAI values in rangelands (see Supplementary Fig. S8 and Fig.S9 online). These findings suggest that the models simulate vegetation responses to climatic variability more reliably in rangeland ecosystems.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LAI deviation across forest and rangeland ecosystems under drought conditions</emphasis></p><p>Forest ecosystems (F_I, F_II, F_III) exhibit stronger drought resistance than rangeland ecosystems (R_I, R_II, R_III), as indicated by fewer minor fluctuations in their LAI during dry periods (Fig. 6). Forests maintain stable LAI during extreme dry conditions (ED and SD) due to deeper root systems, greater species diversity, and the creation of moisture-retaining microclimates beneath the canopy. This microclimate effect is significant in forest ecosystems. Microclimate, defined as the climatic conditions near the ground surface at a small scale from a few centimeters to several hundred meters, plays a crucial role in regulating plant survival, growth, distribution, and interactions54. Compositional differences among habitats have been attributed to variations in microclimate. Numerous studies have shown that forests exhibit a markedly different microclimate compared to grasslands, being cooler during the day, warmer at night, and more humid during the daytime55. A microclimate with reduced temperature fluctuations in the Hyrcanian forests also enhances soil water retention.</p><p>These adaptations allow forests to resist drought stress better. In addition, biodiversity is widely recognized as a key factor in maintaining the stability and functionality of ecosystems in the face of environmental changes and ecological stressors. Numerous studies have shown that higher species diversity enhances the capacity of ecosystems to cope with challenges such as drought56, 57\u201358. Therefore, the Caspian Hyrcanian forests, with their high biodiversity, are better equipped to withstand drought conditions and maintain ecosystem productivity during dry periods. On the other hand, the soil water holding capacity and soil water availability are also higher in forests compared to grasslands due to greater soil porosity59which contributes to the higher drought resistance of Hyrcanian forests. Rangelands, especially in bioclimatic Zones II and III, show more significant LAI fluctuations during dry months, reflecting greater vulnerability to drought. This is due to their lack of tree cover, leading to quicker surface moisture loss. However, with slightly better drought resistance, rangelands in Zone I still exhibit negative LAI deviations, indicating they face challenges during droughts. The role of ecosystem type in shaping responses to drought, Similar to our results on the differential impacts of drought on highlands and lowlands, this study highlights how forests demonstrate better drought resistance due to deeper root systems and moisture-retaining microclimates. In contrast, rangelands experience more significant fluctuations in vegetation indices. Additionally, both studies emphasize the importance of ecosystem-specific adaptations in mitigating the impacts of extreme climate events60. The variation in drought vulnerability between ecosystems is influenced by factors such as root allocation, mycorrhizal associations, and xylem anatomy61. Given these results, active management is needed for rangelands, particularly in drought-prone areas, to maintain productivity and ecological health. Sustainable forest management is crucial for improving resilience to drought and preserving ecosystem services like carbon sequestration and water filtration. Both ecosystems require tailored management strategies to cope with increasing drought conditions and ensure long-term ecosystem stability in the face of climate change.</p><p>Fig. 6</p><p>Distribution of drought and wetness classes based on SPI values: Extreme Wet (EW), Severe Wet (SW), Moderate Wet (MW), Moderate Drought (MD), Severe Drought (SD), and Extreme Drought (ED). Color codes represent class categories across the study regions.</p><p>The 2007 assessment by the International Expert Panel emphasizes the need for adaptive management strategies despite existing knowledge gaps62. These strategies can help reduce forests\u2019 environmental, social, and economic vulnerabilities and the community\u2019s dependence on them, ensuring long-term sustainability amid increasing drought. In this study, we define resistance as the ability of an ecosystem to survive and maintain its functions during a disturbance (such as drought). At the same time, resilience refers to the capacity to return to pre-disturbance performance levels63. Due to the lack of a strong correlation between LAI and the drought index in forested areas across the studied bioclimatic zones, we assessed drought resistance by analyzing LAI fluctuations across different drought classes. s shown (Fig. 5), the results indicate that vegetation in the humid forest zone (F_I) exhibits the least LAI variability under both drought and wet conditions, reflecting a high level of resistance to climate variability. In the semi-humid zone (F_II), moderate LAI fluctuations were observed, indicating a combination of intermediate resistance and partial resilience. However, in the semi-arid zone (F_III), the highest fluctuations in LAI occurred, with marked increases during wet periods and sharp declines during droughts. This pattern contrasts with the commonly proposed delayed response hypothesis for semi-arid ecosystems64. It suggests that vegetation in this zone responds rapidly to climatic changes, displaying high short-term resilience during wet periods but low resistance to drought stress. This is particularly evident in semi-arid climates, where vegetation is susceptible to changes in precipitation, which directly influences its growth patterns and survival rates. The sensitivity to precipitation variations in these climates results in more pronounced fluctuations in vegetation indices, such as LAI, during extreme weather conditions. Our study and the comparative study show that drought resistance and resilience can be analyzed using LAI deviations. Both studies demonstrate that forest ecosystems maintain stability under extreme drought conditions, while rangelands experience more significant fluctuations in LAI, indicating higher vulnerability to drought stress65. A similar analysis in three rangeland regions with differing bioclimatic conditions showed that humid rangelands (R_I) exhibited relatively low LAI fluctuations, indicating notable resistance to drought. In the semi-humid rangelands (R_II), more pronounced LAI fluctuations and noticeable reductions during dry periods were observed, suggesting reduced resistance and moderate resilience. The semi-arid rangelands (R_III) experienced the highest LAI variability, with substantial declines under drought conditions, reflecting low resistance and resilience to water stress. In summary, forest ecosystems across all three bioclimatic zones showed lower LAI variability than rangelands, indicating higher resistance to drought. However, rangelands exhibited quicker recovery in some wet conditions, demonstrating comparatively higher short-term resilience. Based on these findings, targeted ecosystem-specific management strategies can be developed. Using remote sensing technologies to monitor changes in vegetation cover is essential. These methods will help identify damaged areas and enable timely decision-making for conserving natural resources. Additionally, development plans should be implemented with precise environmental assessments and consideration of new climatic conditions to prevent further degradation. For instance, in semi-arid rangelands (R_III) where low resistance and resilience were observed, spatial policies should prioritize active restoration efforts, such as soil conservation and introducing drought-tolerant shrub species with deeper root systems. Conversely, in humid forest zones (F_I) where vegetation showed strong drought resistance, sustainable forest management practices focused on maintaining canopy cover and limiting land-use change should be reinforced.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that climate change impacts on grassland vegetation phenology vary by elevation66,67. A previous study found that herbaceous and annual plant-dominated rangelands are more vulnerable to drought than those dominated by shrubs and bushes, primarily due to their shallower root systems and lower capacity for water retention68.</p><p>In continuation of examining the role of ecosystem type in drought response, it is evident that environmental and anthropogenic factors such as temperature, land-use change, and soil characteristics also play critical roles in intensifying or mitigating drought impacts. Rising temperatures and heatwaves can significantly affect forest functioning by intensifying evaporation from both root systems and tree canopies, leading to increased dryness and biological stress, ultimately causing tree mortality even in the absence of precipitation deficits69. Therefore, drought assessments must thoroughly consider the effects of temperature and evapotranspiration on forest desiccation and vulnerability.</p><p>Moreover, recent studies have widely recognized meteorological variables such as temperature and precipitation as primary drivers of vegetation dynamics, particularly influencing LAI variations. These factors are closely linked to reduced greenness and structural changes in forest vegetation under warmer conditions70. In parallel, soil serving as the foundational medium for plant growth plays a vital role in water retention and the resilience of vegetation cover. In forest and rangeland ecosystems, soil degradation caused by recurrent droughts or human activities can reduce its moisture-holding capacity and, consequently, impair plant growth. This process, which results from the interaction of multiple stressors, including climate change and drought, can severely diminish vegetation greenness and survival71.</p><p>Additionally, land-use change is a major driver in weakening the resilience of natural ecosystems to drought. The conversion of forests to agricultural lands, infrastructure development, mining activities, and human-induced wildfires are among the leading causes of deforestation and vegetation loss in the Hyrcanian forests72,73. Such activities reduce canopy cover, accelerate surface moisture loss, degrade soil structure, and diminish biodiversity, reducing the ecosystem\u2019s capacity to withstand drought stress.</p><p>Overall, understanding the complex interactions among climatic factors (e.g., temperature and precipitation), soil properties, and human-induced disturbances (e.g., land-use change and unsustainable exploitation) is essential for accurately interpreting ecosystem responses to drought and developing effective management and mitigation strategies.</p><p>The LAI distribution function for severe drought (SPI = -2), extreme wet conditions (SPI = + 2), and normal conditions in May for rangelands and forests across bioclimatic regions is illustrated (Fig. 7). The results indicate that although the SPI index affects forest vegetation cover, its impact is weaker and less pronounced than that of rangelands. This is due to the Hyrcanian forests\u2019 ability to retain moisture during drought, aided by relative precipitation, fog, and deep soils. Forest biodiversity also enhances resilience to climate stressors61. Having adapted to water scarcity, natural forests are more resilient to climate fluctuations. Moreover, LAI may not be the most accurate metric for forest cover changes; alternatives like NDVI, EVI, or VCI might better capture drought impacts. The SPI index, focusing on meteorological drought, does not consider hydrological effects like groundwater depletion. Indices like SPEI or SSI may offer a more accurate measure of drought effects on water availability. Thus, the weak correlation between SPI and vegetation changes is due to humid forest conditions, resilience, index limitations, and the difference between meteorological and hydrological droughts. Further studies should explore these factors. In contrast, rangelands are more drought-sensitive due to reduced precipitation and water resources. Herbaceous and shrubby species in rangelands with shallow root systems are highly vulnerable. The correlation between LAI and SPI is stronger here, showing a clear link between medium-term droughts and vegetation reduction. A significant LAI decline in rangelands reflects decreased productivity and biodiversity, while trees in forests with deeper roots store and use water more effectively, making them more drought-resistant. Studies show that climatic factors like rainfall have a direct impact on LAI. Drought periods lead to a significant decline in vegetation cover in rangelands, while forests demonstrate resistance to such stressors, aligning with the patterns outlined (Fig. 7)74.</p><p>Fig. 7</p><p>Depicts the distribution function of the LAI index about the severe drought threshold (SPI = -2), the extreme wet threshold (SPI = + 2), and normal conditions during May (as an example) for each bioclimatic zone.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conclusion</emphasis></p><p>This study examined the impact of drought conditions on forest and rangeland ecosystems within the Hyrcanian bioclimatic zones of Iran, utilizing the LAI and the SPI as primary indicators. The results demonstrated that rangeland vegetation is more sensitive to drought, exhibiting greater fluctuations in LAI, whereas forests, characterized by deeper root systems and canopy-driven microclimates, show higher resistance. This resistance in forests is attributed to their ability to access subsurface water resources and reduce surface evaporation; however, their resilience is lower due to a longer recovery time required for canopy restoration following drought events. Significant variations in vegetation responses to drought were observed across different bioclimatic zones, likely due to differences in vegetation types and climatic and topographic factors such as temperature, precipitation, and elevation. Statistical models indicated that the SPI explained over 80% of the variability in LAI in certain rangeland areas, whereas this value was approximately 50% in forested regions. Our findings revealed that vegetation in the humid zone (F_I) exhibited the least variability in the LAI under varying moisture conditions, indicating the highest level of drought resistance. In contrast, the semi-arid zone (F_III) experienced the most significant LAI fluctuations, with sharp declines during drought and rapid increases during wet periods, reflecting low resilience in this zone. This pattern differs from previous studies\u2019 commonly reported delayed response of semi-arid ecosystems to drought. Such differences may be attributed to specific bioclimatic characteristics of the region, the impact of successive drought events, or human interventions such as land-use changes and ecological pressures.</p><p>From a management perspective, these findings underscore the necessity for tailored strategies for forest and rangeland ecosystems. In drought-affected rangelands, particularly those under intense stress, priority should be given to improving soil quality and introducing drought-resistant species, whereas maintaining biodiversity and increasing canopy density in forests can enhance ecosystem resistance. Additionally, water resource management should be optimized considering ecosystems\u2019 spatial and temporal sensitivity to drought. This study has certain limitations that may influence the interpretation of results. The moderate spatial resolution of MODIS satellite data may not fully capture vegetation responses at finer scales. Furthermore, the SPI, which focuses solely on meteorological drought, does not encompass drought stress\u2019s full hydrological and biological dimensions. Using linear models might also inadequately represent the complex responses of vegetation to drought conditions. Future research is recommended to incorporate key environmental variables such as temperature, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and soil infiltration into predictive models to enhance accuracy and comprehensiveness. Applying advanced modeling approaches capable of capturing nonlinear and multifaceted interactions could further improve the precision of results and inform more effective management interventions. Ultimately, this study provides important insights into the effects of drought on the Hyrcanian Forest and rangeland ecosystems and establishes a scientific foundation for developing sustainable management and long-term resilience strategies for these ecosystems.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><p>[1].Adab, H.

Nationally, the total acres burned rose from 2.7 million acres in 2023 to nearly nine million in 2024, a 231% increase.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To that end, Sen. John Curtis, R-Utah, and three of his fellow senators introduced the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.curtis.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fix-Our-Forests-Act_ARP25243.pdf\">Fix Our Forests Act</url>, bipartisan legislation meant to combat catastrophic wildfires, restore forest ecosystems, and make federal forest management more efficient and responsive.</p><p>\"Utah and the American West are on the front lines of a growing wildfire crisis - and the longer we wait, the more acres will burn, and more families will be impacted,\" Curtis said upon introduction of the bill on Friday.</p><p>\"After months of bipartisan cooperation and consensus-building, my colleagues and I are introducing comprehensive legislation to support forest health, accelerate restoration, and equip local leaders - from fire chiefs to mayors - with the tools and data they need to protect lives, property, and landscapes. I'm proud of this bill and look forward to receiving additional input from my colleagues as it advances through committee and the full Senate.\"</p><p>The other sponsors include Sens. John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., Tim Sheehy, R-Mont., and Alex Padilla, D-Calif.</p><p>Rex Warner, for the Deseret News</p><p>Post CA Fires_000023.JPG</p><p>Post CA Fires_000023.JPG</p><p>1</p><h>California's deadly wildfire rampage</h><p>California wildfires this year destroyed more than 11,000 homes and left a wave of fear in evacuated communities who wondered if anything would be left.</p><p>The California fires were amplified by strong winds, but in addition to that, dried out, overcrowded forests are a key culprit in the dramatic uptick Western states are seeing in wildfire frequency and the resulting devastation.</p><h>Frustration over wildfires</h><p>Curtis said in a media call with Utah reporters on Friday that he drove up to Brian Head Resort and could see the charred trees from a previous \"horrific fire\" still left standing.</p><p>\"And I remember the news cycle at the time, there were some very angry local people. I think even local legislators were angry because this could have been prevented. The Forest Service had not managed these forests in a way that would have prevented this forest fire,\" Curtis said.</p><p>\"That's what this bill is all about. It's about managing our forest in a way that is in harmony with those who definitely want to preserve and protect them, - and, by the way, count me as one of those - but also in a way that doesn't tie hands, that helps these people make good decisions and do so quicker. And so I think this is a huge deal for Utah, for the West, for those who worry about forest fires in the area,\" he added.</p><p>It is a sentiment that has been expressed before, and for years.</p><p>The Seeley Fire in 2012 is an example.</p><p>A 2012 plume of smoke that state officials said a Forest Service official decided to let burn erupted into the Seeley Fire, which cost $9 million to quell and caused immense problems with the watershed in Emery County.</p><p>In a meeting years later, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox was blunt: \"Someone made a terrible decision without consulting with state and local officials.\"</p><p>Curtis emphasized that the bill would not exclude public input and is a bipartisan effort - a heavy lift during this time of polarized politics.</p><p>Drying conditions and less moisture is a combination that makes the situation worse, and his colleagues see that.</p><p>\"We can see Republicans and Democrats coming together, spending a large amount of time in overcoming differences - and, I don't mind telling you - some pretty large differences in how we approach this and finding a path forward and (this is) a big huge shout out to my three Senate colleagues.\"</p><h>What the Fix Our Forests Act would do</h><p>Curtis said forest health challenges are also <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/fs_media/fs_document/forest-monitoring-2023.pdf\">increasing</url> in frequency and severity due to climate stressors like drought and fire, and biological threats like invasive species - all of which the West is particularly vulnerable to. From 2001 to 2019, total forest area declined by 2.3%, while interior forest area decreased by up to 9.5%. The Intermountain region had the largest area losses, and the Pacific Southwest had the highest annual loss rates.</p><p>The<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.curtis.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fix-Our-Forests-Act_ARP25243.pdf\">Fix Our Forests Act</url>would:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Establish new and updated programs to reduce wildfire risks across large, high-priority \"firesheds,\" with an emphasis on cross-boundary collaboration.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Streamline and expand tools for forest health projects(e.g., stewardship contracting, Good Neighbor agreements) and provide faster processes for certain hazardous fuels treatments.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Create a single interagency program to help communities in the wildland-urban interfacebuild and retrofit with wildfire-resistant measures, while simplifying and consolidating grant applications.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Strengthen coordination efforts across agencies through a new Wildfire Intelligence Center, which would streamline federal response and create a whole-of-government approach to combating wildfires.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>\"A century of fire suppression and decades of reduced forest management have left us with overgrown, unhealthy forests that are more vulnerable to disease and catastrophic wildfire,\" said Gov. Cox.\"Thanks to Sen. Curtis's strong leadership on the Fix Our Forests Act, along with the tools provided by President Trump's executive order, we're now equipped to do the critical work our forests need. This bill will help us protect watersheds, enhance wildlife habitat, reduce wildfire risk, and provide the timber we need to build strong homes and neighborhoods.\"</p><p>Some conservation groups weighed in on the proposal as well.</p><p>\"The declining health of our national forests and the fish and wildlife habitat that they provide is a concern for America's hunters and anglers,\" said Joel Pedersen, president and chief executive officer of the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership. \"</p><p>\"TRCP applauds the leadership of Sens. Curtis, Sheehy, Hickenlooper, and Padilla for introducing the bipartisan Fix Our Forests Act in the Senate and urges Congress to advance these important forest management provisions and to accompany them with adequate resources and capacity to carry out on-the-ground work.\"</p><p>The legislation is key given the federally-managed lands involved.</p><p>\"About half of our lands in California are publicly owned and managed by the federal government,\" explained California Natural Resources Secretary Wade Crowfoot. \"So, reducing catastrophic wildfire risk clearly relies on helping our federal lands become healthier and more resilient to fire.\"</p><p>Supporters include: The Nature Conservancy; National Wildlife Federation; Environmental Defense Fund; National Audubon Society; Citizens' Climate Lobby; Rural Voices for Conservation Coalition; The Stewardship Project; the Federation of American Scientists; CAL FIRE; the International Association of Fire Chiefs; Alliance for Wildfire Resilience; Megafire Action; the Association for Firetech Innovation; Climate &amp;amp; Wildfire Institute; Tall Timbers; Bipartisan Policy Center Action (BPC Action); and Hispanics Enjoying Camping, Hunting, and the Outdoors (HECHO).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DESNWS-httpswwwdeseretcomutah20250411curtisstrivesforbetterforestmanagementwithbill</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DESNWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FJ8-P243-RRTG-94T0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164282</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1226\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Deseret News Publishing Co.

According to news reporting originating from Tambov State Technical University by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"The article proposes a classification of fuzzy information about the terrain for solving problems in the fields of agriculture and forestry.\" </p><p><br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Tambov State Technical University: \"This classification allows for a more accurate description and understanding of the characteristics of fuzzy information, which can be useful for decision-making under uncertainty. Special attention is given to the area of forest fire modeling using geographic information systems.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"A hybrid fuzzy network is proposed for classifying the parameters of the fire source and the environment to select the optimal analytical model.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Application of neural fuzzy classification in decision support systems.

According to news originating from Athens, Greece, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Wildfires are one of the strongest drivers of degradation of Mediterranean ecosystems, while weather and climate are among the main factors influencing fire potential.\" </p><p><br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from National and Kapodistrian University of Athens: \"From this perspective, we attempt to assess the future forest fire risk in Crete in the near (2046-2065) and distant future (2081-2100), under the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) of RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5. A risk assessment model was developed according to the conceptual framework of the 'impact chain', as defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), aiming at the formulation of a final composite risk index. The multicriteria spatial analysis, which was implemented with GIS techniques, highlighted the areas that are expected to be heavily affected in the future. It was found that the forest fire risk for the tourism sector increases with the higher emissions scenarios and towards the end of the century, with the south and central parts of the island exhibiting 'very high' risk.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The effectiveness of this method is underlined, both in terms of implementing the necessary preventive measures against the adverse effects of climate change and of strengthening adaptation planning.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Modelling Future Forest Fire Risk for the Tourism Sector of Crete.

The firing of this type of incendiary or tracer ammunition is prohibited in the State of New Jersey,\" law enforcement and forest fire officials said in a statement.</p><p>The fire is presumed to have started in the southwest corner of the rifle range, according to the statement by the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office Major Crime Unit-Arson Squad, New Jersey Forest Fire Service, and the New Jersey State Fire Marshal's Office. It resulted in 15 structures being evacuated and the closure of Stump Tavern Road.</p><p>On Saturday, Shashaty turned himself in at the Jackson Township Police Department headquarters, accompanied by his attorney, officials said. He was transferred to the Ocean County Jail, where he awaits a detention hearing.</p><p>The Shotgun Fire is just one of multiple wildfires across New Jersey. Heavy smoke from fires in South Jersey, including the Pheasant Run fire in Gloucester County and the Bethany Run Wildfire in Burlington and Camden Counties, prompted Philadelphia's Office of Emergency Management to issue a warning Sunday morning to \"use precaution if outdoors and close doors and windows.\"</p><p>In Pennsylvania's Berks County, Sunday marked the third day in a row that firefighters battled the Neversink Mountain fire near Reading. That fire forced some evacuations through Saturday morning and resulted in a non-fire-related injury to a firefighter.</p><p>Through these fires, rain has been the missing hero. Close to 88% of the contiguous United States is considered \"abnormally dry\" by the interagency U.S. Drought Monitor.</p><p>Rain in the forecast for Sunday evening would end Philadelphia's record six-week dry run, but don't expect it to last. The dryness is expected to resume soon after.</p><p>           Staff writer Anthony R.

According to news originating from Anhui, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Acquiring behaviour parameters of wildfire propagation and developing firefighting strategies necessitate a precise and efficient simulation method; fireline coordinates and rate of spread (ROS) are two crucial parameters closely associated with simulation precision.Aims This study proposes an adaptive simulation method for wildfire propagation by integrating continuous time series remote sensing images with a cellular automata (CA) model.Methods The ROS in each direction is calculated using continuous time fireline coordinates derived from multi-source remote sensing images.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include National Key Research &amp; Development Program of China, National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC). <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the University of Science and Technology China, \"A time-adaptive propagation algorithm is developed based on the CA model (time-adaptive cellular automata, TCA). Vegetation distribution information is derived to establish a simulation system for verification experiments.Key results The TCA model demonstrated satisfactory simulation performance, with a prediction accuracy of 92.2% for burned area and 87.3% for fireline length within local regions in the MuLi Forest Fire and effectively characterised gradual spread based on low ROS.Conclusion The adaptive simulation method produces fairly precise results and demonstrated its capability to achieve localised and gradual propagation.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"This software serves as a powerful tool for wildland surface fire prevention and control.Implications The adaptive simulation method based on continuous time remote sensing images and the CA model are essential for accurately predicting wildfire propagation.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Simulating Wildfire Spread Based On Continuous Time Series Remote Sensing Images and Cellular Automata.

The initiative enabled the creation of a collaborative learning space by bringing together participants from a number of non-governmental organizations across India and Nepal who work closely with Indigenous communities.</url></p><p>The goal of the workshop was to equip participants with skills to generate evidence on how communities act as stewards of their natural resources, guided by ethics of care, traditional ecological knowledge, and local agency. This stewardship not only contributes to community well-being but also ensures the continued provision of vital ecosystem services.</p><p>This article explores how the <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garo_people\">Garos, an Indigenous tribe in Meghalaya, play a vital role in managing and conserving their mosaic landscapes.

Drawing from their traditional knowledge, they actively plant Bolchim (</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duabanga_grandiflora\">Duabanga grandiflora) and Achri (</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bischofia_javanica\">Bischofia javanica) trees on the riverside between May and July. The deep-rooted systems of these species help retain water and regulate the moisture of their land.</url></p><p>For sustenance, the community harvests a variety of forest products, including timber for house construction and Non-timber Forest products (NTFPs) such as yams, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, viagra palm shoots, green leafy vegetables, and medicinal plants used to treat various ailments. Resource collection, however, is carefully managed, with harvesting limited to the traditional boundaries of designated patches within the larger community forest area.</p><p>The Garo tribe  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339841516_TRADITIONAL_FARMING_SYSTEM_A_CASE_STUDY_OF_GARO_TRIBE_IN_WEST_GARO_HILLS_DISTRICT_OF_MEGHALAYA_NORTH-EASTERN_INDIA/link/5e6860d292851c7ce05b2e15/download?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7ImZpcnN0UGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIiwicGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIn19\">has traditionally practiced farming based on Indigenous knowledge systems, applying them across plain lands, homestead gardens,</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jhum\">Jhum (shifting cultivation) fields, and social forestry areas. They mainly adopted agroforestry farming techniques for their livelihoods. The Garo people make up about one-third of</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://easternroutes.com/northeast-india/meghalaya/khasi-tribe-garo-jaintia/\">Meghalaya's total population. In the Garo Hills region, only 7 to 8 percent of the forested land is managed by the Meghalaya Forest Department. The remaining area is owned and governed by local communities, with oversight from the</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garo_Hills_Autonomous_District_Council\">Garo Hills Autonomous District Council (GHADC).</url></p><p>Ethics of care</p><p>The community's sense of care for their forests was evident in their sustainable harvesting practices and cultural traditions, such as the the  <url normalizedValue=\"https://utsav.gov.in/view-event/megong-festival-1\">Megong Festival, which celebrates the annual blooming of the Megong tree (</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhinia\">Bauhinia sp) in the months of October and November.</url></p><p>The villagers integrate traditional ecological knowledge with community-based conservation efforts to steward their landscapes effectively. Their three-tiered management system includes upland community conservation areas, where strict protection ensures forest regeneration and water conservation; midland zones, where abandoned Jhum fallows are transformed into plantations for economic benefit; and lowland areas, where limited  <url normalizedValue=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/6356/\">Jhum cultivation and vegetable farming sustain livelihoods while maintaining ecological integrity.</url></p><p>Their approach to watershed conservation is evident in the protection of upland forests, which are essential for stream replenishment, soil erosion prevention, and regulation of water flow. Equally noteworthy is their dedication to biodiversity conservation, exemplified by the establishment of the  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=akBNnBCmbTI\">Bandari Fish Sanctuary - a protected area that supports a thriving population of</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_fish\">electric fish.</url></p><p>This structured landscape management demonstrates deep ecological knowledge, balancing conservation goals with local livelihoods and aligning with Indigenous adaptive management practices for long-term sustainability.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://globalvoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Forst-Health-Assessment.jpg\">[ Photo taken by the author during a forest health assessment in Meghalaya. ]</url></p><p>Photo taken by the author during a forest health assessment in Meghalaya.

These include permitting seasonal grazing only from December to April, while cattle must be kept at home and fed during the rest of the year. The community also conducts annual patrols to monitor forest boundary encroachment, with participation being mandatory. At least one member from each household in every hamlet must join, and non-compliance results in a fine of INR 500 (USD 5.82). All records and updates are documented in an annual report and reviewed during village meetings.</p><p>A community participant shared:</p><p>Wildlife hunting is strictly prohibited, and outsiders are not allowed to collect broom-grass from the village forest. Fishing is banned in the Chingal and Imbisi streams, with violators facing a fine of INR 20,000 (USD 233). To incentivize enforcement, witnesses receive half of the fine amount as a reward, with fines collected during the annual general meeting. Additionally, stringent fire prevention measures are in place - intentional forest fires result in a fine of INR 5,000 (USD 58), and restrictions on burning firecrackers in the forest during the festive season have been enforced in the past.</p><p>In the event of an accidental forest fire, the entire community mobilizes to extinguish the flames using banana leaves.</p><p>Results of local stewardship</p><p>The tribal communities engage with their resources in ways that turn their lands into multifunctional cultural landscapes, where biodiversity is nurtured and maintained without depending on formal protected areas like parks or sanctuaries. During the field visit, it was clear that these landscapes, managed through various access and governance systems, are supported by a wide range of resource management practices that prioritize sustainability and environmental care.</p><p>A walk through the village forest revealed evidence of community-driven, soft-touch forestry practices, such as tending and low-impact harvesting methods, like hand-cutting, coppicing for fuelwood, and climber cutting. The forest also displayed a clear age gradation of trees, with lichens, lianas, fallen deadwood, and natural decomposition processes resulting in a 1-2 inch layer of humus. In a 30 by 30 meter quadrat field exercise, 40 tree species were recorded, with 77 percent of the trees being coppice shoots with diameters less than 10 cm. This traditional coppicing practice plays a vital role in forest regeneration, promoting multi-aged stands with rapid growth and resilience. This approach facilitates quick recovery, thereby enhancing biodiversity.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://globalvoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Dr-Pentie-Thong.jpg\">[ Photograph by the author: Dr. Pentie Thong from Landstack conducting a forest health assessment. ]</url></p><p>Photograph by the author: Dr. Pentie Thong from Landstack conducting a forest health assessment.

Donnelly urging him to go a step further by making the ban permanentas fireworks at any time can cause fires and are deeply distressing for animals, military veterans, and other individuals sensitive to loud noises and smoke.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The group points out that during fireworks displays, terrified dogs break through fences, wild animals flee onto roadways, and startled birds abandon their nests. Fireworks were also the cause of the Tea Time Hill wildfire, which burned 4,000 acres of South Jersey's Wharton State Forest in July, destroying the homes and taking the lives of millions of living beings, from raccoons and deer to insects.</p><p>\"The booms and blasts of fireworks sound like World War III to animals, who panic and are often injured or even killed as they try to escape some horror they don't understand,\" says PETA President Ingrid Newkirk. \"PETA is urging New Jersey to put a permanent kibosh on fireworks and ensure that festivities leave the most vulnerable among us in peace.\"</p><p>PETAwhose motto reads, in part, that \"animals are not ours to abuse in any way\"points out that Every Animal Is Someone and offers free Empathy Kits for people who need a lesson in kindness. For more information, please visit PETA.org or follow the group on X, Facebook, or Instagram.</p><p>PETA's letter to Donnelly follows.</p><p>October 31, 2024</p><p>William J. Donnelly</p><p>State Forest Firewarden and Chief of the Forest Fire Service</p><p>New Jersey Forest Fire Services</p><p>Dear Chief Donnelly:</p><p>I'm writing on behalf of People for the Ethical Treatment of AnimalsPETA entities have more than 9 million members and supporters globally, including thousands across New Jerseyahead of this year's Diwali celebrations with a request that we hope will spark your interest: We deeply appreciate that due to the recent drought, you have implemented a statewide burn restriction and ban on fireworks. We respectfully request that you make the fireworks ban permanent. As an IndianAmerican woman, I know that Diwali is a beautiful, joyous festival that can easily be enjoyed without the hazards associated with fireworks, as can all festivals, including the Fourth of July.</p><p>Packed with gunpowder, heavy metals, and other toxins, fireworks release particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and nitric oxide, which can degrade air quality, disrupt the growth of trees and other plants, alter nutrients in the soil, and increase water acidity. Fireworks also release smoke and chemicals that are harmful to the respiratory systems of all species, including those of humans. Even short-term exposure to smoke from fireworks has been linked to heart attacks and arrhythmias in people with heart disease. And as you know, fireworks were the cause of the Tea Time Hill Wildfire, which burned at least 4,000 acres in July.</p><p>In addition to being harmful to the environment, fireworks sound like an all-out war to noise-sensitive individualsincluding dogs, cats, wildlife, and veterans with post-traumatic stress disorderand their use has devastating consequences. Terrified dogs often climb, break, or dig their way out of wherever they are as they frantically try to escape from the chaos, resulting in increased intake at animal shelters and further straining community resources. This year in New Jersey, many families looked for their animal companions following Fourth of July festivities. The number of missing animals skyrockets by 30% to 60% around this holiday.</p><p>By making this change, New Jersey would set a wise, positive example for other states to follow. Massachusetts is already embracing alternative celebrations statewide, and we hope you'll join this forward-thinking state by embracing fireworks-free festivities such as Diwali that are considerate of humans, other animalsboth domestic and wildand the planet. Thank you for your attention. We look forward to hearing from you.</p><p>Very truly yours,</p><p>Sneha Swaroop</p><p>Science Policy Advisor</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126810611</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D9X-HND1-DYTH-G23R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"707\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"10\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>October 31, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The fire response effort has been hindered by regional impacts from Helene, as debris remains in forests and some roads.</p><p>\"I\u2019m concerned about the wildfires in Polk County, where people are already struggling due to Mother Nature,\" Gov. Josh Stein said in a social media post. Stein urged residents to monitor emergency alerts and follow evacuation orders \"if you need to leave your homes.\"</p><p>The two largest blazes in what's known as the Black Cove Complex fires have burned more than 5,500 acres in Polk County and were 0% contained late Monday, the state Forest Service said. Both have been burning since Wednesday and gained ground Monday despite the efforts of 263 firefighters from North Carolina and eight other states.</p><p>\"The Black Cove Fire is moving into Henderson County along Big Hungry Creek Road, where firefighters are attempting to slow the spread of the fire and protect structures,'' the Forest Service said in a late-afternoon update Monday.</p><p>Dry conditions that have prevailed in the area for weeks are expected overnight and later in the week, along with windy conditions on Tuesday and Wednesday. In recent weeks, large sections of North Carolina and South Carolina have been designated an \"elevated fire risk\" by the National Weather Service because of high winds, low humidity and a dearth of rainfall.</p><p>\"Many areas across the state have seen fires this weekend. A statewide burning ban (is) in place. Do not burn outdoors at all!\" the state <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/NCEmergency\">emergency management agency warned in a social media post</url>.

In total, Polk County has issued 165 evacuation orders while Henderson County has issued 29.</p><p>Wind gusts up to 30 mph are forecast for Tuesday with gusts expected to be higher on ridge tops, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Clay Chaney.</p><p>Residents in multiple counties were warned of smoky conditions, with the wildfires impacting the region's air quality. </p><p>The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality extended Code Orange alerts to Henderson, Transylvania, and Rutherford counties through midnight on Monday. Authorities said older adults, children, and those with heart or lung disease may experience health effects.</p><p>Polk County remained under a Code Red alert for air quality on Monday, meaning exposure to the air may be unhealthy for anyone. Residents in the area were advised to consider limiting prolonged or heavy exertion outdoors, and those with air pollution sensitivity, including children, older adults, and people with asthma, should avoid outdoor exertion.</p><p>Last week, the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services issued a statewide burn ban \"due to hazardous forest fire conditions.\"</p><h/><p>In South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster declared a state of emergency to ensure firefighters have the resources needed to combat the Table Rock Fire in the Blue Ridge Mountains. The state obtained a FEMA grant to help cover the costs for additional fire crews, air tankers and other equipment, McMasters said Monday.</p><p>\"The statewide burning ban remains in effect as wildfire risks remain high across the state,\" McMaster said in a statement. \"Anyone who violates this ban can and will go to jail.\"</p><p>As of Monday night, the Table Rock Fire \u2212 which ignited Friday \u2212 is estimated to be over 1,100 acres and has zero containment, according to the South Carolina Forestry Commission. Heavy traffic as residents flee the area has hampered response and caused hazardous driving conditions.</p><p>\"Heavy smoke conditions along the road have compounded difficult travel along the route,\" Pickens County authorities said in a fire update. \"Residents and motorists should avoid the area.\"</p><p>A smaller blaze, called the Persimmon Ridge Fire, was estimated to be more than 300 acres with zero containment, the South Carolina Forestry Commission said Monday night.</p><p>\"The weather over the next few days remains concerning, as relative humidities are expected to remain very low, and the forecasted wind speeds will still be conducive to spreading the fire,\" the state's Forestry Commission said in a statement.</p><h/><p>The South Carolina Forestry Commission noted that the current estimate of acres burned includes several hundred acres set ablaze by wildland firefighters to eliminate the parched growth between evacuated residential areas and the active wildfires.</p><p>\"The burnout, which remains in progress, is being deemed successful in removing said fuels,\" the South Carolina Forestry Commission said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Contributing: Thao Nguyen, USA TODAY;

Jared Polis, right, speaks alongside Canadian Consul General Sylvain Fabi, left, at the Capitol on March 13, 2025. (Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Colorado Gov. Jared Polis spoke out on Thursday against tariffs imposed on Canada by the United States as a 25% levy on all steel and aluminum imports took effect this week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">#8216;Any additional tariffs with Canada would make us all worse off. Canada will lose, the United States will lose and Colorado will lose. It'll decrease export markets for growing Colorado and major Colorado products, and it will increase prices for American consumers,#8217; he said in his office at the Capitol, alongside Sylvain Fabi, Canadian consul general in Denver.</p><p>Polis, a Democrat in his second term, then announced that March 15 will be ColoradoCanada Friendship Day to mark the relationship between the state and the country.</p><p>#8216;Our close partnership with Canada strengthens our economy, protects our national security and enriches our culture, at a time when in Washington, our national government seems to be confusing friends with enemies,#8217; he said.</p><p>GET THE MORNING HEADLINES.</p><p> SUBSCRIBE </p><p>Tariffs imposed by the administration of President Donald Trump on steel and aluminum imports went into effect Wednesday, part of a trade fight that has worried watchers of the global economy. There is already a 25% tariff on Canadian goods that are not under the US-Mexico-Canada agreement.</p><p>Canada is the biggest foreign supplier of steel and aluminum to the United States. That country announced retaliatory tariffs totaling about $20 billion on American goods.</p><p>Trump briefly threatened to double the tariffs on Canada when Ontario moved to impose a 25% surcharge on electricity sold to Minnesota, Michigan and New York state, but he <url normalizedValue=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/2025/03/11/repub/trump-double-tariffs-canadian-metals/\">scrapped the plan when Canada agreed to suspend the planned charges.</url></p><p>The economic skirmish is part of a broader fraying of diplomatic relations between Canada and the Trump administration, which has also repeatedly threatened to annex the country as the 51st state.</p><p>#8216;Let us get back to the effective and constructive relationship that has defined so much of our shared history as friends, partners and allies,#8217; Fabi said.</p><p>While Colorado has no power to set or reduce tariffs, Polis wanted to voice support for Canada.</p><p>#8216;Now is the time to go out of our way to show our appreciation to a partnership that has made Canadians and Americans better off,#8217; he said. #8216;It's important that Canadians know that not all Americans \u2014 in fact, most Americans don't feel the way our current administration has treated them is appropriate.#8217;</p><p>There are about 272 Canadian-owned companies in Colorado that employ about 21,000 people, according to the governor's office. In 2023, 18% of Colorado's exports went to Canada.</p><p>Status of ICE detainees</p><p>Polis also weighed in on recent operations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Colorado.

Agencies and workers who manage trails, roads and forests have all been affected.</p><p>#8216;It could directly lead to increased forest fire risk here in our state, so I'm extremely concerned about that,#8217; he said. #8216;We do not have the ability to backfill the federal government's withdrawal from basic items like road maintenance and forest management, so I'm really hopeful that those cuts can be restored.#8217;</p><p>YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.</p><p> SUPPORT </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-STNW1000979854277475853125220600013</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">Newstex Blogs</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FB6-6J43-RRX1-R0F8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567520</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"808\"/><timeReceived>9:22 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

REPI facilitates long-term partnerships to improve resilience to climate change, preserve wildlife habitats and natural resources and promote sustainable land uses near military installations and ranges. Members of the Forest Fire Service also provided a demonstration of prescribed burning, one of the strategies used to help maintain the effectiveness of fuel breaks.</p><p>Fighting wildfires in places such as the Pinelands has become increasingly challenging because of a changing and warming climate, NJDEP Commissioner Shawn LaTourette said. Through REPI, the Forest Fire Service and Department of Defense have formed a strong alliance that is advancing climate science, planning, and resilience strategies to protect lives and properties that are increasingly at risk from wildfires due to climate change. The Department of Environmental Protection thanks the Department of Defense for its foresight and our leaders in Congress for their support of this important work.</p><p>Fuel breaks and firebreaks are critical to help ensure the safety of life and property in a wildfire. A fuel break is a manmade change in forest fuel characteristics which affect fire behavior. Fires burning into fuel breaks can be more readily controlled. A firebreak is a constructed clearing used to stop fires that may occur, or to provide a control line from which firefighters work. Maintenance of fuel breaks and firebreaks is achieved through prescribed burning - the practice of setting fires in forests or grasslands under well-defined and strategically planned conditions to achieve land management objectives.</p><p>Since 2020, the DEPs Forest Fire Service has received nearly $1.7 million from the REPI Challenge Program in support of wildfire resilience projects. These projects have created or maintained 33 miles of firebreaks and fuel breaks in the vicinity of two military installations Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst and the Warren Grove Air to Ground Range in the heart of the Pinelands, a region especially prone to wildfires due to the dominant tree and plant species and porous sandy soil found there.</p><p>The fuel break tour and prescribed burning demonstration within the fuel break took place along Harry Wright Boulevard in the Roosevelt City section of Manchester Township, Ocean County, near Join Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst.</p><p>Homes in the Roosevelt City neighborhood are directly adjacent to the fuel break in some of the states most pronounced wildland-urban interface areas, which is where forested lands and communities intertwine. The most recent significant wildfire in the vicinity of Roosevelt City prior to construction of the fuel break burned 99 acres in May 2020. The Forest Fire Service contained it a day later. There was no damage to any structures.</p><p>We know the devastation to property, life and ecology that wildfires can cause, and our communities in the Pine Barrens are on the front lines of this threat, said U.S. Senator Cory Booker. Im proud to support federal funding to support projects like this firebreak to protect our national defense assets and communities living in New Jerseys fire-prone areas.</p><p>The 2023 fire season was a forceful reminder that New Jersey is not immune to the devastating wildfires that have only become more frequent due to the impacts of climate change, said U.S. Senator Bob Menendez. This firebreak will not only protect critical military and national security infrastructure, but also hundreds of New Jersey families and their homes. Ill continue fighting to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, support responsible forest management, and provide our military and our communities the resources they need to remain safe and protect critical infrastructure.</p><p>Our local communities, including those around Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in my district, are increasingly feeling the dangerous impact of longer and more intense wildfire seasons, U.S. Representative Andy Kim said. I am glad these three local wildfire risk reduction projects are receiving such crucial federal grant funding to help protect New Jersey families, their homes, and the Pine Barrens that people come to see from all over the world. We must continue to support valuable federal programs and partnerships like the REPI Program that continues to help look after our environment and bolster our resilience to climate change while also protecting our nations military readiness.</p><p>Protecting New Jerseys forests from the destructive capabilities of forest fires is not only critical to the health of our states natural resources, but to the safety of New Jerseyans, said U.S. Representative Jeff Van Drew. These projects will help ensure that our forests remain healthy and preserved for generations to come, and I am grateful for the tireless efforts of the New Jersey State Forest Service and New Jersey Forest Fire Service and the cooperation of the Department of Defense in the implementation of these innovative strategies.</p><p>It is our privilege as service members to support the local communities who help make Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehursts Win as One mission possible each and every day, said U.S. Navy Capt. James Howell, Joint Base McGuire Dix-Lakehurst deputy commander and Naval Support Activity commander. The REPI Challenge Project is a critical step to ensuring Joint Base operationality during times of increased wildfire risk, while also safeguarding those whom we protect and serve from the same threat. We applaud the New Jersey Forest Fire Service and the NJ Department of Environmental Protection for coordinating with the Department of Defense to better protect thousands of residents in the Manchester Township and empower us as stewards over these natural habitats.</p><p>Ocean County is a proud partner in this wildfire hazard mitigation project, said Ocean County Commissioner Virginia E. Haines, liaison to the Ocean County Department of Parks and Recreation and the Ocean County Natural Lands Trust. With everyone working together - Ocean County, the Department of Defense, the state Department of Environmental Protection and the Forest Fire Service we are now protecting 4,000 residents in the Roosevelt City section of Manchester Township.</p><p>We have seen the devastation wildfires can cause and how quickly they spread. The action we took along with our partners to create this fuel-break should result in reduced wildfire risk, Haines continued. I want to commend our partners and the county staff for their diligence in working together so we can ensure the sustainability of the propertys native forest; reduce wildfire risk to the residents of Roosevelt City by creating a fuel-break; and to manage the forest with a consideration for wildlife.</p><p>Thanks to the financial support of the Department of Defense and collaboration with Ocean County, the Forest Fire Service has implemented a project that will protect people and property in Ocean and Burlington counties while also protecting firefighters, said John Cecil, Assistant Commissioner for State Parks, Forests and Historic Sites. In addition to the safety aspect this project affords through the creation of the fire break, the fuel break also helps to restore the forest to its more typical condition where trees have more growing room, and the underbrush is not excessively dense. These more natural conditions improve habitat for native plants to grow and wildlife to thrive, conditions that help to sustain species and protect the forest from damaging wildfire and excessive carbon loss.</p><p>The other wildfire resilience projects funded through the REPI Challenge Program include the Warren Grove Firebreak (known as the Allen and Oswego Road Fire Mitigation and Habitat Restoration Project) in Bass River State Forest and the Greenwood Triangle Forest Fuels Maintenance Project, which is in Brendan T. Byrne State Forest and Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area.</p><p>Additional funding to complete the projects was provided by DEP ($364,000), the USDA Forest Service ($127,000 in State Fire Assistance and $64,000 through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law) and Ocean County ($107,000).</p><p>The New Jersey Forest Service and Forest Fire Service commenced work on the Warren Grove Firebreak during fall 2023. Since then, 13 miles of firebreak has been constructed along a strategic strip of land bordering Allen and Oswego roads, in Bass River Township, Burlington County, and in Little Egg Harbor Township, Ocean County. Forest thinning on 1,305 acres adjacent to Allen and Oswego roads will commence in mid-April to reduce combustible vegetation known as ladder fuels, and to improve wildlife habitat.</p><p>Ladder fuels are small trees and low vegetation beneath the forest canopy. Most large trees in the project area will remain, which will keep the canopy intact. Thinning allows for a healthier forest, reduces competition among trees and provides greater resource availability. Thinning also reduces the likelihood of a catastrophic wildfire burning through a forest.</p><p>The ongoing Greenwood Triangle Forest Fuels Maintenance Project in Brendan T. Byrne State Forest and Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area entails firebreak maintenance and underbrush removal to protect residents in Burlington and Ocean counties and to create safe conditions for firefighters during wildfire suppression efforts. The Greenwood Triangle Forest Fuels Maintenance Project also strategically connects with a Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst firebreak on federal property.</p><p>While REPI funding has assisted with the creation of fuel breaks and firebreaks, the Murphy Administration last year supplemented the Forest Fire Services FY24 budget with $3 million to enhance protection of lives and property through investments in new equipment and staff following the most active year in New Jersey for major wildfires in more than 20 years.</p><p>In 2023, the DEPs Forest Fire Service responded to 1,193 wildfires which burned 18,043 acres across the Garden State. Fourteen of the fires were considered major wildfires, burning in excess of 100 acres.</p><p>The importance of the partnership among federal, state and local governments to accomplish these resilience projects cannot be understated, said Greg McLaughlin, Administrator for Forests and Natural Lands. Not only will these projects provide protection to homes and military installations, they will also provide a safe place for firefighters to work in the event of a wildfire.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126440395</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BJF-94N1-JCBF-S52V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1845\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>March 13, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news originating from Beijing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"With the challenge of making online decisions in the face of escalating losses, the vehicle routing problem in forest fire-fighting places great emphasis on the computing efficiency of algorithms. This paper investigates the route optimization for fire-fighting vehicles and formulates a mixed integer linear programming model to minimize the total losses of overall fire spots.\" </p><p><br/> Financial support for this research came from National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC). <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the Beijing University of Chemical Technology, \"A parallel genetic algorithm with variable neighborhood search (PGA-VNS) is developed, which includes a parallelized evolution process of multiple sub-populations for ensuring the fast convergency to a high-quality solution, and a multi-operator variable searching process to promote the convergency to a nearly optimal solution. By comparing the computational results for various-scale instances, the PGA-VNS is demonstrated to be more effective than the baseline algorithms (i.e., Gurobi, GA, PSO, ALNS, VNS, GA-ALNS, and GA-VNS). Furthermore, the proposed model is extended to the scenario of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), taking into account limited flight range and load impact constraints.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The results could support the scheduling and routing for fire engines or UAVs in minimizing the losses caused by forest fires.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: A Parallel Genetic Algorithm With Variable Neighborhood Search for the Vehicle Routing Problem In Forest Fire-fighting.

Here we use multiple satellite-based tree cover data and vegetation indices to quantify the apparent effects of fragmentation on global forest resilience and potential mechanisms thereof. We measure fragmentation as edge density, patch density and mean patch area of tree cover patches, and measure resilience as one-lag temporal autocorrelation of vegetation indices. We find a statistically significant (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> &lt; 0.05) fragmentation\u2013resilience relationship in about 77% of fragmented forests, but the direction varies across biomes. In tropical and temperate forests, fragmentation is linked to increased local temperature and atmospheric dryness, resulting in a negative fragmentation\u2013resilience relationship. Conversely, in boreal forests, fragmentation is associated with decreased atmospheric dryness and enhanced light resource, thereby increasing forest resilience. Our results reconcile competing hypotheses and highlight the importance of accounting for fragmentation when predicting shifts in ecosystem resilience under disturbances. These findings also suggest the necessity of biome-targeted forest management strategies for climate change mitigation and adaptation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Human-driven forest fragmentation could have major impacts on ecosystem functioning. This global analysis shows that the relationship between fragmentation and vegetation resilience in forests may differ depending on bioclimatic region and local environmental conditions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Main</emphasis>Resilience, the capacity to resist and recover from climatic1, 2, 3, 4\u20135 or anthropogenic disturbances6, 7, 8, 9\u201310, is a fundamental function of the ecosystems of the Earth. It is key to the persistence of ecosystem services, including species richness, carbon sequestration and water supplies\u2014all of which contribute to societal and economic well-being11, 12\u201313. Recent studies have shown that forest resilience has been adversely affected by intensified climatic14 and anthropogenic disturbances worldwide12,15, 16\u201317, which is a growing global concern18,19. However, perspectives are still lacking in quantitatively linking ecosystem resilience with fragmentation, which is now a widespread risk to global forests20, 21, 22\u201323.</p><p>Fragmentation, the process of dividing large, intact forest patches into smaller units, has been a primary concern in the context of global land cover change24. As such, this concern relates to the extent to which forest ecosystem services can be maintained (that is, resilience) as large forest patches are converted into smaller, less continuous ones21, 22\u201323,25. This is an important and urgent issue, since fragmentation is likely to increase forest edge, compared with the previous intact patches26, 27\u201328, with the potential to substantially change forest structures and ecosystem functions and services, thereby influencing forest resilience29,30.</p><p>However, whether fragmentation diminishes or enhances forest resilience remains a long-standing debate. From an environmental stress perspective, studies suggest that fragmentation increases forest edges25, making edge trees more vulnerable to external environmental stress such as elevated temperature and atmospheric dryness31, 32\u201333, thereby decreasing forest resilience20,21,34. Conversely, from a species competition perspective, fragmentation can reduce competition among trees for light and water35,36 and may favour the establishment of early successional species with resource-acquisitive strategies that promote forest functioning and services, thus possibly enhancing resilience37,38.</p><p>To date, however, the contrasting perspectives on the fragmentation\u2013resilience relationships have not yet been fully examined at the global scale. To shed light on this debate, we leverage multiple satellite-based datasets including tree cover and vegetation indices to quantitatively examine the sign, magnitude and potential mechanism of the influences of ongoing worldwide fragmentation on the resilience of global forests. Specifically, we attempt to address two key research questions: (1) Does the fragmentation of forests trigger a pronounced variation in resilience globally? (2) If so, is the fragmentation\u2013resilience relation convergent or divergent across different biomes? Answering these questions would help reconcile competing hypotheses and fill the knowledge gap about the fragmentation\u2013resilience relationship in global forests.</p><p>To do so, we first used satellite-based moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) MCD12C1 land cover images39 and Global Forest Watch (GFW) tree cover maps40 to select the targeted forest grid cells (0.05\u00b0 spatial resolution) that had not experienced tree cover change from 2000 to 2020 (Methods, \u2018Select global forest grid cells\u2019). We then estimated edge density (ED)\u2014 the edge length per unit forest area41\u2014to quantify the degree of fragmentation in global forests, with higher ED values indicating stronger fragmentation (Methods, \u2018Quantify global forest fragmentation\u2019). The robustness of global fragmentation was tested with two other fragmentation indicators: patch density42, calculated as the number of patches per unit forest area, and mean patch area43, calculated as the mean patch size per unit forest area. Fragmentation metrics were further tested using another widely used tree cover dataset\u2014the Landsat global forest cover change (GFCC) tree cover images44.</p><p>We quantified forest resilience over the 2000\u20132020 time period at global scale using the commonly adopted theoretical metric\u2014one-lag temporal autocorrelation (TAC) of MODIS-based retrievals of the kernel normalized difference vegetation index (kNDVI) at a 0.05\u00b0 spatial resolution (denoted TACkNDVI)45,46, a robust proxy for ecosystem productivity12,18,45. Specifically, higher TACkNDVI values are considered to indicate lower forest resilience (Methods, \u2018Estimate global forest resilience\u2019). We also examined TACkNDVI by using other TAC metrics estimated from a commonly used vegetation index\u2014MODIS leaf area index (LAI) (TACLAI)47 and a reconstructed solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) dataset (GOSIF) by combining orbiting carbon observatory-2 (OCO-2) SIF and MODIS vegetation index data (TACSIF)48. To reduce the influence of canopy structure and vertical leaf angle on TAC estimation49, we further compared TACkNDVI with the other five TAC metrics estimated from different vegetation indices\u2014chlorophyll vegetation index (CVI) (TACCVI)50, disease\u2013water stress index 2 (DSWI2) (TACDSWI2)51, normalized difference drought index (NDDI) (TACNDDI)52, normalized difference moisture index (NDWI) (TACNDWI)53 and normalized rapeseed flowering index green (NRFIg) (TACNRFIg)54. TAC-based results were also tested using the theoretical variance metric55 and direct empirical recovery rate56 obtained from fitting an exponential recovery model to vegetation time series after experiencing abrupt disturbances (Methods).</p><p>Given that the spatial differences in ED, patch density and mean patch area among forest grid cells involve variations in both fragmentation and tree cover fraction (TC), we used three independent methods\u2014 the partial correlation analysis (PCA) (Fig. 1), the partial least squares-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) (Fig. 2) and the statistical data binning approach (Fig. 3)\u2014to remove the influence from tree cover for quantifying the impacts of fragmentation on forest resilience for each 2\u00b0 \u00d7 2\u00b0 moving window globally (Methods, \u2018Quantify the impacts of fragmentation on forest resilience\u2019). We then applied the space-for-time method57 to quantify the biophysical effects of forest on local environment and used PLS-SEM to unravel the key biophysical pathways through which fragmentation may affect forest resilience (Figs. 4 and 5) (Methods, \u2018Explore the potential mechanisms\u2019). The analysis results were also compared with those estimated from the null models, a fundamental tool that serves as a baseline for complex models (Methods, \u2018Develop null models to test the result robustness\u2019). Last, we explored the heterogeneity of fragmentation\u2013resilience relationships across various biomes, under different climatic aridity conditions and in diverse surrounding landscapes, and further discussed potential uncertainties from satellite vegetation indices and TAC estimates (Fig. 6).Fig. 1</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pervasive but divergent fragmentation\u2013resilience relationships across global forests estimated using the PCA method.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>, Map of the partial correlation coefficient (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">R</emphasis>) between ED and one-lag TAC of kNDVI (TACkNDVI).

In tropical (UNM, 91%; PCA, 88%) and temperate (UNM, 87%; PCA, 82%) forests, TACkNDVI is positively correlated with ED (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> &lt; 0.05), primarily clustered in the Brazilian Amazon, Central Africa and northern USA (Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Fig. 1a,b). This indicates that tropical (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03b2</emphasis>TAC = 0.0025 \u00b1 0.0002) and temperate (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03b2</emphasis>TAC = 0.0015 \u00b1 0.0001) forests with stronger fragmentation (larger ED) exhibit weaker resilience (larger TACkNDVI) (Fig. 1c,d and Supplementary Fig. 2d,e). Conversely, in boreal forests TACkNDVI is negatively correlated with ED (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03b2</emphasis>TAC = \u22120.0008 \u00b1 0.0001) (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 2f) over most fragmented forests (UNM, 75%; PCA, 72%) (Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Fig. 1a,b), suggesting a contrasting fragmentation\u2013resilience relationship. This signifies that stronger fragmentation (larger ED) tends to enhance boreal forest resilience (smaller TACkNDVI).</p><p>ED and TC are the two most important covariates affecting forest resilience across all climate zones (Fig. 1f,h and Supplementary Fig. 1c\u2013e). Therefore, we further conducted a PLS-SEM analysis, which can effectively address the collinearity issues, to compare their relative importance across the globe (Supplementary Fig. 3). We discovered an asymmetric impact of ED versus TC on forest resilience (Fig. 2). More than 68% of tropical forests show a stronger positive ED\u2013TACkNDVI pathway (path coefficient is 0.38 \u00b1 0.024, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> &lt; 0.01) compared with the negative TC\u2013TACkNDVI pathway (path coefficient is \u22120.21 \u00b1 0.021, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> &lt; 0.01) (Fig. 2a). This finding is consistent with the PCAs (Supplementary Fig. 4), where the majority of tropical forests (77%) show a higher sensitivity of TACkNDVI to ED (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">R</emphasis> = 0.31; <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> &lt; 0.01) than to TC (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">R</emphasis> = \u22120.28; <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> &lt; 0.01) (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 4). Overall, tropical forests show a positive asymmetric influence of fragmentation versus TC on forest resilience. However, the asymmetry is reversed in the boreal zone, where &gt;55% of grid cells show a stronger positive TC\u2013TACkNDVI relationship (SEM path coefficient is 0.36 \u00b1 0.030, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> &lt; 0.01; <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">R</emphasis> for PCA = 0.17, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> &lt; 0.01), compared with a relatively weaker negative ED\u2013TACkNDVI relationship (SEM path coefficient is \u22120.33 \u00b1 0.028, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> &lt; 0.01; <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">R</emphasis> for PCA = \u22120.14, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> &lt; 0.01) (Figs. 1h and 2c and Supplementary Fig. 4). In temperate forests, the positive impacts of ED on TACkNDVI and the negative impacts of TC on TACkNDVI have equal weighting, each accounting for approximately half the total grid cells (Figs. 1g and 2b and Supplementary Fig. 4).</p><p>To strictly control the impact of TCs in each bin, we established linear correlations between ED and TACkNDVI for each 10% TC bin (50\u201360%, 60\u201370%, 70\u201380%, 80\u201390% and &gt;90%) within each 2\u00b0 \u00d7 2\u00b0 moving window and calculated the slopes (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03b2</emphasis>TAC) of their linear fitting curves (Fig. 3; Methods, \u2018Quantify the impacts of fragmentation on forest resilience\u2019). Results show that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03b2</emphasis>TAC is positive for all TC bins in tropical (0.0016 \u00b1 0.00001 on average; Fig. 3a and Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7a\u2013e) and temperate (0.0010 \u00b1 0.00002 on average; Fig. 3b and Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7f\u2013j) forests, but negative in boreal forests (\u22120.0008 \u00b1 0.00001 on average; Fig. 3c and Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7k\u2013o). Interestingly, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03b2</emphasis>TAC increases with tropical TC, suggesting a stronger negative impact of fragmentation (larger ED) on forest resilience (smaller TACkNDVI) in tropical regions with higher TC compared to lower TC. In temperate forests, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03b2</emphasis>TAC exhibits similar magnitudes for all TC bins. Conversely, in boreal forests, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03b2</emphasis>TAC decreases sharply in areas with nearly full TC (&gt;90%), indicating a stronger positive impact of fragmentation (larger ED) on forest resilience (smaller TACkNDVI) as TC increases. This finding, based on the TC binning analysis, is consistent when upscaling to the climate zoning scales (Supplementary Fig. 8).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Potential mechanisms of fragmentation effects on forest resilience</emphasis></p><p>Fragmentation is expected either to release competition for light and water, and thereby promote forest resilience35, 36, 37\u201338, or to accelerate exposure to external environmental stress and thus reduce forest resilience31, 32, 33\u201334. To test these two contrasting assumptions, we applied the PLS-SEM analysis to explore the potential mechanisms through what kind of changes in environmental conditions fragmentation may affect TAC (Methods, \u2018Explore the potential mechanisms\u2019). This was achieved by using moving windows for each bin of TC to limit the effects of TC. We found that, within each 10% bin of TC, fragmentation strongly regulates the local land surface temperature (LST), soil moisture (SM), atmospheric dryness (vapour pressure deficit, VPD) and absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) (Fig. 4), which in turn enhance or diminish forest resilience to macroclimate fluctuations. However, the pathways through which fragmentation affects forest resilience differ greatly across biomes.</p><p>In tropical and temperate biomes, forests cool local temperature (Fig. 4a) and increase atmosphere and soil moisture (Fig. 4b,c), alleviating potential constraints from high-temperature stress and drought57, 58\u201359. This can benefit forest productivity in sunlight-sufficient environments60, 61\u201362. However, fragmentation significantly (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> &lt; 0.001) weakens such cooling (ED positively correlated with \u2206LST) and humidification effects (ED positively correlated with \u2206VPD) (Fig. 4e), which in turn raises local forest temperature and atmospheric dryness. This fragmentation-induced warming and drying of local environments tends therefore to decrease forest resilience (larger TACkNDVI) (Fig. 5a,b). This impact emerges as the most important direct-influencing pathway in most tropical forests (total path coefficient of these two pathways is 0.39 \u00b1 0.0002; 51.35% of tropical forest pixels) and temperate forests (total path coefficient of these two pathways is 0.13 \u00b1 0.0002; 52.14% of temperate forest pixels) (Fig. 5d,e). Fragmentation-induced warming may further exacerbate atmospheric dryness due to the strong influences of LST on air temperature and, consequently, on VPD (Fig. 5a,b). The total path coefficient is 0.77 \u00b1 0.004 for tropical biomes and 0.75 \u00b1 0.006 for temperate biomes, leading to cascading negative effects on resilience (larger TACkNDVI). This is an important indirect pathway through which fragmentation affects forest resilience (total path coefficient is 0.24 \u00b1 0.0001), particularly affecting 33.65% of tropical forest grid cells.</p><p>Conversely, boreal forests are often associated with a slight warming effect on local temperatures (Fig. 4a). Reduction in such biophysical warming due to fragmentation (Fig. 4e) consequently decreases boreal forest resilience (total path coefficient is 0.05 \u00b1 0.0004) (Fig. 5c), where productivity is often limited by low temperature63,64. However, this negative impact is offset by other direct influences on resilience through changes in SM, VPD and APAR. Our analysis indicates that the negative ED\u2013TACkNDVI relationship is largely attributed to the influencing pathways through increases in SM (total path coefficient is \u22120.03 \u00b1 0.0001) and decreases in VPD (total path coefficient is \u22120.10 \u00b1 0.0002) (Fig. 5c\u2013e). Fragmentation-induced cooling on local temperatures also decelerates atmospheric and soil dryness (Fig. 5c), further promoting plant transpiration and photosynthesis65, both of which enhance forest resilience (smaller TAC). Furthermore, fragmentation in boreal forests produces a positive ED\u2013\u2206APAR pathway (path coefficient is 0.22 \u00b1 0.005; <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> &lt; 0.05) (Fig. 5c). This is particularly important for enhancing forest resilience (total path coefficient is \u22120.02 \u00b1 0.0002, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> &lt; 0.05) in the sunlight-insufficient boreal regions66 (Fig. 5c,e), providing another explanation for the negative ED\u2013TACkNDVI relationship.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Variations across biomes, climates and fragmentation drivers</emphasis></p><p>The fragmentation\u2013resilience relationship varies across forest types (green histograms, Fig. 6). Fragmentation can alter the humidity and temperature conditions in evergreen broadleaf forests and deciduous broadleaf forests in tropical and temperate zones (Supplementary Fig. 15b\u2013e). This alteration leads to the most negative impact of fragmentation on their ecosystem resilience (green histograms, Fig. 6). The fragmentation\u2013resilience relationship also differs in degree of climatic aridity (brown histograms, Fig. 6). In drier climates, fragmentation induces more pronounced changes in environmental climates32 (Supplementary Fig. 16). Therefore, the strength of the fragmentation\u2013resilience relationship is enhanced with aridity (brown histograms, Fig. 6). Forest resilience also responds differently to fragmentation in flood-prone regions (Supplementary Fig. 17), where water is not a limiting factor and local temperatures are typically lower than the surroundings due to strong evapotranspiration. Our analysis shows that, in flood-prone forests, fragmentation probably causes fewer disturbances to the local environment of forests, leading to a weaker fragmentation\u2013resilience relationship (purple histograms, Fig. 6).</p><p>Fragmentation associated with different drivers of coincident TC loss8 may have various impacts on forest resilience. We find that fragmentation induced by anthropogenic disturbances, such as commodity-driven permanent deforestation, agriculture and urbanization (except for selective forestry operations within forests), generally result in more substantial changes in local temperature and humidity (Supplementary Fig. 18) and thus produce stronger impacts on forest resilience compared with natural disturbances (for example, wildfire) (red histograms, Fig. 6). Impacts from broader landscape-level environments were also examined in three representative regions in tropical, temperate and boreal forests, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 19a; Methods, \u2018Select global forest grid cells\u2019). Our analyses reveal that forests adjacent to built-up lands or croplands generally experience a hotter and drier background environment compared with forests adjacent to natural surface grasslands. This pattern is consistent in both tropical and temperate regions (Supplementary Fig. 19b,c), resulting in a more pronounced decline in resilience (blue histograms, Fig. 6). In addition, changes in the surrounding climate relative to neighbouring disturbances may also influence the fragmentation\u2013resilience relationships. Our findings indicate that fragmentation in areas with neighbouring disturbances (agriculture, urbanization and wildfire) exacerbate climatic variability (Supplementary Fig. 20), leading to a more significant decline in resilience (orange histograms, Fig. 6). Conversely, afforestation or reforestation efforts in the surrounding areas help mitigate climate change impacts (Supplementary Fig. 20), resulting in a weaker effect of fragmentation on resilience (orange histograms, Fig. 6).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Testing potential uncertainties</emphasis></p><p>Uncertainties may arise from satellite-based optical vegetation indices, which often saturate in dense forest18. For instance, LAI, NDVI, kNDVI and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) all perform well in low-density forests, but saturate when the aboveground biomass exceeds 250 Mg ha\u22121 (Supplementary Fig. 21a\u2013c). In regions with fewer saturation issues (Supplementary Fig. 21d), satellite-based optical vegetation indices converge to show positive correlations between ED and TAC in tropical and temperate zones (Supplementary Fig. 21e\u2013g); while consistently representing negative correlations between ED and TAC in boreal zones (Supplementary Fig. 21e,h). However, in dense forests where optical vegetation indices saturate strongly, such as the central Amazon, southern Europe and western Canada, the fragmentation\u2013resilience relationships cannot be reliably estimated using the correlation between ED and optical vegetation indices-inferred TAC metrics (Supplementary Fig. 21i\u2013k). This uncertainty can be illustrated by comparing the results from independent Ku-band microwave vegetation optical depth (VOD)67 which are less prone to saturation in dense vegetation. We detected a pronounced positive correlation between ED and TACVOD in dense forests of the central Amazon, southern Europe and western Canada (Supplementary Fig. 22). Thus, in low-density forests the choice of vegetation indices does not significantly impact the fragmentation\u2013resilience relationships. However, in dense forests where optical vegetation indices are susceptible to signal saturation, using non-optical remote sensing vegetation indices, such as VOD, can provide more reliable results. Canopy structure and vertical leaf angle issues49 may also compromise the reliability of optical vegetation indices. To address this, we selected the CVI50, which is less affected by either structure or leaf angle, to test the robustness of our evaluations. While the CVI-based fragmentation\u2013resilience relationships become slightly less pronounced, the divergent patterns between tropical/temperate forests (positive) versus boreal forests (negative) still hold true (Supplementary Fig. 23; slope is 1.13, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">R</emphasis>2 = 0.95, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, The aforementioned fragmentation\u2013resilience relationships also remain robust when using other TC data (that is, GFCC) to calculate ED (Supplementary Fig. 24; slope is 0.71, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">R</emphasis>2 = 0.63, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> &lt; 0.001), or using other alternative fragmentation metrics (patch density and mean patch area) instead of ED (Supplementary Fig. 25; patch density: slope is 0.84, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">R</emphasis>2 = 0.91, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> &lt; 0.001; mean patch area: slope is 0.82, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">R</emphasis>2 = 0.90, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> &lt; 0.001), or examining alternative time periods (2000\u20132015 and 2006\u20132020) (Supplementary Fig. 26). To be cautious, the robustness of satellite vegetation indices-based fragmentation\u2013resilience patterns were also examined using TAC calculated from the field measurements of data for eddy covariance gross primary production (GPP) from the FLUXNET2025 dataset, which showed a strong consistency with the TAC calculated on the basis of kNDVI (Supplementary Fig. 27; slope is 0.91, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">R</emphasis>2 = 0.73, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> &lt; 0.001). In the last, the pervasive but divergent fragmentation\u2013resilience relationships across global forests remain robust even when downscaling to smaller sizes of forest grid cells (1 km instead of 0.05\u00b0 resolution) (Supplementary Fig. 28).</p><p>Another fundamental issue to be examined is the validity of using TAC as the theoretical indicator of forest resilience. Thus, justification from empirical estimations is important because it gives a directly measurable resilience metric for those locations where disturbances occurred56. To do this, we used the empirical direct recovery rate (DRT) to test the robustness of TAC-based fragmentation\u2013resilience relationships. DRT is a valid direct resilience metric, which is obtained by fitting an exponential recovery model to vegetation time series after experiencing abrupt disturbances56 (Methods, \u2018Estimate global forest resilience\u2019). We found similar DRT-estimated fragmentation\u2013resilience relationships to that of TAC-based relationships (Supplementary Fig. 29; slope is 0.68, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">R</emphasis>2 = 0.55, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> &lt; 0.001). Additionally, the divergent TAC-based fragmentation\u2013resilience relationships across biomes also coincided with those obtained by using the time-series variance instead of TAC68,69 (Supplementary Fig. 30). It is worth noting that kNDVI variance-based fragmentation\u2013resilience (Supplementary Fig. 30c\u2013e) can efficiently capture the microwave VOD-inferred fragmentation\u2013resilience pattern in densely forested areas such as the central Amazon (slope is 0.93, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">R</emphasis>2 = 0.91, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> &lt; 0.001), southern Europe (slope is 0.93, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">R</emphasis>2 = 0.93, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> &lt; 0.001) and western Canada (slope is 0.82, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">R</emphasis>2 = 0.75, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> &lt; 0.001). This suggests that the variance metric probably outweighs the TAC metric in representing the fragmentation\u2013resilience relationships in the densely forested ecosystems.</p><p>Environmental variability may differ across moving windows, introducing uncertainty in fragmentation\u2013resilience relationships. To address this, we selected four key environmental factors (shortwave radiation, temperature, precipitation and elevation) and quantified the environmental variability within each 2\u00b0 \u00d7 2\u00b0 moving window using their interquartile ranges (IQR) (Methods, \u2018Select global forest grid cells\u2019<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">;</emphasis> (Supplementary Fig. 31). Our analysis revealed that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">R</emphasis> values for the correlation between ED and TAC decreased as IQR increased (Supplementary Fig. 32), indicating a significant negative impact of environmental variability on the fragmentation\u2013resilience relationships across different windows. Notably, windows in the small IQR cohorts (the lowest 25% IQR range), which were less influenced by environmental variability, showed a regionally averaged <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">R</emphasis> value of 0.74, 0.69 and \u22120.47 for tropical, temperate and boreal zones, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 33c\u2013e). This indicates a robust relationship between ED and TAC across global forests. Furthermore, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">R</emphasis> values between ED and TACkNDVI exceeded 0.60 across most TC bins (Supplementary Figs. 34 and 35); and more than 94% of those windows showed significant correlation (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> &lt; 0.001) (Supplementary Fig. 33f\u2013h), consistent with randomization-based analyses (Supplementary Fig. 33i\u2013k). To further evaluate the impact of environmental variability associated with the 2\u00b0 \u00d7 2\u00b0 moving window method, we compared it with a fixed 2\u00b0 \u00d7 2\u00b0 window method (Supplementary Fig. 36) and also tested against a larger moving window (4\u00b0 \u00d7 4\u00b0) (Supplementary Fig. 37). Results showed that the majority (&gt;96%) of 2\u00b0 \u00d7 2\u00b0 moving windows in small IQR cohorts exhibited significant correlations (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> &lt; 0.001) between ED and TAC for both the fixed 2\u00b0 \u00d7 2\u00b0 window method (tropical, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">R</emphasis> = 0.71 \u00b1 0.0071; temperate, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">R</emphasis> = 0.69 \u00b1 0.0103; boreal, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">R</emphasis> = \u22120.48 \u00b1 0.0110) and the 4\u00b0 \u00d7 4\u00b0 moving window method (tropical, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">R</emphasis> = 0.72 \u00b1 0.0010; temperate, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">R</emphasis> = 0.71 \u00b1 0.0011; boreal, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">R</emphasis> = \u22120.50 \u00b1 0.0014). Additionally, Student\u2019s <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis>-test revealed no statistically significant differences in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">R</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> values between the 2\u00b0 \u00d7 2\u00b0 moving window method and both the fixed 2\u00b0 \u00d7 2\u00b0 and 4\u00b0 \u00d7 4\u00b0 window methods (Supplementary Figs. 36c\u2013i and 37c\u2013i).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Discussion</emphasis></p><p>One key finding of this study is the demonstration of a pervasive fragmentation\u2013resilience relationship existing in about 77% of global fragmented forests, with 55% showing significant (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> &lt; 0.05) positive correlations and 22% exhibiting significant (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> &lt; 0.05) negative correlations (Fig. 1). Typically, the fragmentation\u2013resilience relation is mostly equal to or even stronger than that between resilience and TC (Fig. 2). This finding highlights the fact that forests, even with the same TC, exhibit resilience differences with various degrees of fragmentation70,71. Nevertheless, the impacts of fragmentation on resilience, which is now a widespread risk to global forests, has been largely overlooked in previous studies20, 21, 22\u201323. Therefore, accounting for the spatial and temporal variations in forest fragmentation is crucial for predicting the extent of forest resilience shifts under climate change and understanding their consequences for ecosystem functioning.</p><p>Equally important, the discovered pervasive but divergent fragmentation\u2013resilience relationships reconcile the long-standing debates from an environmental stress perspective versus a species competition perspective. The sunlight-sufficient and heat-intensive tropical and temperate biomes are generally biodiversity hotspots72 harbouring many endemic species that are highly sensitive to climate variations (droughts and/or heatwaves)73. Thus, plants in these biomes mostly exhibit limited tolerances to environmental stress74 and are more likely to be constrained by frequent high temperature and drought stress31, 32\u201333 rather than by sunlight66,75. As such, fragmentation-induced warmer and drier environments not only intensify constraints on ecosystem functioning, thus reducing forest resilience, but also worsen the local forest environment, which is used to provide thermal refuges for biological communities75, 76\u201377. This may increase the extinction risks for endemic species, leading to biodiversity loss and, in turn, lower resilience78, 79\u201380. Conversely, in the cold and sunlight-insufficient boreal zones, forests usually show a positive fragmentation\u2013resilience relationship. In these biomes, forests are more susceptible to sunlight and water limitations and low-temperature constraint66,81, 82\u201383. Although fragmentation-induced cooling slightly constrains forest resilience84,85, fragmentation indirectly decelerates atmospheric and soil moisture dryness and increases available light for plant growth, especially for the understory vegetations86,87. This releases species competition for water and light and thus increases the fraction of APAR88, ultimately benefiting forest resilience.</p><p>Our findings have potential implications for forest management and policies. Given the negative fragmentation\u2013resilience relationship, it is crucial to preserve tropical and temperate forests in an intact state to minimize fragmented areas. In these biomes, fragmented areas have been primarily caused by anthropogenic disturbances (for example, commodity-driven deforestation, urbanization and agriculture) (Supplementary Fig. 18a,c) and mostly replaced by impervious surfaces89 and croplands8 (Supplementary Fig. 38). This anthropogenic-induced fragmentation worsens the cool and humid forest environment59,90,91, resulting in notable degradation in forest structure92,93 and productivity60, 61\u201362 and ultimately a stronger reduction in forest resilience, compared with the natural disturbances (Fig. 6). In contrast, the fragmentation\u2013resilience relationship differs in boreal forests, where natural disturbances (for example, fire) and moderate anthropogenic disturbances (selective forestry operation within forests) are the main cause of fragmentation (Supplementary Fig. 18e)8,83. Fragmented areas resulting from natural disturbances are mostly recovered by grasses or mosses (Supplementary Fig. 38), which often display allelopathic interactions with tree species in native forests94. The impacts of fragmentation on forest resilience tend to be enhanced with rising climatic dryness (Fig. 6). Neighbouring disturbances also have broader landscape-level impacts on the resilience of forest ecosystems (Supplementary Figs. 19 and 20). This overflow impact of disturbance on forest ecosystems suggests the necessity of setting buffer areas to protect the conserved areas. It is also worth noting that uncertainties (for example, signal saturation issues) may compromise the use of the optical vegetation indices-based TAC metric in evaluating the fragmentation\u2013resilience relation in densely vegetated regions such as the tropical Amazonian rainforests. In contrast, the variance-based metric or microwave VOD can outperform the optical vegetation indices and give a better performance. While the global fragmentation\u2013resilience relationships found in this study are overall robust, uncertainties remain to be further examined in some specific regions with regard to the complexity of forest communities, limitations of satellite-based vegetation indices, the validity of TAC estimates and mixed pixel issues across local to global scales.</p><p>In summary, our study indicates a pervasive fragmentation (ED)\u2013resilience (TACkNDVI) relationship in global forests. We further discover that the ED\u2013TACkNDVI relationships differ substantially across forest biomes. Specifically, it is positive in tropical/temperate forests and negative in boreal forests. The contrasting ED\u2013TACkNDVI relationships are largely attributed to fragmentation-induced changes in the local environment, which is important for persisting ecosystem services and resilience. Overall, our findings underscore the importance of considering fragmentation, rather than relying solely on changes in TC, when assessing forest resilience. These findings also reconcile the divergent fragmentation\u2013resilience arguments hypothesized by the environmental stress perspective versus the species competition perspective, with broad implications for biome-targeted forest management strategies and practices to improve forest resilience under the pressure of climate change and in the face of anthropogenic disturbances.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methods</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Select global forest grid cells</emphasis></p><p>We first overlaid the 30-m high-resolution global TC change maps from GFW40 with 0.05\u00b0-resolution MODIS MCD12C1 land cover images39 and selected the grid cells defined as \u2018forestlands\u2019 in the MODIS land cover images. We then calculated the TC for each 0.05\u00b0 forest grid cell and selected for analysis those forest grid cells with TC consistently &gt;50% (in total of 792,140 grid cells) from 2000 to 2020. For a given forest ecosystem, its resilience variation can be influenced by landscape fragmentation and TC change. To minimize the impacts of TC change, we excluded those 0.05\u00b0 forest grid cells that experienced &gt;2% loss or &gt;2% gain in TC from 2000 to 202090 and focused solely on those relatively stable areas (&lt;2% of TC loss and &lt;2% of TC gain). This selection was conducted using 30-m resolution TC change maps from GFW, which were updated to 2020 by ref. 40.</p><p>Furthermore, we investigated the fragmentation\u2013resilience relationships across three climate zones (tropical, temperate and boreal regions) based on the K\u00f6ppen\u2013Geiger climate classification map95 and various forest types (evergreen needleleaf, evergreen broadleaf, deciduous needleleaf, deciduous broadleaf and mixed forests) according to the International Geosphere\u2013Biosphere Programme (IGBP) classification criteria based on MODIS MCD12C1 land cover images39 (Supplementary Fig. 15a). The fragmentation\u2013resilience relationships were also tested for various climatic aridity conditions on the basis of the aridity index (ratio of precipitation (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis>) to potential evapotranspiration (PET), denoted as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis>/PET) (that is, hyper arid (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis>/PET \u2264 0.03), arid (0.03 &lt; <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis>/PET \u2264 0.2), semi-arid (0.2 &lt; <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis>/PET \u2264 0.5), dry sub-humid (0.5 &lt; <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis>/PET \u2264 0.65) and humid (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis>/PET &gt; 0.65)), adapted from WorldCLIM96 (Supplementary Fig. 16a). The fragmentation\u2013resilience relationships were further examined between flood-prone and non-flood-prone regions using the flood extent mapping algorithm provided by ref. 97 (Supplementary Fig. 17a).</p><p>Notably, fragmentation induced by different drivers may exhibit various impacts on resilience. To examine this, we classified fragmentation drivers using a 0.1\u00b0-resolution global tree loss driver map over the period from 2000 to 2015 developed by ref. 8, who identified five main drivers of TC loss: commodity-driven deforestation (the permanent conversion of forestland to non-forest land), large-scale forestry operations, shifting agriculture (the conversion of forest to agricultural land), wildfires (the burning of forest vegetation) and urbanization (the conversion of forest to urban areas). We then re-analysed the fragmentation\u2013resilience relationships for different fragmentation drivers during 2000\u20132015 (Supplementary Fig. 18a).</p><p>We also evaluated potential impacts from neighbouring land uses based on the MCD12C1 land cover images39. The targeted forest grid cells were classified into six categories based on the predominant land-use types of their surrounding grid cells (4\u00b0 \u00d7 4\u00b0 windows): shrublands, grasslands, wetlands, forests, croplands and buildings, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 19a). We further tested potential influences from neighbouring disturbances based on the TC loss driver map of ref. 8. Similarly, the targeted forest grid cells were categorized into six groups on the basis of the predominant disturbance type in their surrounding grid cells (4\u00b0 \u00d7 4\u00b0 windows): commodity-driven deforestation, large-scale forestry operations, shifting agriculture, wildfires, urbanization and afforestation/reforestation (Supplementary Fig. 20a).</p><p>Additionally, environmental variability may differ across different 2\u00b0 \u00d7 2\u00b0 moving windows, introducing potential uncertainties (Supplementary Fig. 31). To address this, we quantified environmental variability for each 2\u00b0 \u00d7 2\u00b0 moving window by considering four key environmental factors: shortwave radiation, temperature, precipitation and elevation. First, we normalized each environmental variable within each climate zone and computed the IQR for each 2\u00b0 \u00d7 2\u00b0 moving window. Then, we calculated the maximal IQR of the four environmental variables for each 2\u00b0 \u00d7 2\u00b0 window to represent its overall environmental variability. On the basis of this metric, we classified all 2\u00b0 \u00d7 2\u00b0 windows into four groups on the basis of the maximal IQR of each window: large IQR cohort (top 25%), relatively large IQR cohort (25\u201350%), relatively small IQR cohort (50\u201375%) and small IQR cohort (bottom 25%) (Supplementary Fig. 32). Finally, we selected moving windows belonging to the small IQR cohort, which were less influenced by environmental variability, to assess the robustness of our findings.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Quantify global forest fragmentation</emphasis></p><p>ED, defined as the edge length per unit area41 (equation (1)), is an effective metric for assessing fragmentation70,98.

Patch density was calculated as the number of patches per unit forest area42 (equation (2)), while mean patch area was calculated as the mean patch size per unit forest area43 (equation (3)). Overall, we selected 249,481 fragmented forest grid cells (32% of global forests) at a resolution of 0.05\u00b0 for analysis.

Theoretically, the resilience of a system is closely tied to both the variance and TAC of time series encoding the dynamics of the system55. Thus, we mainly used TAC and variance as the theoretical metrics to estimate forest resilience. Satellite-based vegetation indices have been used to calculate TAC and variance for quantifying ecosystem resilience11, 12\u201313,15,18,56,69,102. In this study, we adopted the widely used kNDVI time-series data (2000\u20132020)45 (equation (4)) as the primary vegetation index to calculate one-lag TAC (TACkNDVI) for forest resilience analysis. We retained only NDVI pixels with good quality and used a rolling-mean detrender followed by removing a third-order harmonic function fit to the data as a deseasoner in Python56, to produce kNDVI time series devoid of long-term trends and seasonal patterns for each pixel for further analysis11,13. We further tested the result estimated using the above detrending and deseasoning method, which is consistent with that of the seasonal-trend decomposition procedure based on the locally weighted regression (LOESS) method (STL)103.4</p><p>Additionally, we explored four other commonly used vegetation indices\u2014MODIS-NDVI46, MODIS-EVI46, MODIS-LAI47 and a reconstructed SIF product by combining the OCO-2 SIF and MODIS vegetation index data (GOSIF)48\u2014to calculate TACkNDVI, TACEVI, TACLAI and TACSIF, respectively, to test the robustness of relationship between ED and TACkNDVI (Supplementary Fig. 23k\u2013r). To test the potential influences of canopy structure and vertical leaf angle on optical vegetation indices-based estimations, we explored five other vegetation indices, that is, CVI (TACCVI)50,104, DSWI2 (TACDSWI2)51,104, NDDI (TACNDDI)52,104, NDWI (TACNDWI)53,104 and NRFIg (TACNRFIg)54,104, which were found to be less sensitive to variations in structure and vertical leaf angle (Supplementary Fig. 23a\u2013j). To evaluate impacts from the saturation issues of optical vegetation indices in dense vegetation13, we also used Ku-band microwave VOD derived from AMSR-E67 to calculate TACVOD (Supplementary Fig. 22). The satellite vegetation indices-inferred fragmentation\u2013resilience relationships were also examined by using global eddy covariance GPP data from the FLUXNET2025 dataset to calculate TACflux_GPP, (Supplementary Fig. 27). All the optical vegetation indices were computed monthly and resampled to a 0.05\u00b0 spatial resolution to match the spatial resolution of kNDVI.</p><p>A previous study13 introduced an empirical metric\u2014recovery rate\u2014to directly measure ecosystem resilience. The empirical recovery rate was obtained by fitting an exponential recovery model to vegetation time series after experiencing abrupt disturbances56. Thus, we also calculated the empirical recovery rate following the method of ref. 56 to justify the use of TAC and variance as proxies for vegetation resilience. The specific calculation process was summarized as follows. (1) First, for each of the target forest cells, we identified sharp transitions in the time-series vegetation indices where slopes were above the 99th percentile using an 18-point (9 month) moving window and defined their peaks as individual disturbances. (2) Then, we identified the local minimum vegetation index after the individual disturbance, and used the five following years of data after identifying the minimum vegetation index to fit an exponential function to the residual time series, assuming that the recovery after a disturbance to a vegetation state <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">x</emphasis>0 approximately follows equation (5):5where <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">x</emphasis>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis>) denotes the state of vegetation at time <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> following the disturbance. Parameter <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03b3</emphasis> represents the empirical recovery rates. A negative <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03b3</emphasis> indicates that the vegetation system will return to its original stable state at a rate of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03b3</emphasis>. Conversely, a positive <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03b3</emphasis> suggests that the initial disturbance will be amplified, indicating a non-resilient state of vegetation. It is important to note that the relationship between TAC and the recovery rate <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03b3</emphasis> is exponential, while the relationship between variance and the recovery rate <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03b3</emphasis> follows a power law (1/<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">r</emphasis>).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Quantify the impacts of fragmentation on forest resilience</emphasis></p><p>Given the significant correlation between fragmentation and TC105,106, we used the PCA107, data binning approach and PLS-SEM108 to isolate the impacts of tree cover. This allowed us to better understand the individual influence of fragmentation (ED) on forest resilience (TACkNDVI).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The partial correlation analysis</emphasis></p><p>Partial correlation is a robust method for describing the relationship between two variables while removing the effects of another variable, or several other variables, on this relationship109, 110\u2013111. Thus, we constrained the PCA between ED and TAC (Fig. 1), after removing the effect of TC, temperature, precipitation, shortwave radiation, elevation, longitude and latitude, within 2\u00b0 \u00d7 2\u00b0 moving windows. Only those 2\u00b0 \u00d7 2\u00b0 moving windows with &gt;50 records were retained for analysis (249,481 in total).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The PLS-SEM analysis</emphasis></p><p>PLS-SEM is a robust statistical technique designed to analyse complex cause\u2013effect relationships in path models112, 113, 114, 115, 116\u2013117 that include latent variables. In our study, we used a straightforward PLS-SEM model that included two mediating variables, TC and ED, to analyse their effects on resilience (TACkNDVI). The PLS-SEM results for tropical, temperate and boreal forests are shown in Fig. 2. We compared the path coefficients between ED and TACkNDVI with those between TC and TACkNDVI to represent the varying impacts of fragmentation on resilience across global forests. We used the goodness-of-fit (GoF) as an effective indicator to assess the overall predictive performance of PLS-SEM. GoF values &gt;0.7 are considered \u2018very good\u2019, while those &gt;0.5 are considered \u2018good\u201965,118.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The data binning analysis</emphasis></p><p>Data binning is a data preprocessing method used to group original continuous data into several categories119. Since data within the same group share similar classification characteristics, the data binning approach can minimize the impact of classification features, allowing to assess the correlation of other variables within the bins. In this study, within each moving window, we established linear correlations between ED and TACkNDVI for each TC bin (50\u201360%, 60\u201370%, 70\u201380%, 80\u201390% and &gt;90%) and calculated the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">R</emphasis> values and slopes of the corresponding linear correlation fitting curves (Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7). We then computed the average slopes within each 2\u00b0 \u00d7 2\u00b0 moving window for each TC bin across different climate zones, as shown in Fig. 3.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Explore the potential mechanisms</emphasis></p><p>To explore the pathways through which fragmentation impacts on resilience, we first quantified the biophysical effects of forest on LST, VPD, SM and APAR, denoted as \u2206LST, \u2206VPD, \u2206SM and \u2206APAR, respectively (see later): \u2206LST was calculated using the MODIS MOD11C3 v.061 land surface temperature products120; \u2206VPD and \u2206SM were derived from the TerraClimate dataset96. \u2206APAR was calculated on the basis of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and fraction of absorbed PAR (FAPAR) data from the global land surface satellite (GLASS) product121,122.</p><p>Then, we assumed that the adjacent forest and non-forest areas share the same background state and adopted the space-for-time analogy57 to estimate intrinsic biophysical effects of forests on local environment\u2014\u2206LST, \u2206VPD, \u2206SM and \u2206APAR123. Specifically, for each 0.05\u00b0 forest grid cell, the impact of forests on local temperature can be expressed as the LST difference (\u2206LST) between forest and open land (equation (6)). The \u2206VPD, \u2206SM and \u2206APAR induced by the biophysical effects of forests were calculated similarly to \u2206LST. All these changes in climatic variables (\u2206LST, \u2206VPD, \u2206SM and \u2206APAR) were computed annually and resampled to 0.05\u00b0 spatial resolution to match the spatial resolution of kNDVI. The analysis results are shown in Fig. 4.6where LSTnon-forest was obtained from neighbouring non-forest areas located within a 50-km radius90,124, as grid cells within this distance were assumed to share a similar background climate123. To minimize distance-related uncertainties, LSTnon-forest within 50 km of the targeted forest grid cells were averaged using the inverse distance as a weighting factor124. Additionally, only forest grid cells with more than five reference grid cells within 50 km were included in the analysis90.</p><p>After that, we developed a PLS-SEM framework incorporating four mediating variables (\u2206LST, \u2206VPD, \u2206SM and \u2206APAR) to represent the pathways through which fragmentation largely impacts on resilience. We ran the PLS-SEM using 1,000 bootstrapping samples to validate the estimates of path coefficients and their coefficients of determination (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">R</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">2</emphasis>). Only grid cells with GoF &gt; 0.5 were included in the analyses65,125. Results were shown in Fig. 5.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Develop null models to test the result robustness</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The UNM approach</emphasis></p><p>The null model approach is a fundamental tool that serves as a baseline or reference point for evaluating the significance of observed data in complex systems126,127. In this study, we developed a UNM between ED and TACkNDVI (Supplementary Fig. 1a), which revealed a consistent global pattern similar to the one observed in PCA (Fig. 1a; Methods, \u2018The partial correlation analysis\u2019). Additionally, we developed the UNMs, using TC, temperature, precipitation, shortwave radiation, elevation, longitude and latitude as the predictor variables, respectively, with TACkNDVI as the response variable. These UNMs revealed that fragmentation and TC were the two most influential factors affecting forest resilience (Supplementary Fig. 1c\u2013e). The relative importance of these factors was consistent with the results derived from the PCA (Fig. 1f\u2013h; Methods, \u2018The partial correlation analysis\u2019).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The binary linear regression and multiple regression approaches</emphasis></p><p>We further developed the binary linear regression null model (BNM) and multiple linear regression model (MLR), to test the robustness of PLS-SEM. The root mean square error (RMSE), Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and Akaike information criterion (AIC) are effective indicators for evaluating model accuracy128, 129\u2013130. If the RMSE, BIC and AIC of complex models are lower than those of the BNM or MLR, it indicates that the complex models have a higher predictive power than the null models131,132.</p><p>First, we established a BNM with ED and TC as the two predictor variables and TAC as the response variable, which was used as a baseline to test the robustness of the PLS-SEM model in depicting the relative importance of ED versus TC in influencing TAC (Fig. 2). Here, we also used the partial correlation approach based on BNM analysis to quantify the relative importance of ED versus TC in influencing TAC (Methods, \u2018The partial correlation analysis\u2019). Overall, the results from the BNM showed consistent patterns regarding the relative importance of ED versus TC in influencing TAC (Supplementary Fig. 4). The simulation accuracy of PLS-SEM (RMSE = 0.09; AIC = \u22122,547; BIC = \u22122,536) was higher than that of the BNM (RMSE = 0.10; AIC = \u22122,423; BIC = \u22122,415) (Supplementary Fig. 5). This indicates that PLS-SEM provided a more reliable approach for depicting the relative importance of ED versus TC in influencing TAC.</p><p>Similarly, we established an MLR analysis to test the robustness of PLS-SEM (Fig. 5). In this model, ED, \u2206LST, \u2206VPD, \u2206SM and \u2206APAR were used as predictor variables and TACkNDVI was set as the response variable. Our analysis revealed that the RMSE values produced by PLS-SEM were consistently lower than those of the MLR (Supplementary Table 1). We also compared our PLS-SEM model (Fig. 5) with alternative models that excluded one of the climatic variables (\u2206LST, \u2206VPD, \u2206SM or \u2206APAR). The simulation accuracy of our original PLS-SEM was consistently higher than that of these alternative models (Supplementary Table 2). To ensure robustness, we also conducted PLS-SEM and MLR analyses exclusively using windows belong to the small IQR cohorts, which were less affected by environmental variability (Supplementary Table 2).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reporting summary</emphasis></p><p>Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 42225104, 42471326 and 42125105), the National Key R&amp;D Programme of China (no. 2024YFF1306600) and the Science and Technology Program of Guangdong (no. 2024B1212070012).

According to news originating from the Department of Chemistry by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Forest fires significantly impact ecosystems; thus, identifying characteristics that increase the danger of fires is critical to mitigating their negative impacts. This study examines the parameters contributing to wildfires in the Vellore Reserve Forest This paper aims to develop GIS-based risk maps and models to enhance fire protection, fuel mitigation strategies, and land use decisions by improving wildfire risk recognition and prediction. This research discusses Wildfire Modeling in Vellore Reserve Forest, Tamil Nadu, India.\" </p><p><br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Department of Chemistry: \"This field is large and rich in knowledge on the study of wildfires in the study area. Tamil Nadu, India's southernmost state, is divided into 32 districts with diverse landscapes and ecosystems. The Vellore district, covering 6,077 square kilometers, has a significant 27% forest cover, covering 162,286 ha. This forest is primarily found between latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates in the calm taluks of Gudiyatham, Tirupattur, and Vellore-the Vellore Reserve Forest Report 2023 highlights this ecological diversity. Geographic information systems (GIS) based analysis of forest fire was done using normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference moisture index, fuel danger index (human) activity danger index, weather danger index, topographic danger index, normalized burn ratio index, and differenced Normalized Burn Ratio. The geographical scope of this research encompasses the entire Vellore district of Tamil Nadu, India. Real-time maps were photographed by MODIS and Landsat nine satellites to obtain a normalized difference in vegetation and moisture index. Initially, data are converted to digital maps. The most helpful fuel, activity, weather, and topography danger indexes are calculated using the Raster Calculator utility, Euclidean Distance tool, Kriging tool, and Digital Elevation Model, respectively. In the Vellore district, the calculated activity danger index ranges from 0 to 12,000, showing that the high risk emanates from human activities. The climate is dry from May to July, and the weather danger index is 345-348. In other seasons, the weather index is 338-341, indicating a low-risk level. In Vellore, low to medium-risk values for the topography index are 56.5-933, and high-risk values are 934-1,690. Fire severity is indexed in terms of both NBR and dNBR. NBR and dNBR are calculated from the NIR-SWIR ratio. Despite the limited data sources being a big challenge in this paper, the innovative elements of this study are characterized by a comprehensive, integrated strategy that employs GIS technology, providing an understanding of localized factors influencing wildfire ignition.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"This research contributes significant data and insights regarding the metrics that govern wildfire dynamics, serving as a vital resource for wildfire management efforts in the region. This paper assists in applying the models to predict the future wildfire risk under climate change and land use conditions.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Wildfire indicators modeling for reserved forest of Vellore district (Tamil Nadu, India).

Though the New Jersey Forest Fire Service was the primary firefighting agency, it has brought in fire companies from throughout the region to help with wildfires that started burning in October, which marked the driest month in the state's history.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As of Monday, the three major fires in South Jersey were controlled, and an arrest was made in one that authorities say began at gun range where a man was firing Dragon's Breath shotgun shells, which are designed to spread flames.</p><p>In North Jersey, emergency crews are mourning the loss 18-year-old Dariel Vasques, a New York State Forest ranger helping battle the 3,000-acre Jennings Creek Wildfire burning in both Passaic County, New Jersey, and Orange County, New York. Sunday's rain helped give rest to crews that had been working nonstop to contain the fire.</p><p>Here's the status of the South Jersey fires that began burning last week, all of which began amid an extreme drought in the state.</p><p>Shotgun Wildfire</p><p>Crews have made substantial progress fighting what the New Jersey Forest Fire Service has dubbed the Shotgun Wildfire, with 90% contained as of Friday. Officials have not updated the status of the fire as of Monday morning.</p><p>But it tore through 350 acres in the Colliers Mills Wildlife Management Area in the area of Stump Tavern Road in Jackson Township, Ocean County, not far from Six Flags Great Adventure. The fire began Nov. 6., burned 350 acres, and caused evacuations.</p><p>On Sunday, authorities arrested Richard Shashaty, 37, of Brick Township, and charged him with arson and firearms violations after allegedly firing prohibited Dragon's Breath shotgun ammunition. He was using the ammo while at the Central Jersey Rifle Range, where authorities say the fire ignited.</p><p>Shashaty turned himself in at the Jackson Township Police Department headquarters over the weekend, accompanied by his attorney, officials said. He was transferred to the Ocean County Jail, where he awaits a detention hearing.</p><p>What is Dragon's Breath?</p><p>According to authorities, Shashaty was firing rounds of Dragon's Breath 12-gauge from a shotgun, emitting magnesium shards that ignited \"combustibles on the berm of the shooting range.\"</p><p>The firing of incendiary or tracer ammunition is prohibited in New Jersey. Officials said Shashaty was responsible for firing the ammunition. The ammo is designed to produce a pyrotechnic effect.</p><p>For example, Phoenix Rising advertises its \"Super Dragon' Dragon's Breath\" 12-gauge rounds, saying they have \"an incredible range of 200 plus yards and a burn rate of over 5,000 degrees. It is the highest quality and most effective round of its type made. While it is extremely fun to shoot, it is also an effective deterrent.\"</p><p>The company notes that the Dragon's Breath rounds became much more popular after the release of John Wick: Chapter 4, part of the popular hyper-violent eponymous series. The Dragon's Breath scene has been analyzed by various aficionados. New York magazine's culture website,Vulture, for example, wrote a lengthy breakdown of the \"Dragon's Breath\" scene, and many have posted clips of it across social media.</p><p>The rounds became so popular, they had to be back-ordered.</p><p>Pheasant Run Wildfire</p><p>The wildfire that broke out in the Glassboro Wildlife Management Area in Gloucester County, and first spotted from the Blue Anchor FireTower on Nov. 7, burned through 133 acres, and was 75% contained as of Friday, the last update from the New Jersey Forest Fire Service.</p><p>Firefighters remained on the scene for days, and the blaze produced significant amounts of smoke that could be seen and smelled for days.</p><p>No more updates are expected, as officials considered the fire no longer a threat.</p><p>Bethany Run Wildfire</p><p>As of Friday, crews had contained 90% of the a 360-acre wildfire that broke out on the border of Burlington and Camden Counties on Nov. 7, where it was originally spotted from the Medford Fire Tower. The fire burned near the popular Black Run Preserve in Evesham and smoke could be seen in Philadelphia. It caused the evacuation of 12 homes. However, residents were later allowed to return home.</p><p>Did Sunday night's rain help drought conditions?</p><p>Though it rained overnight Sunday into Monday, a persistent drought still affects the Philadelphia region. Officially, 0.31 inches was measured at Philadelphia International Airport, and was not close to putting a dent into the deficit, though it did improve fire conditions.</p><p>The drought has been acute in South Jersey, where some counties were suffering from 10-inch rain deficits the past 90 days - prior to the rain. The state issued a ban on open fires in October and has asked residents to voluntary conserve water. There is no rain in the forecast for the next week.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:fkummer@inquirer.com\">fkummer@inquirer.com</email></p><p>FrankKummer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHIINQ-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHIINQ2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DD7-7701-DYJT-21PD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"832\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Philadelphia Inquirer</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 12, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00063X1</classCode><className>SIX FLAGS GREAT ADVENTURE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

According to news originating from Uttarakhand, India, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Fossil fuels, a non-renewable source, supply more than 81% of the world's primary energy and contribute heavily to global climate change. This paper represents a strategy to address the administration of forest bio residue in the northern Himalayan district of India.\" </p><p><br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee: \"Uttarakhand state, the north part of India, is rich in bio residues such as Pine needles of Chir Pine (Pinus roxburghii). Every year during the summer, there is a forest fire breakout, mainly caused by these dry pine needles, which cover a forest floor and are highly flammable. This forest bio residue is renewable and is a potential energy source for rural livelihoods, which would also generate social business enterprises among the locals. This is an effort to develop a practical manual-operated briquetting machine (BM) capable of fabricating briquettes from forest waste. The primary materials utilized to make briquettes are pine needles and forest waste. The proposed method inculcates principles of compression molding along with necessary optimizations. Briquetting is one of the cheapest ways to harvest the destructive energy of pine needles in a clean and economically viable way. Briquetting machines reduce forest fires by reducing dependency on wood from forests for fuel while simultaneously lowering carbon emissions by using biomass or agricultural waste as alternative fuel sources. This dual benefit protects forests and helps battle climate change and local air pollution, making it a long-term option for environmental protection.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The developed BM is one solution that can solve the dual purpose of climate change mitigation and employment. The designed and developed machine fabricates thirty-three briquettes per hour and is currently installed in the Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand, India.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Design and Development of a Pine Needle Briquetting Machine for the Uttarakhand Region of India.

Carlos Fari\u00f1as on Monday called on the public help prevent grassfires during this dry and windy season.</p><p>Fari\u00f1as, founder of the Fari\u00f1as Fire and Rescue Volunteers in this city, made the call after he and his team responded to a grass fire in Barangay 33B, La Paz, Laoag City within the La Paz dunes, a popular tourist destination for 4x4 rides and sand boarding in Ilocos Norte province.</p><p>He said the grass fire was caused by some drunken men who lit fireworks near the 4x4 view deck as evidenced by a recovered empty fireworks box and lighter.</p><p>Fire authorities said the blaze was put out immediately with the help of the village's firefighting brigade and the operators of 4x4, who used big drums filled with water from the firetruck and transported them using the 4x4 vehicle because the fire truck could not go near the grassfire area.</p><p>'Let us be vigilant to prevent forest fire that could risk the lives and properties of our constituents,' Fari\u00f1as said, noting that the incident happened near residential properties.</p><p>Authorities have been raising alarm over the rising incidents of forest and grass fires in Ilocos Norte, with 23 recorded incidents from February to March 6, 2023 alone, which tore through the city of Batac and the towns of Vintar, Sarrat, Currimao, Marcos, Banna, Piddig, Paoay, Solsona, and Nueva Era.</p><p>Marcel Tabije, head of the provincial resiliency office, said most of the wildfires reported during the period were due to human activities that involved 'burning of agricultural farm wastes and throwing of cigarette butts in grassy areas.'</p><p>'We urge the public to be vigilant and report it immediately to the Bureau of Fire Protection if you happen to see a grassfire incident,' he said.</p><p>Aside from limited manpower, officials of the Bureau of Fire Projection (BFP) here said they currently lack forest fire fighting equipment and a jet shooter backpack.</p><p>The BFP has been recommending to local authorities the installation of radio towers in isolated areas to ensure quick response in case of wildfires.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

High-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) from ArcticDEM enable the volumetric and soil organic carbon quantification of medium to large disturbance areas undergoing RTS ( \u226510,000 m2) for the Northern Hemisphere. Using DEM time-series analysis and deep learning, we retrieve a total of 2747 disturbance areas undergoing active RTS with a total volume loss of (317.0 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 106 m3 between 2012 and 2022. Here we show that climatic drivers of RTS activity exhibit latitudinal and regional variations, specifically, the number of precipitation-driven RTS decreases linearly as latitudes increase, whereas temperature-driven RTS increases sharply. Finally, we estimate that 96% of detected RTS thawed ~1.95 \u00d7 10\u20133 Pg carbon per year, equivalent to ~0.2% of annual gradual thaw emission estimates. Our results highlight the complexity of regional RTS dynamics and the importance of high resolution, long-term monitoring efforts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This study systematically mapped 2747 retrogressive thaw slumps during the past decade. It finds that higher latitude thaw slumps are mainly driven by temperature, while lower latitudes are influenced by prior-year climate and precipitation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>The Northern Hemisphere, particularly the Arctic, is warming at a rate two to four times faster than the global average (refs. 1, 2\u20133). This rapid warming is driving cascading environmental4,5 and societal impacts6, including thawing permafrost7, 8\u20139. Permafrost underlies ~15% of exposed land surface of the Northern Hemisphere10 yet disproportionally consists of 34% of the global soil carbon storage11,12. When permafrost thaws, the landscape response is largely dependent on ground ice content, ranging from minor elevation change over ice-poor permafrost areas to larger amounts of thaw-subsidence in ice-rich areas causing landscape modifications known as thermokarst13, 14, 15\u201316. In recent years, efforts have been made to estimate thermokarst extent and its potential greenhouse gas emissions17,18, however regional scale empirically-based assessments indicate a wide range of variability in the nature and distribution of thermokarst processes15. While there is high confidence that climate warming is increasing permafrost temperatures, there is greater uncertainty in the magnitude and distribution of thaw-driven change and estimates of associated greenhouse gas release12.</p><p>Large uncertainties in understanding the consequences of permafrost thaw remain especially for thermokarst on hill-slopes (i.e., thaw-driven mass wasting) due to a lack of large-scale Northern Hemisphere studies concerning the spatial distribution of mass wasting, volumetric rates of subsidence, and a scarcity of information about biogeochemical cycling and emissions of thawed material19, 20\u201321. For example, Olefeldt et al.17 estimated 4.9% of the pan-Arctic (0.91 \u00d7 106 km2) to be susceptible to low-to-moderate levels of hillslope thermokarst activity, while Turetsky et al.18 initiated their hillslope abrupt thaw model spin-ups at 1.4% of all pan-Arctic lands to be affected by hillslope mass wasting (and 3% annual increases of active thaw afterwards). One of the most dramatic and rapidly evolving examples of hillslope thermokarst are areas undergoing retrogressive thaw slumping (RTS)22, 23\u201324. Despite increasing interests in understanding the three-dimensional characterization and dynamics of RTS at local to regional scales8,25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31\u201332, the majority of the literature (including recent deep learning studies) focus on one or two-dimensional detection and measurement of RTS (e.g.,33, 34, 35\u201336) through which thawed volumetrics (and greenhouse gas emissions) cannot be obtained. Quantification of the spatial distribution and rates of subsidence of medium- to large RTS (i.e., \u226510,000 m2) is especially important as these disproportionally contribute the most to regional-scale volumetric budgets due to deeper thaw and non-linear area-volume scaling effects8,31. These uncertainties and information gaps identify an important need for a Northern Hemisphere quantification of the total and annual volume loss of RTS to calibrate future earth system and emission models and validate predictions of previous models.</p><p>Thaw slumping describes \u201cthe landsliding process involving the melting of ground ice and [subsidence or] collapse of thawed material\u201d (37, p. 91). When this process occurs as backwasting or upslope enlargement it is specified as retrogressive thaw slumping. The permafrost literature describes retrogressive thaw slumping both as a complex set of thermokarst processes as well as a thermokarst landform, termed retrogressive thaw slumps. This identical terminology between process and landform can create inconsistencies in what to map38 as well as challenge the calibration and validation of machine learning models for large-scale detections31,38. Henceforth for clarity, we use RTS to denote the process of retrogressive thaw slumping and use the term slumps to denote landforms described as retrogressive thaw slumps37.</p><p>The most common landforms undergoing RTS are thaw slumps; however, RTS can also shape landforms from dead glacial ice in recent ice-cored moraine complexes39, 40\u201341. Ice-rich permafrost is required for RTS to occur and as a thaw-driven mass wasting process, the primary process of RTS is the ablation of an ice-rich headwall typically of crescent or elongated shape (Fig. 1c42;). RTS can be highly dynamic; initializing quickly in a single thaw season and remaining active for decades33,43, or ceasing activity before potential reactivation occurs44. However, in the last two decades, intensification of material transfer in response to temperature and precipitation increases has transformed RTS dynamics in many Arctic regions, driving feedbacks that perpetuate retrogressing growth, increase downwasting, and impact downstream environments, leading to the development of areas undergoing RTS to reach between 50,000 m2 and 400,000 m2, creating landforms termed \u201cmega slumps\u201d8,22. Volumetric enlargement at the retrogressing headwall remains the primary mechanism of thawing ice-rich permafrost, and the disturbance areas undergoing this process are the focus of this study (Fig. 1). A lack of representative RTS training data is often cited as one of the greatest limiting factors to achieve accurate and transferable deep learning models for pan-Arctic detections45, 46\u201347, and studies typically overcome this by merging regional datasets from various sources and vintages (refs. 48,49), which might be sparse and biased50, as well as remote-sensing based and unverified by permafrost experts38. There is thus a need for a temporally consistent, reproducible, and spatially comprehensive and representative Northern Hemisphere dataset with standardized geomorphic ontological definitions.Fig. 1</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Examples of slump landforms and subsidence areas detected in this study.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> General location of examples in the Eureka Sound Lowlands (~79 \u00b0N) that encompass south-eastern Axel Heiberg Island and west-central Ellesmere Island, Canada.

The hatched blue areas in (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>) and (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>) represent areas that would represent the slump as a landform (including the headwall, subsidence areas as well as areas of accumulating sediments such as debris tongues), furthermore, our methods have also detected RTS activity in areas producing other landforms, such as backwasting caused by dead ice in glacial moraines. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis> shows a field example of a slump (different from those shown in (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>) and (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>), but from the same area) taken from a helicopter in 2016 by M. Ward Jones. If the slump initiated within our monitoring period of 2012\u20132022 our detections represent the entire subsidence area and the output would look like the pink area in (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>), but if the slump initiated prior to 2012, this study only detected a narrow band of subsidence where the headwall actively retrogressed in the monitoring period and would look like the pink area in (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>). Furthermore, the orange lines represent areas of mass wasting so subsidence activity in subsequent years would retrogress beyond this boundary. The example in (b) can be found at 79.49\u00b0N; 86.84\u00b0W and (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>) at 79.61\u00b0N; 86.23\u00b0W.

These estimates are further correlated with climate variabilities and used to obtain a first-order estimate of soil organic carbon release.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Results</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RTS Distribution and Area Estimates</emphasis></p><p>The spatial distribution of medium- to large disturbance areas undergoing RTS ( \u226510,000 m2; minimum elevation change of 2 m) was obtained using deep learning detection models attuned to thaw-driven geomorphic RTS processes of annual subsidence (see Methods and Fig. 1). Sequential differencing of DEMs from the ArcticDEM time-series (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 440,949 strips52;) highlighted incremental surface elevation changes associated with the retrogression of ice-rich headwalls53, the timing and spatial pattern of which was used as a key distinctive feature during detection (termed the \u201c<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">rainbow</emphasis>\u201d pattern; Figs. 2c, S3e) that distinguished RTS from elevation changes caused by other landscape processes or time-series noise. After manual verification by topical experts, a total of 2747 disturbance areas undergoing RTS were retained across the Northern Hemisphere for which elevation change magnitudes were summarized (Fig. 2a). These verified sites reflect geomorphic change within a 10-year period (2012\u20132022), characterized by areas of active subsidence through annual thaw-driven headwall ablation and upslope expansion. The median and maximum RTS disturbance area was 20,680 m2 and 249,540 m2 (Fig. 3a), respectively, with a total disturbance area undergoing RTS in the Northern Hemisphere of 78.6 km2 (7860 ha). Compared to the pan-Arctic ground ice map54, 77% of RTS occurred in areas with high ground ice content (1.37 ha 1000 km\u22122; Fig. S10; ice content &gt;20%), 5% in areas with medium ground ice content (0.15 ha 1000 km\u22122; ice content between 10% and 20%) and 18% in areas with low ground ice content (0.20 ha 1000 km\u22122; ice content &lt;10%). The presence of RTS in low ground ice content areas provides insights on ice-rich permafrost distribution in that localized areas of high ground ice content are still possible within coarsely mapped low ground ice content regions.Fig. 2</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Spatial distribution of 2747 active retrogressive headwalls detected in this study.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> The median volume loss per year (unit m3/year) for each site undergoing retrogressive thaw slumping (RTS). <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis> Surface elevation changes for one large RTS (75\u00b037'19.2\u201cN 98\u00b039'54.0\u201cE) in Taymyr Peninsula, Russia.

In addition to the detection of RTS of common landscape positions and morphologies (i.e., next to fluvial channels or lakeshore- or coastline-based), the deep learning models also identified a series of RTS in Yakutia, Russia (Fig. S13b) that exhibit a different morphology, termed thermoterraces41, that are morphologically distinct from the typical crescent shape of slumps and are challenging to identify and delineate even by domain experts38. Other areas undergoing RTS were detected along current glacier margins in northern Greenland, Svalbard, near Klutlan Glacier, Canada; and in Novaya Zemlya, Russia, where glacier dead-ice backwasting occurs (Fig. S13f) (ref. 60). There are considerable geomorphological differences between dead-ice backwasting in recent ice-cored moraine complexes and RTS, yet the small number of large dead-ice backwasting detections (&gt;10,000 m2) were not manually excluded from the inventory as both mass wasting phenomena occur on ice-cored slopes, are thaw related, and exhibit similar elevation change \u201crainbow\u201d patterns due to their retrogressive, rotational sliding failure mechanisms39, 40\u201341. Furthermore, the strong linkage between RTS detections with modern-day glacier margins is compatible with RTS activity across northwestern Canada where terrain encompassing the former glacial margins of the Laurentide Ice Sheet contains relict glacier ice preserved by permafrost61.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Volumetric Estimates and Growth Dynamics</emphasis></p><p>We estimated terrain subsidence (total volume loss) as a result of headwall ablation and RTS growth over the last decade (2012\u20132022), with volume estimates consisting of ground ice loss and sediment release that would subsequently flow downslope (e.g., Fig. 18,22). The total volume loss for all 2747 areas undergoing RTS was (317.0 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 106 m3 between 2012 and 2022. The 25 and 100 largest RTS by volume loss (0.9% or 3.6% of total RTS count) contributed 31.0 and 75.3 \u00d7 106 m3 (10% and 24%) of the total volume loss, respectively, confirming the disproportionate impacts of the largest areas undergoing RTS8,31. Regional differences in RTS-driven subsidence indicate heterogeneity in the morphology of RTS, whereby the majority of the largest RTS are distributed in ice-cored moraine of Banks Island and the Peel Plateau, Canada (Fig. 2; and Table 1).Table 1</p><p>Summary statistics of RTS volumetrics by region</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"14\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"112\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"32\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"32\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"32\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"32\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"24\"/><colspec colname=\"col7\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"32\"/><colspec colname=\"col8\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"24\"/><colspec colname=\"col9\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"32\"/><colspec colname=\"col10\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"32\"/><colspec colname=\"col11\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"32\"/><colspec colname=\"col12\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"40\"/><colspec colname=\"col13\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"32\"/><colspec colname=\"col14\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"40\"/><thead><row><entry colname=\"col1\" morerows=\"1\">Northern Hemisphere sub-region</entry><entry colname=\"col2\" morerows=\"1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col3\" nameend=\"col5\" namest=\"col3\">Disturbance Area (m2)</entry><entry colname=\"col6\" nameend=\"col8\" namest=\"col6\">Depth (m)</entry><entry colname=\"col9\" nameend=\"col12\" namest=\"col9\">Volume (m3)</entry><entry colname=\"col13\" nameend=\"col14\" namest=\"col13\">Allometry</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col3\">Max</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Median</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">SD</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">Max</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">Median</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">SD</entry><entry colname=\"col9\">Max</entry><entry colname=\"col10\">Median</entry><entry colname=\"col11\">SD</entry><entry colname=\"col12\">Yield (million m3/year)</entry><entry colname=\"col13\"/><entry colname=\"col14\"/></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">1.

See Fig. 4 for the main regions on the map.</p><p>Across the Northern Hemisphere, the median ground surface elevation change for all medium-to-large RTS was \u22123 meters and the median volume loss was 62,484 m3 with a standard deviation of 167,125 m3 (Table 1, and Fig. 3b, c). Most RTS events (86.7%) considered in this study were &lt;200,000 m3 in size (&lt;400,000 m3 95.5%), and average and maximum headwall heights ranged considerably, between 1 to 10 m and 1 to 30 m, respectively (Fig. 3c, d). Larger RTS (by volume) were concentrated within narrow latitudinal bands of 67 \u00b0N and 81\u201382\u00b0N, while the highest headwalls were concentrated at latitudes 62\u00b0N and 65\u201368\u00b0N (Fig. 3e, f). The largest individual RTS by volume loss during the monitoring period occurred 30 km southwest of Aklavik, Canada (68\u00b0N) in the Willow River catchment8, totaling 3,584,000 \u00b1 54,000 m3, a retrogression area of 249,540 m2 (25 ha), and a maximum surface elevation change of \u221233 \u00b1 1 m. The RTS inventory also addressed knowledge gaps related to the volume loss from thawing headwalls and how that changes with further slump enlargement8,31. Our study shows a generally consistent (log10) power-law relationship between RTS area and volume loss across different regions in the Northern Hemisphere (Table 1, see \u201cMethods\u201d), with most regions clustered around a scaling exponent of 1.24\u20131.33. Larger regional contrasts do exist, e.g., scaling exponent ranging from 1.16 (in Plateaus and Plains of Northern Asia) to 1.36 (in Southern Nunavut), indicating a varying degree of non-linearity in the response of RTS expanding volumetrically with increasing area that are likely governed by regional topographic slope configurations and sub-surface conditions.</p><p>Temporal metrics provided insights into the annual dynamics of RTS. The majority (75%) of areas undergoing RTS yielded &lt;10,000 m3 annually (&lt;20,000 m3 89.6%), with median yields of 5013 m3 (Fig. 3g). Summarizing annual volumetric yields across regions (named after Provinces and Divisions as defined by62), RTS located in the Arctic Lowlands (e.g., Banks Island), Mackenzie Mountains, and Brooks Range (incl. Peel Plateau) exhibited the largest yields of 10.0, 4.1, and 4.1 million m3/year, respectively, due to their large population of areas undergoing RTS (Table 1). At a combined 18.2 million m3/year, these three regions contributed up to 56.8% of the observed annual yields across the Northern Hemisphere. The majority of RTS exhibited a relatively stable momentum in their annual yields (i.e., near 0 m3/year2), meaning that annual activity is neither accelerating or decelerating. However, as a whole Northern Hemisphere population, momentum was slightly positive with a mean of 179 m3/year2 (Fig. 3h) indicating a slight acceleration in annual volume loss. These momentum estimates are affected by pronounced annual peaks and lows of activity, but provide useful insights into the net long-term trends of RTS in the Northern Hemisphere as well as sub-regions. For example, across the Northern Hemisphere the decadal trend shows a slight increasing volume loss rate, with total volume loss per year showing peaks in 2016 and 2020 with lows in 2013 and 2018 (Fig. 4b), which are consistent with temperature peaks and troughs in these years (next Section). Temporal trends also varied across regions (Fig. 4c), some characterized by positive momentum with accelerating annual volumetrics, such as Plateaus and Plains of Northern Asia (PPNA) with an acceleration of (0.27 \u00b1 0.05) million m3/year2, Ural Mountains (UM) (UM Division includes Yugorsky Peninsula and Novaya Zemlya Archipelago) with (0.29 \u00b1 0.07) million m3/year2, and Brooks Range (BR) with (0.32 \u00b1 0.08) million m3/year2, while other regions are decelerating (volume loss decreases through time) such as Arctic Lowlands (AL) with (\u22120.5 \u00b1 0.3) million m3/year2. In addition to regional accelerations and decelerations, some temporal trends were characterized by mid-decadal peaks (e.g., Mackenzie Mountains and Brooks Range) while other regions remained constant (e.g., Mackenzie Lowlands, South Nunavut, and Mountains and Plateaus of Northeast Asia).Fig. 4</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Linkage between volume loss rate and air temperature.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> The correlation coefficients between volume loss per year and air temperature for each RTS.

Correlations were calculated for the same year as well as the previous year to account for pre-conditioning effects where an extreme summer one year leads to slope failure in the subsequent year (refs. 63,64). Across the Northern Hemisphere a total of 816 RTS (30%) showed strong positive correlations (r \u2265 0.5) (Fig. 4) with same-year air temperature, consistent with current literature43,56. A total of 329 RTS (12%) showed strong correlations (r &gt; =0.5) with same-year precipitation trends. Figure 5 highlights latitude-dependent differences in the linkage to temperature and precipitation, with individual RTS binned based on their latitudinal distribution. 71 \u00b0N marks the inflection point where RTS dynamics were predominantly driven by rising temperatures. The percentage of temperature-driven RTS (influenced by both the same year and previous year temperature) increased sharply from 40% to 88% (as percentage of RTS within their respective distribution bins, Fig. 5) as latitudes increased from 71\u00b0N\u201382\u00b0N, and the precipitation-driven RTS decreased linearly from 60% to 13% as latitudes increased from 60\u00b0N to 82\u00b0N. As shown in Fig. 5, preconditioning effects from climate in the previous year64 appear prominent at lower latitudes (&lt; 65\u00b0N), where the percentage of RTS affected by previous-year precipitation (27%) is greater than by same-year precipitation (14%), while at high latitudes(&gt;75\u00b0N), the percentage of RTS influenced by previous-year temperature (8%) is significantly lower than those affected by same-year temperature (42%).Fig. 5</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Relationships between climate variabilities and RTS activity vary by latitude.</emphasis></p><p>This figure shows the distribution of RTS as a function of latitude (black), and the percentage of RTS with strong positive correlation (r\u22650.5) with temperature (in red) or precipitation (in blue) from the same year (the percentage of RTS is based on individual RTS within their respective latitudinal distribution bins seen in black), and with temperature (yellow) or precipitation (cyan) from the previous year. The width of each fill color represents the percentage of RTS dominated by each driving factor. P and T in the legend represent precipitation and temperature, respectively.</p><p>The circumpolar assessment in this study demonstrates varied responses between RTS enlargement and climate drivers at the regional scale, agreeing with and further expanding on35. In the Plateaus and Plains of Northern Asia (PPNA), Northern Mountains (NM), Ural Mountains (UM), Arctic Lowlands (AL, including Banks Island, Victoria Island), 49%, 44%, 43%, 30% of RTS within those regions exhibited strong correlations (r \u2265 0.5) with temperature trends (from the same year); whereas in regions Mountains and Plateaus of Northeast Asia (MPNA), only 16% RTS showed strong correlation with temperature (from the same year). Region Mackenzie Mountains has the highest percentage of RTS (30%) correlated to precipitation trends (from the same year) agreeing with previous studies22,63, and in region Mackenzie Lowlands, temperature and precipitation played a similar role, with 18% of RTS correlated to temperature and 18% of RTS correlated to precipitation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Soil Organic Carbon Release</emphasis></p><p>Here we provide the estimate of soil organic carbon (SOC) release from RTS on a Northern Hemisphere scale using empirical volumetric subsidence rates. An estimated 1.95 \u00d7 10\u20133 Pg carbon per year (where 1 petagram =1 gigatonnes) was released between 2012 and 2022 for 96% of the detected RTS that were within the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database area (NCSC)65. The remaining RTS were located outside the database coverage (e.g., Northern Greenland, coastal margins). The NCSC only estimates the upper 3 m of soil, therefore these values are an under estimation for 979 RTS that had mean elevation changes between &gt;3 m and 19 m, however the highest carbon amounts have been shown to generally occur in the upper 3 m and decrease with depth58.</p><p>It could be argued that a large number of small disturbance areas undergoing RTS (area &lt;10,000 m2, small elevation changes) not considered in this study could lead to underestimations of carbon release. To estimate this effect, we used area-frequency distribution modeling and comparisons with detailed manual RTS inventories to estimate the total RTS population size and volumetrics of small areas undergoing RTS (Figs. S11a, S12), resulting in an additional 2244 to 12,514 areas or 18.0\u201363.8 \u00d7 106 m3 (see Methods). The inclusion of small RTS increases the total Northern Hemisphere volume estimate from 317.0 \u00d7 106 m3 to a range of 335 to 381 \u00d7 106 m3, and shows that the effect of undetected smaller RTS on carbon release is small, comprising only 5\u201317% of the estimated total volume.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Discussion</emphasis></p><p>This work presents the quantification of volumetric change from large areas undergoing RTS in the Northern Hemisphere between 2012 and 2022. This work has also generated a baseline inventory of active RTS and disturbance area, terrain subsidence (total volume loss), and annual volumetric yield estimates, that were correlated to climate variabilities and used to obtain a first-order estimate of soil organic carbon release. The detection models used in this study were attuned to the incremental surface elevation changes associated with the retrogression of ice-rich headwalls, i.e., visualized as time-transgressive rainbow patterns found in ArcticDEM53. The degree to which these signals were extracted (see \u201cMethods\u201d) and used in deep learning algorithms highlights continual advances in data availability and computing resources to further mature RTS mapping over large geographic extents. Furthermore, the presented ontology, methods, and results point to an important methodological improvement over existing methods using point or aerial detection and measurement approaches of RTS (e.g.,33, 34, 35\u201336). While there has been increasing interest in understanding the three-dimensional characterization and dynamics of RTS at local to regional scales, our study has identified important insights into the magnitude and distribution of hillslope retrogressive subsidence employing volumetric loss detections, non-linear scaling, and regional patterns of RTS &gt; 60\u00b0N latitude. For instance, the total reported volume loss observed between 2012 and 2022 (317.0 \u00b1 0.3 \u00d7 106 m3) and three-dimensional characterization (median elevation change \u22123 m, median volume loss 62,484 m3 \u00b1 167,125 m3, most RTS &lt;200,000 m3) help fill knowledge gaps to validate existing thermokarst, geohazard, earth system and emission assumptions and models (Fig. 317,18;). These models can be further refined in the future by taking into account updated estimates of annual volumetric losses (median: 5013 m3, majority &lt;10,000 m3), the regional or latitudinal differences in morphology and dynamics (i.e., headwall height, annual volumetrics), as well as knowledge of how the volumetric loss from thawing headwalls changes non-linearly with further slump enlargement (area-volume scaling). In terms of future expected RTS intensifications, we note that the mean momentum for individual RTS in the Northern Hemisphere was slightly positive (representing increasing volume loss through time) at 179 m3/year2 with specific regions characterized by either positive (Plateaus and Plains of Northern Asia, Ural Mountains, Brooks Range) or negative momentum (Arctic Lowlands), or exhibiting constant/mid-decadal peaks. It was beyond the scope of this study to determine the drivers behind the regional differences in volumes, depths, yields, scaling coefficients, or momentum, which should be considered in future work. Drivers governing these differences are most likely related to regional topographic slope configurations, subsurface conditions, landscape genesis (e.g., glacial legacy), and the most recent disturbance or thaw history (e.g., presence of old or ancient RTS disturbances, wildfire) (31,42,61,63,66). In terms of RTS intensity, of particular emphasis is the degree of concentration observed at local to regional scales, with the 100 largest disturbance areas undergoing RTS (3.6% of total count) contributing 24% of the total volume loss observed across the study area, and with the top three regions, specifically the Arctic Lowlands (e.g., Banks Island), Mackenzie Mountains, and Brooks Range (incl. Peel Plateau), yielding up to 56.8% of the observed annual yields across the Northern Hemisphere. This not only further confirms the disproportionate impacts of the largest areas undergoing RTS8,31, but also points to the continued importance of sustained local and regional monitoring with northern stakeholders in parallel to large-area initiatives such as presented here8,15,27.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Limitations and Uncertainties</emphasis></p><p>As with any large-scale compilation of mapped phenomena, there are limitations and uncertainties in the presented dataset and findings. In addition to common errors and noise in stereoscopic DEMs53, our approach contains limitations and sources of errors specifically related to the portion of a retrogressing landform under analysis (e.g., a slump), the temporal and geographic coverage of the ArcticDEM domain, and potential volumetric errors arising from sediment and snow. Firstly, from an ontological perspective, our method focused on detecting and measuring areas of active subsidence through DEM differencing, specifically detecting headwall retrogression between 2012 and 2022. The deep learning models were not trained to detect landforms produced by RTS (e.g., slumps) that include scar areas representing inactive areas. Rather, the models were trained to detect large contiguous areas undergoing RTS (as a geomorphic mass wasting process) with a minimum size of 10,000 m2 and a minimum elevation change of \u22122 m. The largest known slumps in the literature (e.g., the Peel Plateau\u2019s \u201cFM2\u201d or Russia\u2019s \u201cBatagay\u201d), considered megaslumps (landforms &gt;20 ha)22,43,67,68, are complex disturbances comprised of multiple smaller active headwalls as well as inactive areas. Although these two thaw slumps have headwalls 10\u2019s of meters high, activity is localized. The two specific slump landforms were not included in our dataset as they either did not meet the minimal size threshold, or due to other data limitations or surrounding noises that reduced the prominence of the rainbow pattern (Fig. S15b, e). Similar large, partially active RTS are missed in our analyses where minimum size or elevation change threshold of the actively subsiding area was not met. Heterogeneous activity across large disturbances and size constraints has also been reported by other detection studies (e.g., Batagay34;). Due to the minimum size or elevation change threshold adopted in this work, our dataset also excludes many small or shallow slumps characterized by smaller elevation changes (e.g., Fig. S15h26,69).</p><p>Secondly, an overall limitation of ArcticDEM is that the temporal resolution varies throughout its geographic coverage depending on the availability of stereographic pairs of images used to create the DEMs. Therefore, the temporal and geographic coverage of DEMs is not uniform across the study region. The ArcticDEM domain also does not include regions south of 60\u00b0N except for Alaska, southern Greenland, and the Kamchatka Peninsula and, therefore, does not cover the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, another known RTS hotspot36. Furthermore, classification based on the unique rainbow pattern reflecting the time-transgressive nature of RTS enlargement could miss detection of disturbances already initiated but with only two DEMs available for differencing. In this case, the corresponding rainbow pattern would be absent and thus not be included in the final RTS detection count. The large number of false positives before visual inspection (Table S4) were caused by various sources, such as other mass wasting, snow/glacier melt, and vegetation changes (e.g.,53).</p><p>Lastly, our analysis approach provided the mean elevation difference before and after the epoch with the most significant change for each pixel. This means elevation change may differ from a simple difference between the first and last DEM more commonly employed in geomorphology studies53. This is a potential source of error in volume estimates that are also found in other studies30 because the only measured change is within the active retrogressing area between two epochs. Reference 53 has shown that this commonly leads to under-estimations of volume losses and could therefore impact area-volume scaling coefficients, yet overall the expected impact to our Northern Hemisphere results and interpretations is low. Additionally, in order to conduct an analysis of RTS dynamics at this large scale we had to include winter scenes to ensure adequate temporal data coverage. Changes in snow cover between DEMs can cause an overestimation of measured RTS subsidence, because elevation differences would measure loss of sediments and snow when differencing a summer and winter scene70. Differencing two winter scenes would likely mitigate some effect of snow if snow depths are similar. Despite these limitations, this study represents the quantification of the volume and three-dimensional dynamics of RTS in the Northern Hemisphere, which was made possible by collaboration between remote sensing scientists and disciplinary experts.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Volumetric Estimates and Links to Climate Variability</emphasis></p><p>A second objective of this study was to correlate the annual volumetric yield estimates with climate variability. We observed that 57% of RTS had growth dynamics that were either correlated with ERA5 temperature or precipitation trends from the same or previous year. RTS dynamics were predominantly driven by temperature increases at high latitudes, and RTS dynamics are most strongly linked to climate from the previous year at lower latitudes (&lt;65\u00b0N). In areas where temperature dominates the driver for RTS activity (e.g., &gt;71\u00b0N, climate-driven permafrost56,71), the volume loss rates are negatively correlated with precipitation time series (Fig. S14; Ellesmere Island). Higher latitude areas correspond with the distribution of Arctic polar desert environments72,73 that do not have enough precipitation to impact RTS retreat and the only moisture source to aid in sediment evacuation is from the ice face from the RTS headwall74. In contrast, permafrost in lower latitudes increasingly relies on ecosystem protection to persist71, which buffers against air temperature increases unless other disturbances coincide that initiate and/or sustain RTS63,67.</p><p>With respect to direct linkages between RTS growth dynamics and climate variabilities, it is worth emphasizing that 43% of RTS were neither correlated with ERA5 temperature nor precipitation trends from the same or previous year. It indicates that other drivers (e.g., ground ice exposure and local heterogeneity) introduce considerable variation in this observed temperature effect. Furthermore, as individual disturbances evolve and slope gradients change they can decouple from climate8,56. Limitations also arise from the heterogeneity in the accuracy and representativeness of ERA5 trends due to the limited number of Arctic weather stations and the short amount of yearly measurements (n ~ 10, Fig. 2d) used in this study. There is not a strong singular effect of temperature on RTS volumetric activity for lower latitudes (&lt;71\u00b0N), which suggests it is not advisable to conduct risk assessments for the Northern Hemisphere purely on temperature trends alone75 without taking into account terrain conditions (ground ice, surficial geology, etc.) as primary explanatory variables. Future work should consider additional lagged or cumulative effects, as well as the importance of shorter-term extreme climatic events (e.g.,22,35,56). Overall, the results highlight there is a need for long-term and high temporal resolution monitoring and a densification of weather stations across the Arctic as ERA5 trends may be too coarse and imprecise to conduct local or regional correlations regarding RTS dynamics.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon Release Estimates and Its Uncertainties</emphasis></p><p>Carbon release from abrupt permafrost thaw is estimated to contribute approximately half of total permafrost carbon release from ~20% land area within the permafrost zone compared to carbon release from the gradual thawing of permafrost soils18. Within the modeling results by18, hillslope erosion, primarily from RTS, contributed to one-third of carbon release from abrupt permafrost thaw, or ~13% of carbon emissions compared to gradual thaw. While the amount of SOC released by RTS is not negligible, our estimate representing carbon released by abrupt thaw from subsidence processes suggests that the proportion of carbon released by RTS is less than initial model estimates. Our calculated value of ~1.95 \u00d7 10\u22123 Pg carbon per year within our time period is much less (~0.2%) compared to what was estimated (using modeling) to be released annually from gradual thawing permafrost (~1 Pg carbon per year)11. The impact of the RTS missed in the deep learning detection is likely small, around 20% (recall is high, 77%\u201380% - Table S3). Nevertheless, the carbon release is likely underestimated because some RTS are missed due to a less prominent time transient change pattern if only a single year of retrogression occurred during the observation period or if the disturbance area was affected by surrounding noise. The mean depth of elevation loss is 3 m, so our estimates represent at least average conditions within the study domain. Reference 58 found that the depths exceeding 3 m contributed to 15\u201320 % volume change and 5 to 10 % of total soil carbon mobilization. In our dataset, excluding carbon at depths greater than 3 m represents 30 % of volume with no carbon estimate. Ground ice content was not included in our carbon release estimate because the uppermost layers are comprised of the active layer and ice-poor permafrost above massive ice19. We believe the underestimation of not including the deeper ground layers offsets this potential overestimation for RTS with ground ice within the upper 3 m of soil.</p><p>While our study shows less overall carbon release from RTS process, field studies19,20 on the Peel Plateau have shown that released carbon is sequestered within redistributing and accumulating sediments (e.g., debris tongues, Fig. 1c) by becoming chemically bound through interactions with mineral soil. While variations in net carbon release vary regionally76, likely due to variation in carbon content of near-surface and deeper permafrost19, overall, our study along with these recent field studies19,20,76 point to net carbon released by RTS to be of lower magnitude than initially suggested by modeling18 and merits future work to better constraint values. Finally, most models focusing on the impacts of climate change on carbon release rely on increases in air temperature as a driver of thaw. Our Northern Hemisphere scale results of RTS dynamics show that only a subset of RTS dynamics correlate with ERA5 air temperature dynamics. While RTS may have less of an impact on carbon dynamics than initial modeling efforts have suggested, these processes still generate transformative impacts to the landscapes and ecosystems they are located in (e.g.,8,77,78). Their broad distribution, increasing size and dynamics, and general associations with a warmer and wetter climate highlight the importance of understanding complex interactions between thaw-driven mobilization and resequestration of organic carbon on the landscape and through aquatic systems (e.g.,8,19). We can anticipate that RTS will be a dominant, rapid modifier of many ice-rich permafrost landscapes in a warming circumpolar world, so bridging process knowledge of landscape evolution with geochemical and ecosystem impacts, and quantitative remote sensing assessments that track intensity and magnitudes of change at broad scales highlights the need for advancing multiscale assessments, and for interdisciplinary collaboration.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methods</emphasis></p><p>The ArcticDEM project51 provides a large collection of very high spatial resolution (2 m), open-access, and time-dependent DEMs covering the entire northern hemisphere landmass above 60 \u00b0N, as well as all of Alaska, Greenland and the Kamchatka Peninsula, enabling new opportunities for detecting and quantifying RTS. The ArcticDEM data are derived from sub-meter resolution (~0.5 m) stereo-pair images from the Maxar satellite constellation, including Worldview-1 (launched 2007), 2 (2009), 3 (2014), and GeoEye-1 (2008). ArcticDEM DEMs are created using stereophotogrammetry applied to overlapping pairs of images79, including pairs from the same or different orbital passes (i.e., in-track or cross-track pairs) and combinations of different sensors79.</p><p>The latest release of ArcticDEM (ArcticDEM strips version 4.1, Release October 2023) includes 440,949 time-dependent DEM strips across the Arctic. ArcticDEM data undergo basic automated quality control and filtering for errors due to clouds, shadows, detector saturation80, water surfaces, and other sources using algorithms developed by the ArcticDEM project team. To better preserve the original data, version 4.1 includes the error masks as separate files instead of applying the masks as in previous versions52,81.</p><p>The overall workflow for RTS detection is summarized in Fig. S1. It consisted of data preparations (Step 1: DEM co-registration and change detection) followed by an initial classification using simple raster-based thresholds (Step 2). This was followed by a multi-step deep-learning approach with iterative model training and validation using several training datasets and data augmentation approaches (Step 3). Finally, a two-step inspection approach using semi-automated decision rules followed by a manual inspection by subject matter experts reduced the sample size to its presented form (Table S4, Step 4).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Step 1: Retrieving surface elevation change from DEM time series</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Co-registration of DEMs using bundle adjustment</emphasis></p><p>The DEMs have an internal (pixel-to-pixel) accuracy of ~30 cm (1 sigma)82. Nevertheless, biases in the horizontal and vertical directions give an external (absolute) accuracy of several meters, caused by the errors in sensor models83,84. These biases can be removed through coregistration83,85 and the bundle adjustment of translational offsets among repeat DEMs82. Validation experiments over unchanging surfaces show that this coregistration reduces the uncertainty in elevation measurements to the random error in the DEMs of ~0.3 m ~ 0.5 m82,83,86,87. DEMs with consistently poor pairwise coregistration residuals are then identified as bad data and are removed. Note that to mitigate long-wavelength errors (e.g., tilt) (e.g.,86) in DEMs, we divide these DEMs into 2 km by 2 km tiles and carry out the coregistration and bundle adjustment within the small tiles.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Automated change detection algorithm</emphasis></p><p>After coregistering DEMs, we developed automatic algorithms to detect the magnitude and time of the change in the ground surface elevation time series. First, we detect the time of the change by differencing the elevation between sequential observation times. A sudden change in the time series will appear as an outlier/spike in the differenced time series. The advantage of this method is that the differenced time series should cluster around zero (within the noise and seasonal variability) if no abrupt change occurs. The elevation difference is:1where <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">y</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">j</emphasis> is the elevation in meters at time <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">j</emphasis>, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">e</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">j</emphasis> is the measurement noise. The largest value for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">y</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">j</emphasis>-<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">y</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">j\u20131</emphasis> will be considered as a potential event of elevation change if it further conforms to a significance criterion, e.g., larger than 3 times the root mean square errors, and the time range of the event would be between <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">j\u20131</emphasis>and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">j</emphasis>. The temporal resolution of the event time estimate is mainly limited by the temporal resolution of satellite imagery acquisitions. After estimating the event time, the elevation change can be calculated using a linear model based on the Heaviside step function, as demonstrated in88. Its uncertainty is estimated based on the posteriori variance of unit weight and error propagation88. For reader\u2019s convenience, it is reiterated here:2where <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">y</emphasis> is the surface elevation in meters at time <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> (in years), <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">e</emphasis> is the time of the change, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H</emphasis> is the Heaviside step function, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a</emphasis> represents the surface elevation before the event and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">b</emphasis> is the to-be-estimated elevation change magnitude, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a</emphasis> + <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">b</emphasis> represents the surface elevation after the event.</p><p>We then constructed maps of event time of change, elevation change, and uncertainty by applying the above algorithm for each pixel on a regular 2 m grid within a 2 km by 2 km tile. Examples of these maps, shown in Fig. S2(a,d), display both real surface changes caused by mass wasting and deposits, as well as noise. The elevation change profile (Fig. S2(c)) shows that the magnitude of elevation change increases with the terrain elevation. The detected time of change (Fig. S2(d, f)) demonstrates how this RTS developed retrogressively over the years, where the time of change near the headwall is most recent (2015), and the left of the area had slumping activities in 2013, 2011, and 2010 (earliest where it is furthest away from the headwall). Another characteristic of the time of change map is that the estimated time is locally homogeneous over the depletion zone, but random in other areas.</p><p>Fig. S3 demonstrates the sample products from our change detection processing, which include 6 data types for each area. The 6 data types are the elevation change map, the uncertainty of the elevation change, the time of the change T1 (date of the closest DEM data before the detected change), the time of the change T2 (date of the closest DEM data after the change), the number of overlapping DEMs in the area, and the flag of confidence levels for the estimated elevation change at each pixel.</p><p>The confidence level is classified for each pixel using the following conditions:</p><p>Estimated time is homogeneous locally;</p><p>Elevation change uncertainty &lt; 2 m;</p><p>Elevation change &lt;\u22122 m;</p><p>The elevation change estimate should be larger than 3 fold the uncertainty, and the total number of overlapping DEMs is at least 4;</p><p>Total area of the selected cluster &gt;200 m2.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Step 2: Simple classification based on thresholds</emphasis></p><p>From the elevation change maps generated by the change detection algorithm, we then classify potential RTS with a simple thresholding method. The following criteria are used for classifying potential RTS:</p><p>Surface elevation changes \u2264 \u22121 meter, and total area &gt;2000 m2.</p><p>Within the polygon, there is at least one pixel with a high confidence level.</p><p>The standard deviation of the time of change (T1) within the selected cluster &gt;1 year.</p><p>For two regions under consideration, based on only criterion 1, the total number of RTS candidates is 936,370 for Victoria, Canada (also identified as Region 9) and 9498 for a 50 km by 50 km area in Peel Plateau, Northwest Territories (Table S1). Criterion 3 is designed to identify slumps with multiple thawing periods that display the distinctive \u201crainbow\u201d pattern. Adding criteria 2 and 3, the total number of RTS candidates is reduced by 8 ~ 50 times.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Step 3a: Mask R-CNN for RTS classification with training set 1</emphasis></p><p>To detect RTS in images and generate segmentation masks, we adopt the algorithm Mask R-CNN (Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network)89, which has been widely recognized as a promising semantic segmentation algorithm across broad scientific applications (e.g.,90, 91, 92, 93\u201394). Mask R-CNN extends the previous Faster R-CNN architecture95 to include pixel-level segmentation on top of bounding box recognition. We use the open-source detection and segmentation software Detectron296, which is the latest implementation of the Mask R-CNN algorithm89. Deep learning models in this study are trained with Nvidia A100-SXM Tensor Core GPUs on Google Colab.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Training data preparation</emphasis></p><p>We collected three bands of data as the input for deep learning. As shown in Fig. S4(a), based on criteria 1\u20133 only, it is difficult to distinguish RTS from other surface changes, such as ground surface changes around gullies. Hence, two extra bands of information are added as input images. Band 2 is the DEM total curvature97, which shows distinct patterns near gullies and RTS, e.g., the curvature is high and outlines the headwalls of RTS (Fig. S4g), whereas the curvature shows skeleton features along gullies (Fig. S4c). Band 3 is the time of change map, which shows unique \u201crainbow\u201d patterns for RTS (Figs. S4h, Fig. S3e), whereas it shows random patterns near gullies (Fig. S4d). The 3-band images (Fig. S4e and i) are then rescaled to integers between 0 and 255, which are the input images for Mask R-CNN.</p><p>Each RTS candidate from Step 2 was prepared in a format compatible with the Detectron2 software. We applied a 100 m buffer around the outline, and then the 3-band images, RTS outlines, and bounding boxes were used as the input for Detectron2. The image sample size ranges from ~10,000 m\u00b2 to 500,000 m\u00b2. The RTS polygons were labeled as one class \u2018slump\u2019. The labeling information including coordinates of polygons outlining the boundary of RTS, bounding box, class types, and file size is exported as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files in COCO (Common Objects in Context) format to be read by the Detectron2 software. By scrutinizing candidates from Step 2 in Victoria, Canada, we manually selected the ones with strong \u201crainbow\u201d patterns as the training and validation data. Training and validation data were randomly split with a ratio of 9:1. The training data contains a total of 900 images, and validation data contains a total of 104 images (Fig. S5).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Training model</emphasis></p><p>Using the training data set, we fine-tuned a pre-trained Mask R-CNN model (mask_rcnn_X_101_32x8d_FPN_3x.yaml) available in Detectron2\u2019s model library. Referring to the configuration of training parameters in the literature92,93, the learning rate (cfg.SOLVER.BASE_LR) is set as 0.00025, and the maximum iteration (cfg.SOLVER.MAX_ITER) is set as 48000, and the threshold for prediction confidence score (cfg.MODEL.ROI_HEADS.SCORE_THRESH_TEST) is set as 0.7.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prediction and evaluation</emphasis></p><p>We adopt the inventory of RTS in the Peel Plateau, Northwest Territories from Segal et al. (2016b) as the ground truth for evaluation. The inventory provides outlines of RTS derived from Quickbird imagery (0.6 m resolution) and SPOT imagery (10 m resolution). We further only selected RTS that show signals from our ArcticDEM data, i.e., the ones that coincide with our RTS candidates from Step 2. The selected 83 RTS in a 50 km by 50 km area in Peel Plateau are used as ground truth (Fig. S5b).</p><p>After training, the model prediction is applied to test images for evaluation. The output of prediction for each image is the 2D mask of classified RTS. We remove all clusters with an area of less than 2000 m2. To evaluate the performance of deep learning classification, we adopt the metric intersection over union (IoU). IoU is defined as the ratio of the intersection of two areas to the union of two areas. The threshold for IoU is set as 0.1. A polygon is classified as a true positive if the IoU is larger than the threshold, and a false positive if otherwise.</p><p>As shown in Fig. S5b and Table S2, there are 83 true positives in this 50 km by 50 km tile area in the Peel Plateau. The criteria 1\u20133 in Step 2 can successfully recover 77 true positives yet failed to filter out 1161 false positives. The deep learning results can reduce the number of false positives by 23%. We further combine the two solutions, by only selecting candidates that have more than 50% of areas classified as RTS by deep learning. This combination of deep learning and criteria 1\u20133 reduces the number of false positives by 3 times from 1161 to 357. This combination, by requiring the agreement of two methods to be better than 50%, removes a large number of false positives. As demonstrated in Figure S6a, for the ground truth Slump FM327, the cluster from criteria 1\u20133 and deep learning show a good agreement, yielding a true positive. For the uppermost cluster, the deep learning indicated pixels (red) are much less than that from criteria 1\u20133 (white), which indicates bad agreements, leading to a rejection of that cluster. However, a substantial number of false positives still remain, leading to a low precision of 17% (Table S2).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Step 3b: Mask R-CNN for RTS classification with training set 2</emphasis></p><p>After the first iteration of applying the deep learning algorithm (from training data set 1) on several regions, we further manually selected a group of RTS across broader regions as a second training data. The manual selection of training data sets was conducted in QGIS, by visually scrutinizing each candidate shapefile on top of the time of change base map. The candidate shapefile that encloses an area with the \u201crainbow\u201d pattern is classified as a true RTS. The dataset is randomly split into training and validation sets at a 9:1 ratio, resulting in 1660 training images and 189 validation images (Fig. S7).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Data augmentation and ensemble modeling</emphasis></p><p>Considering that the available training data size is relatively small, data augmentation techniques (e.g.,91,92) were applied to minimize overfitting. The adopted data augmentation includes rotation, translation, rescaling, and flipping, which increases the sample size by 25 times. The precision and recall of five different models are compared for Peel Plateau as shown in Table S3. The overall issue is that the results have too many false positives, which yield a low precision. Data augmentation in fact unfavorably increases the number of false positives, e.g., 524 vs 357 for model 1aug (with augmentation) and model 1 (without augmentation). Using the training data set 2, the number of true positives increases slightly, but the number of false positives also increases. The ensemble model is retrieved by applying a logical AND operator to all individual model outputs. Since individual models may detect different false positives, when combined, the overlap of common false positives reduces, hence enhancing the precision (Fig. S6b). For the test area in Peel Plateau, the ensemble combination of five models (Table S3) reduces the number of false positives from 357 to 210. Yet, the precision remained low, only 24%.</p><p>The prediction performance shows regional variations due to different land cover and environmental settings such as vegetation cover, snow and ice cover, and water bodies. Further evaluation is carried out in Eureka, Canada (Fig. S5c56), which represents the Arctic desert environment with little vegetation. There are 45 RTS as ground truth in this test area manually examined by subject experts. Due to minimal impact from vegetation changes, the ensemble model achieves a considerably higher precision of 65% and a recall of 77% (Table S3). The performance differences across land cover types indicate limited spatial transferability of our method.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Step 4</emphasis></p><p>After deep learning, we carried out a full visual inspection to ensure reliable results and achieve high precision. We visually assessed the polygons based on Google satellite images and the \u201crainbow\u201d patterns in the time of change maps derived in this study. Additional visual inspection using ESRI satellite imagery basemap, Yandex Maps satellite imagery basemap and multi-year PlanetScope satellite imagery were carried out. Randolph glacier inventory maps98 were also used to mask out glacier areas. We further used a priori information for references including ground ice content maps54 and published RTS (Fig. S8). The final selection of RTS is listed in Table S4, which includes a total of 2747 RTS.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Volume estimation</emphasis></p><p>We divide the entire RTS into sub-areas by the time of change in years. For each year, we estimate the volume change per year using this equation:where <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A</emphasis> is the area of a single pixel (e.g., 4 m2), <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">h</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> is the height change at each pixel, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">N</emphasis> is the total number of pixels within the RTS of a given year.  is the time span in years. It\u2019s noted that satellite sampling interval may undesirably scale the volume loss rate. For example, if there are two acquisitions in April and September, the satellite interval will yield a half-year time difference, where it actually means the change occurred in one summer year. Hence we use the number of summer years as the time difference instead of using the precise satellite acquisition dates. Here,  represents the count of summers (summer defined as the period from June 20th to September 22nd each year) within the measurements\u2019 time span. If an acquisition occurs before the summer of a year, the time is labeled as the previous year.</p><p>Following the method in80, the uncertainty of volume per year is calculated as:Where  is the standard deviation of the estimated volume per year.  is the covariance between height error at pixel <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> and pixel <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">j</emphasis>. The covariance can be empirically calculated using the periodogram method80,99 (Fig. S9).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Population size and volumetric estimation of small RTS</emphasis></p><p>Two avenues were pursued to model the total volumetrics of small RTS ( &lt;10,000 m2), namely area-frequency distribution modeling and through comparisons with detailed manual RTS inventories.</p><p>The active RTS detected in this study yield a power law area-frequency distribution (Fig. S11a), which can be modeled using equation:where <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A</emphasis> is the RTS headwall expansion area observed between 2012\u20132022 (m2), <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> is the probability density,  and  are coefficients. The fitting of the area-frequency distribution yields =2.5 \u00b1 0.2, =(2.7 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10\u22125. This power law distribution indicates that the number of RTS increases as the headwall expansion area decreases. The modeled parameters predict that the number of small active RTS (headwall expansion area &lt;10,000 m2) is about 2244 (upper-bound: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 3444). Considering the area-volume relationship (next section), the estimated total volume of small active RTS is about 18 \u00d7 106 m3 (upper-bound: 27 \u00d7 106 m3), which is a small percentage (5\u20138%) of the estimated total volume of small and medium to large RTS ((317.0 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 106 m3). This prediction is consistent with the observation of 83 RTS in Peel Plateau (Fig. S5b), where small RTS (2000 m2 \u2264expansion area &lt;10,000 m2) represent 45% of the total count, yet only 12% of the total scar area.</p><p>The area distribution obtained in this study was compared to eight detailed RTS inventories. To do so required careful assessment of RTS ontologies and definitions used in the respective inventories. For example,30\u2019s inventory represents annual average area change using medium resolution DEM differencing, whereas31\u2019s multi-temporal inventory leveraging high resolution data was used to manually calculate annual average active area changes (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 186) given that this inventory method also included inactive and partially active RTS. Reference 100\u2019s inventory reflect 2002 and 2018 epochs, the areas of which were differenced to obtain annual average change estimates. Furthermore, other inventories commonly cited in the literature, such as24,45,55,63,101,102 are manual single-epoch delineations that typically reflect larger RTS scar zone areas, and not solely the area of active subsidence measured within a specific time period as in this work. We multiplied the scar area estimates with a mean standardized growth rate of 1.34% (i.e., twice the long-term rate observed between 1950\u20131960 and 2004\u20132008 in55 to account for RTS intensifications in the last two decades) to obtain an estimate of annual area change. Then all samples of the eight inventories were prorated to reflect a 10-year change estimate consistent with this work. The eight inventories (Fig. S12a,b) were characterized by a substantial number of small RTS (with active subsidence area &lt;10,000 m2 over a decade), specifically 82% of total counts (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 6736 small RTS versus 1520 medium-to-large RTS). This estimate does not include inactive RTS or those active for less than a decade35. These percentages differed among source imagery resolutions and among studies (Fig. S12c,d). If these percentages are generally consistent across the Northern Hemisphere we would expect that the number of areas undergoing RTS detected in this study (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 2747) represents about 18% of all active RTS over a decadal period, for a total Northern Hemisphere population of small RTS of 12,514. Considering the area-volume relationship, the estimated total volume of small active RTS based on this population estimate is 63.6 \u00d7 106 m3, which is 17% of the combined estimated total volume of small and medium to large RTS.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Area-volume relationship</emphasis></p><p>The volume of thawed material scales exponentially with RTS area8,31. Rates of RTS expansion and intensification across scales (or landslides in general) are typically quantified using area-volume allometry, which is a structural trait and an important indicator of potential nonlinearity effects31,103. The 2747 active RTS from this study provided a precise estimation and interpretation of allometric model coefficients for regional populations as well as the Arctic as a whole using high spatial resolution data:where, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A</emphasis> is the retrogressing headwall area (m2), <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">V</emphasis> is the corresponding volume loss (m3),  is the scaling factor,  is the scaling exponent31. As shown in Fig. S11b, the power-law relationship between headwall area and volume is evident and convergent in our product. A least-squares adjustment yields  = 1.30 \u00b1 0.01 and  =\u22120.83 \u00b1 0.05, with most regions clustered around  = 1.24 to 1.33 (Table 1) indicating a consistent and non-linear headwall yield with slump enlargement across most of the Arctic. RTS belonging to the Plateaus and Plains of Northern Asia and Southern Nunavut represented allometric endmembers, with  = 1.16 and 1.36, respectively (Table 1). In the former region  suggests that headwall volume loss grows primarily with increasing planform area with little increase in the absolute depth (i.e., nearing linear growth model31). In the latter region  suggests that the relative depth of thaw grows non-linearly but not quite in proportion to the planform area (i.e.,  = 1.5; self-similarity growth model31). Small differences in the allometric scaling exponent represent large volume differences, e.g., applying = 1.5 instead of = 1.4 produces a volume difference of a factor of 2104,105. This sensitivity also means that  is difficult to directly compare against other studies using a landform-type definition of RTS, with8 and31 estimating  of 1.45 and 1.36, respectively, based on very high resolution data in the Beaufort Delta (Canada), or using coarser data across several regions indicating ranges between 1.05 to 1.3730.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate variability data</emphasis></p><p>To estimate Arctic air temperature, we used the surface air temperature (at 2-meter height) estimates from the hourly ECMWF Reanalysis version 5 (ERA5) data with 0.25\u00b0 grid size106. CRU TS (Climatic Research Unit gridded Time Series, v. 4.07) surface air temperature dataset107 was also used for comparison (figure not shown). The precipitation data were from the hourly ERA5 dataset (total precipitation)106. The total precipitation is the accumulated liquid and frozen water, comprising rain and snow, that falls to the Earth\u2019s surface. The mean values are calculated for all RTS sites during the selected summer months (July and August).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Soil organic carbon estimate</emphasis></p><p>We used the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database (NCSCD)65,108 to estimate the amount of soil organic carbon (SOC) released in the upper 3 m of permafrost by RTS. We used the shapefile version of the dataset and the NCSCD provides a SOC mass (SOCM) estimate for each polygon within the database. We assume that the proportion of SOCM to be constant within each dataset polygon, therefore we calculated the area proportion for each individual RTS and applied this value to SOCM values. The NCSCD divides the SOCM for each 1 m interval for the upper 3 m of soil. Based on the mean elevation of individual RTS, we summed the SOCM data layers accordingly, meaning, for example, RTS with a mean elevation change of 2 m only considered the SOCM amount in the upper 2 m. Due to data availability, RTS with elevation changes of greater than 3 m still only considered the SOCM amounts in the upper 3 m. A total of 10 RTS had mean elevation changes of 1 m, 857 RTS of 2 m, 793 RTS of 3 m and 979 RTS of greater than 3 m, respectively. There were 108 RTS that were located outside of the NCSCD dataset and were not included in the SOCM estimate.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>C.D., M.W.J., I.H., A.L., and J.F. was supported by NASA Earth Surface and Interior Program grant 80NSSC20K0491.

Both trends are aided by rapid warming in the high northern latitudes, which is happening twice as fast as the global average.</p><p>The study reveals a worrying increase in not only the extent of forest wildfires over the last two decades, but also their severity. The carbon combustion rate, a measure of fire severity based on how much carbon is emitted per unit of area burned, increased by almost 50% across forests globally between 2001 and 2023.</p><p>The work involved an international team of scientists - from the UK, the Netherlands, US, Brazil and Spain - who warn that further expansion of forest fires can only be averted if the primary causes of climate change, such as fossil fuel emissions, are tackled.</p><p>Lead author Dr Matthew Jones, of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at UEA, said: \"Increases in both the extent and severity of forest fires have led to a dramatic rise in the amount of carbon emitted by forest fires globally.</p><p>\"Startling shifts in the global geography of fires are also under way, and they are primarily explained by the growing impacts of climate change in the world's boreal forests.</p><p>\"To protect critical forest ecosystems from the accelerating threat of wildfires, we must keep global warming at bay and this underscores why it is so vital to make rapid progress towards net zero emissions.\"</p><p>Dr Thais Rosan, from the University of Exeter, added: \"The findings of this study demonstrate the significance of fire geography and illustrate that fire disturbance represent a critical and growing threat to the global efforts to combat climate change.</p><p>\"The frequency and intensity of forest fires in the extratropics are increasing, representing a significant risk to areas that constitute a substantial proportion of the global net land carbon sink.</p><p>\"As fire intensity and severity rise, the capacity of these forests to continue storing carbon is increasingly threatened.</p><p>\"To achieve international climate targets, it is essential to address the impact of these wildfires, which risk undermining the potential of forests to act as long-term carbon sinks and mitigate the effects of climate change.\"</p><p>Threats to carbon storage</p><p>Forests are of worldwide importance for carbon storage, with their growth helping to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and reduce rates of global warming.</p><p>They also play a crucial role in meeting international climate targets, with reforestation and afforestation schemes being implemented to remove carbon from the atmosphere and offset human CO2 emissions from hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and certain industries.</p><p>The success of these schemes relies on carbon being stored in forests permanently, and wildfires threaten that.</p><p>Extratropical fires are already emitting half a billion tonnes more CO2 than two decades ago, and the long-term effect depends on how forests recover. More widespread and severe forest fires are a sign that emissions are now out of balance with the carbon captured by post-fire recovery.</p><p>Dr Jones, a NERC Independent Research Fellow, said: \"The steep trend towards greater extratropical forest fire emissions is a warning of the growing vulnerability of forests and it poses a significant challenge for global targets to tackle climate change.</p><p>\"We know that forests rebound poorly after the most severe fires, so there is huge interest in how the observed increases in fire severity will influence carbon storage in forests over the coming decades. This demands our close attention.\"</p><p>Escalating wildfire impacts masked until now</p><p>Significantly, the increased emissions from forest fires contrasts with the reduced burning of the world's tropical savannahs during the same period. Previous studies have shown that, since 2001, the area burned by all fires (forest and non-forest) fell by a quarter globally, mainly due to this.</p><p>The latest findings are important because forest fires burn more severely and release larger amounts of harmful smoke to the atmosphere than savannah grassland fires, presenting major threats to those living near fires and to more distant communities exposed to poor air quality caused by smoke.</p><p>The authors say the study debunks the narrative that falling overall annual area burned by fire globally means falling wildfire impact.</p><p>\"Until now, reduced burning in the already fire-prone savannahs and grasslands has masked increases in forest fire extent and severity that are hugely consequential for society and the environment,\" said Dr Jones. \"Our work shows that fires are increasingly happening where we don't want them to - in forests, where they present the greatest threat to people and to vital carbon stores.\"</p><p>Managing wildfires</p><p>Machine learning was key to unlocking new observations about the shifting global geography of forest fires. It was used to group the world's forest ecoregions into 12 distinct pyromes, allowing the researchers to isolate the effects of climate change from other influencing factors such as land use.</p><p>This knowledge also reveals new insights into which strategies can be most effective for mitigating wildfires and protecting forests. Dr Jones said: \"Substantial financing is required to support strategic programs of forest management, stakeholder engagement, and public education, all of which represent a meaningful shift of fire management strategy from largely reactive to increasingly proactive.</p><p>\"For example, priority areas for forest management and fire breaks must be defined based on proactive monitoring of forest productivity, particularly in the extratropics. Managing fuel loads in places where they could present greatest danger during fire-favourable weather is a key priority for limiting the severity and impact of fires when they do occur.\"</p><p>The paper is entitled: \"Global rise in forest fire emissions linked to climate change in the extratropics.\"</p><p>The work was supported by funders including the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), European Commission Horizon 2020 programme, and European Space Agency.</p><p>* * *</p><p>JOURNAL: Science <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.ado6828\">https://doi.org/10.1126/science.ado6828</url></p><p>* * *</p><p>Original texct here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://news.exeter.ac.uk/research/global-co2-emissions-from-forest-fires-increase-by-60/\">https://news.exeter.ac.uk/research/global-co2-emissions-from-forest-fires-increase-by-60/</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-8887166 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8887166</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DB2-HT21-JC11-119S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1249\"/><timeReceived>1:17 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"10\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>October 22, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
