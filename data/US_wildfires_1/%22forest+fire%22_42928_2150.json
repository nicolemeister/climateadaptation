While fires are nothing new to California, their severity has intensified in the past few decades, largely due to climate change and development in fire-prone areas, according to research.</p><p>Since 2008, there have been nearly 30 major wildfires in Sonoma County, with the 2019 Kincade Fire being the largest single fire in the county\u2019s history, burning a total of 77,758 acres, according to Cal Fire.</p><p>Looking back on the county\u2019s fire history before the turn of the century, familiar burn scars foreshadowed bigger blazes to come.</p><p>Repeat west county blazes</p><p>The west county area has been subject to wildfires for at least as long as records have been kept, often spurring residents to action.</p><p>An April 4, 1917, article in The Press Democrat told of a group of Guerneville residents who organized a volunteer firefighting force seven months after a large forest fire broke out near Kidd Creek that threatened the nearby towns of Cazadero and Guerneville.</p><p>A few months later, a forest fire again erupted near Guerneville, which took the new fire crew several days to get under control, according to a July 26, 1917, San Francisco Call article.</p><p>Fires also broke out in the outskirts of Guerneville in September 1923, and along Armstrong Grove and near Guerneville\u2019s former quicksilver mines in November 1929, according to articles in the HealdsburgTribune and Petaluma Argus at the time.</p><p>According to a Sept. 5, 1961, Press Democrat article, the biggest forest fire in the area\u2019s history at the time was a blaze, believed to be started by an arsonist, that burned more than 6,000 acres from Guerneville to east Cazadero, destroying 22 structures. Then the 1978 Creighton Ridge Fire, between Cazadero and Fort Ross, doubled those figures \u2014 charring 12,000 acres and burning down more than 50 structures.</p><p>The 2020 Walbridge Fire burned more than 55,000 acres north of Guerneville, including parts of Armstrong Redwoods State Natural Reserve.</p><p>Familiar scars in Santa Rosa</p><p>When the devastating 2017 Tubbs Fire swept across nearly 37,000 acres between Sonoma and Napa counties, the burn scars marked an eerie similarity to that of the 1964 Hanly Fire. The Hanly Fire, presumably started from a carelessly discarded lit cigarette, stretched from Mount St. Helena toward Calistoga and Santa Rosa\u2019s Fountaingrove neighborhood. The 1964 fire burned approximately 52,700 acres.</p><p>According to a map of significant fires in the county, a 1965 fire northwest of Santa Rosa burned over 13,000 acres in the same area as the 2019 Kincade Fire.</p><p>Scroll through the gallery above to see some of the most notable Sonoma County fires in commonly burned areas.</p><p>___ (c)2024 The Press Democrat (Santa Rosa, Calif.)

According to news originating from Porto, Portugal, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Wildland firefighting is physically and mentally demanding.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Fct - Foundation For Science And Technology. <br/> The news editors obtained a quote from the research from University of Porto: \"The aerobic capacity of firefighters is important due to the demands of the activity and the associated occupational risks. The main objectives of this study were to identify and characterise the physically demanding tasks undertaken by volunteer firefighters during wildland fires (real work conditions). A total of 125 firefighters replied to a survey about sociodemographic, biometric data, and work fitness assessment. A group of 23 was evaluated in a physical stress test using a VO2peak protocol to determine maximum oxygen consumption and ventilatory thresholds. The physical demands and physiological responses were collected during the operations at the firefront (n = 21). The results revealed that wildland firefighting entails physical demands that exceed established reference values, with maximum oxygen uptake exceeding 40%.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The cardiovascular strain is particularly notable in tasks performed near the firefront, reflecting fatigue. The physical and cardiac demands associated with forest fire fighting have been demonstrated to contribute to occupational illnesses with prolonged exposure. This study underscores the imperative for interventions to enhance the identification and real-time monitoring of physiological parameters to enhance firefighters' overall health and well-being.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Physical Demand Assessment of Volunteer Firefighters During Wildland Firefighting.

That\u2019s why\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/a-new-study-says-75-percent-of-entrepreneurs-are-concerned-about-their-mental-health.html\">three-quarters of small business owners</url>\u00a0are worried about their mental health, while more than half have been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, or stress-related problems.</p><p>As a company matures, new hurdles and anxieties arise. The average entrepreneur spends\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.agilitypr.com/pr-news/business/time-management-new-survey-reveals-biz-owners-spending-time-theyd-rather-spend/\">almost 70%</url>\u00a0of their time working \u201cin\u201d the business\u2014much of it putting out fires.</p><p>Inevitably, there are days and weeks when the failures far outnumber the wins. That makes it easy to get dragged down into negativity. But if the leader operates from a place of calm, it can help everyone else bring their best selves to work. Here are a few principles that I\u2019ve learned about that can help you do just that.</p><h>1. You\u2019re not the hero of this story</h><p>So many business leaders feel like it\u2019s up to them to save the day and feel like they\u2019re the only one who can fix things.</p><p>But this is a recipe for dizzying highs and crushing lows. And trust me, the lows outnumber the highs. You whiplash back and forth between elation and despair and rarely find that middle ground of calm that you desperately need to \u00a0make strategic decisions.</p><p>A far more useful approach is to think of yourself as just one player in a larger drama. Sure, you\u2019re the boss, but you\u2019re channeling greater forces. Ultimately, you\u2019re an instrument that supports and directs the talents of the team around you.</p><h>2. Mission actually does matter</h><p>Sustaining calm is easier with a sense of purpose. People can accept a tough journey if they know where they\u2019re going and can see progress, however small.</p><p>This is where your mission comes in. Now, it doesn\u2019t have to be earth-shattering. You just need something that everyone can get behind. My company\u2019s mission is simple: helping small businesses compete in a world of Amazon and Shein. Using technology to empower customers is our rallying cry.</p><p>Importantly, this has to be more than a slogan on a website or a poster on the wall. (There\u2019s a reason only\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/employers-effectively-communicating-company-goals-140000507.html\">25%</url>\u00a0of employees actually feel educated on company goals, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.slingshotapp.io/2024-digital-work-trends-report-2\">Slingshot\u2019s most recent Digital Work Trends report</url>). Your company needs to live the mission, and employees need to understand how it translates into tangible goals and also see incremental progress.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>As gimmicky as it might seem, dashboards and trackers can be invaluable here. We have screens throughout our office showing key KPIs and movement over time. We also celebrate wins in monthly huddles and recognize team members who push the mission forward.</p><h>3. Think impact rather than urgency</h><p>The startup world moves fast. On any given week, there will be dozens (if not hundreds) of time-sensitive tasks that demand your attention.To focus on the things that matter, you need to think in terms of impact, not urgency. Rather than prioritizing your to-do list by deadline, narrow your to-do list down to the tasks that will actually move the needle for you and your company.\u00a0</p><p>With a manageable list, it\u2019s easier to exit panic mode and start calmly working away on what really matters. Running on adrenaline\u2014and treating everything like a five-alarm fire\u2014might get results in the short term. However, this is a surefire recipe for team burnout, which is ultimately inefficient and counterproductive.</p><p>Doing this right isn\u2019t possible without long-term priorities. Setting a North Star or long-term goal for your company allows you to see what you should prioritize and what you shouldn\u2019t.</p><h>4. Remember that creation follows in the wake of destruction</h><p>When I\u2019m not running a business, I\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://earth.org/interview/the-power-of-film-in-conservation-an-interview-with-age-of-unions-dax-dasilva/\">work in conservation</url>. I\u2019ve seen how the terrible violence of a forest fire sets the stage for regreening\u2014and how quickly that recovery can happen.</p><p>I think of that every time I suffer a setback, like losing a key employee. Of course, it hurts. But more often than not, such departures set the stage for much-needed changes and renewals.\u00a0From moments of devastation, new opportunities for growth arise.</p><h>5. When in doubt, write down the good and the bad</h><p>Calm leaders focus on the positive, but they also take stock of the negative.</p><p>Throughout the year, I keep a running list of my \u201cgratefuls\u201d and \u201clows.\u201d\u00a0The real impact of this approach is retrospective. Looking back, I often realize that some of the lows weren\u2019t really that low after all. In fact, they needed to happen and sometimes led to a major transformation. One example was losing a particular deal. In the end, that event ended up setting the company up for success by pushing us to explore new markets.</p><p>Ultimately, every leader must decide how they want to show up for the team. In my experience, calm beats panic every time. That\u2019s especially true when the stakes are high and people are looking to their leader to lower the temperature. And right now, that virtue may be more valuable than ever.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/w_1280,q_auto,f_auto,fl_lossy/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms-2/2025/02/p-91279197-stay-calm-as-a-leader.jpg\">Link to image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FASCOM-91279197</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FASCOM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F4Y-4GC3-RRH6-G24Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">475434</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"944\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Mansueto Ventures, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Fastcompany.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"02\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>February 17, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Work Life</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000629</classCode><className>ENTREPRENEURSHIP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001581</classCode><className>SMALL BUSINESS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DLFX</classCode><className>PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX002052</classCode><className>DEPRESSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000032</classCode><className>SMALL BUSINESS ASSISTANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000D05Y</classCode><className>MENTAL HEALTH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001912</classCode><className>RETAIL &amp; WHOLESALE TRADE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008XSL</classCode><className>RETAILERS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

According to news reporting originating in Penang, Malaysia, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Forest fires are sudden, destructive, hazardous, and challenging to manage and rescue, earning them a place on UNESCO's list of the world's eight major natural disasters. Currently, amid global warming, all countries worldwide have entered a period of high forest fire incidence.\" </p><p><br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from University Sains Malaysia, \"Due to global warming, the frequency of forest fires has accelerated, the likelihood of large fires has increased, and the spatial and temporal dynamics of forest fires have shown different trends. Therefore, the impact of climate change on the spatiotemporal dynamics of forest fires has become a hot issue in the field of forest fire research in recent years. Therefore, it is of great significance and necessity to conduct a review of the research in this area. This review delves into the interactions and impacts between climate change and the spatiotemporal dynamics of forest fires. To address this issue, scholars have mainly adopted the following research methods: first, statistical analysis methods, second, the establishment of spatiotemporal prediction models for meteorology and forest fires, and third, the coupling of climate models with forest fire risk forecasting models. The statistical analysis method relies on the analysis of historical meteorological and fire-related data to study the effects of climate change and meteorological factors on fire occurrence. Meanwhile, forest fire prediction models utilize technical tools such as remote sensing. These models synthesize historical meteorological and fire-related data, incorporating key meteorological factors such as temperature, rainfall, relative humidity, and wind. The models revealed the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of fires, identified key drivers, and explored the interactions between climate change and forest fire dynamics, culminating in the construction of predictive models. With the deepening of the study, the coupling of climate models and fire risk ranking systems became a trend in the prediction of forest fire risk trends. Moreover, as the climate warms, the increased frequency of extreme weather events like heatwaves, droughts, snow and ice storms, and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has accelerated forest fire occurrences and raised the risk of major fires. This review offers valuable technical insights by comprehensively analyzing the spatial and temporal characteristics of forest fires, elucidating key meteorological drivers, and exploring potential mechanisms. These insights serve as a scientific foundation for preventive measures and effective forest fire management.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"In the face of a changing climate, this synthesis contributes to the development of informed strategies to mitigate the escalating threat of forest fires.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Spatiotemporal dynamics of forest fires in the context of climate change: a review.

According to news originating from Nanjing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"Forest fires pose severe challenges to forest management because of their unpredictability, extensive harm, broad impact, and rescue complexities. Early smoke detection is pivotal for prompt intervention and damage mitigation.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Defense Science And Technology Foundation of China. <br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Nanjing University of Science and Technology: \"Combining deep learning techniques with UAV imagery holds potential in advancing forest fire smoke recognition. However, issues arise when using UAV-derived images, especially in detecting miniature smoke patches, complicating effective feature discernment. Common deep learning approaches for forest fire detection also grapple with limitations due to sparse datasets. To counter these challenges, we introduce a refined UAV-centric forest fire smoke detection approach utilizing YOLOv5. We first enhance anchor box clustering through K-means++ to boost the classification precision and then augment the YOLOv5 architecture by integrating a novel partial convolution (PConv) to trim down model parameters and elevate processing speed. A unique detection head is also incorporated to the model to better detect diminutive smoke traces. A coordinate attention module is embedded within YOLOv5, enabling precise smoke target location and fine-grained feature extraction amidst complex settings.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Given the scarcity of forest fire smoke datasets, we employ transfer learning for model training. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves 96% AP [ [50] ] and 57.3% AP [ [50:95] ] on a customized dataset, outperforming other state-of-the-art one-stage object detectors while maintaining real-time performance.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Efficient Detection of Forest Fire Smoke in UAV Aerial Imagery Based on an Improved Yolov5 Model and Transfer Learning.

This decision comes as recent precipitation has significantly improved conditions and lowered the forest fire danger level to LOW to MODERATE statewide over the past few days.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While this rainfall marks a turning point, it is important to remember that Connecticut remains in the fall fire season. Residents are urged to consult their local municipalities for guidance on burning and continue to practice fire safety as conditions evolve.</p><p>An Unprecedented Fire Season</p><p>Since October 21st, Connecticut has faced one of the most challenging wildfire seasons in recent history, with 227 fires reported, managed, and monitored. The driest period in recorded history and high winds created a perfect storm for wildfire activity.</p><p>Despite these extreme conditions, Connecticuts proactive and aggressive management strategy successfully limited the spread and intensity of brush fires statewide. This is a testament to the collaboration, coordination, and swift action by DEEP, the Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security (DEMHS), local fire departments, the Connecticut Army National Guard and our out-of-state and international partners.</p><p>\"This season tested us, but it also showcased the effectiveness of our coordinated statewide response and the value of preparedness and collaboration, DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said. From local fire departments to international crews, every responder was vital in protecting Connecticuts communities and wildlands. We are deeply grateful for their efforts and the publics vigilance during this period of extreme fire danger. We encourage the public to continue to be vigilant for the remainder of the fire season, and always, as we all play a critically important role in preventing brush fires from starting.</p><p>Connecticuts Proactive Strategy and Regional Partnerships</p><p>Central to Connecticuts success was a decision to bring in resources early and to embed DEEP and DEMHS personnel and mutual aid crews directly with local fire departments during firefighting operations. This innovative approach allowed for rapid decision-making, efficient resource deployment, and seamless coordination between teams. The strategy proved vital in preventing small fires from escalating into large-scale events, protecting countless homes, businesses, and natural resources.</p><p>Connecticuts participation in the Northeast Forest Fire Protection Compact, a regional mutual aid agreement, brought invaluable personnel and equipment to the state from Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, New York, and Quebec. In addition, teams from Oregon, California, and Nova Scotia also responded to provide assistance, showcasing the broad scope of collaboration required to combat the unprecedented wildfire emergency. Together, these crews worked alongside Connecticut responders to tackle fires statewide, including the Hawthorne Drive fire in Berlin and the Rocky Neck State Park fire in East Lyme.</p><p>In total, Connecticut hosted hundreds of firefighters for this common cause. The shared spirit of mutual aid developed over years of training and deployments highlighted the strength of regional collaboration and the importance of investing in emergency preparedness. These partnerships brought critical resources to Connecticut and reinforced the relationships and strategies that will continue to protect the state and our compact partners in future emergencies.</p><p>Building Resilience Amid Changing Conditions</p><p>This wildfire season has highlighted the growing challenges of extreme weather events driven by a changing climate. Just a few months ago, Connecticut was responding to intense and historic flooding in parts of the state, and shortly after the focus shifted to wildfire defense. The frequency and intensity of these extreme events underscore the need for ongoing resilience planning and the implementation of preparedness measures.</p><p>\"The range of emergency events this fall highlights our need to prepare for more frequent and severe weather, Commissioner Dykes continued. Proactive strategies, strong partnerships, and investments in infrastructure and emergency planning not only address todays challenges but build lasting resilience, delivering immediate value and long-term savings to Connecticut.\"</p><p>Connecticuts successes this season demonstrate the importance of investing in emergency planning, training, and collaboration, and we have created a model for more effectively addressing wildfire threats in our densely forested state.</p><p>Through the dedication of DEEP personnel, the leadership of DEMHS, and the selfless work of local and mutual aid crews, Connecticut has shown that proactive planning and unified action can overcome even the most daunting challenges.</p><p>Looking Ahead: Remaining Vigilant</p><p>The recent rain is welcome, but it is not a signal to let down our guard. Fall fire season remains active, and fine fuels like leaves and twigs can dry quickly in warm or windy weather, reigniting the potential for fire. Residents are asked to remain cautious, stay aware of local guidance, and continue practicing fire safety in the coming weeks.</p><p>Fire Safety Guidance:</p><p>Adhere to Local Burn Laws: Even with the burn ban lifted from state public lands, check with your municipality for any specific restrictions on open burning.</p><p>Handle Fire Responsibly: Use fire pits, grills, and other sources of flame cautiously. Always ensure they are fully extinguished before leaving them unattended.</p><p>Dispose of Ashes Safely: Place ashes in a fire-safe container with a sealable lid, and ensure they are cool before disposal. Store the container away from flammable materials.</p><p>Avoid Spark-Generating Activities: Refrain from using lawn equipment, chainsaws, or other machinery near dry vegetation.</p><p>Report Fires Immediately: Call 911 if you see smoke or fire. Quick reporting is critical in preventing the spread of wildfires.</p><p>As we move forward, DEEP, DEMHS, and our partners remain committed to ensuring that Connecticut continues to be ready and rises to the occasion for any challenges that lie ahead.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126851256</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DHF-Y4W1-JCBF-S25F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1088\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 26, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Today as I speak to you in Mann Ki Baat, there is a deep anguish in my heart. The terrorist incident that took place in Pahalgam on the 22nd of April has hurt every citizen of the country. Every Indian holds deep sympathies for the affected families. No matter which state one belongs to, no matter which language one speaks, one is feeling the pain of those who have lost their loved ones in this attack. </p><p>I can feel that the blood of every Indian is on the boil after seeing the pictures of the terrorist attack. This attack in Pahalgam shows the desperation of the patrons of terrorism; displays their cowardice at a time when peace was returning to Kashmir, there was a vibrancy in schools and colleges, construction work had gained unprecedented pace, democracy was getting stronger, the number of tourists was increasing at a record rate, people's income was increasing, new opportunities were being created for the youth. The enemies of the country, the enemies of Jammu and Kashmir, did not like that. The terrorists and the masterminds of terror want Kashmir to be destroyed again and hence they executed such a big conspiracy. In this war against terrorism, the unity of the country, the solidarity of 140 crore Indians, is our biggest strength. This unity is the basis of our decisive fight against terrorism. We have to strengthen our resolve to face this challenge that has surfaced before the country. We have to demonstrate strong willpower as a nation. Today the world is watching, after this terrorist attack, the whole country is speaking in one voice.</p><p>Friends, the anger that we the people of India feel, that anger is there in the whole world. After this terrorist attack, condolences are continuously pouring in from all over the world. Global leaders have called me up as well; written letters and sent messages too. Everyone has strongly condemned this heinous terrorist attack. They have expressed condolences to the families of the deceased. The whole world stands with 140 crore Indians in our fight against terrorism. I once again assure the affected families that they will get justice, and justice will be done. The perpetrators and conspirators of this attack will be served with the harshest response.</p><p>Friends, two days ago we lost the country's great scientist Dr. K. Kasturirangan ji. Whenever I met Kasturirangan ji, we discussed topics like the talent of Indian youth, modern education, Space-Science. His contribution in lending newer heights to science, education and India's Space Program shall always be remembered. ISRO attained a new identity under his leadership. The Space Programs that moved forward under his guidance gave global recognition to India's efforts. Many of the satellites that India uses today were launched under the supervision of Dr. Kasturirangan.</p><p>There was one more special facet to his personality, which the younger generation can learn from. He always accorded importance to innovation. The vision of learning, knowing and doing something new is very inspiring. Dr. K. Kasturirangan also played a major role in formulating the new National Education Policy of the country. Dr. Kasturirangan came up with the idea of forward looking education according to the modern needs of the 21st century. His selfless service to the country and contribution to nation building will always be remembered. Very humbly, I pay my tribute to Dr. K. Kasturirangan.</p><p>My dear countrymen, this month of April marks 50 years of the launch of the Aryabhatta Satellite. Today, when we look back and remember this journey of 50 years, we realize how far we have come. This flight of India's dreams in space once commenced with just conviction. Some young scientists with the passion to do something for the nation they neither had the modern resources like today, nor the access to world technology as such. If at all they had anything, it was talent, dedication, hard work and the passion to do something for the country. You must have seen pictures of our scientists carrying critical equipment themselves on bullock carts and bicycles. It is the result of that very dedication and spirit of service to the nation that so much has changed today. Today India has become a Global Space Power. We have created a record by launching 104 Satellites simultaneously. We have become the first country to reach the South Pole of the Moon.</p><p>India has launched the Mars Orbiter Mission and we have reached pretty close to the Sun through the Aditya - L1 Mission. Today India is leading the most cost effective but successful Space Program in the entire world. Many countries of the world take help of ISRO for their Satellites and Space Missions. Friends, when we see a Satellite launch by ISRO, we are filled with pride. I had a similar feeling when I witnessed the launch of PSLV-C-23 in 2014. I was also present at the ISRO Center in Bengaluru during the landing of Chandrayaan-2 in 2019. At that time Chandrayaan failed to achieve the expected success, it was a very difficult time for the scientists. But I could see with my own eyes the patience of the scientists and their zeal to achieve something. And a few years later, the whole world too noticed how the same scientists made Chandrayaan-3 a success.</p><p>Friends, now India has opened her Space Sector for the private sector as well. Today many youth are attaining new milestones in the field of Space Startups. 10 years ago, there was only one company, but today there are more than 325 Space Startups working in the country. The times to come are ushering in a lot of new possibilities in Space. India is going to scale new heights. The country is busy preparing for many important missions like Gaganyaan, SpaDeX and Chandrayaan-4. We are also working on the Venus Orbiter Mission and Mars Lander Mission. Our Space Scientists are going to fill the countrymen with new pride through their innovations.</p><p>Friends, you certainly must have seen the horrific pictures of the earthquake that struck Myanmar last month. The earthquake caused huge devastation there every breath, every moment was precious for the people trapped under the debris. That is why India immediately started Operation Brahma for our brothers and sisters in Myanmar. From Air Force aircraft to Navy ships, everything was sent to help Myanmar. The Indian team set up a field hospital there. A team of engineers helped in assessing the damage to important buildings and infrastructure. The Indian team supplied blankets, tents, sleeping bags, medicines, food items and many other things. During all of that, the Indian team also received a lot of appreciation from the people there.</p><p>Friends, in this crisis, many heart-touching examples of courage, patience and ingenuity came to light. The Indian team rescued an elderly woman of more than 70 years of age who was buried under the debris for over 18 hours. Those who are watching 'Mann Ki Baat' on TV right now, you must be able to see the face of that elderly woman. The team from India provided every treatment facility, from stabilizing her oxygen level to treatment of fractures. When this elderly woman was discharged from the hospital, she expressed her gratitude to our team. She expressed that she had got a new life because of the Indian rescue team. Many people told our team that because of them they were able to locate their friends and relatives.</p><p>Friends, after the earthquake, there was a possibility of many people being trapped in a monastery in Mandalay, Myanmar. Our team also carried out relief and rescue operations there, that resulted in them receiving a lot of blessings from Buddhist monks. We are very proud of all those who participated in Operation Brahma. We have our tradition, our values, the sentiment of 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' - the whole world is one family. India's readiness as the Vishwa-Mitra in times of crisis and India's commitment to humanity is becoming the hallmark of our identity.</p><p>Friends, I have come to know about an innovative effort of NRIs in Ethiopia, Africa. Indians living in Ethiopia have taken the initiative to send children who are suffering from heart disease since birth to India for treatment. Many such children are also being helped financially by Indian families. If the family of a child is unable to come to India on account of lack of money, our Indian brothers and sisters are making arrangements for that too. The effort is to ensure that every needy child of Ethiopia suffering from a serious ailment receives better treatment. This noble work of NRIs is being appreciated a lot in Ethiopia. You know that medical facilities are constantly improving in India. Citizens of other countries are also benefitting from that.</p><p>Friends, just a few days ago, India has also sent a large quantity of vaccine for the people of Afghanistan. These vaccines will be useful in preventing dangerous diseases like Rabies, Tetanus, Hepatitis B and Influenza. This week, on Nepal's request, India has sent a large consignment of medicines and vaccines there. This will ensure better treatment for patients of thalassemia and sickle cell disease. Whenever it comes to serving humanity, India has always been at the forefront and will always be at the forefront in every such need in the future as well.</p><p>Friends, we were just referring to Disaster Management and the most important thing in dealing with any natural disaster is your alertness. You can now get help in this alertness from a special APP on your mobile. This APP can save you from getting trapped in any natural disaster and its name too is 'Sachet'. The 'Sachet APP' has been developed by India's National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). Be it flood, cyclone, land-slide, tsunami, forest fire, avalanche, storm, hurricane or lightning, 'Sachet APP' tries to keep you informed and protected in every way. Through this APP, you can receive updates related to the weather department. The special thing is that 'Sachet APP' also provides a lot of information in regional languages. You too should take advantage of this APP and share your experiences with us.</p><p>My dear countrymen, today we see India's talent being appreciated all over the world. India's youth has changed the world's view towards India and the interest of the youth of any country shows what the future of the country would be like. Today, India's youth is moving towards science, technology and innovation. Even in those regions, which were earlier known for backwardness and other factors, the youth have set examples that give us new confidence. A Science Centre at Dantewada in Chhattisgarh is drawing everyone's attention these days. Until some time ago, Dantewada was known only for violence and unrest, but now, the Science Centre there has become a new ray of hope for children and their parents. Children are enjoying going to this Science Centre. They are now learning everything from making new machines to technology.</p><p>Through making new machines and using technology, they are learning to make new products now. They have got the opportunity to learn about 3D printers and robotic cars as well as other innovative things. Some time ago, I also inaugurated Science Galleries at Gujarat Science City. These galleries provide a glimpse of the potential of modern science, and how much science can do for us. I have been informed that the children there are very excited about these galleries. This growing attraction towards science and innovation will surely take India to new heights.</p><p>My dear countrymen, the biggest strength of our country is our 140 crore citizens, their capability, their will power. And when crores of people join a campaign together, its impact is huge. An example of this is 'Ek Ped Maa Ke Naam' - this campaign is in the name of the mother who gave birth to us and it is also for Mother Earth who ensconces us in her lap. Friends, On the 5th of June, on 'World Environment Day', this campaign is completing one year. During this one year, under this campaign, more than 140 crore trees have been planted in the name of the mother across the country. Observing this initiative of India, people outside the country have also planted trees in the name of their mother. You too should become a part of this campaign, so that on completion of one year, you can be proud of your participation.</p><p>Friends, all of us know that trees provide coolness we get relief from heat in the shade of trees. But recently I came across another news related to this which caught my attention. During the last few years, more than 70 lakh trees have been planted in Ahmedabad city of Gujarat. These trees have increased the green area in Ahmedabad to a great extent. Along with that, the number of water bodies has also increased here due to the construction of the River Front on the Sabarmati river and reconstruction of some lakes like Kankaria lake. Now news reports say that in the last few years, Ahmedabad has become one of the major cities fighting against global warming.</p><p>The people there are also feeling this change; the coolness in the environment. The trees planted in Ahmedabad are becoming the reason of bringing myriad shades of happiness there. I again urge all of you to plant trees to maintain the health of the earth, to deal with the challenges of climate change, and to secure the future of your children. Ek Ped Maa Ke Naam.</p><p>Friends, there is an old saying where there is a will there is a way. When we decide to do something new, we certainly reach our destination. You must have eaten a lot of apples grown in the mountains. But, if I ask you whether you have tasted the apples of Karnataka, you will be surprised. Usually, we think that apples are grown only in the mountains. But Shri Shail Teli ji, who lives in Bagalkot, Karnataka, has grown apples in the plains. In his Kulali village, apple trees have started bearing fruits even in temperatures above 35 degrees. Actually since, Shri Shail Teli was fond of farming, so he tried apple farming as well and he attained success in it. Today, a lot of apples grow on the trees planted by him and he is earning a good income by selling them.</p><p>Friends, now that we are talking about apples, you must have heard the name of Kinnauri apple. Saffron production has started in Kinnaur, famous for apples. Generally, saffron cultivation was little in Himachal, but now it has commenced in the beautiful Sangla valley of Kinnaur. One such example is Wayanad in Kerala.</p><p>Success has been achieved in growing saffron there as well. And in Wayanad, this saffron is not being grown in any field or soil; rather with the help of the Aeroponics Technique. Something astonishingly similar has happened with the production of litchi. We had been hearing that litchi grows in Bihar, West Bengal or Jharkhand. But now litchi is being grown in South India and Rajasthan as well. Thiru Veera Arasu of Tamil Nadu used to cultivate coffee. He planted litchi trees in Kodaikanal and after 7 years of hard work, those trees have started bearing fruit. The success in growing litchi has inspired other farmers in the area. Jitendra Singh Ranawat has succeeded in growing litchi in Rajasthan. All these examples are very inspiring. If we decide to do something new and persist despite difficulties, even the impossible can be made possible.</p><p>My dear countrymen, today is the last Sunday of April. The month of May is beginning in a few days. I will take you around 108 years back from today. The year 1917 these two months of April and May a unique battle for independence was being fought in the country. The atrocities of the British were at their peak. The exploitation of the poor, the deprived and the farmers had crossed inhuman levels. On the fertile land of Bihar, the British were forcing the farmers to grow indigo. The farmers' fields were becoming barren due to indigo cultivation, but the British government was least concerned. In such a situation, Gandhiji reached Champaran in Bihar in 1917.</p><p>The farmers told Gandhiji our land is dying, we are not getting food grains to eat. The pain of lakhs of farmers made a resolve come up in Gandhiji's mind. From there the historic Satyagraha of Champaran started. 'Champaran Satyagraha' was the first big experiment by Bapu in India. The entire British rule was shaken by Bapu's Satyagraha. The British had to suspend the law that forced farmers to cultivate indigo. This was a victory that infused new confidence in the freedom struggle. All of you must be aware that another son of Bihar also contributed a lot to this Satyagraha, who became the first President of the country after independence. The great personality was Dr. Rajendra Prasad. He also wrote a book on the Champaran Satyagraha Satyagraha in Champaran every young person should read this book. Brothers and sisters, many more indelible chapters of the freedom struggle are associated with April itself. Gandhijis Dandi March culminated on the 6th of April itself. This March which commenced on the 12th of March and continued for 24 days had shaken the British. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre took place in April itself. The marks of this blood stained history are still present on the soil of Punjab.</p><p>Friends, in a few days, on the 10th of May, the anniversary of the first freedom struggle would also be there. The spark that arose in that first battle for freedom, later became a torch for millions of freedom fighters.</p><p>On the 26th of April, we observed the death anniversary of the great hero of the 1857 revolution, Babu Veer Kunwar Singh. The entire country derives inspiration from this great freedom fighter of Bihar. We have to keep alive the immortal inspirations of lakhs of such freedom fighters. The energy we receive from them provides renewed strength to our resolve of Amritkaal.</p><p>Friends, in this long journey of 'Mann Ki Baat', you have formed an intimate relationship with this programme. The achievements that the countrymen want to share with others are conveyed to the people through 'Mann Ki Baat'. Next month, we will again meet and talk about the diversity, glorious traditions and new achievements of the country. We will learn about people who are bringing about a change in the society with their dedication and spirit of service. As always, keep sending us your thoughts and suggestions. Thank you, Namaskar.</p><p>*****</p><p>MJPS/SR/SKS</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1127113180</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FNN-BXN3-RXYP-P1KV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3065\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 27, 2025 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX001710</classCode><className>TERRORISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX002018</classCode><className>TERRORISM &amp; COUNTERTERRORISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002017</classCode><className>NATIONAL SECURITY &amp; FOREIGN RELATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0T5</classCode><className>TERRORIST ATTACKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009EOQ</classCode><className>PRIME MINISTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>ST000DN68</classCode><className>SPACE PROGRAMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>ST0008WTA</classCode><className>SPACE EXPLORATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DL5Q</classCode><className>TYPES OF GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DMYZ</classCode><className>EMOTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DL87</classCode><className>DEMOCRACIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001088</classCode><className>MATH &amp; SCIENCE EDUCATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>N927000CC</classCode><className>SPACE &amp; AERONAUTICS AGENCIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST0008YVR</classCode><className>ASTRONOMY &amp; SPACE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>ST000DN68</classCode><className>SPACE PROGRAMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>ST0008WTA</classCode><className>SPACE EXPLORATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N610000CC</classCode><className>EDUCATIONAL SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>N927000CC</classCode><className>SPACE &amp; AERONAUTICS AGENCIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GX142</classCode><className>NEW DELHI, INDIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000A260</classCode><className>KASHMIR</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0008XIB</classCode><className>JAMMU &amp; KASHMIR, INDIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>GC304</classCode><className>INDIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

In the environment domain, Huawei TECH4ALL has run nature conservation projects in 53 protected areas with global and local partners in forest, wetland, and ocean ecosystems around the world.\"Over the past five years, Huawei's TECH4ALL program has demonstrated how technology can be a powerful force for good, addressing global challenges in environmental protection, education, and digital inclusion,\" said Harvey Zhang, CEO of Huawei Austria.The Innovations for Biodiversity Forum focused on TECH4ALL nature conservation projects in Europe, including findings of biodiversity monitoring in the wetland ecosystem around Austria's Lake Neusiedl.The quality of the reed bed habitats in this ecosystem is declining, negatively impacting amphibian species, mammals, and bird life. Since 2021, audio monitoring devices have collected more than<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2 million individual audio files</emphasis>of 69 bird species.This vast dataset will help develop a conservation management plan for the ecosystem, including<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">controlled fire management</emphasis>to rejuvenate aging reed beds and strengthen overall biodiversity by understanding the habitat preferences of the individual species studied.\"Hardly any reed harvesting has been done in recent decades, which has had a negative impact on the state of the reed belt. The study investigated whether targeted fires could have an effect similar to that of harvesting. To do this, areas that show different age conditions due to fires were compared,\" said Dr. Christian Schulze from the Department of Biodiversity Research at the University of Vienna. \"The research showed that older reed beds harbor the greatest diversity of bird species. However, the analysis of individual species also shows that controlled reed fires have positive aspects.\"The forum explored a similar TECH4ALL monitoring project in Poland to build a more complete picture of biodiversity in the Bia\u0142owie\u017ca National Park ecosystem, also with the aim of developing targeted conservation measures.Greek startup PROBOTEK introduced a forest fire-prevention solution that uses sensors, drones, AI, and 5G to detect and transmit real-time video-footage of fire risks, which are on the rise in parts of Europe due to climate change and rising temperatures. The project is designed to enable emergency response in the first 'golden 15 minutes' of a forest fire being detected, notify residents of evacuation routes, and plan routes for fire trucks and ambulances.The forum also looked at the success of an AI-based filtering system designed to protect Norway's wild Atlantic salmon from possible extinction due to the invasive pink salmon species. The pilot project in 2023 successfully filtered out 6,000 invasive salmon, and expectations are high that the solution, the world's first of its type, can be scaled out across Norway's river systems.On day two of the forum, the media delegation in attendance visited Lake Neusiedl to learn how the TECH4ALL solution works in practice and the transformative effect that intelligent digital technologies can have on nature conservation.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">About Huawei TECH4ALL</emphasis>TECH4ALL is Huawei's long-term digital inclusion initiative. Enabled by innovative technologies and partnerships, TECH4ALL aims to promote inclusion and sustainability in the digital world.For more information, visit the Huawei TECH4ALL

According to news originating from Changsha, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"This paper investigates the application of the YOLOv7 object detection model combined with knowledge distillation techniques in forest fire detection.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Natural Science Foundation of China. <br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Central South University of Forestry and Technology: \"As an advanced object detection model, YOLOv7 boasts efficient real-time detection capabilities. However, its performance may be constrained in resource-limited environments. To address this challenge, this research proposes a novel approach: considering that deep neural networks undergo multi-layer mapping from the input to the output space, we define the knowledge propagation between layers by evaluating the dot product of features extracted from two different layers. To this end, we utilize the Flow of Solution Procedure (FSP) matrix based on the Gram matrix and redesign the distillation loss using the Pearson correlation coefficient, presenting a new knowledge distillation method termed ILKDG (Intermediate Layer Knowledge Distillation with Gram Matrix-based Feature Flow). Compared with the classical knowledge distillation algorithm, KD, ILKDG achieved a significant performance improvement on a self-created forest fire detection dataset. Specifically, without altering the student network's parameters or network layers, mAP@0.5 improved by 2.9%, and mAP@0.5:0.95 increased by 2.7%.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"These results indicate that the proposed ILKDG method effectively enhances the accuracy and performance of forest fire detection without introducing additional parameters. The ILKDG method, based on the Gram matrix and Pearson correlation coefficient, presents a novel knowledge distillation approach, providing a fresh avenue for future research. Researchers can further optimize and refine this method to achieve superior results in fire detection.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Forest Fire Object Detection Analysis Based on Knowledge Distillation.

With 32% of Stanford's student body being from California, many students across campus were directly and indirectly affected by the fires.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I lived there over the summer and I would drive up on Sunset and go through the Palisades. It's crazy to think that the area is now totally decimated,\" said Jessica Korobkin '27, a student from LA whose mother's house burnt down as a result of the fires.</p><p>However, the repercussions of the fires extend beyond just the destruction of buildings. The ash's impact on air quality is an ongoing concern for many of the area's residents.</p><p>At the peak of the Pacific Palisades fire, an EPA air monitor in LA Chinatown recorded 483.7 micrograms per cubic meter of fine particulate matter. The federal limit of fine particulate matter in comparison is 35 micrograms. Numerous parts of LA are well above the limit, which may prove to be harmful and dangerous to residents' respiratory health.</p><p>Korobkin said a number of the Palisades residents were advised by doctors not to go back home, even if they were not directly impacted by the fires.</p><p>Given the nature of the materials burned - such as houses, vehicles and other structures - a significant amount of toxic chemicals, including benzene, volatile organic compounds, formaldehyde and heavy metals, were released into the atmosphere. The rebuilding of these houses further adds to the degradation of air quality.</p><p>In an email to The Daily, professor and physical science research scientist Jessica Yu, wrote that \"fine particulate matter can penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream, potentially leading to cardiovascular health issues.\" Wildfire smoke is also associated with an \"increased risk of premature births, low birth weight, dementia, cognitive impairment, memory loss, anxiety and depression.\"</p><p>Yu also advised LA residents to wear P100 masks, which can filter at least 99.97% of airborne particles and are more resistant to clogging in heavily polluted environments.</p><p>Patricia Bromley M.A. '05 M.A. '10, an associate professor at the Graduate School of Education, wrote in an email to The Daily that the impact of the fires is indiscriminate.\u00a0</p><p>\"These hardships affect everyone, regardless of socioeconomic status, although families with greater resources can often access alternatives more easily (e.g. housing, meals, alternative schooling),\" Bromley wrote.</p><p>The fires have also had significant impacts on education. UCLA had one week of online education due to the air quality.</p><p>Impacts have also been seen on home insurance premiums, exposing an insurance crisis that has festered for years.</p><p>\"Home insurance affects everybody, even people that rent. The fires are maybe going to affect the affordability of housing. Our home insurance is in a crisis to cover the loss for insurers,\" said Michael Wara, director of the Climate and Energy Policy Program. \"Having home insurance cost two to five times what it costs today would have a huge impact on the state.\"</p><p>\"I just hope insurance companies uphold their promises, and if they can't, then the government steps in,\" Korobkin said.</p><p>California's current policies on wildfire control mandate a 100-foot defensible space around homes in State Responsibility Zones, clearing flammable materials to slow down wildfires and provide a safe perimeter for firefighting efforts.</p><p>\"I would not categorize this as a forest fire or a wildfire, the right way to think about this is an urban firestorm,\" Wara said. Reports show that many homes do not follow the current regulations. \"Changes to the built environment and how homes and gardens are built can prevent these kinds of fires,\" said Wara.</p><p>For the time being, Gov. Gavin Newsom has taken measures to curb and manage the effects of the fires on the people.\u00a0</p><p>Shreya Ramachandran '25, a senior class president, and the StanfordCaresforLA team have also set up a GoFundMe to provide relief and donations to those affected by the fire. As of Thursday, it has received $2,970 in donations.</p><p>Additionally, the team is hosting a charity concert at Xanadu on Thursday night, featuring student performers and bands. They are also partnering with Coupa Cafe to donate one dollar to the relief fund for every latte sold on Friday.</p><p>\"One thing that I have been really happy to see is, as we've been reaching out to organizations to support me in this effort, how much of an interest there was from the Stanford community,\" Ramachandran said.</p><p>Ramachandran has continued rallying her fellow students for support, whether it's monetary or otherwise.</p><p>\"Every bit helps, whether it's donating, volunteering or just spreading the word. Let's show up and make a difference together.\" wrote Ramachandran in a campus-wide email.</p><p>Korobkin is looking to the future with hope.</p><p>\"What was so special about the Palisades was that it really felt like a small town,\" Korobkin said. \"I really just hope that people stay and rebuild.\"</p><p>Paridhi Bhatia '27 is a beat reporter for international students and a writer for the University desk.

According to news reporting out of Beijing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Although firefighting aircrafts are effective for fighting forest fires, they are affected by a variety of risks related to forest fires during flight operations such as thermal radiation, temperature rise, decrease in air density, and changes in updraft aerodynamics.\" </p><p><br/> The news editors obtained a quote from the research from Tsinghua University: \"Quantifying these influences poses a significant challenge. Our research reveals that safety standards predominantly hinge on technical indicators like flight height, speed, and angle of attack, which makes it possible to quantify the above effects. A general method framework for analysing firefighting flight safety criteria was constructed in this study. Using relevant physical models, such as heat radiation, temperature, air density, and updraft in a forest fire environment, safety criteria with an analytical form were established. The corresponding safety constraints of each criterion were calculated quantitatively, and the most stringent constraint was determined based on multiple factors to obtain a comprehensive safety constraint boundary composed of the critical height, stall speed, and critical angle of attack. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is validated through a simulation case.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The research results show that the constrained boundary calculation method proposed in this study can provide a scientific foundation for developing technical specifications for forest aviation safety and aviation fire task plan.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: An integrated quantitative method of risk analysis and decision making for safety manipulation of a forest firefighting aircraft by using physical models of multi-hazard factors.

According to news reporting out of the Saveetha School of Engineering by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Forest fires are a type of natural catastrophe that poses a risk to the vegetation and fauna of the hill stations.\" </p><p><br/> The news editors obtained a quote from the research from Saveetha School of Engineering: \"Due to the presence of vast enormous areas of land adorned with aged trees, vegetation, and wild life, safeguarding the ecosystem is both critical and arduous. A Geographic Information System and Remote Sensing assist in resolving this issue through the continuous monitoring of the forest using satellite, aerial, and drone-based imagery gathered from a variety of sources in India and Abroad. Landsat8 series Band 4, Band 5, Band 6 and Band 7 is used for the study. Following the correction and analysis of reflectance values for pre-fire and post-fire imagery, the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) is computed and processed.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Finally, the difference in NBR based on the pre-fire event and post-fire event for the Yercaud hill station is analyzed and the severity level is classified for the chosen area of interest.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Study of Forest Fire Severity through Normalized Burn Ratio Analysis using Remote Sensing.

Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) News Release</nitf:hl2></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WASHINGTON - Today, Senator Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) cosponsored two bills to address the consequences of recent federal staff cuts at the National Park Service (NPS) and the U.S. Forest Service (USFS). The Protect Our Parks Act of 2025 and the Save Our Forests Act of 2025 will fully restore staffing levels at both agencies, ensuring that America's national parks and forests remain accessible, safe, and well-maintained.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The bills were introduced by fellow Arizona Senator Mark Kelly and cosponsored by Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Tina Smith (D-MN), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), and Chris Van Hollen (D-MD).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Trump administration's mass firings have led to significant staffing reductions at national parks, including the Grand Canyon in Arizona, negatively impacting visitor experiences and maintenance efforts. They have also delayed critical infrastructure projects, such as the 12.5-mile waterline replacement project, which supplies water to the South Rim and the Town of Tusayan. And ahead of fire season, Forest Service firings will hamper forest maintenance and wildfire prevention to protect Arizona communities.</p><p>\"From Horseshoe Bend to the Grand Canyon to Saguaro National Park, Arizona's public lands are central to our state's identity and drivers of local economies. Elon Musk and his DOGE minions are willing to put that at risk and jeopardize Arizonans' safety so they can give tax cuts to their billionaire buddies,\" said Senator Gallego. \"I'm proud to join Senator Kelly in fighting to ensure that our national parks are fully staffed, and our national forests are safely managed.\"</p><p>\"Trump's indiscriminate firings are directly affecting Arizona families. When there aren't enough staff at the gates of the Grand Canyon, Petrified Forest, Saguaro, and other national parks around the state, that means visitors are stuck in long lines and local businesses suffer. And when the Forest Service can't properly prepare for fire season, Arizona communities are at risk,\" said Senator Kelly. \"We're doing right by hardworking federal employees and ensuring our parks and forests have the staff they need to stay open, keep visitors safe, and get critical projects done on time.\"</p><p>\"Anyone who has hiked the Appalachian Trail through the White Mountain National Forest or visited Saint-Gaudens in New Hampshire knows just how spectacular our public lands can be. Without proper staffing and resources, public safety, ecosystems and local economies will all suffer,\" said Senator Shaheen. \"I'm proud to join my colleagues in introducing legislation to restore national park and forest service employees who were unjustly fired by the Trump Administration and ensure the investments Congress has made in our outdoor economy continue to flow as intended.\"</p><p>\"National Parks Service workers like Park Rangers keep us safe in some of our country's most wild and extreme areas, including places like Voyageurs National Park in northern Minnesota. U.S. Forest Service workers keep our forest areas healthy and productive, including the largest forest east of the Mississippi River, the Superior National Forest. I've met these fired workers, I've heard their stories and losing them makes our most cherished wild areas less safe and less cared for,\" said Senator Smith. \"Elon Musk indiscriminately and illegally fired thousands of the workers meant to keep these areas safe, including Minnesotans who worked with loggers to sell timber in a way that protected the health of our forests and Park Rangers up at Voyageurs. Republicans are risking the longevity of our parks and forests all to pay for tax breaks for billionaires and big corporations. These bills are commonsense proposals that clarify that Congress - and only Congress - has the power to decide where we spend tax dollars.\"</p><p>\"As the mayor of a city surrounded by state and national forest land, it is imperative that we preserve the positions of those who work for the Forest Service and the National Park Service because they are our frontline for protecting the community from the fire danger that prolonged drought and the effects of climate change expose us to. Without the vigilance and personal commitment to the preservation of these areas of our rangers, we become an unmonitored tinderbox waiting for a single destructive spark. For the sake of safety, please reinstate the positions of the dedicated park staff who serve our cities, states, and nation,\" said Ann Shaw, Mayor of the City of Cottonwood.</p><p>\"Clarkdale has the pleasure of being located in two National Forests - Prescott and Coconino and the home of Tuzigoot National Monument. For the visitors who come to enjoy our beautiful area of grand vistas, wonderful outdoors adventures of hiking, fishing, and kayaking, and to learn about our Singuan history; having well-staffed facilities and services ensures they have a safe and enjoyable experience. These areas are important economic drivers that help sustain our local economy. For those who live here - this is a critical fire area. It is very important that our national forests and monument have the necessary personnel needed to manage these lands. They are a big part of our overall fire mitigation efforts. A forest fire would be devastating to our community,\" said Robyn Prud'homme-Bauer, Mayor of the town of Clarkdale.</p><p>\"It is of great importance to have appropriately staffed National Parks and forest service to maintain our tourism industry, sustain our local economies and provide critical fire mitigation. In light of the current drought situation in Yavapai county we need more forest service personnel not less. National Parks must remain open and fully staffed. Thank you for your attention on this important matter for Yavapai county and the Verde Valley,\" said Christina \"Alex\" Barber, Mayor of the Town of Jerome.</p><p>\"More than 5 million tourists visit the Grand Canyon National Park each year. The National Park is an economic engine for Arizona and our rural gateway communities. Terminating essential Grand Canyon employees just prior to the summer tourist season threatens a positive visitor experience and impacts our tourist economy. These terminations, together with the hiring freeze, which prevents the hiring of 70-100 needed seasonal workers, imperils the protection, operation, and management of the Grand Canyon, one of the natural wonders of the world,\" said Vice Chair of Coconino County Board of Supervisor Patrice Horstman. \"Our National Forests in Arizona provide premier outdoor recreation and hunting opportunities and it is not a surprise that these lands are being utilized beyond the capacity of the employees to provide adequate law enforcement or emergency response. Not to mention the important role of the Forest Service must play in fire suppression and healthy forest management. For the health and safety of our communities, rather than terminating employees, forest Service staffing needs to be increased.\"</p><p>\"Right now, our local communities, fire departments, and land management partners are getting no information from the Forest Service, leaving us in the dark about fire prevention, recreation management, and critical projects that impact public safety and tourism. We appreciate Senator Kelly for introducing legislation to restore staffing at the Forest Service and address the uncertainty facing our wildland-urban interface,\" said Yavapai County Supervisor Brooks Compton.</p><p>\"To effectively address fire prevention, recreation management, and essential projects impacting public safety and tourism, Yavapai County emphasizes the need for timely and consistent information from the Forest Service. We appreciate Senator Kelly's leadership in introducing legislation to bolster Forest Service staffing and reduce uncertainty in our wildland-urban interface.

Ruben Gallego, D-Arizona, issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Gallego Cosponsors Legislation to Restore National Park and Forest Service Staffing, Protect Public Lands</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WASHINGTON - Today, Senator Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) cosponsored two bills to address the consequences of recent federal staff cuts at the National Park Service (NPS) and the U.S. Forest Service (USFS). The Protect Our Parks Act of 2025 and the Save Our Forests Act of 2025 will fully restore staffing levels at both agencies, ensuring that America's national parks and forests remain accessible, safe, and well-maintained.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The bills were introduced by fellow Arizona Senator Mark Kelly and cosponsored by Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Tina Smith (D-MN), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), and Chris Van Hollen (D-MD).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Trump administration's mass firings have led to significant staffing reductions at national parks, including the Grand Canyon in Arizona, negatively impacting visitor experiences and maintenance efforts. They have also delayed critical infrastructure projects, such as the 12.5-mile waterline replacement project, which supplies water to the South Rim and the Town of Tusayan. And ahead of fire season, Forest Service firings will hamper forest maintenance and wildfire prevention to protect Arizona communities.</p><p>\"From Horseshoe Bend to the Grand Canyon to Saguaro National Park, Arizona's public lands are central to our state's identity and drivers of local economies. Elon Musk and his DOGE minions are willing to put that at risk and jeopardize Arizonans' safety so they can give tax cuts to their billionaire buddies,\" said Senator Gallego. \"I'm proud to join Senator Kelly in fighting to ensure that our national parks are fully staffed, and our national forests are safely managed.\"</p><p>\"Trump's indiscriminate firings are directly affecting Arizona families. When there aren't enough staff at the gates of the Grand Canyon, Petrified Forest, Saguaro, and other national parks around the state, that means visitors are stuck in long lines and local businesses suffer. And when the Forest Service can't properly prepare for fire season, Arizona communities are at risk,\" said Senator Kelly. \"We're doing right by hardworking federal employees and ensuring our parks and forests have the staff they need to stay open, keep visitors safe, and get critical projects done on time.\"</p><p>\"Anyone who has hiked the Appalachian Trail through the White Mountain National Forest or visited Saint-Gaudens in New Hampshire knows just how spectacular our public lands can be. Without proper staffing and resources, public safety, ecosystems and local economies will all suffer,\" said Senator Shaheen. \"I'm proud to join my colleagues in introducing legislation to restore national park and forest service employees who were unjustly fired by the Trump Administration and ensure the investments Congress has made in our outdoor economy continue to flow as intended.\"</p><p>\"National Parks Service workers like Park Rangers keep us safe in some of our country's most wild and extreme areas, including places like Voyageurs National Park in northern Minnesota. U.S. Forest Service workers keep our forest areas healthy and productive, including the largest forest east of the Mississippi River, the Superior National Forest. I've met these fired workers, I've heard their stories and losing them makes our most cherished wild areas less safe and less cared for,\" said Senator Smith. \"Elon Musk indiscriminately and illegally fired thousands of the workers meant to keep these areas safe, including Minnesotans who worked with loggers to sell timber in a way that protected the health of our forests and Park Rangers up at Voyageurs. Republicans are risking the longevity of our parks and forests all to pay for tax breaks for billionaires and big corporations. These bills are commonsense proposals that clarify that Congress - and only Congress - has the power to decide where we spend tax dollars.\"</p><p>\"As the mayor of a city surrounded by state and national forest land, it is imperative that we preserve the positions of those who work for the Forest Service and the National Park Service because they are our frontline for protecting the community from the fire danger that prolonged drought and the effects of climate change expose us to. Without the vigilance and personal commitment to the preservation of these areas of our rangers, we become an unmonitored tinderbox waiting for a single destructive spark. For the sake of safety, please reinstate the positions of the dedicated park staff who serve our cities, states, and nation,\" said Ann Shaw, Mayor of the City of Cottonwood.</p><p>\"Clarkdale has the pleasure of being located in two National Forests - Prescott and Coconino and the home of Tuzigoot National Monument.

According to news reporting out of Kharkiv, Ukraine, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"The study examines the consequences of a forest fire in a radioactively polluted area in the Chernobyl accident zone, namely the transfer of radioactive substances and their impact on the environment and radiation situation.\" </p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from National Technical University Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute: \"The purpose of the study is to develop a mathematical model of the transfer of radioactive substances and a methodology for integrated assessment of the ability of an ecosystem to retain deposited radionuclides. The research methodology is based on existing proven mathematical methods and models, such as the turbulent diffusion model, the Gaussian static model, and the hierarchy analysis method (Thomas L. Saaty method). Models were obtained for the formation of a radioactive smoke cloud and its migration in the atmospheric air, the spread of radioactive aerosols and gas components, taking into account convection, turbulent exchange, humidity, wind strength and direction over the combustion zone. The processes of blowing and fluttering in the wind by the wind as the horizontal migration' perturbers of radioisotopes represent a new, still insufficiently studied area of research. Integral indicators for assessing the ability of the forest natural complex' components to reliably accumulate and retain radioisotopes that have settled have been determined.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"It was revealed that the priority factors of impact on the environment and the degree of radioactive contamination are the activity and directions of migration of combustion products, which constitute radioactive contamination.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Investigation of the Transfer Radioactive Contamination from the Chernobyl Zone and its Impact on Radiation in the Environment.

(AP) - A New York parks employee died battling one of a number of wildfires in New Jersey and New York amid dry conditions that have prompted air-quality warnings in both states, authorities said Sunday.</pre></p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\"><br/>The worker died when a tree fell on him Saturday afternoon as he battled a major brush fire along the New York-New Jersey border, according to reports from the Eastern Dutchess County Fire and Rescue and the New York state forestry services.<br/>New York State Police said they were investigating the death amid the fire in Sterling Forest located in Greenwood Lake. They identified the victim as Dariel Vasquez, an 18-year-old aide employed by the New York State Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation Department.<br/>The fires in New York and New Jersey come as firefighters are also battling a wildfire in California.<br/>The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection's Forest Fire Service reported the sprawling blaze had spread to 3.9 square miles near the border in Passaic County's West Milford and Orange County, N.Y. Officials said Sunday that the blaze, dubbed the Jennings Creek Fire, was now threatening 14 Greenwood Lake structures as well as two New Jersey homes and eight buildings in that state's Long Pond Ironworks Historic District.<br/>Health advisories were issued for parts of New York, including New York City, and Northeastern New Jersey due to smoke from the fires. People were urged to limit strenuous outdoor physical activity if possible; those especially sensitive included the very young and very old and people with ailments such as asthma and heart disease.<br/>New Jersey officials, meanwhile, reported 75 percent containment of a 175-acre fire in the Pompton Lakes area of Passaic County that was threatening 55 homes, although no evacuations had been ordered.<br/>Progress was also reported on fires in the Bethany Run area on the border of Burlington and Camden counties in Evesham and Voorhees townships.<br/></pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COLMBN-8443615</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COLMBN2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DJY-X1P1-JBSN-008T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">145264</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"324\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Columbian Publishing Co.

According to news reporting originating from Concepcion, Chile, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Wildfires pose a significant threat to forests and the delicate natural balance. In this work, we present a novel optimization approach for designing forest fire monitoring systems that incorporate surveillance towers, monitoring balloons, and drone technology, which have gained popularity in recent years for monitoring, logistics, and civil applications.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include NLHPC, VRID - INICIACIN, Vicerrectona de Investigacion y Desarrollo (VRID) , Universidad de Concepcion, ANID (Chilean Agency for Research and Development), CONICYT FONDECYT. <br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from the University of Concepcion, \"We develop a compact mixed-integer linear programming model that includes location decisions for multiple monitoring technologies and routing of drones among monitoring facilities to achieve the most extensive possible terrain coverage. Additionally, we propose a matheuristic algorithm that comprises six components: a solution procedure, perturbation procedures, local search procedures, a call to the general-purpose solver to solve a mixed-integer linear programming model, a global reset strategy, a local reset strategy, and an acceptance criterion. We test the proposed model and algorithm on a set of random instances and a real-life case study in Chile. While the proposed model can only solve small instances, the matheuristic can find good-quality solutions for all instances.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"This study can aid the government and private sector in designing an integrated fire monitoring system that leverages watchtowers, monitoring balloons, and drones.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: An Optimization-based Approach for an Integrated Forest Fire Monitoring System With Multiple Technologies and Surveillance Drones.

This is CBS NEWS MORNINGS.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The final day for the public to say their final farewell. Nearly 100,000 mourners and counting coming to pay tribute to Pope Francis as heads of state and royalty begin converging on Rome for tomorrow`s funeral.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rare rebuke: President Trump speaks out against Russia calling on President Putin to stop after launching one of the deadliest attacks on Ukraine`s capital. How the President says it could impact the peace deal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And breaking overnight, severe storms strike the nation`s heartland with tornadoes, hail, torrential rain, and flash flooding.</p><p>Good morning. I`m Jessi Mitchell in for Michael George.</p><p>Today is the last day Pope Francis will lie in state in St. Peter`s Basilica before his coffin is sealed in preparation for his funeral. So many mourners have been lining up to see the pontiff. The Vatican has kept the doors open for the last two nights to accommodate the crowds.</p><p>Today, many of the dignitaries and heads of state begin arriving in Rome ahead of tomorrow`s service and burial. Among them, President Trump and the First Lady. And we have learned his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, will also attend. CBS` Tina Kraus joins us now from the Vatican.</p><p>Tina, what else are you learning about the funeral?</p><p>TINA KRAUS: Well, Jessi, we know that there will be 50 heads of state, 10 monarchs and former President Biden will sit alongside them at the funeral. It`s perhaps not a huge surprise that he`s coming because he`s only the second Catholic president in U.S. history behind John F. Kennedy.</p><p>And before he left office, he awarded Francis the Presidential Medal of Freedom with distinction. That`s the highest civilian award that can be given by the president. So tomorrow, he will be down there in St. Peter`s Square along with hundreds of thousands of mourners to remember Pope Francis.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>TINA KRAUS (voiceover): The devoted descended on St. Peter`s Square for a third and final day to see Pope Francis one last time as he lies in state. Tens of thousands, including the Pope`s relatives, have come to pay their respects so far.

With much of tomorrow`s funeral ceremony taking place outside, a massive security operation is underway. As 170 foreign dignitaries are expected to attend, snipers will be on the rooftops, drone detecting technology is in place and more than 8,000 security forces will patrol the streets.</p><p>TINA KRAUS (voiceover): The Vatican has released an image of Pope Francis` tomb, made from marble with the simple inscription Franciscus. The Pope also approved a break in tradition just last year, removing the centuries- old practice of popes being buried in three coffins.</p><p>Yesterday, rosary prayers at the church where the Pope will be buried, the Basilica of St. Mary Major, led by Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle of the Philippines. He`s mentioned as one of a handful of candidates who could become the next pope.</p><p>New York Archbishop Timothy Dolan is one of 135 cardinals eligible to vote in the conclave to choose Francis` successor.</p><p>CARDINAL TIMOTHY DOLAN (Archbishop of New York): We certainly want somebody with his gracious, humble, simple, loving style.</p><p>TINA KRAUS (voiceover): The date of the conclave is expected to be announced after the funeral.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>JESSI MITCHELL: So Tina, what happens between now and tomorrow`s funeral?</p><p>TINA KRAUS: Well, we do know that later today, President Trump and the First Lady are expected to leave Washington and they will fly here to Rome before the president joins other leaders like President Zelenskyy from Ukraine.</p><p>But the biggest thing that we know is that, you know, behind me, we still got the long, long, long lines of mourners. They only have so many hours left before 8 p.m. tonight when the viewing is cut off. That`s when the pope`s coffin will be sealed, a veil placed over his face first, then the coffin sealed ahead of the funeral tomorrow. But the stage is set down here. They`ve built the altar up, they`ve added more chairs, and they have a massive security operation in place to make sure that everyone can stay safe as they remember the pontiff.</p><p>Jessi?</p><p>JESSI MITCHELL: Tina Kraus at the Vatican, thank you.</p><p>And we will bring you the funeral of Pope Francis live tomorrow morning.

As CBS` Erica Brown reports from the White House, it`s the latest push to bring the two sides to peace.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>ERICA BROWN (voiceover): After an hours-long barrage of Russian airstrikes on Ukraine`s capital, President Trump reacted on social media, telling Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R) (U.S. President): I didn`t like last night, I wasn`t happy with it, and we`re in the midst of talking peace and missiles were fired, and I was not happy with it.</p><p>ERICA BROWN (voiceover): As he met with Norway`s Prime Minister at the White House Thursday, the president spoke about Russia`s assault that killed at least a dozen people. The deadliest attack on Kyiv in close to a year.</p><p>ERICA BROWN: Trump has repeatedly said Russia, which invaded Ukraine more than three years ago, is more willing than Ukraine to broker a peace deal. The president was asked what concessions Russia has offered so far.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP: Stopping the war, stopping taking the whole country, pretty big concession.</p><p>ERICA BROWN (voiceover): In an interview airing Sunday on CBS` Face the Nation, moderator Margaret Brennan asked Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov whether Putin agrees with Trump`s assertion that the U.S. and Russia may have a deal to end the war.</p><p>SERGEY LAVROV (Russian Foreign Minister): The president of the United States believes, and I think rightly so, that we are moving in the right direction. The statement by the president mentions a deal and we are ready to reach a deal, but there are still some specific points, elements of this deal which need to be fine-tuned.</p><p>ERICA BROWN (voiceover): President Trump is pushing a proposal that would reportedly exclude Ukraine from NATO and freeze the fighting close to the current front lines. Erica Brown, CBS News, the White House.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>JESSI MITCHELL: A federal judge in Maryland ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a second man deported last month to a prison in El Salvador, despite having a pending asylum application. The judge said the removal of the Venezuelan man, identified only as Christian, violated a 2019 court settlement agreement. The judge cited another federal judge`s order for the government to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was deported to El Salvador the same day.</p><p>And the Trump administration was dealt another setback, this one in its efforts to withhold federal funds from schools with DEI programs. Three different federal judges issued separate rulings yesterday, blocking the Department of Education from cutting off billions of dollars in funding. The decisions came ahead of today`s deadline for states to sign a form saying they would not use certain DEI practices or risk losing federal money.</p><p>Breaking overnight, at least six tornadoes touched down in the south and central U.S. from Texas to Iowa. This is what it looked like in Canadian Texas near the Oklahoma border as a powerful storm pushed through the region. More than 100 miles to the north, a possible tornado was spotted near Freedom, Oklahoma.</p><p>And a thunderstorm packing heavy rain, hail and damaging winds caused flooding in Omaha, Nebraska.

It`s the Garden State`s largest fire in nearly two decades. Officials say it`s been difficult to keep this fire under control.</p><p>BILL DONNELLY (New Jersey Forest Fire Service Chief): We just could not get far enough ahead of this fire, based on its behavior, that we were able to actually keep it in check.</p><p>RAY STRICKLAND (voiceover): Nineteen-year-old Joseph Kling is accused of starting the fire on Tuesday. Authorities say Kling lit wooden pallets for a bonfire and left the area. Investigators used advanced equipment to track him down.</p><p>MAN 1: There was some technology that was involved, the GPS coordinates, we were able to establish, and that really led us to Joseph Kling and some of the witnesses that we were able to find.</p><p>RAY STRICKLAND (voiceover): This home and several buildings were damaged as the fire spread rapidly due to high winds, dry brush, and low humidity. Evacuations have now been lifted after some 5,000 people were forced to flee.</p><p>WOMAN: Didn`t sleep all night, and then we got the notice that we could go back, but it`s still very unsettling because look at it.</p><p>RAY STRICKLAND (voiceover): Firefighters are making progress. The blaze is now about 50% contained, but winds are blowing the smoky air towards New York and Long Island, creating health concerns for millions of people.

The trial is set to begin in August.</p><p>And the \"Chicago Tribune\" says Highland Park, Illinois parade shooter Robert Crimo III was sentenced to life in prison without parole.

The fires  in January 2025 have <url normalizedValue=\"https://ktla.com/news/california/wildfires/palisades-eaton-wildfire-damage-maps/\">burned thousands of structures</url>, along with the building materials, furniture, paints, plastics and electronics inside them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When materials like these burn, they can release toxic chemicals with the potential to harm people breathing the air downwind.</p><p>A 2023 <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgad186\">study of smoke</url> from fires in the wildland-urban interface - areas where urban neighborhoods bleed into the wildlands - found it contained a vast array of chemicals harmful to humans, including <url normalizedValue=\"https://wwwn.cdc.gov/TSP/MMG/MMGDetails.aspx?mmgid=758&amp;toxid=147\">hydrogen chloride</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://wwwn.cdc.gov/tsp/substances/ToxSubstance.aspx?toxid=25\">polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/dioxin/learn-about-dioxin\">dioxins</url> and a range of toxic organic compounds, including known carcinogens such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/benzene\">benzene</url>, as well as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532257/\">toluene</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://wwwn.cdc.gov/TSP/MMG/MMGDetails.aspx?mmgid=291&amp;toxid=53\">xylenes</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://wwwn.cdc.gov/TSP/PHS/PHS.aspx?phsid=419&amp;toxid=74\">styrene</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://wwwn.cdc.gov/TSP/MMG/MMGDetails.aspx?mmgid=216&amp;toxid=39\">formaldehyde</url>. The researchers also found metals in the smoke, including lead, chromium, cadmium and arsenic, which are known to <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.643972\">affect several body systems</url>, such as the brain, liver, kidney, skin and lungs.</p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c06653\">short-term effects of exposure</url> to smoke like this can trigger asthma attacks and cause lung and cardiac problems.</p><p>But smoke can also have long-term effects, and those are less well understood. As an <url normalizedValue=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CGBqQIgAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">environmental toxicologist</url> who focuses on wildfire smoke health effects, I, along with many of my colleagues, am increasingly concerned about the impact of long-term and repeated exposures to wildfire smoke that more people are now facing.</p><h>Long-term smoke exposure is increasing</h><p>Nationwide, the acreage burned in wildfires in the U.S.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2022-06/57970-Wildfires.pdf\">has nearly doubled each decade</url> since 1990. That is changing how people are exposed to wildfire smoke.</p><p>Communities have found themselves blanketed in smoke for days and weeks at a time <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.16006\">increasingly often</url>. In 2023, massive <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/north-americas-summer-of-wildfire-smoke-2023-was-only-the-beginning-210246\">wildfires in Canada</url> repeatedly spread thick smoke into many U.S. communities. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-inventories/2020-national-emissions-inventory-nei-plan\">Controlled burns</url>, which firefighters set to clear away flammable brush and reduce the severity of future wildfires, also add smoke to the air.</p><p>Wildfire smoke is now the <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06522-6\">leading source of PM2.5</url> - microscopic particulate matter than can penetrate into the lungs - in the western U.S.</p><p>This growing exposure increases the need to understand the long-term consequences of living and working in wildfire-risk areas.</p><h>Dose, duration and frequency matter</h><p>When scientists study the health risks of wildfire smoke, they tend to use analysis methods that were developed to assess health effects caused by low-level, chronic, urban air pollution exposures - picture car exhaust or smokestack emissions. However, these approaches fail to capture the dynamic and intense nature of wildfire smoke. </p><p>Researchers suspect there are differing consequences for people exposed to smoke at varying intensities and durations. Repeated exposure to wildfire smoke may also have compounding health effects over time. </p><p>To study the long-term impact of wildfire smoke, scientists need to know how much smoke people were exposed to, for how long and how often. That's not an experiment anyone can conduct on humans in a lab, but the data can be gathered from communities being affected by wildfires.</p><p>Right now, however, this kind of data collection is rare.</p><p>Most studies that have explored long-term exposure, such as its <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2023.3300\">impact on dementia</url> or <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16193720\">pregnancy</url>, have used an average exposure over years rather than detailed data on exposures.</p><p>A few have focused on specific events. For example, a study of residents who had been exposed to six weeks of smoke during the 2017 Rice Ridge Fire near Seeley Lake, Montana, found their <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/toxics8030053\">lung function was significantly reduced</url> for at least two years after the fire. That was a forest fire, and while burning vegetation is bad, it's generally thought to be less toxic than burning buildings. </p><h>Thinking differently about smoke exposure</h><p>Improving understanding of the long-term effects of wildfire smoke will require thinking differently about smoke.</p><p>If epidemiologists can begin clearly defining the negative health effects from wildfire smoke exposure in terms of dose, duration and frequency in their studies, taking into account the dynamic and episodic nature, then toxicologists can model these human experiences in animal experiments.</p><p>These experiments would have the potential to improve the understanding of the long-term health risks and then help scientists develop effective guidelines and strategies to mitigate harmful exposures.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Luke Montrose receives funding from the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CONUSA-247463</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CONUSA2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DWX-X6N3-RRSJ-M25V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463575</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"743\"/><timeReceived>7:00 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Conversation - United States</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"6137\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"01\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>January 15, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Business &amp;

But what about the EPs? The shorter projects call for a shorter list, so here are the five best EPs of 2024.</p><p>READ MORE: Editor's pick: The top 10 albums of 2024</p><p>5. \"Sweet Boy pt. 1\" by Malcolm Todd</p><p>Originally an EP at the start of the year, \"Sweet Boy pt. 1\" is composed of five alternative and indie songs and is an easy and fun listen. \"4Me 4Me\" is the best of the project, led by an addicting bounce and layered vocals.</p><p>Other tracks like \"Ladygirl\" and \"Thailand\" continue this vibe. Todd created an exciting experience on \"Sweet Boy pt. 1\" that is both danceable and chill, and it's absolutely worth a listen.</p><p>4. \"Descanso\" by Angela Mu\u00f1oz</p><p>This EP cultivates a heavenly feel in every single song. The 20-minute listen is well worth it; it's an experience that envelopes you fully into the music. The way the project flows is similar to Steve Lacy's \"The Lo-Fis:\" The songs almost combine into one another while keeping their own style.</p><p>But what truly makes this EP great is Angela Mu\u00f1oz's ethereal voice. \"Forest Fire\" is perhaps the best song, but \"Descanso\" as a whole is worth a listen.</p><p>3. \"For You\" by Troy Javelona</p><p>For those who enjoy a good R&amp;B and soul feel, this EP is \"For You.\" Each song flows into one another without sounding too much of the same, and though the project only lasts 17 minutes, it's still a joyful and complete ride.</p><p>Songs like \"Dance\" are groovy while songs like \"Letting Go\" are memorable and slower. The titular song \"For You\" is a good balance between the bright and joyful songs and the unhurried and more meaningful music within the EP.</p><p>2. \"JRNY\" by Jordan Ward and Joony</p><p>When looking for a chill vibe, look no further. \"JRNY\" is consistently relaxed while being upbeat one song and slow on the next. The layering of music and voices is what makes this EP stand out, especially in the track \"Jealousy.\" Whether played in the background or listened to through AirPods, all the songs have the ability to change the atmosphere in the best way possible.</p><p>Ultimately, the EP gives off similarities to Brent Faiyaz's songs \"Been away\" and \"Trust\" while still having its own flavor. So for those who enjoy Faiyaz's work, this EP could expand your taste.</p><p>1. \"14 minutes\" by Dominic Fike</p><p>Dominic Fike's newest EP is the epitome of summer music. It is meant to be blasted in the car on a hot summer day, or - quite honestly - every day of the year.</p><p>While listening, each song stands out and is memorable: TikTok sensation \"misses\" is fun and upbeat, \"hi grace\" is a catchy autotune and piano-filled hit, and \"coast2coast\" is quick and thrilling.</p><p>If anything, the biggest downfall of the project is it being only 14 minutes. Yet, it only being that long is what makes it iconic. Every song hits and this EP is a good way to spend 14 minutes of any day.</p><p>Editor's note: The opinions presented in this review are the author's and do not imply any endorsement from The State Press or its editors.</p><p>Edited by Andrew Dirst, Sophia Braccio and Natalia Jarrett.</p><p>Reach the reporter at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:sjames51@asu.edu\">sjames51@asu.edu</email> and follow @sennajames_ on X.</p><p>Like The State Press on Facebook and follow @statepress on X.</p><p>Senna JamesCommunity Editor</p><p>Senna is a sophomore studying journalism and mass communication with a minor in Spanish.

According to news reporting out of Beijing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Forest fires are characterized by a rapid and devastating nature, underscoring the practical significance of forest fire risk monitoring.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science And Beijing Engineering Research Center For Global Land Remote Sensing Products; National Key Research And Development Program of China. <br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Beijing Normal University: \"Currently, forest fire risk assessments inadequately account for non-meteorological hazard factors, lack the hazard-formative environment and contextual disaster knowledge for fire occurrence mechanisms. In response, based on MODIS products, we augmented the FFDI (forest fire danger index) with the RDST (regional disaster system theory) and selected various fire risk indicators, including lightning. MOD14 was used for the correlation analysis of fire and its indicators. Through the amalgamation of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), the entropy method, and the minimal relative entropy theory, we formulated the CFFRI (composite forest fire risk index) and assessed forest fire risks spanning from 2010 to 2019 in Southwest China, which were validated with historical disaster data and MCD64. The findings revealed that the CFFRI yields consistently higher overall fire risk values, with 89% falling within the high-risk category and 11% within the moderate-risk category. In contrast, the FFDI designated 56% of cases as fourth-tier fire risks and 44% as third-tier fire risks.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Notably, the CFFRI achieved an accuracy of 85% in its calculated results, while the FFDI attained 76%. These outcomes robustly demonstrate a superior applicability of the CFFRI compared with the traditional FFDI.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Development of an Index for Forest Fire Risk Assessment Considering Hazard Factors and the Hazard-Formative Environment.

Twenty-odd years after <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wicked,</emphasis> the indomitable diva won't stay earthbound on a Broadway stage. But instead of wowing Oz astride a broomstick, Menzel's strapped into a climbing harness, vaulting off the trunk of a mammoth redwood, twisting, twirling-<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">and</emphasis> tickling the stratosphere with E-flats. As always, Menzel is pure magic. The show around her? So wooden.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I don't care how balsa-weak that joke is (will I be the 14th hack to use it, or the only one lacking self-restraint?). <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.redwoodmusical.com/\">Redwood</url> rhymes with deadwood, the derogatory term for people or things that no longer serve a function. Menzel has plenty to give. She could be the greatest squandered resource on Broadway in decades, which makes this well-intentioned misfire more frustrating: they are literally hanging Menzel out to dry.\u00a0</p><p>Co-conceived by the star and writer-director <url normalizedValue=\"https://observer.com/person/tina-landau/\">Tina Landau</url>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Redwood</emphasis> is an arboreal fable about trees and grief, an everywoman's quest for healing. The opening is a rather a blur of clunky exposition, as Landau serves up a scrapbook montage that \"tesseracts\" memories: New York gallerist Jesse (Menzel) dates art photographer Mel (De' Adre Aziza); they get married; raise a son (<url normalizedValue=\"https://observer.com/person/zachary-noah-piser/\">Zachary Noah Piser</url>); quarrel a lot and lose the son to a drug overdose-after which Jesse, in a fit of desperation, drives West to Northern California in search of...something? She falls asleep in redwood forest and the next morning a pair of bewildered canopy botanists discover her, like a princess in a fairytale. Jesse has found her purpose! To scale hundreds of feet up a trunk and commune with nature. Our hero stalks the scientists, hoping to rappel like them.\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://observer.com/person/khaila-wilcoxon/\">Khaila Wilcoxon</url> and Idina Menzel in &lt;em&gt;Redwood&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class=\"media-credit\"&gt;Matthew Murphy and Evan Zimmerman&lt;/span&gt;'&gt;</p><p>In her first outing on Broadway, composer and co-lyricist <url normalizedValue=\"https://observer.com/person/kate-diaz/\">Kate Diaz</url> sets the extended opening sequence to a synth-heavy number called \"Drive,\" the lyrics of which are often hard to make out. When you finally grasp a few lines- \"I've never had the chance to dance in rain before. / And I've never had the chance to breathe an air so pure. / Under a boundless sky, I ask myself why...\"-you realize the extra ear strain was in vain. This kind of factory lyric-writing is for cannibalizing on TikTok, not deepening character. Diaz assembles less of a score than an album of made-to-order soundalike tracks tailored for Menzel's girlish vibrato and powerful belt-but the vocal writing is often muddy, the melodies derivative. Here's a scoop of Taylor Swift, now a chunk of Coldplay, maybe a slice or two of Bruno Mars.\u00a0</p><p>Some songs come close to gaining traction as musical-theater numbers: Playing a grizzled but kindly botanist, <url normalizedValue=\"https://observer.com/person/michael-park/\">Michael Park</url> makes a meal out of the rollicking, bluegrass-flavored \"Big Tree Religion.\" As Park's young Black colleague, the magnetic Khaila Wilcoxon has a gorgeous soprano to rival Menzel; in \"Becca's Song,\" she sings movingly about rebuilding our broken environment. Of course, Menzel gets ample opportunities to shine: the ecstatic anthem, \"Great Escape,\" a defiant ode to grief called \"No Repair,\" and \"In the Leaves,\" where our multitasking leading lady swings in harness, flips upside down, and teaches the birds a lesson in warbling.\u00a0</p><p>The performers are appealing and there are one or two funny lines (\"I don't want a pity climb,\" Jesse protests when the scientists learn she's grieving her son). But too often the songs are generic and static, matched by the book's quick-sketch characters and pop psychology. In building the central drama of a mother mourning the sudden death of her adult son, Landau has said she was inspired by the drug-related death of her nephew. Unfortunately, Landau writes with all the raw anguish of a concerned aunt with an eye for good material. We get zero sense of what Spencer was like, except that he delivered a birthday rap to his mom as a kid and was work-averse. When Jesse tells Becca the story of how Spencer died, it sounds like two overworked mothers had a mentally disturbed son with a drug problem, gave him $2,000 and packed him off to Los Angeles. You feel guilty? Maybe you should. Characters are allowed to be difficult and flawed-monstrous, even-but their arcs to closure and peace only satisfy if we truly care about them. When Spencer's cheerful ghost drops in to absolve Jesse, the gesture is hollow as a thicket of bamboo.\u00a0</p><p>The nearly two-hour run time suggests storytelling problems. Either the team couldn't find 20 minutes to trim, or didn't think they could get away with an intermission. Can't believe I'm saying this about an eco-musical but thank goodness for technology. Video designer <url normalizedValue=\"https://observer.com/person/hana-s-kim/\">Hana S. Kim</url> fills the eye with acres of luscious leaves and trunks, some of it captured on video in redwood forests, others composited through CGI. Set designer Jason Ardizzone-West arranges more than a thousand LED panels to accommodate this verdant bounty, screens that fan around the playing space and create (from the orchestra, at least) an IMAX-y immersion in the green world. One massive semicircular screen rotates to reveal the detailed trunk of a redwood. When the video POV sails over the canopy of trees or pans up and down the vertiginous scenery, you may reach for the Dramamine. Kim conjures up a climactic forest fire in artful waves of reds and oranges and swarms of black ashy particles rising in the sky. Scott Zielinski's nimble lighting design (no doubt tricky to balance with ambient projection) melds abstract mood with times of day; he sends warm shafts of sunlight between set elements to endow this world with needed depth. The airborne stunts are by <url normalizedValue=\"https://observer.com/person/melecio-estrella/\">Melecio Estrella</url> and the company BANDALOOP. They did a great job: nobody fell. Seriously, the perpendicular traversing of surfaces (\"perp walk,\" anybody?) is very cool: aerial poetry.</p><p>Had it been imagined as a pop oratorio with Nat Geo imagery, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Redwood</emphasis> might have succeeded. You'd still need finer songs and richer language. For a structure as large and complex as a Broadway musical to stand for a whole season in this degraded cultural ecology requires a deeper and broader root system. You want to leave shivering with the majesty of nature; instead, it feels like 110 minutes staring at a potted plant.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Redwood </emphasis>| 1hr 50mins.

According to news reporting out of Ballarat, Australia, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Wildfires, which can cause significant damage to power systems, are mostly inevitable and unpredictable. Fire danger indexes, such as the Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) and the Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI), measure the potential wildfire danger at a given time and location.\" </p><p><br/> Financial support for this research came from Department of Energy Environment and Climate Action. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Federation University Australia, \"Thus, by predicting these fire danger indexes in advance, power system operators can obtain valuable insight into the potential wildfire risks and can better be prepared to tackle the wildfires. However, due to dependency on weather conditions, these indexes usually have volatile time series, which make their prediction complex. Taking these facts into account, this paper, unlike previous approaches that predict fire danger indexes based on climatological models, develops a machine learning-based forecast process to predict these indexes using the relevant weather data and past performance. To do this, first, a volatility analysis approach is presented to analyse the volatility level of the time series data of a fire danger index. Afterwards, an effective machine learning-based forecast methodology using a new deep feature selection model is proposed to predict fire danger indexes.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The developed forecast methodology is tested on the real-world data of FFDI and FWI and is compared with several popular alternative methods reported in the literature.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Prediction of Fire Danger Index Using a New Machine Learning Based Method To Enhance Power System Resiliency Against Wildfires.

According to news originating from Incheon, South Korea, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Since the 1953 truce, the Republic of Korea Army (ROKA) has regularly conducted artillery training, posing a risk of wildfires - a threat to both the environment and the public perception of national defense. To assess this risk and aid decision-making within the ROKA, we built a predictive model of wildfires triggered by artillery training.\" </p><p><br/> Financial support for this research came from National Research Foundation of Korea. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Inha University, \"To this end, we combined the ROKA dataset with meteorological database. Given the infrequent occurrence of wildfires (imbalance ratio approximate to\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$\\approx $$\\end{document} 1:24 in our dataset), achieving balanced detection of wildfire occurrences and non-occurrences is challenging. Our approach combines a weighted support vector machine with a Gaussian mixture-based oversampling, effectively penalizing misclassification of the wildfires. Applied to our dataset, our method outperforms traditional algorithms (G-mean=0.864, sensitivity=0.956, specificity= 0.781), indicating balanced detection.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"This study not only helps reduce wildfires during artillery trainings but also provides a practical wildfire prediction method for similar climates worldwide.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Prediction of Forest Fire Risk for Artillery Military Training Using Weighted Support Vector Machine for Imbalanced Data.

According to news originating from Linnaeus University by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Forest fires, i.e., wildfires, often cause an inevitable strain on society and human living conditions.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Kamprad Family Foundation For Entrepreneurship. <br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Linnaeus University: \"Incident Commanders (IC) at the Fire and Rescue Services (FRS) are challenged to handle forest fires and at the same time address the forest owners' needs; this stipulates a need for collaboration, information, and communication. Hence, the aim of this study was to explore and describe the ICs' experiences and actions in their interactions with forest owners during forest fires on private property. Interviews were conducted and analyzed using Flanagan's Critical Incident Technique (CIT) to describe the experiences and actions of 22 ICs. The results showed that a firefighting operation needs clarity in information exchange with the forest owner as a stakeholder, not a victim. The trust between forest owner and IC accelerated the operational phase. The ICs demonstrate more care than the law stipulates, and they worry about the forest owners.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Therefore, the FRS needs to form a strategic partnership with forest owners and their network on a local level. Also, future forest fire drills should not only include emergency stakeholders (i.e., police, ambulance, etc.) but also forest owners and local volunteer organizations. For a resilient community, FRS and forest owner collaboration is vital.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Fire and Rescue Services' Interaction with Private Forest Owners During Forest Fires in Sweden: The Incident Commanders' Perspective.

According to news reporting out of Changchun, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Forest fires require rapid and precise early smoke detection to minimize damage.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Jilin Provincial Department of Science And Technology. <br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Changchun University of Science and Technology: \"This study focuses on employing smoke recognition methods for early warning systems in forest fire detection, identifying smoke as the primary indicator. A significant hurdle lies in the absence of a large-scale dataset for real-world early forest fire smoke detection. Early smoke videos present characteristics such as smoke plumes being small, slow-moving, and/or semi-transparent in color, and include images where there is background interference, posing critical challenges for practical recognition algorithms. To address these issues, this paper introduces a real-world early smoke monitoring video dataset as a foundational resource. The proposed 4D attention-based motion target enhancement network includes an important frame sorting module which adaptively selects essential frame sequences to improve the detection of slow-moving smoke targets. Additionally, a 4D attention-based motion target enhancement module is introduced to mitigate interference from smoke-like objects and enhance recognition of light smoke during the initial stages.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Moreover, a high-resolution multi-scale fusion module is presented, incorporating a small target recognition layer to enhance the network's ability to detect small smoke targets. This research represents a significant advancement in early smoke detection for forest fire surveillance, with practical implications for enhancing fire management.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Early Smoke Recognition Algorithm for Forest Fires.

According to news reporting originating from Istanbul Technical University by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Forest fires in Turkiye, like in other regions, have detrimental effects on wildlife habitats, water quality, air pollution, climate change, and the economy.\" </p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Istanbul Technical University: \"These fires become particularly concerning during the dry summer months. In 2021, forest fires affected over 150 thousand hectares of land across the country, with the Manavgat district in Antalya province alone witnessing the burning of approximately 60 thousand hectares of forest area. This study aims to assess the applicability and suitability of Fire Weather Index (FWI) data derived from meteorological station data in the Antalya region, as well as EFFIS FWI data generated using satellite-based meteorological information, for fire danger mapping during the Manavgat forest fire that occurred between 28 July and 6 August 2021. Additionally, correlation analyses were performed between the two FWI datasets and other relevant variables, including the difference in Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), the difference in Land Surface Temperature (dLST), and Fire Radiative Power (FRP) data detected from MODIS and VIIRS satellites. The results of the correlation analysis indicated that the FWI values obtained using in-situ meteorology station data showed much higher correlations than FWI values obtained from EFFIS, with the highest correlation (73%) observed with dLST data. Consequently, the fire danger map was created using the in-situ meteorological data, given its stronger correlation.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The results prominently revealed a widespread high-risk level across the entire Antalya province, with the Manavgat district classified into the 'Extreme' and 'Very Extreme' FWI classes, emphasizing the critical importance of utilizing in-situ meteorological data for precise fire danger assessments and proactive fire management strategies.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Fire Weather Index And Forest Fire Danger Mapping: Insights From A Case Study in Antalya - Manavgat Forest, Turkiye.

According to news reporting from Porto, Portugal, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Firefighting continues to be among the most hazardous yet least studied occupations in terms of the impact of exposure to occupational disease.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Fct/mctes. <br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from University of Porto: \"In particular, firefighters are at increased risk of adverse health effects due to exposure to significant levels of potentially harmful substances, namely carbon monoxide, particulate matter and formaldehyde, during their professional duties. This paper reports an epidemiologic study aiming to reduce the gaps in assessing the long-term effects of air pollution exposure to forest fires' combat on firefighters, namely regarding chronic obstructive pulmonary Disease (COPD) and asthma. Methods and analysis Based on the implementation in an area with high forest fires (in Portugal), the study will analyse firefighters' exposure to fire emissions by measuring air pollutants with personal exposure monitors during forest fire combat through a retrospective cohort study (exposed vs non-exposed). Moreover, based on answers to validated questionnaires and medical examinations to be performed by medical doctors, the study will assess the prevalence, incidence and exacerbation of COPD and asthma in firefighters, thus considering both short-term and long-term effects.

According to news originating from Hefei, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"With rising global temperatures, wildfires frequently occur worldwide during the summer season.\" </p><p><br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Anhui University: \"The timely detection of these fires, based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images, can significantly reduce the damage they cause. Existing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based fire detection methods usually use multiple convolutional layers to enhance the receptive fields, but this compromises real-time performance. This paper proposes a novel real-time semantic segmentation network called FireFormer, combining the strengths of CNNs and Transformers to detect fires. An agile ResNet18 as the encoding component tailored to fulfill the efficient fire segmentation is adopted here, and a Forest Fire Transformer Block (FFTB) rooted in the Transformer architecture is proposed as the decoding mechanism.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Additionally, to accurately detect and segment small fire spots, we have developed a novel Feature Refinement Network (FRN) to enhance fire segmentation accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed FireFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the publicly available forest fire dataset FLAME-specifically, with an impressive 73.13% IoU and 84.48% F1 Score.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Real-Time Wildfire Monitoring Using Low-Altitude Remote Sensing Imagery.

Majority of the fires are in the Bronx, then Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan and Staten Island.</p><p>Columbia University climate scientist Richard Seager told <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Newsweek</emphasis> in a phone interview on Thursday he isn't surprised by the recent uptick in city fires, citing a lack of precipitation across the Northeast in recent weeks. However, Seager noted the dry spell is unexpected given recent regional trends showing increased rainfall in recent years.</p><p>Outside of the city, fires have ignited across the Northeast over the past few weeks, with over 450 in Massachusetts alone since October, according to Governor Maura Healey's November 12 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mass.gov/news/governor-healey-thanks-firefighters-asks-public-to-do-their-part-to-contain-fire-risk\">press release</url>.</p><p>In New Jersey, Governor Phil Murphy <url normalizedValue=\"https://dep.nj.gov/newsrel/24_0054/\">declared</url> a drought warning, writing that \"the New Jersey Forest Fire Service has responded to 537 wildfires, a more than 1,300 percent increase in wildfires over the same period last year.\" Earlier this week, much of Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York were under red flag warnings, due to dry and windy conditions conducive to fires.</p><p>The Inwood Hill Park three-alarm fire, which is considered significant on a scale of 1 to 5, required around 145 firefighters to combat the \"very, very large, extensive brush fire, approximately 400 by 400,\" FDNY chief of fire operations Kevin Woods said in a press conference last night.</p><p>He noted that firefighters faced several topographical challenges including, having to pull water from the Harlem River and stretch the \"hose lines approximately 150 feet or more up a hill to extinguish multiple fires,\" calling it was a \"very, very dangerous operation.\"</p><p>In a shock to the city, fires have burned across the boroughs, notably in frequented family spaces including Brooklyn's Prospect Park, the Bronx's Van Cortlandt Park, and just outside the city, with New Jersey's Jennings Creek still ablaze after burning 2,283 acres in New Jersey, <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/njdepforestfire/status/1856849642694021515\">according</url>to the New Jersey Forest Fire Service. As of Wednesday evening, the first was 50 percent contained.</p><p>The city has issued air quality alerts following increased smoke and air particulate pollution that are \"unhealthy for sensitive groups.\" At a press conference yesterday, New York City Mayor Eric Adams recommended individuals with respiratory issues to stay indoors, use air filters, and air conditioning.</p><p>New York state has implemented a statewide burn ban until November 30. This prohibits people from starting any outdoor fires including uncontained campfires. In addition, grilling has been banned in New York City Parks.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Northeast drought monitor: What are the current drought conditions?</emphasis></h><p>According to the U.S. drought monitor, the city, and many neighboring counties including across state lines, are experiencing \"severe drought.\"</p><p>The New York City Department of Environmental Protection reported as of Wednesday, that September and October received more than 3 inches less rain than historical averages, at 1.36 and 0.87 inches respectively, and so far, there has only bee 0.21 inches of rain in November.</p><p>The department also reported that the reservoirs that feed the city's water supply system are at 62 percent capacity, compared to 79.2 percent normally. Adams noted this in his press conference, saying, \"We need rain. And we can't get any clearer than that. Not only downstate, but up where our reservoirs are located.\"</p><p>\"Since late September, there's been very little precipitation in the Northeast and that is really, really surprising,\" Seager told <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Newsweek. </emphasis></p><p>He explained that in the tri-state area, \"for decades it's been getting wetter here, and in particular its been getting wetter in the fall and in particular October. So these five, six weeks of dry conditions appear as a stunning drop in precipitation amongst what is overall a trend towards wetter conditions.\"</p><p>He largely credited this drought to \"random atmospheric dynamics,\" that are resulting in a \"sequence of unfortunate weather\" fueling fires.</p><p>Regarding the trend towards a wetter climate, he said \"Climate models predict that precipitation should be increasing in the Northeast as a result of human driven climate change and that is occurring primarily because as the Atlantic Ocean warms up that puts more moisture in the atmosphere above it. Then a storm system could pick that moisture up and bring it to the Northeast.\"</p><p>He noted that the \"wetting that has occurred here is way in excess of what models predict should have happened,\" suggesting there might be other factors at play beyond human driven climate change.</p><p>Seager echoed New York City officials, emphasizing the importance of avoiding smoking or barbecuing in parks, warning that small ignitions can easily spark brush fires in the dry conditions and given the season, where dried leaves cover the floor.</p><p>Unlike in California, where wildfires are more common and forecasters can better predict dry or wet seasons based on tropical Pacific Ocean patterns, in the Northeast, \"our range of predictability is limited to the one, one and a half weeks of weather predictions, and unfortunately it says it's going to be dry,\" he said.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2520912/ny-drought-map.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>NY Drought Map</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>National Drought Mitigation Center</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Map indicating the various levels of drought throughout the state of New York as of November 12, 2024 data.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWKCOM-1985879</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWKCOM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DDP-P8S1-JBR6-94V4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472435</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"913\"/><timeReceived>4:13 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright \u00a9 2024 Newsweek Inc.

This earlier post focused on single images as data points that themselves contain data. Analyzing other types of sources adds additional considerations of how the data points have been arranged and for what purpose.</p><p>These newspaper clippings from January 27 and 29, 1937, communicate data about flooding along the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. Allow time for students to examine the clippings and then ask them to describe what stands out. What data can they identify? What are they curious about? What can they tell about what was important at the time and place of publication? What do they think was the purpose of these reports?</p><p>Students may also be curious about the specific numbers reported. How accurate are they, and how was the data collected? How does the image with the telephone pole convey mathematical information without using specific numbers? Statistical problem-solving can lead students to ask and answer questions about the causes of this flood, determine why it was so disastrous, or make comparisons with other floods. Additional data from around the country is available here and in this collection.</p><p>In response to flooding disasters across the country, the United States Forest Service produced The Adventures of Junior Raindrop in 1948. It tells a story using cartoon imagery, colorful language, and real-life film footage. Ask students to watch this 7-minute film and to consider some of the following questions:</p><p>What data is evident in the film? What research might it be based upon?</p><p>Why was this film made and who was its intended audience?</p><p>What questions does the film raise about how water travels on the surface, how gullies are formed, and how they grow?</p><p>What claims are made in the film and what data might support those claims? For example, consider the claim made at 4:42. Could the destruction shown earlier in the film be directly attributable to a forest fire?</p><p>What purposes might be served by the use of phrases such as \"hoodlum\" raindrops that \"gang up\" to flood valleys?</p><p>Oral histories, the written word, figures and images are all data about the earth's environment. Data informs human actions on individual and societal scales. Statistically literate students examine both data and the stories told around it and seek multiple sources of data as part of their investigations.</p><p>Considering recent flooding events in the United States and around the world, students can propose statistical research questions based on current data in the news. Ask students to generate criteria that they can use to ensure that the conclusions they are drawing from this data are built on solid ground.</p><p>The next post in this series takes a closer look at erosion data.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126871474</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DMF-HHP1-JCBF-S45V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"506\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"12\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>December 10, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>LIBRARY OF CONGRESS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>FOREST SERVICE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>Education Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>Student Confessions</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkYwNzRENUMxQzgyNEZFM0E4RTZEQzgyQ0MxQzZBRjE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjYyMjJFNDI5RTZDNEExMjhBMUIwRDQxNzQ2QTYxMzM</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>N519120MM</classCode><className>LIBRARIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921190TM</classCode><className>NATIONAL LIBRARIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLBO</classCode><className>CARTOONS &amp; COMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001965</classCode><className>SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp; LIFESTYLE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0009U58</classCode><className>HISTORY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>N519120MM</classCode><className>LIBRARIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921190TM</classCode><className>NATIONAL LIBRARIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLBO</classCode><className>CARTOONS &amp; COMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000A2VV</classCode><className>MISSISSIPPI RIVER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

This year's report covers 20 years of state air monitoring data for air pollutants regulated under the Clean Air Act, including ground-level ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, particle pollution and lead. The report presents data from the 2023 calendar year, including the historic 2023 Canadian wildfire smoke events.</p><p>According to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center, 15 million hectares (about two million acres larger than the state of Wisconsin) burned in 2023 more than six times the annual average in Canada.</p><p>\"Five percent of the entire Canadian forest burned last year,\" said Gail Good, DNR Air Management program director. \"During the multi-day air quality advisory in late June of last year, the air monitoring network measured some of the highest PM2.5 concentrations ever recorded in the state.\"</p><p>Wildfire smoke events in 2023 resulted in the DNR issuing 15 PM2.5 air quality advisories almost five times higher than the average over the previous 12 years. PM2.5 advisories are issued when air quality has reached or is expected to reach the orange \"unhealthy for sensitive groups\" level on the Air Quality Index (AQI).</p><p>The design values used to assess PM2.5 concentrations are calculated over a three-year period. This year's Trends Report shows an increase in PM2.5 concentrations for the most recent period (2021-2023). Despite the jump caused by 2023's wildfire smoke, overall, PM2.5 concentrations have decreased 25% in the last 20 years, and all monitors measured concentrations below the 2012 federal air quality standards.</p><p>The report shows that over the last 20 years, statewide ozone concentrations have decreased by 15%. For decades, ozone concentrations have been dropping across the state. However, that trend has slowed. Last year's wildfire smoke contained ozone-forming pollutants, which, combined with recent warmer-than-usual summers, contributed to increased ozone concentrations.</p><p>As a result, the Lake Michigan shoreline area, including the Milwaukee area and parts of Sheboygan and Kenosha counties, continues to fall short of meeting the 2015 ozone standard. Wisconsin has implemented many programs that have reduced emissions of ozone-causing pollutants from power plants, industry and transportation in the state. However, these emission reductions have not resulted in the attainment of the 2015 ozone standard because most ozone-causing emissions are transported across state boundaries and are outside Wisconsin's control.</p><p>To better illustrate the latest trends, the DNR updated its Air Quality Trends Report Interactive StoryMap, which shows Wisconsin's air quality trends for each pollutant over the last 20 years.

The spectacular achievement takes the country closer to realisation of its space dreams of an independent space station of India-the Bharatiya Antariksh Station (BAS) by 2035 and an Indian-crewed lunar landing by 2040, as space-docking is a prerequisite for both. By becoming the fourth country in the world to achieve the technological feat, it also demonstrates significant advancement of the capabilities of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and brilliant space scientists of the country. The Union Cabinet's approval of the proposed establishment of the Third Launch Pad of ISRO at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre of ISRO at Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, has brightened hopes for next-generation launch vehicles of ISRO and India's human spaceflight mission. </p><p>ISRO requires new-generation, heavier launch space vehicles with stronger and advanced propulsion systems. It is not possible from the existing two launch pads, and the establishment of the third launch pad will fill the gap. The third launch pad is set to become a reality over the next four years, provided there is unhindered fund flow for meeting the estimated expenditure to the tune of nearly Rs. 4000 crores. The Space Docking Experiment (SpaDeX) mission involves two small satellites, and the two satellites will operate as a single spacecraft after docking. Subsequently, after successful undocking, the two satellites will be used for capturing high-resolution images, natural resource monitoring, vegetation studies, and on-orbit radiation environment measurements and multiple other applications. Incorporation of indigenous technologies in the SpaDex mission is reflective of India developing its self-reliance in space exploration. The successful soft landing of the Chandrayaan-3 on the lunar surface, which stole the show for the global scientific community, also showcased the expertise of ISRO scientists in developing indigenous cutting-edge space technology and capabilities that few other nations possess. The Union Cabinet has already granted its approval to the Chandrayaan-4 mission to develop and demonstrate the capabilities to land on the Moon and return. Successful achievement of the Chandrayaan-4 will be critical to India achieving one of its space dreams of Indian astronauts landing on the lunar surface and safely returning to the earth. The SpaDex success has laid the ground for the Chandrayaan-4 launch, which is tentatively scheduled for 2027. India's rapid advancement in space technology has revolutionised the country's communication ecosystem, facilitating most people living in far-flung and remote areas, like borderland areas of the Northeast region, to communicate seamlessly with the rest of the world. Satellite-based remote sensing applications have unlocked tremendous growth potential in agriculture, facilitated better disaster management, land use studies, forest mapping, forest fire management, weather forecasting, urban planning, etc. Wide application of space technologies requires a dynamic human resource with specialised knowledge and skills. The North Eastern Space Application Centre (NESAC) has been playing a pivotal role in disaster management, agricultural growth, and urban planning in the region. Expanding areas of cooperation between NESAC and the States in the region has pushed the demand for more scientist specialising in different streams of space science and engineering. This has created opportunities to motivate youth of the region to nurture dreams to explore career opportunities in space science and technology. At the 12th meeting of the NESAC Society held in Agartala in December 2024, Union Home Minister Amit Shah urged the organisation to send 100 students with science backgrounds from all the states of the region on a visit to ISRO headquarters so that they can develop interest in space and related technology and urged the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region to contribute 60% of the cost for the project. He also urged the state governments of the region to start new courses related to space technology in engineering colleges. States in the region need to play a proactive role in seizing the opportunity of grooming at least 100 students annually to develop ambition and career goals in space science and associated technology. The region developing a strong pool of space scientists and technocrats will go a long way in advancing space application for sustainable development of each state. It will also open the door for students and young scientists of the region to play a crucial role in India's space missions and increase the contribution of the region to the realisation of the country's space dreams. Youths from the region have also established their footprint in the startup revolution in India. The Central Government is setting up a dedicated venture capital fund to the tune of Rs 1,000 crore for the next five years to boost employment in the space sector by supporting startups in fields like engineering, software development, data analysis, manufacturing, logistics, professional services, etc. This has also created new opportunities for entrepreneurs from the region to diversify their startup ideas and initiatives.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SENTIL-0065609526</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SENTIL2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DXH-88T3-RTKG-53DR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438973</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"888\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Omega Printers &amp;

This approach, although not yet utilized in India, advances the current drone technology by enabling coordinated operations among multiple swarms to efficiently address forest fires.</p><p>Sundaram explains, \"A singular drone is inadequate once a fire has begun to spread. What's required is a swarm capable of mutual communication and independent decision-making.\" The team has engineered an algorithm facilitating this intricate coordination, allowing drones to independently assess a fire's magnitude and determine the necessary number of drones to extinguish it.</p><p>Upon detecting a potential fire, drones equipped with cameras and sensors are dispatched. The first drone to locate the fire becomes the focal point, drawing others to consolidate efforts. \"The drones autonomously allocate resources, directing an appropriate number of units to the most threatening fire clusters,\" Sundaram adds.</p><p>The researchers drew inspiration from the foraging patterns of Oxyrrhis marina, a marine predator, to refine their search algorithm. This biological model enables drones to adjust their search parameters dynamically, increasing efficiency in locating and addressing fires.</p><p>This decentralized, data-driven strategy ensures optimal deployment of resources, with the potential to extend beyond fire management to other disasters, such as floods and earthquakes, enhancing rescue and relief efforts.</p><p>While components of this technology have been tested, including AI-enabled fire detection and precise payload delivery, comprehensive field-testing of the full swarm strategy is pending. Future plans include integrating these drone swarms with unmanned ground vehicles for resource delivery and refueling capabilities.</p><p>Research Report:An Efficient Approach With Dynamic Multiswarm of UAVs for Forest Firefighting</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPCDLY-202403240622302805</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPCDLY2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BMG-3P41-DYJG-N004-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">288597</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"382\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Space Daily, Distributed by United Press International</copyright><publicationName>Space Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"03\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>March 23, 2024 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>india-developing-multi-swarm-drone-technology-for-forest-fire-management</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp;

(CSE: INTG | FSE: ZK9) (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cIntegral\u201d) is pleased to provide an update on the field program completed in 2024 at the Burntwood Project in Manitoba. The program focused on advancing the understanding of the project's rare earth element (\u201cREE\u201d) potential through systematic sampling and geochemical analysis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Burntwood Project is a prospective syenite-carbonatite-hosted REE target located in northern Manitoba. The 2024 field program was designed to further evaluate mineralized trends identified in historical work and to explore for new zones of mineralization. Additionally, the Manitoba Geological Survey (MGS) conducted a parallel bedrock mapping program in the northwestern Burntwood Lake area, which has provided valuable geological context for ongoing exploration efforts.</p><p>The 2024 fieldwork was made possible through funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), Mitacs, and the Manitoba Mineral Development Fund (MMDF). This collaborative funding support enabled Integral Metals to apply advanced exploration techniques, including geomicrobial and biogeochemical sampling, to refine mineralization models for the project.</p><p>Summary of 2024 Field Activities</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Rock Sampling: A total of 442 rock samples were collected from outcrops to assess REE mineralization and alteration associated with carbonatite dikes.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Soil Sampling:\u00a0857 soil samples were collected in a grid-based pattern to evaluate geochemical dispersion and pathfinder element associations.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Biogeochemical Sampling:\u00a0109 black spruce samples were collected to test for their efficacy as indicators of REE mineralization in the region.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Geomicrobial Sampling:\u00a0860 soil samples were collected to assess microbial community signatures associated with mineralization.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>The Manitoba Geological Survey\u2019s 2024 work built upon previous mapping efforts, benefiting from improved exposure due to a 2022 forest fire. Their findings included the identification of numerous carbonatite dikes within the Burntwood syenite complex, reinforcing the area\u2019s REE potential. The mapping also confirmed the presence of pegmatitic granite, quartz diorite, and tonalite intrusions, which will aid in refining exploration models. Furthermore, their study suggested an increase in the density and size of carbonatite intrusions in the northern portion of the complex.</p><p>Samples from the field program have been submitted to the Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC) for multi-element geochemical analysis, including assays for REEs, gallium, and associated pathfinder elements. The\u00a0Institute for Microbial Systems and Society (IMSS) is currently preparing the soil microbial samples for sequencing. Results are expected before summer, and will guide the next phase of exploration at Burntwood, which may include geophysical surveys and drill targeting.</p><p>\u201cWe are excited about the potential of the Burntwood Project,\u201d said Paul Sparkes, CEO of Integral Metals. \u201cThis past year\u2019s work significantly advances our understanding of the system, and we look forward to receiving assay results to refine our next steps. The Manitoba Geological Survey\u2019s contributions have been invaluable in refining our geological model.\u201d</p><p>Integral Metals remains committed to unlocking the value of the Burntwood Project through methodical exploration and data-driven decision-making.
