The incident calls for conducting a reality check on emergency calls on fire in the region to assess the preparedness for fire season from February to April. The massive fire that broke out in the river belt of the Tawang Chu River below in the Lungla Sub-Division of Tawang quickly spread, posing a threat to many villages. It is reassuring to know that timely intervention by the Lungla administration, with the support of the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) Lungla, Indian Army personnel from the Tawang Brigade, local police, and residents, successfully contained the fire near the village and residential buildings, preventing potential loss of lives and property. </p><p>Despite these efforts, the wildfire in the jungle continues to burn due to the challenging terrain of steep mountains and dense, inaccessible forest, states an official release, which is reflective of the challenges in the containment of forest fires once they break out, particularly in hilly terrain. Forest fire studies conducted by the Forest Survey of India (FSI) found the region to be falling under an extremely to very highly forest fire-prone zone, and the states of Mizoram, Manipur, Nagaland, and Tripura to be exhibiting the highest forest fire probability in terms of its frequency of event occurrence. Devastating forest fires occurring in the Lungeli district in Mizoram and the Dzukou Valley along the Nagaland-Manipur boundary in the past are grim reminders of putting people, administration, and fire and emergency services on maximum alert, particularly in the dry season. Undoubtedly, the forest fire monitoring system has significantly improved with the application of satellite and remote sensing technologies. The real-time alerts issued by FSI are intended to help the states undertake mitigation measures and control and contain large forest fires before they cause widespread devastation. The limitation of financial resources will always limit the capabilities of fire and emergency services, but the strategy of effective coordination among various agencies can scale up the capacities. The advancement of technology has improved forest fire management, but it is the people who can play the most crucial role in the vigilance and monitoring of forest fires. Indigenous communities in the region living in co-existence with nature naturally keep visiting the forest areas near their traditional villages. Building awareness among them to immediately alert the authorities when they come across incidences of forest fire can ensure timely action for containment. Aligning forest fire prevention with climate change mitigation goals is important as rising temperatures have increased the vulnerability in the region. Apart from the loss of forest cover, failure to contain forest fires causes extensive loss of wildlife and leads to the release of more carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, precipitating the global warming crisis. Loss of forest cover in the region has already become a serious issue, with aggressive pushes for development activities resulting in the diversion of forest areas, more particularly for linear infrastructure projects such as the construction of highways, laying of railway tracks, etc. The challenge is to not let forest fire incidents make it worse. This hard reality should put all states in the region on the highest alert against forest fire becoming another major contributing factor for loss of forest cover. The catastrophic wildfire in Los Angeles destroyed over 10,000 residences and other structures, including those of many Hollywood celebrities, and caused the loss of forest over an area of more than 13,000 hectares and led to the the evacuation of over 1.8 lakh people. Described as the worst wildfire in California's history, the scale of destruction is an eye-opener for the global community and national governments against complacency over current forest fire management and preparedness at a time when global efforts are to mitigate climate change and address the worsening global warming crisis. Expansion of urban settlement closer to forest areas has increased the risk in the region, but fire emergency services have not proportionately been strengthened. Besides, poor connectivity to many places is a major obstacle to timely action by fire and emergency services, particularly in hilly areas of Assam and the hill states. When forest conservation and restoration figures are high on the priority list for the government, forest fire prevention cannot remain low on the list. Increased budgetary allocations by the states for strengthening fire and emergency services are not a choice but an urgent necessity. The requirements in this regard must come from the village-level planning process so that an adequate emergency response system can be developed at an ideal location to respond to fire calls in a cluster of villages within the shortest possible response time. The availability of fire and emergency services and village-level volunteers can help mobilise quick response teams to overcome the problem of the availability of men and materials.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SENTIL-0065663834</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SENTIL2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F0N-MNP3-RRR6-X16W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438973</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"887\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Omega Printers &amp;

Specifically, in the same one, consulted by Europa Press, it is stated that, although Tragsa \"is not legitimized to negotiate\" this sectorial collective agreement, it can negotiate \"its own company agreement\".<br/>Thus, from the department headed by Carlos Novillo have argued that in this way could include all staff performing work in prevention and suppression of forest fires, \"allowing a homogeneity in the working conditions of professionals who perform the same functions\".<br/>THREE-WAY MEETING NEXT WEEK AND IMPROVEMENTS IN THE ORDER<br/>During the meeting, the Community of Madrid has also urged the public company to convene a meeting with the workers' representatives next week to make progress in the resolution of the labor dispute and has confirmed that it will introduce labor improvements in the renewal of the contract to the public company that will come into force from next year.<br/>In this meeting, representatives of the Agencia de Seguridad y Emergencias Madrid 112 (ASEM112) will deliver the improvement plan of the bases and infrastructures of which these representatives were informed last July.<br/>Likewise, it has been confirmed to Tragsa the decision to continue with the prevention, assessment, surveillance, detection and support to the Fire Brigade of the Community of Madrid in forest fire extinction tasks and in certain interventions related to adverse meteorological episodes.<br/>In the new contract, which will come into force as from 2026, improvements will be introduced, such as an increase in the budget item by 4 million Euros, thus amounting to a total of over 32 million Euros per year. In addition, as was communicated to the workers in July, it will contemplate the hiring of personnel during the 12 months of the year.<br/>All this with the aim of increasing prevention actions with a more stable and professionalized operation, according to sources from the Regional Ministry, as pointed out to Europa Press.<br/>From the Community of Madrid it has been remarked that in this way \"continues in the search for solutions\" to the labor situation of this group, claims that the regional executive recognizes as \"necessary\".<br/>The works council - formed by the unions UGT, Firet and CGT - denounces the precarious and temporary situation in which they carry out their work and demands labor improvements for the collective and the negotiation of the collective agreement, which has not been revised since 2008.<br/>Among other demands, they ask to update salaries, frozen since 2010, to take into account the danger, hardship and toxicity involved in their work - they are not protected against carcinogenic agents - and to put an end to the temporary situation - 40% of the workforce is working four months a year.<br/>In statements to Europa Press, Jes\u00fas Molina, from Firet, explained that they also demand improvements in bases that have been abandoned for 20 years or that Law 5/2024, approved on November 8, 2024, is applied, something that the Community of Madrid does not do.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-72302551</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GJS-G1B3-RS1P-J31N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"794\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 22, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>america</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>agencias</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000DKTF</classCode><className>SURVEILLANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N813930MM</classCode><className>LABOR UNIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097C9</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS &amp;

At first, it was tried to extinguish the flames with municipal means.<br/>It was around 5.46 am when the Junta de Andaluc\u00eda declared the level 1 emergency for the forest fire. Level 1 is activated in those fires in which, being able to be controlled with the ordinary means and resources available in the Junta de Andaluc\u00eda is estimated, by its possible evolution, the need for the implementation of measures for the protection of people and property of non-forest nature.<br/>In this sense, it came to warn to leave their homes preventively to \"more than 50 neighbors\" in the area of El Marchal and Campico Moletas, where parts of the municipality are shared with B\u00e9dar. Five residents of Los Albaricos and Fuente de los Albaricos, who were already able to return to their homes, were also evicted.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-72543968</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GM8-88F3-RX6H-205Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"330\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 29, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>america</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>agencias</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0008XWL</classCode><className>EVICTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0008XWL</classCode><className>EVICTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DFRN</classCode><className>EMERGENCY VEHICLES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>ST000A2MA</classCode><className>ANDALUSIA, SPAIN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

This is a step that significantly increases the rescue capacity of the association and the safety of local residents. There are 34 permanent residents living on Naissaar and over 20,000 people visit the island every year. The rescue vehicle was brought from the city of Kotka, Finland. The technical inspection was carried out on site by Herki Parbo , a member of the rescue association, who also took the car for the first test drive. In his opinion, the car is technically in good condition and is fully suitable for operational use in island conditions.</p><p>Naissaare's new rescue vehicle is four-wheel drive and equipped with a winch and ladder - this is an important additional equipment that allows, for example, to pull out vehicles stuck in sand on coastal areas or to perform rescue work at heights.</p><p>According to Indrek Vaik , a representative of the Naissaar Volunteer Rescue Society, their society is the first responder on the island for all kinds of rescue incidents:'Whether it's a forest fire, a traffic accident or a medical emergency - the addition of a rescue vehicle significantly strengthens our capabilities, improves the speed of response and increases the scope of operations. Since there is no permanent professional rescue team on the island, a lot of responsibility falls on the volunteers,' said Vaik.</p><p>The municipality has strategically developed the rescue capabilities of its small islandsAccording to the mayor of the municipality, Illar Lemetti, Viimsi municipality has made a strong contribution to ensuring the security of the permanently inhabited islands of the municipality:</p><p>'The strategic goal of the municipality is for Prangli and Naissaar to have a functioning rescue capability that can respond to an initial rescue event autonomously, without involving the national rescue capability, because it takes time to get help to the islands. Cooperation with the Naissaar and Prangli communities has become stronger and more open, and mutual interests are increasingly taken into account.'</p><p>According to Deputy MayorAlar Mik , Naissaar's rescue capability is an important part of the broader Estonian rescue capability network, for which the Rescue Board is responsible at the national level.'However, at the local level, the role of Viimsi Rural Municipality is to ensure that the island has primary rescue equipment and readiness to carry out rescue operations. As previously in the case of Prangli, the development of rescue capability on Naissaar has also taken place in cooperation with the Rescue Board,' added Alar Mik.</p><p>Note: This is an automated translated version of the story which may have translation errors.

The fires we've suffered this year have also affected Portugal and so we're going to propose to the Portuguese and French governments that we can work together on this pact of state in the face of the climate emergency,\" said S\u00e1nchez.<br/>The Spanish Prime Minister also said that he will tell the European Commission, \"which is the government of Europe\", that it is necessary to \"do anything but go backwards in the ecological transition\", condemning climate change denialist speeches.<br/>S\u00e1nchez, who was speaking in Madrid at a government event to present the State Pact he is defending, considered that the impact of climate change was one of the factors behind the size and violence of this summer's fires, the largest on record in Spain.<br/>\"Climate change kills,\" he said.<br/>But the Prime Minister also pointed to other reasons for the fires, such as \"inadequate\" land management, with forest areas \"loaded with biomass\", roads without firebreaks or a lack of native or flame-resistant tree species.<br/>S\u00e1nchez also referred to \"a clearly insufficient prevention policy\" and gave as an example the lack of plans for this purpose or insufficient fire departments and forestry sappers, in both cases referring to competencies that fall to regional governments.<br/>Fires killed four people and burned around 400,000 hectares in Spain in 2025, an annual record in the country, according to the still provisional data from the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS), which has comparable records since 2006.<br/>Last week, the Spanish government declared the areas affected by 113 major fires in the country over the last two months to be disaster zones.<br/>The fires coincided with a heatwave that hit Spain between August 2 and 18 and which was the \"most intense\" and the third longest since at least 1975, since comparable records have been kept, according to the national meteorological agency (Aemet).<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-72631691</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GMX-5SW3-RWHW-G4K3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"378\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 1, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Atualidade</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Mundo</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Pol\u00edtica</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Sapo Atualidade</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> altera\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> espanha</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> inc\u00eandios</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> pedro s\u00e1nchez</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Portugal</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00097C9</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS &amp;

This effort unites state and local agencies, health care experts, and fire service professionals under a common goal: to protect Connecticut residents and their communities from the dangers of fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Keeping Connecticut families safe is our highest priority, Governor Lamont said. Fire Safe CT brings together the best of what our state has to offer public safety, health care, and environmental expertise to help residents stay safe and informed. Its a model of collaboration, and Im proud to support it.</p><p>The initiative is led by a coalition of partners, including the Connecticut Office of the State Fire Marshal, which is within the Connecticut Department of Administrative Services (DAS); the Connecticut State Police Fire and Explosion Investigation Unit and the Connecticut Fire Academy, which are both within the Connecticut Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection (DESPP); and the Connecticut Burn Center at Bridgeport Hospital. It is also being supported by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP), particularly in addressing outdoor fire risks.</p><p>Fire Safe CT focuses on two key objectives:</p><p>Public Education Delivering clear, actionable fire prevention tips to Connecticut residents through engaging multimedia campaigns, with particular emphasis on home safety, outdoor fire management, and burn injury prevention.</p><p>Community Empowerment Equipping local fire departments and municipal fire marshals with enhanced resources, educational materials, and support to bolster their community risk reduction efforts.</p><p>DAS and the Office of the State Fire Marshal are proud to be part of this effort to deliver consistent, effective fire prevention messaging and tools across Connecticut, DAS Commissioner Michelle Gilman said. Fire Safe CT will help local leaders and first responders better engage their communities and save lives.</p><p>DESPP Commissioner Ronnell A. Higgins underscored the initiatives comprehensive approach.From investigation to education to training, this initiative links every part of the fire safety ecosystem. Our agencies are united in the mission to prevent fires before they start and support recovery when they do, Commissioner Higgins said.</p><p>Connecticut State Fire Marshal Lauri Volkert highlighted the proactive nature of the program.This is more than a campaign its a commitment to prevention, Volkert said. Fire Safe CT empowers every resident and firefighter to take steps today that could save lives tomorrow.</p><p>The Connecticut Fire Academy is proud to continue its mission to be an integral part of fire prevention efforts throughout our state, Alan Zygmunt, program manager at the Connecticut Fire Academy, said. Fire Safe CT will expand that reach by providing resources and materials to departments to enhance their community programs.</p><p>The Connecticut Burn Center, as the only dedicated burn center in the state, is committed not only to healing burn injuries but to preventing them, Dr. Alisa Savetamal, medical director of the Connecticut Burn Center at Bridgeport Hospital, said. Through Fire Safe CT, we are partnering with emergency services, safety professionals, educators, families, and individuals to ensure that everyone has access to the most up-to-date prevention information.</p><p>We are proud to be part of the statewide collaborative emphasizing public safety, particularly with regard to outdoor burning, whether it be for debris management or simply enjoying a campfire with family and friends, DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said. Nearly all of Connecticut wildfires are human caused and therefore are mostly preventable. As we approach the first anniversary of one of our states most destructive fall wildfire seasons in decades, DEEP encourages all residents and visitors to learn best practices for outdoor burning. These practices include being aware of the daily forest fire danger before igniting permitted debris fires authorized by municipal open burn officials, and ensuring that campfires are cool to the touch before leaving them unattended. Please visit DEEPs website (Forest Fire Prevention Tips) for more information about best practices to protect yourself, your home and property, and our first responders.</p><p>The initiatives website, ct.gov/firesafe, offers downloadable resources for individuals and communities, including social media toolkits, template letters for local campaigns, community outreach materials, and fire risk checklists for homes and businesses.</p><p>Connecticut residents are encouraged to follow Fire Safe CT on social media:</p><p>Instagram: @fire_safe_ct</p><p>Facebook: Fire Safe CT</p><p>YouTube: @FireSafeCT</p><p>Office of the Governor</p><p>State Capitol</p><p>210 Capitol Avenue</p><p>Hartford, CT 06106</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1127303032</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GJH-GGW3-S674-C2V7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"826\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 21, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

These include strengthening forest management units, the climate village program, forest and land rehabilitation, sustainable forest management, and forest fire prevention and management.</p><p>\"In addition, we will develop a design for Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) related to carbon,\" Susanto said.</p><p>The draft also incorporates the strategic and annual work plans of the West Papua Forestry Service and the Environment and Land Service (DLHP) to avoid duplication of activities already funded by the province's 2025 regional budget (APBD).</p><p>\"This ensures that activities not included in the APBD can instead be financed through the RBP grant,\" he explained.</p><p>Susanto underlined that the distribution of the climate grant will not pass through regional coffers but will directly fund activities carried out by the Samdhana Institute.</p><p>All proposed programs have received approval from the BPDLH, while Samdhana's appointment as implementing partner reflects its proven track record.</p><p>\"Samdhana Institute has conducted conservation work in Teluk Bintuni District and several other areas in Papua,\" he said, adding that the organization also presented its activities to West Papua Governor Dominggus Mandacan on August 13.</p><p>Translator: Fransiskus Salu Weking, Cindy Frishanti Octavia</p><p>Editor: Anton Santoso</p><p>Copyright (c) ANTARA 2025</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Antara News.

Her mother, Esperanza, had had to flee from the Woolsey Fire, one of the fiercest fires ever seen in California, and the fear was too much for the beautiful little donkey inside her womb,\" Funke wrote.<br/>For his part, C\u00f3rdova recalls that the story - which has a link to Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez's Platero y yo - was recorded in a diary in which he wrote down what happened \"to understand the mystery of death that accompanies pain and to try to make sense of what has no meaning.<br/>It all began when C\u00f3rdova and his partner traveled to California, to the ranch of Cornelia Funke, author of Reckless and The Dragon Rider, who started an artistic residency program that she recently moved to Italy.<br/>We were there with her, who was exploring whether it was feasible to invite writers, musicians, illustrators from different parts of the world to have a space for creation at the ranch where she lived.<br/>That was in 2019 and the day we arrived at her ranch was very shocking, because Cornelia came out to greet us, visibly worried, because she had just given birth to her donkey, named Esperanza, who lived at the ranch and was very delicate. She then went to the veterinarians to see if they could save her,\" she recalls, but two hours later the bad news arrived: the donkey did not survive.<br/>C\u00f3rdova returned to the same place in February 2020 to stay for two months as a resident. However, the pandemic broke out and he had to stay six more months, time that served the author to complete the book.<br/>This story is very special to me, because it is the first time I have published a story based on so many real events. Besides the fact that it was an extraordinary experience that I needed to write and that I want to share with boys and girls, because life has that sadness of absence, death and pain, but it also gives us the opportunity to recover and move forward, as happened here\", he explains.<br/>Finally, he talks about the link with Platero y yo, one of the first books the writer had as a child and that, when he read it, he had the feeling of not understanding, but feeling the prose.<br/>Much of what happens there has to do with an experience of the senses. So, I wanted to evoke that reading and somehow also pay homage to the donkeys in literature,\" he concludes.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-73131052</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GRW-S7Y3-RXG1-G43G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"491\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 15, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>\u00daltima Hora</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000A4JW</classCode><className>SINGERS &amp;

Within that framework, ten agreements were established that will allow him to face the claims and, thus, avoid effects on homes and losses of wild flora and fauna.</p><p>Among the main agreements is the creation of the Unified Emergency Attention Command for Forest Fires, led by Governor Manuel Gambini and made up of the Regional Environmental Authority, the Regional Forestry Management and Silvestre Fauna, the Regional Emergency Operations Center, the National Institute of Civil Defense, the Armed Forces and the XII Departmental Comandancia de Firefighters of Ucayali.</p><p>The implementation of mobile units for the general body of Firefighters of Ucayali has also been considered, within that framework, the regional government will make two trucks and two tanks with a capacity of 5000 gallons available, and the hiring of personnel in charge of the transport of said vehicles will be managed. In addition, the delivery of two motobombs and two chainsaws has been managed, according to Vice Governor Jenny Reyna.</p><p>In turn, the commander of the XII Departmental Fire Department of Ucayali, Peter Meza, informed that, so far from 2025, 167 forest fires have been recorded in the region, being the districts of Manantay and Yarinacocha the most affected. He also said: We are close to a crucial season in terms of forest fires. After an arduous training, we start working with the first group of level II forest combatants, which already have the certification to attend these emergencies.</p><p>The director of the Regional Office of National Defense, Nestor Arroyo, mentioned that the Regional Government of Ucayali has been executing an investment project for forest fire prevention and control, through which training and awareness campaigns have been carried out in local governments. Likewise, personal protective equipment and fire kits have been delivered to various municipalities in the region. We have trained personnel to act in the front line.</p><p>In addition, the commander of the Ucayali operational command will request the Joint Command of the Armed Forces, a helicopter with a helibalde system for emergency care against forest fires.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUCLID-506944758</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUCLID2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GNH-DFH3-S41V-K3CW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">343637</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"412\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025  TendersInfo - Euclid Infotech Pvt.

According to news originating from Socorro, New Mexico, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) play a critical role in environmental monitoring and early forest fire detection.\" </p><p><br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Department of Computer Science: \"However, they are susceptible to sensor malfunctions and network intrusions, which can compromise data integrity and lead to false alarms or missed detections. This study presents a hybrid anomaly detection framework that integrates a Transformer-based Autoencoder, Isolation Forest, and XGBoost to effectively classify normal sensor behavior, malfunctions, and intrusions. The Transformer Autoencoder models spatiotemporal dependencies in sensor data, while adaptive thresholding dynamically adjusts sensitivity to anomalies. Isolation Forest provides unsupervised anomaly validation, and XGBoost further refines classification, enhancing detection precision. Experimental evaluation using real-world sensor data demonstrates that our model achieves 95% accuracy, with high recall for intrusion detection, minimizing false negatives.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The proposed approach improves the reliability of WSN-based fire monitoring by reducing false alarms, adapting to dynamic environmental conditions, and distinguishing between hardware failures and security threats.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: A Transformer-Based Autoencoder with Isolation Forest and XGBoost for Malfunction and Intrusion Detection in Wireless Sensor Networks for Forest Fire Prediction.

According to news reporting originating from the Indian Institute of Information Technology by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Forest fires pose significant threats to both natural ecosystems and human communities due to their unpredictable nature and capacity for widespread destruction. Identifying and mitigating fires in the trunk, ground, and canopy of forests is crucial for reducing their adverse effects on the ecosystem and climate.\" </p><p><br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Indian Institute of Information Technology: \"The detrimental impacts of forest fires, such as the exacerbation of the greenhouse effect, the hastening of global warming, and the modification of climatic patterns, underscore the urgent necessity for the creation of efficient detection systems. This study presents a real-time Universal Trust Model (UTM) that is specifically designed for the early forest fires detection (FFD) using an intelligent wireless sensor network and machine learning approaches. Our method seeks to reduce fire detection time and improve the reliability of the detection process. This is achieved by employing environmental indicators and moisture levels to swiftly identify fires. The intelligent WSN functions by partitioning the forest into suitable clusters and intelligently positioning sensor nodes to guarantee extensive coverage and effective data transmission to the sink. The proposed UTM system's core component is the computation of trust ratings for every sensor node. These ratings consider communication, energy, and data trust factors to evaluate the reliability of the data being delivered. This integrated trust model enhances the robustness and accuracy of fire detection, especially under difficult environmental conditions. Furthermore, a machine learning regression model is deployed at the base station to augment the precision of fire detection. This is accomplished by examining essential attributes such as temperature, humidity, and CO2 concentrations. We have conducted thorough experiments using actual datasets consisting of 7200 samples to confirm the efficacy of our proposed UTM in detecting forest fires at an early stage. The results suggest that our system obtains a high rate of data processing and a reduced time delay in comparison to existing systems.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"This renders it a promising solution for the imperative need to promptly detect and prevent forest fires. Our technique combines trust mechanisms with machine learning algorithms to create a very advanced forest fire detection system.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Trust-driven approach to enhance early forest fire detection using machine learning.

C3S data shows that August 2025 was 0.22\\xB0C cooler than the two warmest Augusts on record in 2023 and 2024.</p><p>Compared to the pre-industrial level, last month was 1.29\\xB0C warmer. And C3S says the last 12 months, from September 2024 to August 2025, have been 0.64\\xB0C above the 1991 to 2020 average and 1.53\\xB0C above the pre-industrial level.</p><p>Overall, this summer has been the world's third warmest on record, at 0.47\\xB0C above the 1991 to 2020 average. It was only cooler than the summers of 2023 and 2024.</p><p>August brings the southwest Europe's third major heatwave</p><p>At an average of 19.46\\xB0C, August in Europe was 0.3\\xB0C above average this year. This puts it outside of the continent's 10 warmest Augusts in Copernicus's data records.</p><p>But there were still some hotspots. The Iberian Peninsula and southwest France were particularly affected by heatwave conditions.</p><p>In southwest Europe, the month brought the third major heatwave of the summer, accompanied by exceptional wildfires,\" said Samantha Burgess, Strategic Lead for Climate at European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF).</p><p>More than a million hectares of land have gone up in flames across Europe so far this year, an area larger than Cyprus.</p><p>In Spain, almost 400,000 hectares of land have burned since January, according to the Copernicus European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS). More than 260,000 hectares have burned in Portugal.</p><p>A rapid analysis by World Weather Attribution found that hot, dry and windy conditions, which fuelled these fires, were made more likely and more intense by climate change.</p><p>Overall, Europe has seen its fourth warmest summer season on record at 0.9\\xB0C above the 1991 to 2020 average. Summer temperatures were above average across almost all of the continent. The only exception was some parts of Eastern Europe.</p><p>The season also brought drier-than-average conditions in much of the western and southern parts of the continent, as well as in the Balkans and Black Sea regions, and in parts of Scandinavia, Finland and northwestern Russia.</p><p>The world's oceans are unusually warm</p><p>The average sea surface temperature (SST) across most of the world's oceans was 20.82\\xB0C - the third highest value on record.</p><p>Most of the North Pacific saw much above-average SSTs, with record highs reached in some areas.</p><p>\"With the world's ocean also remaining unusually warm, these events underline not only the urgency of reducing emissions but also the critical need to adapt to more frequent and intense climate extremes,\" Burgess said.</p><p>In Europe, August was a more mixed picture. While sea surface temperatures were much less extreme than in 2024 across the Mediterranean, record highs continued in August across an area of the North Atlantic to the west of France and the UK.</p><p>Source: Euronews</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GPW-S0J3-RVWR-D2PH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"496\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 12, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC000DRDR</classCode><className>SEA LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS519290 WEB SEARCH PORTALS AND ALL OTHER INFORMATION SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>SE (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>STX001235</classCode><className>OCEANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DF9M</classCode><className>SEVERE SUMMER WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DS5V</classCode><className>OCEAN HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008YXD</classCode><className>EARTH &amp;

According to news reporting out of Seoul, South Korea, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"While geostationary satellites can provide continuous near-real-time observations, their low spatial resolution makes it difficult to detect small wildfires. Conversely, polar-orbiting satellites are capable of observing small wildfires at high spatial resolution, but can operate only within restricted observation periods.\" </p><p><br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from National Institute of Forest Science: \"To improve wildfire spread prediction accuracy using polar-orbiting satellite observations, this paper proposes a novel methodology to accurately reproduce wildfire perimeters observed at specific time points by these satellites. The approach employs a wildfire spread simulator combined with a rate of spread (ROS) adjustment factor. The proposed algorithm derives ROS adjustment factors for each fuel model based on differential evolution, achieving up to a 0.4 increase in the Sorensen index when reproducing wildfire perimeter data at given observation times. Incorporating these factors into simulator-based predictions allows comprehensive consideration of external factors affecting wildfire propagation, which have not been sufficiently accounted for in previous methods. Moreover, considering the frequent occurrence of small wildfires in Korea, this study establishes a mapping between major species of trees in Korea and corresponding Fire Behavior Fuel Models (FBFMs). This serves as an example of appropriately matching major species of trees to FBFMs for wildfire spread prediction in countries where FBFMs have not been previously applied. The methodology's effectiveness is demonstrated using wildfire perimeter data from polar-orbiting satellite observations and ignition points of recent wildfires in Korea.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The proposed algorithm is expected to significantly enhance wildfire response by swiftly providing critical information for accurate wildfire spread prediction. This will facilitate prompt and precise countermeasures for small wildfires independent of external conditions such as weather.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Reproduction of Smaller Wildfire Perimeters Observed by Polar-Orbiting Satellites Using ROS Adjustment Factors and Wildfire Spread Simulators.

However, he said that the Police has already ordered the corresponding investigations and did not rule out that these could reach the highest levels of the institution.<br/>\"These are quite delicate situations. Indeed, the General Commander (in) the press conference, gave details on the matter. My non-presence was because I was in a meeting in the Council of Ministers, and yesterday, in the Defense Committee, in a reserved session, I gave some details\", he declared.<br/>The head of the Mininter confirmed that an administrative investigation has been ordered by the Inspector General's Office and the Integrity Office.<br/>\"Not only to officers or non-commissioned officers, if it would reach responsibility in the high commands, in the same way it is going to be established, but always with due process. That is why I cannot give any kind of opinion on the matter,\" he said.<br/>Malaver also informed that the Public Prosecutor's Office has already opened a criminal investigation into the breach of DIRIN's systems.<br/>\"The corresponding security mechanisms have been taken, the processes have also been reevaluated and it has been decided to carry out the investigations, first, administrative, because I am aware that the Public Prosecutor's Office has already opened a criminal investigation\", he added.<br/>Finally, he emphasized that the Executive seeks to guarantee both the protection of the information and of the personnel whose data were exposed. \"We are going to ensure not only the security of the information, but also the security of the police personnel\", he said.<br/>According to him, this episode reflects the growing risks of cybercrime: \"These new threats are suddenly moving away from extortion or the physical presence of criminals and towards technology. This is the new modality, cyber-attacks, cyber-crime, and we have to be prepared to face these new criminal modalities that are becoming more accentuated\".<br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Public Prosecutor's Office is targeting C\u00e9sar Acu\u00f1a's administration</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Peru must recover its saving capacity to face crisis and avoid excessive indebtedness</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Dina's ballast: expert's report complicates Santiv\u00e1\u00f1ez's situation</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Personal Secretary of Pope Leo XIV congratulates young people from I.E.

According to news originating from Fuzhou, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"[Objective] Forest fire, as the primary natural and human-induced disturbance in subtropical forests, seriously affects the soil biochemical cycle. We aimed to clarify the response of soil extracellular enzyme activities to the restoration process following forest fire disturbance.\" </p><p><br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Fujian Normal University: \"[Methods] We investigated the soils of subtropical secondary forests at different stages of recovery following forest fire disturbances. Subtropical forest soils at seven stages of restoration were analyzed using a spatial substitution time series approach. The forests were categorized into three age groups, including old forests (60-70 years), middle-aged forests (30-40 years), and young forests (&lt;20 years). We aimed to reveal the succession patterns of extracellular enzyme activities and their stoichiometric characteristics following forest fire disturbances by measuring invertase activities related to soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in subtropical forest soils. [Results] The activities of soil cellulose hydrolase (CBH) and b-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) increased significantly with forest stand age, but the activities of other extracellular enzymes did not increase significantly with stand age. Correlation analysis and redundancy analysis showed that soil C and N contents were the key factors affecting the change of soil extracellular enzyme activities. In addition, the ratios of soil extracellular enzyme C, N and P were 1 0.94 1.53, 1 1.02 1.63 and 1 0.99 1.47 in young, middle and old forests, respectively, indicating that soil microorganisms in subtropical forest was limited by P, but such P-limitation was improved gradually with forest stand age following forest fire disturbance.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"[Conclusion] The extracellular enzyme activities related to soil N transformation increased with forest stand age following forest fire disturbances in subtropical forest soils. The stoichiometric characteristics of soil extracellular enzyme gradually tended to be stable, indicating that soil health was progressively improved during the restoration process following forest fire disturbance in subtropical forests.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Extracellular Enzyme Stoichiometric Characteristics of Subtropical Forest Soil under Forest Fire Disturbance.

Over the course, the program provided the group with on-the-job training opportunities, first aid certifications, chainsaw operations, trail building, forest fire suppression, and cultural learning.</p><p>This year also included a day of archaeological training at a cultural site of the Williams Lake First Nation where the group learned excavation techniques, and about the site\u2019s cultural significance and history from an Indigenous Knowledge Keeper.</p><p>Enbridge, an energy transportation company that runs a natural gas pipeline system in B.C. , has supported this program since 2022, contributing over $170,000, including $50,000 this year. Additionally, one of the program days this year includes training, career talks and a site visit at Enbridge\u2019s compressor station located south of Quesnel. This is the second straight year Enbridge hosted the students for a day where they learned about various career paths in the pipeline industry, connect with industry experts, and got to see first-hand what everyday operations look like.</p><p>\u201cThis program gives Indigenous youth the chance to earn certifications, connect with employers and work alongside industry professionals. Our hope is that this program can help them see the range of career opportunities available to them,\u201d said Peter Bird, Western Operations Manager, Outland Youth Employment Program. \u201cEvery year we see how this six-week experience change lives, and we know there are many more young people who could benefit. Support from partners like Enbridge is vital to allow us to expand our reach and provide even more Indigenous youth with access to this training and mentorship.\u201d</p><p>The program is funded by a mix of provincial and private contributions. On top of a place to stay, the students get paid for their work in the program, each earning around $3,000.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QUESNL-news20250827PSCA0004898198</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QUESNL2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GKP-RV73-RSDP-F0CN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438208</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"341\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

They are followed by those of Llamas de Cabrera, Manzaneda and O\u00edmbra, only surpassed by that of Losacio in 2022.<br/>In Europe as a whole, only eight fires have burned a larger area than Larouco. The most devastating was the one that devastated the Dadia National Park in Evros (Greece) in August 2023: according to EFFIS, the fire reached an area of almost 100,000 hectares.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Le\u00f3n and Ourense, the most affected</emphasis><br/>The bulk of the burned area has not only been recorded in a short space of time, it is also mainly concentrated in two autonomous communities: Galicia and Castilla y Le\u00f3n. These two regions, which concentrate more than 75% of the burned area this year, were also the most affected in 2022.<br/>Within these communities, the damage is also concentrated in the provinces of Le\u00f3n and Ourense, which registered the highest percentages of affected area: 15% and 7% respectively. In Zamora, punished by fires such as those of U\u00f1a de Quintana or Gallegos del R\u00edo, the flames have reached 3% of the territory; in C\u00e1ceres, 2%.<br/>The smoke from the fires, which these days has been visible even in satellite images such as the one that heads this piece, has a direct impact on air quality. The records of the European Environment Agency (EEA) reflect the contribution of the fires in recent weeks to the worsening conditions in the environment of the most affected communities, in the northwest of the peninsula. The graph shows the evolution of air quality between August 8 and 21, based on EEA's Environmental Quality Index data.<br/>The darker shades indicate higher concentrations of some of the polluting particles that make up the index: ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and particles of less than 10 and 2.5 microns. The latter are the ones that usually condition the worsening of the environmental quality associated with fires. For example, in the vicinity of A Veiga, values of more than 100 microns per cubic meter of particles of less than 2.5 microns were reached in the early hours of last Thursday (from 51 is considered poor quality). These fine particles can cause respiratory problems and eye irritation, among others.<br/>The coincidence between the worsening of the air in the northwest and the general increase of these values in the rest of the territory also responds to habitual episodes of contamination, especially by ozone and, on some days, by Saharan dust, which intensify with the extreme heat of the summer.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The peninsula leads the escalation</emphasis><br/>The fires of the last few weeks have dynamited a season that until the beginning of August was advancing close to the historical average. With more than 400,000 hectares burned - 0.8% of the country's surface area above the annual average of 0.1% - Spain is already the European Union territory most affected by fires in 2025: it will account for 40% of the area burned in the EU-27.<br/>Portugal has suffered a similar fate: in just two weeks the fire has devoured more than 240,000 hectares (of 276,000 hectares accumulated this year). The Trancoso fire, declared on August 8, alone devastated more than 64,000 and has become the second worst of the decade, according to EFFIS.<br/>The momentum of Spain and Portugal, which account for 66% of what has burned so far, has also made 2025 the worst year on record for the EU as a whole. Fire has already consumed more than one million hectares, some 100,000 more than in the previous peak recorded in 2017. On the continent, only Ukraine, devastated by the war against Russia, exceeds the Spanish figure.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methodology</emphasis><br/>The analysis of hectares burned follows the EFFIS criterion, which excludes fires smaller than 30 hectares and takes their start date as a reference. Although EFFIS groups its records by provinces, in this report the affected area is calculated from the intersection between the perimeter of each fire and the area of the territorial divisions.<br/>The names of some fires in the EFFIS database have been adapted to match those mentioned in EL PA\u00cdS forest fire coverage.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-72319760</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GKF-M0M3-RRRY-W3JY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"784\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 23, 2025 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Espa\u00f1a</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Incendios</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Incendios forestales</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Bomberos</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Bosques</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Medio ambiente</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Calidad aire</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Castilla y Le\u00f3n</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Galicia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Ourense</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Zamora</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp;

Simpson said on Monday that the territory had contacted the\u00a0Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC) to request additional resources.\u00a0</p><p>As of Tuesday, the territory had 105 active wildfires burning and the communities of\u00a0What\u00ec and Fort Providence were under evacuation orders. Jean Marie River was under an evacuation alert, meaning residents were being advised to be ready to leave on short notice.</p><p>Awa Ciss\u00e9, a spokesperson for the CIFFC, said on Tuesday that the N.W.T. had already received some trailers from Alberta to help with firefighting efforts, along with seven\u00a0firefighters and one other personnel position.\u00a0The territory has\u00a0also requested some specialists, including a sprinkler unit protection\u00a0specialist and an ignition specialist.\u00a0</p><p>\"We can't really fill out ... every ask, every request that we have. We try and do\u00a0our best and but we're kind of stretched right now,\" Ciss\u00e9\u00a0said.</p><p>Meantime, according to CIFFC, four air tankers from the N.W.T. along with a smaller aircraft were being deployed elsewhere in the country as of Tuesday.</p><p>In a statement to CBC News, N.W.T fire information officer Mike Westwick said one aircraft group from the territory had been sent to Nova Scotia. That province\u00a0currently has\u00a0the CIFFC's highest fire danger rating.</p><p>Westwick also said that it has \"largely been impossible\" over most of the last week to use air tankers on the priority fires in the N.W.T. because of smoke conditions and poor visibility. Crews have been relying more on helicopters, he said.</p><p>\"[Air tankers] require more visibility than helicopters for obvious reasons given their size and the fact they are flying extremely low to the ground to drop water or fire retardant,\" Westwick wrote.</p><p>\"We understand that people want to see the big machines out there. But we have a duty to ensure people come home safe at the end of the day. We will not put pilots or ground crews at risk by having them fly unsafe missions,\" he wrote.</p><p>Each fire in the N.W.T., he wrote, \"has been able to get the air tankers they request,\" and there were air tankers groups standing by in Yellowknife and Hay River for wherever they're needed.</p><p>Westwick also confirmed that there were no N.W.T. firefighters dispatched outside of the territory.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewscanadanorthnwtrequestshelpfromelsewheretobattlewildfires17623445</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GN4-V473-S2B8-61XD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"402\"/><timeReceived>11:18 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 CBC/Radio-Canada.

Cient\u00edficas (CSIC) has started to work on the recovery of the natural area of Las M\u00e9dulas, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, with the first actions aimed at assessing the damage caused and analyzing the possible risks arising from the fire suffered this August.</p><p><br/>The CSIC, a body attached to the Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, has activated the Disaster and Emergency Advisory Group (GADE) to provide scientific and technical support to the areas affected by the forest fires, starting with Las M\u00e9dulas, according to a press release.<br/>The action of the GADE that is already being developed, in response to the request of the Las M\u00e9dulas Foundation, will orient its first works to assess the damage produced in this natural space and will also provide support in the analysis of the possible risks derived from the fire.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related to this topic</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Frustration in Las M\u00e9dulas: \"If it's not for the neighbors, everything will burn\".</emphasis><br/>Ferm\u00edn Grodira<br/><br/>The scientific-technical groups that make up the GADE advising on Las M\u00e9dulas, under the coordination of In\u00e9s Galindo and the leadership of Javier Madrigal, are related to the assessment of fire severity, terrain instability, effects on geological heritage, biodiversity and social risks.<br/>The forest fire declared in Yeres (Le\u00f3n), last August 9, affected the natural site of Las M\u00e9dulas and caused significant damage to the vegetation although, in principle, without significant effects on the Roman gold mines, although the reports of the CSIC and the Junta de Castilla y Le\u00f3n itself will determine the extent of the damage.<br/>During this emergency period, Javier Madrigal, coordinator of rorestal risks at CSIC, and Mercedes Guijarro, from the Institute of Forestry Sciences (ICIFOR-INIA), as well as Esther Honta\u00f1\u00f3n, from the Institute of Physical and Information Technologies, have offered their advice to the Foundation.<br/>This is the fourth time that the CSIC has activated the Disaster and Emergency Advisory Group since the Disaster and Emergency Advisory Protocol was approved in April 2024, a tool that systematizes and streamlines the intervention and support offered by the CSIC as an expert scientific-technical advisor to emergency managers.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

This rule was pending since the wave of fires of 2022, which until this August had been the worst year of the century in terms of fires. But the Ministry for Ecological Transition argues that, as it is a competence shared with the autonomous communities, the process of allegations has been very complex and it has not been possible to approve it until three years later.</p><p><br/>The Minister of Education and spokesperson for the Government, Pilar Alegr\u00eda, who confirmed the approval of this regulation, stressed that, in any case, \"the preparation of the annual plans is the exclusive competence of the autonomous communities\".<br/>2022 was also a terrible year for fires, with the two fires in the Sierra de la Culebra as the most shocking of the summer. At the end of July of that year, the Council of Ministers approved a royal decree law adopting \"urgent measures on forest fires\". And the Forestry Law was modified to establish that \"the autonomous communities, faced with the general risk of forest fires, will draw up and approve annual plans for the prevention, surveillance and extinction of forest fires\". In addition, these documents \"will include all the actions to be carried out and will cover the entire territory of the corresponding autonomous community\".<br/>The same regulation indicated that the Ministry for Ecological Transition should elaborate, \"with the participation of the autonomous communities and after a report from the Committee for the Fight against Forest Fires, the guidelines and common criteria necessary for the elaboration of the referred plans, which will be approved by royal decree\". After several meetings of that committee to draft the regulation, the ministry released a draft for public information at the end of 2023 so that interested parties could present allegations.<br/>Ecological Transition assured last week that it was a regulation that it had wanted to be processed \"with the greatest agility, but as it is a question of autonomous competences, it has been necessary to generate a consensus with them and that has taken time\". According to these same sources, in the process of allegations, some communities expressed \"attitudes compatible with the perception that it was an exercise of control by the ministry\". \"Some considered that we could not regulate aspects of their own competences, in other cases it was argued that it was difficult to make annual plans, instead of every five years, or the difficulty they had for the elaboration of statistics or that the follow-up could lead to the assumption of responsibilities\", explained Sara Aagesen's department. Finally, the Council of State issued the opinion on the royal decree that was approved this Tuesday at the end of July, just a few days before the brutal wave of fires broke out in Spain.<br/>Once EL PA\u00cdS published last week that, on the one hand, the public prosecutor's office was inquiring about whether the municipalities affected by the worst fires had prevention plans and that, on the other hand, the Government had not yet approved the royal decree with the guidelines pending since 2022, Ecological Transition assured that this norm was not an \"essential condition\" for the autonomous regions to be able to draw up their annual programs. In addition, the ministry assured that the autonomies were already obliged before 2022 to develop \"forest fire prevention plans\".<br/>However, the royal decree law of three years ago explained that \"the experience of recent years has shown that the risk of forest fires extends throughout the territory and in an unseasonal manner\". For this reason, the text continued, \"it is necessary to have a new instrument, of greater scope than the defense plans, so far provided only for high-risk areas\". And it clarified that \"the new plans for the prevention, surveillance and extinction of forest fires must include all the actions to be developed and will cover the entire territory of each autonomous community, must be updated sufficiently in advance and will be applied continuously throughout the year\". The autonomous communities were urged to approve them annually, as some of them have done since then.<br/>Beyond controversies and interpretations of the rules, M\u00f3nica Parrilla, of Greenpeace, celebrated Tuesday the approval of the royal decree with the guidelines. \"It is really complicated to evaluate the compliance of the Administrations with the obligations related to the annual plans as well as to report the compliance due to the variety of names, figures, levels of preventive planning, emergencies and criteria to apply it, as it has been exposed in different published reports\", said Parrilla about the importance of this royal decree.<br/>Among other things, the plans must serve so that, with the information provided by the communities and the rest of the available data, \"the Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge will elaborate a forest fire zoning tool that consolidates the existing information and facilitates, with this, the decision making in terms of prevention and fire fighting\", as approved by the Government in 2022. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-72412886</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GKM-BPK3-RS5Y-N0GY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"881\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 26, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Medio ambiente</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Sociedad</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Cambio clim\u00e1tico</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Emergencia clim\u00e1tica</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Incendios</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Incendios forestales</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Incendios forestales</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Ministerio de Transici\u00f3n Ecol\u00f3gica</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Sara Aagesen</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Comunidades aut\u00f3nomas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Consejo de Ministros</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N921000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BODIES &amp;

According to news originating from Canberra, Australia, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Accurate prediction of head-fire rate of spread is essential to fire management decisions during wildfires, however, evaluation of existing models is limited. Acquisition of reliable rate of spread observations for model evaluation is a key challenge, since wildfires are typically rare and difficult to monitor.\" </p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Australian National University, \"We applied recent advances in satellite active fire remote sensing to generate a novel set of inferred rate of spread observations. Using these observations, we evaluated four commonly used Australian forest fire behaviour models. The Project Vesta Mk1 and Mk2 models provided the best agreement with satellite observations, although these models overpredicted at lower rates of spread. Model prediction error was mostly attributed to windspeed, suggesting that wind characteristics at the fire grounds were not fully characterised under some circumstances using station or gridded observations.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"We suggest that ongoing advancements in satellite active fire detection provide opportunities to evaluate and develop fire behaviour models.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Evaluating Australian Forest Fire Rate of Spread Models Using Viirs Satellite Observations.

But not everyone goes to college, and many students never make it to graduation. Among Americans ages 25 and over, only 38% are college graduates, according to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://educationdata.org/education-attainment-statistics#:~:text=91.4%25%20of%20Americans%20aged%2025American%20men%20have%20college%20degrees.\">Education Data Initiative</url>.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.resume-now.com/job-resources/careers/top-fast-growing-high-school-careers\">report</url> released in May by the resume-writing service Resume Now identifies 13 careers that offer good pay and long-term stability and that don\u2019t require a college degree. Better still, none of the jobs are likely to be replaced by AI.  </p><p>The analysis \"focused on three or four fears that people have right now,\" said <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.resume-now.com/authors/keith-spencer\">Keith Spencer</url>, a career expert at Resume Now. Americans worry about signs of a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/02/01/job-market-hiring-trends/77909818007/\">softening job market</url>. They\u2019re concerned about the cost of college, and whether a degree is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/05/09/best-paying-college-majors-highest-return-investment/83534666007/\">still worth it</url>. And employees in many fields fear that AI \u2013 or robots, or other nonhuman hands \u2013 might sweep in to replace them. </p><p>Their fears are not unfounded. One <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/09/04/ai-less-hiring-few-layoffs/85966555007/\">recent survey</url> shows that some service companies in the New York-Northern New Jersey area have scaled back hiring or plan to do so in the next six months because of AI.</p><p>Despite the slow creep of automation, many fields still require the human touch. To build out this list, Resume Now found careers that require only a high school diploma, that pay at least $50,000 a year, and that represent growing fields with high-demand skills. The report draws on Bureau of Labor Statistics data. </p><p>\"They sort of all have some similarities, in terms of the need for significant human interaction,\" Spencer said. \"Maybe they require manual dexterity in unpredictable environments, or high levels of creativity.\"</p><p>The list comes in two parts: jobs with relatively low AI risk, and positions with \"moderate\" AI risk, based on the need for human decision-making, manual labor, personal interactions and other factors. </p><p>Some of the jobs listed below require \"a level of relevant experience,\" Resume Now reports. But none, apparently, requires a college degree. </p><p>Here\u2019s the list, including job descriptions for less familiar positions and median salaries for all.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">What the future of work means for you: <url normalizedValue=\"https://profile.usatoday.com/newsletters/the-daily-money/?ipid=signuptop10\">Sign up</url> for USA TODAY's Daily Money newsletter.</emphasis></emphasis></p><h>Jobs with low AI risk </h><p>According to Resume Now, these careers offer a good income and strong job security because they require skills that go well beyond the capabilities of AI. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forest fire inspectors and prevention specialists</emphasis></p><p>Job description: Judge fire hazards, investigate wildfire causes and enact prevention strategies. </p><p>Why they're AI-resistant: Fire prevention requires humans in the field and cannot be entirely automated. </p><p>Median pay: $71,420 a year </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/16/USAT/83670675007-usatsi-25627801-168410240-lowres.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Flight attendants</emphasis></p><p>Why they're AI-resistant: AI can\u2019t serve meals.

According to news reporting out of Wenzhou, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Accurate and timely forest fire detection is critical for early warnings and effective wildfire containment, safeguarding both ecological systems and human lives.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Open Fund of Wenzhou Future City Research Institute; Key Special Foundation of Universities in Guangdong Province, China; Zhuhai Basic And Applied Basic Research Project. <br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Zhejiang College of Security Technology: \"However, in the early stages of a fire, the flames are typically small, and the smoke often bears a close resemblance to mist or fog, which makes prompt and accurate detection difficult and frequently causing the loss of the optimal response window. To tackle this challenge, we present an enhanced single-stage object detector, that excels at identifying fires, especially in their nascent stages. First, we incorporate a contrast enhancement technique that leverages an atmospheric scattering model and entropy optimization to clarify the blurred smoke edges. Next, we integrate deformable convolutions into the original feature extraction module, enabling more effective capture of long-range dependencies and spatial relationships, thus improving multi-scale fire detection accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a novel Hybrid Spatial Pyramid Pooling (HSPP) structure, which uses parallel average and max pooling operations to enrich feature extraction, facilitating better recognition of small-scale early fires. Finally, we propose a Dynamic Channel Attention (DCA) module to adaptively optimize cross-channel interactions across multiple feature extraction layers, bolstering cross-scale feature representations.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Extensive experimental results show that on the M4SFWD and FLAME public datasets, our method achieves a 1% improvement in both precision and recall compared to the SOTA methods, while reducing the number of parameters by about 40%, making it more suitable for practical application.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Forest Fire Detection Based on Enhanced Feature Information Capture and Long-Range Dependency.

We participate in training exercises with local fire departments and emergency management teams if and when requested.<br/><br/>What this means for you: If a wildfire does happen, the right people are ready to take action - fast.<br/><br/>We're practicing like its game day.<br/><br/>\"Wildfire preparedness isn't seasonal anymore,\" said Jorge Moya, PSEG senior director of Emergency Preparedness. \"It's something we prepare for all year.\"<br/><br/>That means more drills, continuously improving plans and smoother coordination with first responders - all to protect your community.<br/><br/>Your safety is our priority - every season.<br/><br/>Whether it's the middle of summer or a fall day, we're always working to stay ahead of wildfires because safety is our number one priority - for us, and for the people we serve.<br/><br/>Stay connected and informed at pseg.com/WildfireSafety.<br/><br/>Emergency Preparedness Tools Available<br/><br/>The PSEG Foundation and Sesame Workshop have partnered to create bilingual (English and Spanish), multiple media programs that help families prepare for, and respond to, emergencies and provide tools so that children can build the skills they need to become resilient.       </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENPNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ENPNWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GK7-CJX3-RT4M-61NP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">344171</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"325\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Normans Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ENP Newswire</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61140\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 25, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Eumetsat satellite images show a growing smoke that covered nearby regions for days and spread beyond the peninsula, reaching as far as western France and southern England.</p><p><br/>The following images show four snapshots of the spreading smoke plumes, which began to gain in size during the afternoon of August 13.<br/>The more intense the fires and the heat they give off, the more powerful the convection currents that lift their emissions. Smoke escalation may have played a key role in the spread of smoke southward across the continent: at these heights, atmospheric currents can push pollutants thousands of kilometers. This was the case with the fires that swept across Canada between April and June, whose smoke crossed the Atlantic and reached Greece, as recorded by the Copernicus atmospheric monitoring service.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Record emissions</emphasis><br/>On the most critical days, emissions associated with the fires soared to unprecedented levels: both carbon dioxide and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) reached their highest levels in at least 23 years. These figures far surpass previous records, recorded during the intense fire season of 2022, which peaked in late July; and in mid-August 2006, coinciding with a strong wave of fires in Galicia.<br/>In the week of August 19, active fires in Spain released 13 million metric tons of CO? according to the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS). By comparison, commercial aviation in Spain emitted 7.7 million metric tons in all of 2023, according to the European Environment Agency's latest Climate Action Progress Report.<br/>The magnitude of emissions was not only enough to set a record week. With four months still to go, 2025 is already the year with the highest volume of carbon dioxide and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) attributable to fires since at least 2003.<br/>In contrast to what is happening in Spain, on a global scale, emissions and the area burned by fires have decreased. This may seem contradictory in a scenario of climate change and rising temperatures, but it is explained by the change in land use: agricultural expansion reduces the areas exposed to fire.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-72485001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GM2-9743-RT9P-41PY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"371\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 28, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Espa\u00f1a</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Incendios</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Incendios forestales</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Humo</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Bosques</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Medio ambiente</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Castilla y Le\u00f3n</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Galicia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Ourense</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Zamora</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DQ7E</classCode><className>EARTH OBSERVATION SATELLITES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001232</classCode><className>PARTICULATE MATTER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N924120QC</classCode><className>OCEANOGRAPHIC &amp;

The all-time national record was set in 2022 with 131 confirmed tornadoes.</p><p>Last year also experienced the longest tornado season on record, lasting 240 days, with the first tornado reported in Malden Centre, Ont. on March 16 and the last one in Fergus, Ont. on Nov. 10.</p><p>The first tornado of 2025 reportedly occurred on April 12 in Rolling Hills, Alta.</p><p>Historical tornado data in Canada</p><p>Over the last few years, NTP confirmed the following number of tornadoes across Canada:</p><p>2024 - 1292023 - 902022 - 1312021 - 1272020 - 1102019 - 802018 - 1042017 - 71</p><p>Based on a 30-year period between 1991 and 2020, the average number of tornadoes per year is 64.9 in Canada and 18.5 in Ontario, Sillis said.</p><p>The NTP team is investigating why some years are less active, in terms of tornadoes, than others, with Sillis saying there are many factors involved.</p><p>Possible reasons for fewer tornadoes this season</p><p>Environment Canada couldn't provide a definitive answer as to why we're experiencing fewer tornadoes this year, but offered a hypothesis.</p><p>Meteorologist Steven Flisfeder said there are two possible causes why Ontario, and particularly southern Ontario, are experiencing fewer tornadoes this year.</p><p>One is that this summer has been dominated by high-pressure systems, which are typically associated with clear skies.</p><p>\"That would have the tendency to inhibit any kind of storms, any kind of convection, which would lead to lightning, which would lead to potential thunderstorms, which would lead to potential tornadoes,\" Flisfeder said.</p><p>\"That high pressure, which was very strong, very persistent throughout the summer, is a possible reason why there were fewer tornadoes than we normally see in a typical year.\"</p><p>The second possibility is related to all the forest fire smoke we've experienced this year, particularly in June and July.</p><p>\"There was a lot of smoke in the atmosphere, which has a tendency to reduce solar heating, which would help reduce the potential for thunderstorm initiation as well,\" Flisfeder said.</p><p>This is just a hypothesis, he added, noting a definitive answer would require further research.</p><p>Is tornado season over yet? Expert outlook</p><p>Sillis expects the number of confirmed tornadoes to climb before the year is out.</p><p>The NTP team is still reviewing satellite images from Canada's vast boreal forest, which could turn up more tornadoes from this summer that had not been reported yet due to the area's low population density.</p><p>\"So, the numbers from this summer will likely go up,\" he said, and tornado season is likely not over yet.</p><p>\"I suspect we haven't seen the end of the tornado season in Ontario, or Canada, quite yet. In fact, we've got quite a warm-up in the long-range forecast for southern Ontario, and that typically means higher potential for severe storms,\" he added.</p><p>More information on tornadoes in Canada is available on the NTP website. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KWREC-2025091676649114</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KWREC2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GRX-BGT3-RT4B-G2P9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247362</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"570\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

Ned Lamont, D-Connecticut, issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Governor Lamont Launches Fire Safe CT: A Statewide Initiative To Prevent Fires and Empower Communities</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">*</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(HARTFORD, CT) - Governor Ned Lamont today announced the launch of Fire Safe CT, a collaborative Connecticut state initiative aimed at reducing the risk of fire-related tragedies through public education and local support. This effort unites state and local agencies, health care experts, and fire service professionals under a common goal: to protect Connecticut residents and their communities from the dangers of fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Keeping Connecticut families safe is our highest priority,\" Governor Lamont said. \"Fire Safe CT brings together the best of what our state has to offer - public safety, health care, and environmental expertise - to help residents stay safe and informed. It's a model of collaboration, and I'm proud to support it.\"</p><p>The initiative is led by a coalition of partners, including the Connecticut Office of the State Fire Marshal, which is within the Connecticut Department of Administrative Services (DAS); the Connecticut State Police Fire and Explosion Investigation Unit and the Connecticut Fire Academy, which are both within the Connecticut Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection (DESPP); and the Connecticut Burn Center at Bridgeport Hospital. It is also being supported by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP), particularly in addressing outdoor fire risks.</p><p>Fire Safe CT focuses on two key objectives:</p><p>1. Public Education - Delivering clear, actionable fire prevention tips to Connecticut residents through engaging multimedia campaigns, with particular emphasis on home safety, outdoor fire management, and burn injury prevention.</p><p>2. Community Empowerment - Equipping local fire departments and municipal fire marshals with enhanced resources, educational materials, and support to bolster their community risk reduction efforts.</p><p>\"DAS and the Office of the State Fire Marshal are proud to be part of this effort to deliver consistent, effective fire prevention messaging and tools across Connecticut,\" DAS Commissioner Michelle Gilman said. \"Fire Safe CT will help local leaders and first responders better engage their communities and save lives.\"</p><p>DESPP Commissioner Ronnell A. Higgins underscored the initiative's comprehensive approach. \"From investigation to education to training, this initiative links every part of the fire safety ecosystem. Our agencies are united in the mission to prevent fires before they start and support recovery when they do,\" Commissioner Higgins said.</p><p>Connecticut State Fire Marshal Lauri Volkert highlighted the proactive nature of the program. \"This is more than a campaign - it's a commitment to prevention,\" Volkert said. \"Fire Safe CT empowers every resident and firefighter to take steps today that could save lives tomorrow.\"</p><p>\"The Connecticut Fire Academy is proud to continue its mission to be an integral part of fire prevention efforts throughout our state,\" Alan Zygmunt, program manager at the Connecticut Fire Academy, said. \"Fire Safe CT will expand that reach by providing resources and materials to departments to enhance their community programs.\"</p><p>\"The Connecticut Burn Center, as the only dedicated burn center in the state, is committed not only to healing burn injuries but to preventing them,\" Dr. Alisa Savetamal, medical director of the Connecticut Burn Center at Bridgeport Hospital, said. \"Through Fire Safe CT, we are partnering with emergency services, safety professionals, educators, families, and individuals to ensure that everyone has access to the most up-to-date prevention information.\"</p><p>\"We are proud to be part of the statewide collaborative emphasizing public safety, particularly with regard to outdoor burning, whether it be for debris management or simply enjoying a campfire with family and friends,\" DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said. \"Nearly all of Connecticut wildfires are human caused and therefore are mostly preventable. As we approach the first anniversary of one of our state's most destructive fall wildfire seasons in decades, DEEP encourages all residents and visitors to learn best practices for outdoor burning. These practices include being aware of the daily forest fire danger before igniting permitted debris fires authorized by municipal open burn officials, and ensuring that campfires are cool to the touch before leaving them unattended. Please visit DEEP's website ( Forest Fire Prevention Tips ) for more information about best practices to protect yourself, your home and property, and our first responders.\"</p><p>The initiative's website, ct.gov/firesafe, offers downloadable resources for individuals and communities, including social media toolkits, template letters for local campaigns, community outreach materials, and fire risk checklists for homes and businesses.</p><p>Connecticut residents are encouraged to follow Fire Safe CT on social media:</p><p>* Instagram: @fire_safe_ct</p><p>* Facebook: Fire Safe CT</p><p>* YouTube: @FireSafeCT</p><p>***</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://portal.ct.gov/governor/news/press-releases/2025/08-2025/governor-lamont-launches-fire-safe-ct\">https://portal.ct.gov/governor/news/press-releases/2025/08-2025/governor-lamont-launches-fire-safe-ct</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-9365273 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR9365273</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GJD-G8T3-RRWN-K4DX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"872\"/><timeReceived>4:47 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 21, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
