A new study finds broader surveillance and modeling of these changes could inform strategies for protecting lives, property, and natural resources, and managing wildlife.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This was first published on the Stanford University website and is reprinted with permission.</p><p>The huge, long-lasting wildfires that have become increasingly common in recent years can cause changes in soil chemistry that affect water contamination, air quality and plant growth. But these changes are poorly monitored and rarely factor into post-fire recovery efforts or risk assessments, according to a review study published in Nature Reviews Earth and Environment.</p><p>The study, led by Stanford University and Colorado State University scientists, found that better techniques are needed to monitor changes in soil and surrounding ecosystems. This enhanced monitoring could inform decisions on how to treat drinking water sourced from burned areas, support reforestation and protect workers against toxins during cleanup, rebuilding or revegetation.</p><p>\"In our study, we mesh organic and inorganic chemistry together, whereas a lot of fire research will typically just consider one subject area,\" said soil biogeochemist Claudia Avila, who co-led the study with Alandra Lopez, PhD '22, while both researchers were postdoctoral scholars in the lab of Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability Professor Scott Fendorf.</p><p>\"A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms in soil can help explain, for instance, why drinking water from a forest fire-impacted watershed is suddenly more toxic, or why a forest is not coming back,\" said Colorado State University soil chemist Thomas Borch, a senior author of the study.</p><p>Climate and Ecosystem Impacts</p><p>The review highlights evidence from recent studies suggesting wildfires may release more planet-warming carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than anticipated. Charcoal-like remnants of burned wood and other organic materials, known as black carbon, may not trap carbon dioxide for long periods, as scientists had hoped. \"Carbon that's gone through forest fires and becomes black carbon can actually turn more readily into carbon dioxide by microbes than previously thought,\" said Fendorf, the Terry Huffington Professor at Stanford.</p><p>\"From a climate perspective, we still have a poor understanding of how much of the carbon that is left after a fire has the potential to be transformed into greenhouse gasses, such as carbon dioxide,\" said Borch, who worked in Fendorf's lab as a postdoctoral fellow 20 years ago.</p><p>Wildfires can have many benefits for ecosystems, the authors note. Some fires can increase the nitrogen in soils and augment the water solubility of soil organic carbon, for example, setting the stage for regrowth. However, recovery depends on the presence of other chemicals. For instance, certain types of organic molecules formed in soil during fires are needed for many seeds to germinate. If the local soil chemistry and fire conditions do not produce enough of these molecules, called karrikins, revegetation may be stunted.</p><p>Other research included in the new review has shown that wildfires can double the soil concentration of a group of toxic chemicals known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which can induce chemical reactions that inhibit revegetation. These molecular-scale effects could well explain the mystery of vast areas where trees have struggled to reestablish after wildfires in the Rocky Mountains, Borch said.</p><p>Wildfires can also alter the chemical properties of inorganic materials such as metals within soils. Fire can change the metals into dangerous forms that readily move through the environment, ending up in the air or nearby water, the authors explained, citing Fendorf and Lopez's own recent research. The scientists documented high levels of a hazardous form of the metal chromium at wildfire sites resulting from heat-induced transformation of naturally occurring, benign forms of chromium. At sites where extremely hot, long-lasting fires cooked soils to high temperatures for extended periods, chromium persisted for many months until the next large rain event.</p><p>Other research on chromium indicates that after lower-intensity fires, remnant plant and animal tissue in soil can allow the toxic form of chromium to return to its inert form. Taken together, these studies illustrate the broader reality that wildfire impacts on soil chemistry depend on the intricate nature of the fire and landscape, including fire duration and temperature.</p><p>Predicting and Mitigating Wildfire Risks</p><p>Broader surveillance and modeling could inform strategies for protecting lives, property, and natural resources, as well as wildlife management decisions. Avila offers an example of how this approach to informed stewardship could help prevent the leaching of metals into drinking water supplies. \"By identifying an area that has a high potential for, say, chromium release, we can call for prescribed burns that are lower intensity and reduce the potential for high-intensity, toxin-releasing fires,\" said Avila, who is now an assistant professor of environmental and ocean sciences at the University of San Diego.</p><p>\"If we can grasp the complexity of the intertwined processes that are happening both on the organic and the inorganic side, then that helps give us the ability to predict outcomes for different fire, landscape, and geological conditions,\" said Fendorf.</p><p>This research was supported in part by an Agricultural Microbiomes in Plant Systems and Natural Resources Crosscutting Program grant from USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126571772</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C53-1811-JCBF-S1NT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"972\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"05\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>May 30, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news originating from Karadeniz Technical University by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"In recent years, the occurrence of forest fires has become almost inevitable worldwide due to the severe impact of climate change.\" </p><p><br/> The news editors obtained a quote from the research from Karadeniz Technical University: \"Consequently, it is imperative to examine the consequences of these fires, pinpoint the affected areas, and take required measures following post-fire incidents. With the advent of modern remote sensing satellites, which allow for the rapid monitoring of vast expanses, they offer a valuable data source for addressing such emergency scenarios. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to evaluate the extent of air pollutant gas emissions resulting from the forest fires that occurred in Marmaris and Manavgat, Turkiye, in the summer of 2021. To this aim, using the data obtained from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) sensor onboard the Sentinel-5P satellite, the amount of major air pollutants nitrogen dioxide (NO [ [2] ] ), carbon monoxide (CO) and aerosol were investigated after the forest fires considering three different non-fire time periods. The findings of the experiments indicated that in Manavgat, there was a substantial rise in NO [ [2] ] and average CO levels by 260.43% and 107.07%, respectively, when compared to the 10-day period preceding the forest fire event. Similarly, in Marmaris, there was an increase of 203.63% in NO [ [2] ] levels and a 102.47% rise in average CO levels during the same period.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Positive absorbing aerosol index (AAI) values were also observed during the events, which means that the amount of UV-absorbing aerosols increased due to the fire. The differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) maps derived from the Sentinel-2 MSI imagery were also used to investigate the severity of the forest fires, and to observe the relationship between the fire severity level and the air pollutants investigated.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Assessing Air Pollutant Emissions in The Aftermath of The 2021 Forest Fires in Marmaris And Manavgat, Turki ye: Insights From Satellite-based Monitoring.

A man was killed during one of the fires.Greek firefighters battled wildfires that broke out amid scorching temperatures, with two villages north of the capital Athens evacuated, reviving fears after the country suffered major wildfires last month during its longest heat wave ever. </p><p><br/>A forest fire broke out on Monday in the central Viotia region, some 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Athens. <br/>What happened in Greece? <br/>People in two communities near the fire site were told to evacuate. Around 56 firefighters faced the blaze, the French AFP news agency reported, assisted by four water-dropping aircraft. <br/>Fire protection authorities warned of an \"extreme\" fire risk around Athens and in other parts of southern Greece. <br/>\"The [firefighting] system is on alert, and we must be, too. The risk of wildfires remains high,\" government spokesman Pavlos Marinakis said. <br/>In the northeast region near the Turkish borders, a major wildfire continued to burn for a third day near the town of Alexandroupolis. Strong winds worsened the situation, constantly rekindling the flames. <br/>Some 13 villages were evacuated in the region over the weekend, with several homes destroyed. Over 200 firefighters faced the flames, aided by 16-water-dropping planes and seven helicopters, Marinakis said. <br/>Fires rage across the Canary Islands <br/>Meanwhile in Spain's Canary Islands, a wildfire, believed to have been started deliberately, continued to burn since last Tuesday. Over 12,000 people have been evacuated from their homes, with some 13,000 hectares (32,000 acres) of pine forest and scrubland burned. <br/>\"The worst is over,\" Canary Island regional President Fernando Clavijo told Spain's Cadena SER radio, adding that some of those earlier evacuated were allowed to return home. <br/>The hundreds of firefighters deployed had made some progress for the second night in a row, Clavijo also said. The area's challenging terrain of steep ravines and cliffs has complicated efforts to put down the fire. <br/>A recent heat wave has also contributed to the difficulty, as it left the pine forest bone dry. <br/>Greece suffers destructive wildfires every summer, but officials say they have been exacerbated by climate change, with many other countries in the region also suffering from more fires blamed on warming temperatures. <br/>rmt/jcg (AFP, AP, Reuters) <br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dw.com/en/villages-evacuated-in-greece-as-wildfires-rage/a-66591230?maca=en-cb_en_newstexvolltext_europe-6124-xml-mrss\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DEWL109989169264202204325876100147</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7827</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:690H-GGP1-JCMN-Y50D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567698</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"431\"/><timeReceived>6:20 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

And understandably, many people reacted with some alarm. We city dwellers typically only see wildfires on television, usually alongside footage of fire crews and water bombers valiantly trying to put them out, which creates the impression they are somehow unnatural events that must be avoided at all costs. Of course, in reality, forest fires are not only natural but are essential to the life cycle of the forest ecosystem.</p><p>Unfortunately, politicians, reporters and climate activists rushed in to exploit this unusual event to push their agenda. They made a lot of glib claims about climate change causing wildfires to become more common. For instance, Prime Minister Trudeau\u00a0 <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau/status/1666586130571993088?s=20\">tweeted</url> \u00a0'We're seeing more and more of these fires because of climate change.'</p><p>That statement is false. Amid the smokescreen of untrue claims, nobody seems to have bothered looking up the numbers. Canadian forest fire data are available from the\u00a0 <url normalizedValue=\"https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/datamart/download/nfdbpnt\">Wildland Fire Information System</url> . Wildfires have been getting less frequent in Canada over the past 30 years (see chart below). The annual number of fires grew from 1959 to 1990, peaking in 1989 at just over 12,000 that year, and has been trending down since. From 2017 to 2021 (the most recent interval available), there were about 5,500 fires per year, half the average from 1987 to 1991. <url normalizedValue=\"https://canadafreepress.com/article/forest-firestruth-going-up-in-flames\">read more</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://iotwreport.com/forest-fires-truth-going-up-in-flames/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=forest-fires-truth-going-up-in-flames\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXIO-IOTW126632168720661243425876100227</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IOTW-126632</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68H3-MS41-JCMN-Y2MX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484256</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"287\"/><timeReceived>8:30 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

According to news reporting originating from Beijing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"The wide application and rapid development of satellite remote sensing technology have put higher requirements on remote sensing image segmentation methods.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China. <br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Beijing Forestry University: \"Because of its characteristics of large image size, large data volume, and complex segmentation background, not only are the traditional image segmentation methods difficult to apply effectively, but the image segmentation methods based on deep learning are faced with the problem of extremely unbalanced data between categories. In order to solve this problem, first of all, according to the existing effective sample theory, the effective sample calculation method in the context of semantic segmentation is firstly proposed in the highly unbalanced dataset. Then, a dynamic weighting method based on the effective sample concept is proposed, which can be applied to the semantic segmentation of remote sensing images.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Finally, the applicability of this method to different loss functions and different network structures is verified on the self-built Landsat8-OLI remote sensing image-based tri-classified forest fire burning area dataset and the LoveDA dataset, which is for land-cover semantic segmentation. It has been concluded that this weighting algorithm can enhance the minimal-class segmentation accuracy while ensuring that the overall segmentation performance in multi-class segmentation tasks is verified in two different semantic segmentation tasks, including the land use and land cover (LULC) and the forest fire burning area segmentation In addition, this proposed method significantly improves the recall of forest fire burning area segmentation by as much as about 30%, which is of great reference value for forest fire research based on remote sensing images.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: A Dynamic Effective Class Balanced Approach for Remote Sensing Imagery Semantic Segmentation of Imbalanced Data.

The science is clear, climate change is real, it is getting more severe and if left unchecked, it will destroy not only the U.S. economy but the world's economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Two weeks ago she worried about a possible handful of birds that might die because of windmills while ignoring the hundreds of millions of birds that are lost due to wildfires and habitat loss as a result of climate change. In her column last week, she is concerned about a small amount of noise disturbing a few people. Obviously, she will look for any excuse, however poor, to stop our societal and governmental response to a crisis that will only get much worse by inaction.</p><p>I also have questions about the judgment of the editorial staff for continuing to publish columns that will only serve to encourage low-information climate deniers and thus slow our vital response to an existential threat to all of humanity. Our children deserve better.</p><p>DAVID RANDALL</p><p>SPOKANE</p><p>'DONNA QUIXOTE' MADSEN JOUSTS AT WINDMILLS</p><p>The next local production of \"The Man from La Mancha\" will feature an all-female cast starring The Spokesman-Review's own columnist, Sue Lani Madsen, as Donna Quixote jousting at windmills in rural Eastern Washington.</p><p>I don't know how they get windmill blades for a windmill taller than the Space Needle to a hillside in rural Eastern Washington. The typical wind turbine tower is actually 280 feet with 100-foot blades. Rural roads can't transport a 300-foot blade. Clearly, Madsen is against wind turbines as they make noise. I can hear the jake brakes on large wood chip and logging trucks miles away from my rural property. I also hear railroad train whistles blowing. My house shakes when the local rock quarry blasts the granite from the hillside. I wonder if Madsen opposes those rural activities like she does wind turbines.</p><p>Then we have the issue of property rights and the owners leasing their land for wind turbines. What's wrong with clearing the ridges of trees that are going to burn during the next wild or forest fire? Wind turbines don't burn and spread wildfires.</p><p>Madsen frets over the visual pollution of wind turbines but has no problem with hundreds of high-transmission towers dotting Eastern Washington.</p><p>Lastly, Madsen is concerned about foreign investment and ownership of wind turbines but ignores the takeover of our hydropower by Russian and Chinese crypto mining.</p><p>PETE SCOBBY</p><p>NEWPORT, WASH.</p><p>THANK YOU, JESSE AND NICK</p><p>Spokane County should be proud of the management team at SCRAPS. Jesse and Nick are hard-working, energetic and kind, with skills to handle extremely tough, heartbreaking and thankless jobs. Few people are equipped to handle a job in which the community is angry when you cannot take in strays due to lack of kennel space, while also threatening you when you are forced to euthanize a sick or dangerous dog.</p><p>I volunteer walking dogs at SCRAPS three days a week and have observed these guys firsthand since they came on board. I've seen Jesse fixing clogged sinks, teaching an older couple to walk an older dog up a ramp so they could adopt her, unloading semi-trucks of supplies and much more that is relentlessly necessary with an aging building and hundreds of animals. Last week, we complained the fence needed securing in the big outdoor dog play yard. Jesse was out there at 5:30 the next morning lowering the chain-link fencing and staking it down all around the perimeter. Nick has a gentle way with reactive dogs and has gracefully rescued me from both aggressive dogs and angry people. He pitches in wherever necessary and cleans kennels when SCRAPS is short-staffed. Thanks to Jesse and Nick and the all staff and volunteers at SCRAPS for working so hard to make SCRAPS an agency for which to be proud.</p><p>KERRY MASTERS</p><p>LIBERTY LAKE</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPOKSR-43254540</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPOKSR2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C4M-F3K1-JC0C-J2T2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">157554</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"654\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Spokane Spokesman-Review</copyright><publicationName>Spokesman Review (Spokane, WA)</publicationName><edition>MAIN Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"04\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>April 19, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001022</classCode><className>LETTERS &amp;

According to news reporting from Hefei, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Microwaves have the advantage of penetrating vegetation and exhibit sensitivity to properties such as vegetation water content (VWC); yet, their potential utility in the fire domain is infrequently investigated.\" </p><p><br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from University of Science and Technology of China: \"This study elucidates the different impacts of the microwave VWC index EDVI on fire radiative energy (FRE) across various biome types and the significant predictive power for high-severity fires (defined based on FRE) in mainland Southeast Asia. While EDVI exhibits lower predictive power for high severe fires compared to the commonly used fire weather indices (e.g., FWI), an enhancement is observed when these predictors are used in combination. Either by employing EDVI or fire weather indices, the predictability of fires is found to be highest over forests and lowest over croplands. Factors such as increasing human influence and fuel limitation in croplands are likely reducing the roles of VWC and weather on fires, contributing to the lower prediction skill of EDVI and fire weather. These results indicate the usefulness of microwave VWC index in fire studies.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Although fire weather presents more considerable impacts on fires, the microwave VWC index seem to still provide some complementary information in fire danger assessment.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Satellite microwave measurements complementary to fire weather improve the assessment of fires among different biomes in Southeast Asia.

Thank you for being here, and thank you for watching \"NewsNight.\" Please stay with us. You can also listen to more conversation with me. My podcast is called \"The Assignment,\" and you can get that wherever you get your podcast. \"Laura Coates Live\" starts right now.</p><p>LAURA COATES, CNN HOST AND SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: Tonight, a friend request from Mark Zuckerberg to one Donald Trump. The two meeting in person down in Mar-a-Lago. So, what is this all about? Plus, the other billionaire, Elon Musk, putting federal workers on edge tonight after he publicly named some employees that he wants to fire, apparently. Is this how DOGE is going to work? And later, a trip down memory lane, the days of \"Family Matters.\" Guess who's here? Steve Urkel AKA Stefan Urkel and Jaleel White join me for a special conversation you will not want to miss. Tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\"</p><p>Good evening. We're going to get to all of those stories in just a moment, but we are going to begin tonight with a potential break in one of the greatest mysteries in all of American history. I'm talking about the hunt for the true identity of D.B. Cooper. Now he is the infamous airplane hijacker who jumped out of a plane back in 1971 with $200,000 in cash never to be seen again. His identity is a mystery to this very day. But tonight, my next guest says that he has found that parachute that D.B. Cooper used, and that it could actually end the mystery once and for all.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAN GRYDER, RETIRED PILOT AND YOUTUBER: We just solved it. Literally. Literally.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Literally. This -- this is -- this is the rig because they know what rig he used when he jumped that night.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COATES: Now he says it belonged to a man named Richard McCoy, Jr. Now look at the side-by-side comparison. The parachute was found on the McCoy family property about two years ago. Now he has always been a rumored longtime suspect and was killed in 1974 after pulling off a similar heist but there has never been any proof linking him. Now bits of money have been recovered in the past. There have been literally hundreds of tips and leads over the years that have gone exactly nowhere.</p><p>But according to my next guest, his discovery of the parachute caught the attention of the FBI, who then visited the home and took the parachute into custody. Now we asked the FBI about this, and they wouldn't confirm nor deny. Hmm. They would only point us to a 2016 statement that basically says they've stopped wasting resources on this because they've gotten nowhere.</p><p>But they say something very interesting at the end of that 2016 statement. Quote -- \"Although the FBI will no longer actively investigate this case, should specific physical evidence emerge -- related specifically to the parachutes or the money taken by the hijacker -- individuals with those materials are asked to contact their local FBI field office.\"</p><p>Well, joining me now is the man who helped uncover the parachute, Dan Gryder. He is a retired pilot, a YouTuber, and a D.B. Cooper sleuth. Dan, great to have you here tonight. Tell me about how you found that piece of evidence and why you believe that that belonged to D.B. Cooper, who you believe is actually Richard McCoy, Jr.</p><p>GRYDER: That's correct. Hi, Laura. Thanks for having me on. Yes, we found that parachute. It was the description of the parachute that was used that night was very, very specific and that it was modified. So, all these years, for 20 years, I've been looking for this green military highly-modified parachute, and when we stumbled upon it by accident, I pulled it out and I took one look at it, and I could instantly see the modifications.</p><p>COATES: But what were these modifications? How could you recognize, say, one parachute from another?</p><p>GRYDER: Well, in the parachuting world, it's -- it's very easy to tell. You take one look at where the ripcord housing is and -- and all the modifications that were done to the front side of that. I knew -- I knew what I was looking for when I pulled that out of there and it -- it was -- it matched exactly. On first glance, I already knew this -- this is it. It was found in McCoy's mother's possessions deep in her storage with all of her prized possessions. She was a grandmother not related to aviation or skydiving, and she had the parachute, the canopy, his log book.</p><p>[23:05:03]</p><p>She had all that stuff tucked away in her private possessions that hadn't been seen for 53 years.</p><p>COATES: That's unbelievable to think about. And the modifications, I would assume, would have facilitated the ability to do the very highest that people have been fascinated with. But you also say that the FBI asked for a DNA sample from one of McCoy's children. What are they going to do with that?</p><p>GRYDER: Yes. Well, you know, I've been tracking this thing for almost 20 years. And over that 20 years, the McCoy children have never come out. They've never spoken to me. I tried like crazy to get these kids to talk to me, and they would not talk to me until both their mother and their grandmother died. Their mother, Karen McCoy, was an accomplice in both hijackings.</p><p>And what most people don't know is that there were actually two hijackings. There was a first one, the D.B. Cooper one. And then the same guy, Richard Floyd McCoy, he went back and did the exact same thing five months later, April of '72. It's the same guy.</p><p>But none of the kids would ever talk to me about this until they were both dead, and then they felt relieved that their mother was no longer in danger of going to prison as an accomplice in the D.B. Cooper heist. COATES: That's incredible to think about, that they may have, according to you, believe that their family was somehow connected to any of this. There was not a charge for the mother, I understand. But you say McCoy's family, they also found a log book. What was in that?</p><p>GRYDER: The log book was a parachute jump log book. It showed 39 previous military static line jumps accomplished by McCoy in the military. He served two terms in Vietnam. He was a helicopter pilot, a fixed wing pilot, and a military-trained jumper.</p><p>But the log book showed eight practice jumps leading up to the D.B. Cooper jump, and then nothing. This was his first free fall parachute jump, civilian-style log book. So, he logged 39 previous static line jumps, and then eight practice free fall jumps in -- in anticipation of doing this hijacking, and then nothing until right before April '72. He went back and did one more practice jump prior to his April '72 parachute jump, and he logged that one.</p><p>All those jumps are in there. They're -- they're signed, they're in his ink, they're -- they're symmetrical. Everything matches. Larry Patterson's (ph) logbook matches Richard Floyd McCoy's logbook. They're a perfect match.</p><p>COATES: Wow. And what would have given the children an indication that either of their parents, they believe, to have been involved in this?</p><p>GRYDER: Well, they knew. They grew up with this deep family secret. This is one thing that the kids will tell you. They're not giving any interviews right now. But -- but they -- they will -- if they could, they would tell you. They're not -- they're not talking, and they've lived a lifetime of knowing that they cannot talk about this.</p><p>COATES: Hmm.</p><p>GRYDER: That -- that was their family mantra. They could not talk about what their mom and dad did. Their mom and dad were both complicit in both hijackings, and they knew it.</p><p>COATES: Wow. I mean, you say that the FBI contacted you after -- after you released your evidence video on YouTube. I got to know what that was like, talking to them and the fact that they were leaning in and intrigued by what you found after all these years.</p><p>GRYDER: Well, the FBI did call. You know, it's interesting. We've never contacted any media, we've never contacted any authority, and we have never contacted any FBI in any way. The FBI contacted us after watching my two YouTube videos. They were convinced, and they wanted to see what I had found. They knew specifically exactly what they were looking for.</p><p>They told us upfront, we're going to look at it, we're going to meet with you, we'll meet with you at your location under your specifications. If it's not what we're looking for, we'll give it back in seven days, because we know exactly what we're looking for. That has been a year ago. COATES: So, I'm led to believe that perhaps they are going to keep it in custody because they believe that you're on to something? Maybe everything?</p><p>GRYDER: They're keeping it in custody because of the DNA. The FBI cannot go by circumstantial evidence, they're going to go by a DNA link, and they're trying -- they're trying their hardest to make a solid DNA link between all the artifacts that will tie Richard Floyd McCoy. That's the only way they can close it, with a solid DNA lock. They're going to keep this. Everything that I found is at Quantico, the FBI laboratory. Everything I found is in one storage location at Quantico right now, and their efforts are purely DNA-related.</p><p>COATES: Wow. Dan Gryder, this feels like a movie that I want to see, and yet it could be the solution to the mystery that everyone has been watching since the 70s. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>GRYDER: Thank you.</p><p>COATES: Let's discuss this more with journalist and author Geoffrey Gray. He literally wrote the book on this very story. It's called \"Skyjack: The Hunt for D.B. Cooper.\" Geoffrey, good to see you. What do you think about this? I mean, could the parachute be the key?</p><p>Meghan Hays, JOURNALIST, AUTHOR: You know, great to be here, Laura. I got to say I've been spending, you know, a lot of my life on this case, and I am -- honestly, I'm blown away with this little discovery of the parachute.</p><p>[23:10:08]</p><p>COATES: Hmm.</p><p>GRAY: Not only that the parachute, but the FBI has come to take it and is actually, you know, is swabbing for DNA evidence of a -- of a relative of a suspect. It's major news in this case. You know, the D.B. Cooper case is American history. It is one of the great hunts, the great -- the one that has gotten away literally --</p><p>COATES: Uh-hmm.</p><p>GRAY: -- from investigators for decades. So, the fact that they've come and taken DNA evidence is a big deal in this case. It's probably one of the biggest deals in 10 years, maybe more. And I got to give it up for Dan, who did all the work. You know, he flew to all these places. He, you know, knocked on all those doors. He found this parachute in the back of a garage.</p><p>Now, however, a parachute found in the back of a garage or this tobacco barn, you know, of Richard McCoy does not quite connect all the way --</p><p>COATES: Uh-hmm.</p><p>GRAY: -- to unveiling and unmasking the hijacker. And so, there are still some serious questions about Richard McCoy, as I always said. COATES: What are the holes that you see? What do you -- what would you need, since we've had so much research on it, to connect the dots?</p><p>GRAY: Yes. So, what we all need is a DNA match. Okay? We need something definitive. The problem is that there's not great DNA material in the case. They're scant, if any, at all. They could maybe find some hairs or something on a parachute, but what -- what are they going to really match it to? The best evidence that was collected on that night, Thanksgiving, right, this -- this night many, many years ago --</p><p>COATES: Uh-hmm.</p><p>GRAY: -- were these cigarette butts, these Raleigh filter tips cigarette butts that were collected on the plane. But really, they did not find -- at least in my reporting. The FBI has sort of -- those butts have gone missing. So, there's like a tie, there's a couple other things, but not really any great material. Okay, DNA. So that's problem number one.</p><p>Problem number two, for fans of Richard McCoy who like him as a suspect, is that he doesn't look really close to what I -- eyewitnesses that night thought D.B. Cooper looked like.</p><p>COATES: Hmm.</p><p>GRAY: Okay? And this is the big deal for me and why I have McCoy doubts. I wrote, you know, about McCoy extensively in \"Skyjack,\" my book. And he just -- he's got blue eyes. You know, people thought the hijacker had brown eyes. And another critical, critical point is that the best eyewitness described Cooper as having Marcelled hair, like kind of curly -- like curly -- tight, curly hair.</p><p>And Richard McCoy, look at his hair. He's got the flattest, thinnest, like kind of like Gympie's kind of hair. It's not even close to being curly. He doesn't look even close to it.</p><p>So, those -- those are the hard kind of questions that D.B. Cooper sleuths like myself and Dan look at when we look at a suspect like Richard McCoy.</p><p>COATES: You know, I actually spoke to another investigator who pointed to another possible person in interest, Vince Patterson -- Peterson, at one point in time, and had some of the concerns that you raised about trying to piece together this -- really, I wouldn't call it an age-old mystery, but it's pretty difficult to solve a crime like this all these years later when someone literally jumps out of an airplane and goes away with the money. I mean, this is fascinating to me, and I'm glad that you were here with us today, Geoffrey Gray. Thank you so much.</p><p>GRAY: Thank you.</p><p>COATES: Well, up next, another fascination. Another billionaire spotted at Donald Trump's Florida resort. Guess who it was? Him. Mark Zuckerberg. So, what was he doing there? We'll dive into the Mar-a- Lago social network next. Plus, the DOGE brothers, yeah, it's a phrase now, they get ready to head down to Capitol Hill as federal workers worry about being singled out by Elon Musk. And later, my conversation with Jaleel White on his career-defining role, Steve Urkel. So, I thought Urkel, Steve Urkel, all of them apply.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[23:15:00]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>COATES: Well, looks like the Silicon Valley billionaires just keep on walking through Mar-a-Lago. Tonight, it was Mark Zuckerberg's turn. The Meta CEO went down there to meet with President-elect Donald Trump. A Meta spokesperson confirmed it, said it was Trump who invited Zuckerberg, and that Zuckerberg was -- quote -- \"grateful\" for the meeting. Just remember, Facebook booted Trump off the platform after January 6th before then reinstating his account in 2023. The two have had just called a rocky relationship, to say the least.</p><p>Well, joining me now is CNN political commentator and Republican strategist Brad Todd and former special assistant to President Biden, Meghan Hays. Glad to see you both this evening. Brad, they've had a bit of a contentious relationship, Trump and Zuckerberg. Trump actually once threatened to have him jailed, if we can all recall that. So, what's it all about? Why this meeting?</p><p>BRAD TODD, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: One -- one phrase and two numbers -- three numbers. Section 230.</p><p>COATES: Hmm.</p><p>TODD: Social media giants currently are protected from liability suits based on Section 230. Media companies could be sued if they say things that have defamed other people, but social media companies cannot.</p><p>COATES: Because they're a platform that just basically is like, I'm hosting you, but not responsible for what you say.</p><p>TODD: That's correct. That's correct. However, Mark Zuckerberg and many other platforms began curating people, as we all know. It's deciding what stays on the platform, what doesn't.</p><p>A lot of Republicans in Congress, people like Josh Hawley, think that that means they should be liable. If you're making decisions about the content on your platform, that means you're not just neutrally hosting it, then you should not have that special liability protection. With Republicans in charge, both the White House and Congress, I think Section 230 reform is on the agenda.</p><p>[23:20:00]</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, he doesn't want to be on the wrong side of that.</p><p>COATES: It's part of what the incoming FCC or nominee has focused on in previous writings as well, the idea of Section 230, and this accusation that there has been censorship by those who hold these platforms. So, what would stand out about Trump's having a friendly relationship with, say, Mark Zuckerberg? He already certainly has with Elon Musk.</p><p>MEGHAN HAYS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, FORMER SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT BIDEN: I mean, I think this is a mutually beneficial relationship, right? Like, I think this is beneficial for Mark Zuckerberg, who go down there. They had a really tumultuous relationship in his first term. I think it's smart for him to go down there just for the reasons you're mentioning.</p><p>But this is a massive place of media for him. This is another way that Trump can reach voters where they are. But also, Zuckerberg needs him on his side. They need to get along. And so, I think this is trying to mend the relationship that they didn't have in his first term.</p><p>COATES: I mean, Congress has tried to do this, though. I mean, the idea of Trump talking to Mark Zuckerberg and that would solve the issue might be farcical to the members of Congress who've been trying to not only understand technology, but also to try to reform Section 230 and bring it up to sort of congressional code, so to speak.</p><p>Then you got people like Elon Musk, though, Brad, literally posting the -- and putting federal workers on notice on X, that he wants to fire some of them. He actually named, I think, four relatively unknown employees, examples of people that he actually does want to fire. Why would he do that as a way of promoting perhaps the DOGE department?</p><p>TODD: Well, of course, Elon Musk is not going to have any official authority in this White House. It's outside the government that DOGE is going to operate. I think, in the end --</p><p>COATES: True, though. He seems to have a lot of influence.</p><p>TODD: I think it's influence. Influence but not authority. Those are two different things.</p><p>COATES: Hmm.</p><p>TODD: I think he does have a lot of influence. And I think that in the end, the DOGE is going to end up focusing not on individual people, but on more structural reforms.</p><p>You know, for instance, we have spent $42 billion on Joe Biden's broadband program that hasn't signed anybody up on the internet. They spent tons to build 17 charging stations for electric vehicles. Those are the kind of wasteful government programs that are going to be either contracted out to providers who could do it or right sized or, you know, maybe even move some of those departments out of Washington. But I think it'll be macro picture --</p><p>COATES: Hmm.</p><p>TODD: -- before we -- before all said and done.</p><p>COATES: But macro would be what you said. The micro would be naming individuals. Why take that route then?</p><p>HAYS: I don't think he should. I think we've seen in the last 24 hours all of these people who have been swatted and who have had bomb threats at their house that are now public figure. I mean, they've been public figures that are being named. These are people who either are political appointees or civil servants that are being named in an unfair way.</p><p>They seem to have -- Elon Musk seems to have a vendetta or personal issues with them or what their offices are doing. So, it's -- it's not appropriate for him to be doing that. But I do agree that they should be looking at the government holistically and not on individual people.</p><p>COATES: By the way --</p><p>TODD: -- should be swatted. No one should be in the driveway. That should not happen.</p><p>HAYS: Oh, but that -- I mean, that is just about saying --</p><p>COATES: You know who agrees with that? Elon Musk thought that when they were tracking his flights. He was particularly perturbed about that and not having through privacy, which is -- it just -- it's befuddling to think of why he would do that.</p><p>But, also, you've got long time Trump ally, Steve Bannon, telling Puck's Peter Hamby that Musk was the deciding factor, the deciding factor in Trump's win, saying, to be brutally frank, it's the reason we won. Do you agree with that?</p><p>TODD: I agree with Steve Bannon on very little. But I -- I'm going to halfway agree with him on this. I think -- I think for -- that one of key demographics for Trump that he improved on versus last time was with younger men. And I think a lot of younger men see Elon Musk as a disruptor. And they see that he has changed a lot of industries that they find relevant to their life.</p><p>You know, John Fetterman, the senator from Pennsylvania, the Democrat, said that a lot of young men saw in him Tony Stark. You know, the Marvel hero. And so, Elon Musk is kind of that mysterious, you know, superhero person to some people. So, I think it was -- it was more important than endorsement than Oprah, and maybe a more important endorsement than Taylor Swift, in this presidential campaign. So, I might buy Steve Bannon's argument on this.</p><p>COATES: Well, I wonder why Robert Downey, Jr. then won't play him SNL --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>-- if they ask David Harvey. I'm just -- just going out there for the Marvel people out there. Do you agree with how influential he is?</p><p>HAYS: I mean, I think he's more influential as a person showing up with Donald Trump on the stump than his money. But I do think that people notice when people put their money where their mouth is. And I think that Elon Musk did that. But I don't necessarily think his money helped the ground game. I mean, it's widely reported it was not a successful ground game, that he -- that it was not successful. But I do think him being on the stump with Trump helped him.</p><p>COATES: Because he resonates with younger people who see something --</p><p>HAYS: And see a disruptor. They see sort of a defiant attitude, they see people who are going to fight for them, and I think that was part of why Republicans won in this election.</p><p>COATES: Well, if only these ballots had, after the bubble, the word because, then we would know what the mandate was, and why people voted for people. Brad Todd, Meghan Hays, happy Thanksgiving eve. Thank you both for being here today.</p><p>All right, are you -- are you dreading politics coming up at the Thanksgiving table? And how should you handle those political hot takes? Well, Scott Jennings and Van Jones, they've got some pro tips for all of us.</p><p>[23:25:00]</p><p>Plus, the man you knew and loved at Steve Urkel, Jaleel White. He is my special guest tonight, him and that smile.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNKNOWN: I just wish you weren't a liar.</p><p>UNKNOWN: I wish you wouldn't call me a liar.</p><p>UNKNOWN: Don't raise your voice at me.</p><p>UNKNOWN: I am not raising my voice.</p><p>UNKNOWN: You do not talk to me like that.</p><p>UNKNOWN: You're angry.</p><p>UNKNOWN: You don't talk to me like that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COATES: Okay, so, that's what you want to avoid tomorrow at the Thanksgiving table, particularly if the topic of politics comes up. And let me tell you, this year, it's going to be extra tense given that we are just a few weeks removed from the election.</p><p>[23:30:00]</p><p>Now, the majority of you, according to this CBS News poll, want absolutely nothing to do with talking about politics tomorrow. Seventy-one percent say they're going to try to avoid it. Certainly, hear you on that. But 29% will actively try to talk about it. Twenty- nine percent? So, odds are even if you don't want to, there's going to be someone in your circle who is going to engage and eagerly. So, if that happens, we've got you covered tonight.</p><p>With advice from two of the best who do this for a living, CNN senior political commentators Scott Jennings and Van Jones. Gentlemen, I'm glad you're both here. We have put together a list that we're calling Thanksgiving topics you definitely don't want to talk about, but just might have to thanks to a crazy uncle or aunt. So, here's this kind of jeopardy category for you all.</p><p>I'll begin with you, Scott. Um, someone says Trump doesn't have a mandate to carry out what he wants to because he got under 50% of the popular vote. Give us the Jennings's response at that table.</p><p>SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, FORMER SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO PRESIDNET TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: Oh, please. Donald Trump has gotten more votes every time he has run for three straight elections. He won the national popular vote for the first time for Republicans since 2004, and his party won the House and the Senate. The American people have given him a mandate to govern. They want the Republican Party to take an action.</p><p>And you, sir, bringing this up to me at the table would be wise to tell your party, don't be obstructionist, because I don't think the American people are going to like it.</p><p>COATES: Oh, he is not getting the last crescent roll. All right, Van Jones, what's your take? Go ahead.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Hmm.</p><p>VAN JONES, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, first of all, yeah, he has a mandate, but for what? Because he says so many different things, and people who voted for him said, well, I'm voting for him because I believe he's going to do this, but not the nine other things he said he's going to do. So, all we know is that people didn't like the status quo.</p><p>He barely squeaked out, this win. We have -- we're two votes away from majority in the House. He did not get the popular vote. And it's clear he has a -- he has a mandate to not beat Joe Biden, but it's not clear he has a mandate to do, in fact. And a lot of stuff he's going to try to do when it comes to tariffs, his own base is going to reject. So, he has no mandate, and he should be the one who is careful and doesn't overreach.</p><p>COATES: Now, this is the moment when somebody fights over the canned cranberry sauce or the one that someone made homemade and everyone is like, yeah, sure, thank you for making it. Here's one for you, Van. Another candidate besides Kamala Harris would have won in that same 100-day stretch. What's your response?</p><p>JONES: Well, look, my response is we don't know, we'll never know, but to the extent that that's meant to be some kind of slight against Kamala Harris or some kind of put down of Kamala Harris, I think it's very important to remember that, you know, there are two numbers. Thirty-nine, which is the percent of approval for Joe Biden historically, catastrophically low, and 55, the number of people who wanted a new direction for America. So, she had to go up against those two numbers in 100 days, and she closed the gap in the swing states in a way that was very, very impressive.</p><p>And so, you know, we've never had a female president before, so she was trying to bang against a glass ceiling, maybe a concrete ceiling, and she acquitted herself very, very well. Anybody who's criticizing her now would have to say, if you'd asked six months ago, would she do as well as she did? You said, no way. She had Donald Trump scared right up to the very end. I think we should be proud of Kamala Harris.</p><p>COATES: Scott, I'm passing you the mashed potatoes proverbially here. Go ahead.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JENNINGS: Yeah. Well, I can see why you're down on Kamala Harris. I mean, she was one of the worst Democratic nominees of our lifetime. And presidential campaigns have a way of revealing the talent levels of the people who were in them. And I think we found the ceiling she bumped up against. If you hadn't remembered it from 2020 or 2019, she'd make it to 2020. Now, you really have seen it on display, and maybe she'll try it again in four years from now.</p><p>We'll never know if another Democrat could win, but I'll tell you this: Joe Biden and his administration and what Kamala Harris helped him do have tainted the Democratic Party, it delivered Republican majorities in Washington D.C., and now their party is in the wilderness trying to figure out what went wrong, and the American people are expecting Republicans to lead us out of this morass, this malaise, if you will, that we've been in for the last four years.</p><p>COATES: Something tells me that Scott is not making it to dessert at Van's house. I see his head shaking.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Someone is getting thrown out. I don't know whose house it is right now. But I'm a -- I'm a go on the next one right now because, whew, Scott, okay, this one is for you, and it's probably sure to come up. Trump is only about loyalty, himself, and is stacking his entire cabinet with yes men and yes women. Scott?</p><p>JENNINGS: I mean, honestly, are you -- are you complaining that a president of the United States is appointing people to his government that, oh, my gosh, supported his election campaign, that support his agenda?</p><p>[23:35:00]</p><p>That's unheard of. We've never heard of this before. That's crazy talk. Every president appoints people to the cabinet that supported them, that supports the things they want to do. I mean, my goodness gracious. Joe Biden ended up appointing Pete Buttigieg as secretary of transportation because he said, well, you know, I like trains, choo- choos are fun.</p><p>This is a great cabinet. This is great picks. These people are going to shake up Washington D.C, and so what if they're loyal to Donald Trump? That's what you -- that's what the American people voted for, a government that's going to follow Donald Trump's agenda that he ran on. That's what they voted for. That's how he won. The people should execute his agenda.</p><p>COATES: Van, you're choking on that wishbone right now. Go ahead and tell me --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>-- what your reaction is, before you have to have the Heimlich maneuver, my friend. Go ahead.</p><p>JONES: It's -- it's a nightmare bone.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>No wishes here. Listen, no, I 100% disagree on this because, yes, people wanted a change of direction. What they didn't want was a train wreck. They didn't want a clown car. They didn't want a circus next to, you know, a forest fire. Like, you can have people who support your agenda who are competent. You can have people support your agenda who are not literally punch lines.</p><p>When -- when you are -- when you are announcing people for your cabinet and people aren't sure if it's an episode of \"The Onion\" or if it's real, when you have to, like, triple check because these -- these things are so ludicrous, that is not what anybody voted for. Nobody voted to destroy America's government. And a lot of these picks have no qualification at all except loyalty, and that's the problem.</p><p>COATES: All right, well, I'm going to end on food because I feel like this might be the ties that bind or it might be just the nail in the coffin. I have two quick questions for both of you. Do we call it stuffing or dressing? And is it a pumpkin pie or sweet potato pie? Go, Van.</p><p>JONES: We call it stuffing.</p><p>COATES: Hmm.</p><p>JONES: And -- and for me, it's sweet potato pie.</p><p>COATES: And Scott? Is it dressing or stuffing?</p><p>JENNINGS: Well, I'm putting my -- I'm going to put -- I'm going to put my -- I'm going to put my pilgrim hat on because this is where -- this is the real debate and I --</p><p>JONES: Please don't. JENNINGS: I just want to say I'm going to -- we're not MAGA tonight. We're MAPA. We're going to make America pilgrim again. And I'm going to disagree with Van. I would -- I do like sweet potato pie. I would opt for the pumpkin pie. We do call it dressing. Some people in my family call it stubbing, but majority dressing. So, once again, Van and I cannot seem to find common ground at this Thanksgiving table, but I will send you your Pilgrim hat, my friend.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JONES: But if --</p><p>COATES: I don't think --</p><p>JONES: Please do. I need another trash can.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>COATES: Oh, okay. Well, at this point, I say it has been so nice to have you both at my table. The door is over there. You can't stay for games. You can't. Van, Scott, who has brought not only a bucket of chicken on my show before, but now a Pilgrim hat --</p><p>JENNINGS: That's true.</p><p>COATES: -- I'm going to call you later. I'm going to call you later. Van, I'll shake my head with you. Van, Scott, thank you both so much. Happy Thanksgiving.</p><p>JENNINGS: Happy Thanksgiving.</p><p>JONES: Happy holidays, brother.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Happy holidays, brother.</p><p>JENNINGS: Thank you. See you, guys. Love you both.</p><p>COATES: Up next, a very special guest on this Thanksgiving eve, the one and only Jaleel White on growing up as Steve Urkel and, of course, Stefan Urkel. Look at Jaleel. I mean, I'm telling you, listen, growing up as Laura in the era of \"Family Matters\" --</p><p>JALEEL WHITE, ACTOR: Laura, sweet, thank you for having me on your show.</p><p>COATES: Please tell me you got that. Please tell -- that's my -- that's my new ringtone. Hold on a second. I got to do it. We'll be right back. Hold on. Nope. He said it. He said it. That's it. I'm done.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[23:40:00]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WHITE: Look what you did.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COATES: Steve Urkel AKA Jaleel White did that and so many more quotable moments and lovable chaos throughout the nine seasons of \"Family Matters,\" one of the most iconic family sitcoms of the 90S.</p><p>And despite the fact that when Jaleel White first appeared as Steve Urkel, he was just supposed to be a one-off guest star, but he was an immediate hit. He helped boost the show's ratings. We all fell in love with him and his character. Here's his first scene with, hmm, Laura Winslow.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WHITE: Hi, Laura.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>I hear you can't get a date for the dance. So, you want to go with me?</p><p>UNKNOWN: Well, take a hike, Urkel. She'd rather eat worms.</p><p>WHITE: Okay. Some other time then. Did I mention my dad knows Wayne Newton?</p><p>LAURA WINSLOW, ACTRESS: Make him go away.</p><p>UNKNOWN: Get out of here, goat face.</p><p>WHITE: Excuse me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>COATES: A number of times I've heard, Laura, my sweet, over my life. I'm Laura, and I definitely do not want you to go away. Jaleel White is here with me. His new memoir, \"Growing Up Urkel,\" is out right now. I am so excited to have you here.</p><p>[23:45:00]</p><p>I have been such a fan of your work. In fact, my kids, 12 and 10, they also watch \"Family Matters.\" They know you so much that my son was you for Halloween. WHITE: I love it.</p><p>COATES: Well, listen. I got to tell you, people underestimate the ability to be a comedic actor. I mean, really, to be able to do that at such a young age, to be able to be consistent. You started on \"Family Matters\" as Steve Urkel when you were just 12 years old. You were 21 when the show wrapped. This is a very formative period in your life. What was that like growing up as people -- they knew as Steve, but also Jaleel?</p><p>WHITE: You know, it was -- it was amazing. You know, the number one thing I like to share with people is, at least through the book, is that I attended public school the entire time --</p><p>COATES: Really?</p><p>WHITE: -- I was on that show. Yeah. The entire time, I was in public school. My mother was insistent. And it was a time before smartphones when you could somewhat get away with it. But it still didn't come without its drama. I kind of see my -- my maturation on the show in -- in chapters. You know, when you're in middle school, it suddenly makes you really popular at school. And when you're in high school, you know, you're still popular, but things are changing. Stefan saved my life. We could talk about that whenever you want to. But then by the time you get to college --</p><p>COATES: Oh, Stefan Urkel?</p><p>WHITE: Yeah.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>COATES: We can talk about that. And when you came in for the cooling, you with baby face, yeah, we can we can talk about that.</p><p>WHITE: Yeah. But then when you finally get to college and, you know, you got the east-west rap beef (ph) going on and the image of a young Black man is changing in America, you know, it was -- it was weight on my shoulders during -- during my college years. But I survived those. And by the time my daughter got here, I was really able to appreciate the work that I've done.</p><p>COATES: Well, I want to talk about that because I've often wondered -- I mean, you are so -- to many people -- we're so synonymous with the character. It must have been hard for people to differentiate you as an actor from the real person. How did people treat you in your college days and beyond when you had probably been quite pigeonholed?</p><p>WHITE: You know, I -- that's the stereotypical reaction, and I respect it. But I've done over 400 episodes of episodic television --</p><p>COATES: Hmm.</p><p>WHITE: -- and, you know, much of that came after \"Family Matters.\" It's a challenge for any actor, Laura, to move on from one sitcom or one well-known show to the next big opportunity that lands as big as that show. And it's tougher to do these days because not everybody is watching the same thing anymore.</p><p>COATES: I'm so glad you said that because I often think about that probably contributing to a lot of the division we have when we don't have those common threads. Like, we don't have everyone knowing the catchphrases. They don't have -- I make my kids watch all the shows I used to so they know that mommy is funny and know my catchphrases because they got to have some commonality. Their friends have no idea what they're talking about. But I want to play for everyone some of Steve Urkel's most famous catchphrases.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WHITE: Got me cheese.</p><p>UNKNOWN: I'm falling. I can't get up.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WHITE: Can I do that? Can I do that? Can I do that?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COATES: How do you feel when you watch yourself back at that age?</p><p>WHITE: It's -- you know, during pandemic, I actually spent some time watching all the episodes I wasn't in and picking out certain episodes that I just wanted to, you know, reconnect with. It's an out of body experience for me. It really is.</p><p>COATES: Hmm.</p><p>WHITE: You know, I tell everybody I don't hide it. It was paid schizophrenia. So, I really did create somebody who is very similar to me actually in a lot of awkward ways growing up but very different for me in mannerism. So --</p><p>COATES: How did you navigate the fact that -- I mean, obviously, you were not intended to be the star of the show, but you are, I think, one of the most recognizable figures from that show. There couldn't have been all wine and roses behind the scenes. You're right about that.</p><p>WHITE: Yeah, it wasn't always roses behind the scenes. And, you know, it was definitely bumpy in the beginning. I think that has been well documented. I don't like to beat up my former costars, though. We eventually really did become quite the family.</p><p>I talk about, you know, in the book also, when we got a chance to travel to Paris together as a -- as a -- as a cast. We're the only black show that has ever shot episodes in Europe, and I'm really, really proud of that. You know, it's -- it's like anything, man. Like, the Bulls won a lot of championships, but trust me, they didn't get along all the time. And -- but it's important that you look back fondly and with respect on the people that you worked with. COATES: Oh, I got to go back and watch \"The Last Dance\" again. Scottie, Michael. We'll see what's really going on there. I wonder, though, you mentioned the differentiation and how some things you resonated with and some things were like you were not. Did you ever feel like you were growing out of Steve Urkel?</p><p>WHITE: Oh, yes. See, to me, that's the more interesting story, the slow, inevitable, and obvious me growing out of the character, which I have to laugh at even myself.</p><p>[23:50:02]</p><p>You know -- I mean, I literally did the character from age 12 to 21. Stefan saved my life. You know, I really underestimated how much people needed to see Stefan Urkel, needed to see that I had -- I had more range than that. And it really, really did save my life. So --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>COATES: I want to play for everyone to remind people, I always think about the white suit, Stefan Urkel. Listen to this.</p><p>WHITE: Hey.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WHITE: Steve. Steve who?</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>UNKNOWN: Steve Urkel.</p><p>WHITE: No, no, no. There is no Steve here. I'm Stefan, sweet thing.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Stefan or kiss (ph).</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COATES: I love it. I remember watching this when this actually came out. I'm still smiling. Me and my friends talked about it the next day, Jaleel.</p><p>WHITE: Laura, that's a time that we will never be able to revisit again in American history because when you saw it, what did you do? You hopped on the phone and you start calling everybody. And guess what? All the phone lines lit up after that. It's so hard to create programming like that in this day and age that will trigger someone like yourself at your tender age, calling your friends to be, like, girl, are you watching this? COATES: But you said it saved your life. If -- you know, at that point, especially the timing of it and the, frankly, the stereotypes, some positive, others negative -- I mean, you went from being, you know, the noted nerd and genius to somebody who was smooth and had the debonair qualities. Where did that come from? Was that you initiating that because you wanted to show range or was that the network saying we got to see more?</p><p>WHITE: No. I can't even give the network credit. David Duclon, my former executive producer, and our writing staff, you know, they always saw more in me than I saw in myself. The highest compliment David ever paid to me as our head writer was, Jay, I can give you anything and you pull it off in four days of rehearsal.</p><p>COATES: Hmm.</p><p>WHITE: So, it was by the grace of God, really, that their own creative juices went in this direction, and ultimately, for a lot of women like yourself, you know, you got a chance to see the real me or something closer to the real me. I didn't even think it would be entertaining. So, you know, I'm happy to have been wrong.</p><p>COATES: You were wrong. It was very entertaining. Still is, Jaleel. Let me ask you though on this. It was considered a crossover success. Of course, both Black and white audiences loved it. At a time when you really had people almost having a segregated watching experience of the shows they selected and leaned into and appreciated, what was it like straddling that line, especially when the writers' room at that time was mostly white and male?</p><p>WHITE: You know, I think that's the thing that presented -- that presented the greatest obstacle for me going forward in my career. I was used to a white budget. I was used to a certain level of professionalism. I was used to a certain platform that was as big as ABC on an 8:00 on a Friday night.</p><p>COATES: Uh-hmm.</p><p>WHITE: And suddenly when that show was done, I -- you know, I kind of got reduced to a smaller platform and less budget. And, oh, you know, we're going to put you in an urban box. And it's, like, what does that mean when I've been able to do a show that translates all the way to Italy and Australia and Germany and Spain and France? And I'm like -- I'm looking at the checks coming from these places. So, suddenly, the bean counters are seeing my value differently.</p><p>COATES: What was that like going from, you know, having this TGIF experience to having to fight as an adult who's still very much into production, still an actor, still wanting to be a part of and so obviously a host now and continued success. What has it been like that transition post 21?</p><p>WHITE: It was a real, real, real, personal challenge that really forced me to look within to avoid being bitter and jay (ph). At the end of the day, I've been afforded an incredible life. I love inspiring people. And the thing I'm actually most proud of with \"Family Matters\" is how well the show has traveled around the globe.</p><p>So, I've just always known in my heart that God will continue to kick me back to that where I can affect people from all walks of life, no matter what color they are. Yeah. And that's a tough thing to pull off in TV these days where they just want to kind of keep you in a box with one, what's your target audience? I'm like, man, I don't have a target audience, man. That's not -- I'm here to affect people in the world.</p><p>[23:55:00]</p><p>COATES: That's a beautiful incentive, to continue to create art, and I appreciate that so much. I love it, and I'm so loved talking to you. The book is phenomenal. It's called \"Growing Up.\"</p><p>WHITE: Thank you.</p><p>COATES: I did not spoil everything for everyone. It is a really great read, to get to know you in this way. Thank you.</p><p>WHITE: Laura, you rock.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>COATES: Thanks for watching. Happy Thanksgiving to each and every one of you. \"Anderson Cooper 360\" is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2024112701CNV75</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LACOLI2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DHM-DV71-JCS1-61YD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7463\"/><timeReceived>11:00 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Cable News Network, Inc.

And the investment for Colorado State University will support training programs for aerial firefighting and emergency management, bolstering our state's ability to respond to the increasing threat of wildfire. Together, we are taking action and making a real difference for our state.\"</p><p>\"The refrigeration upgrades will allow us to safely and efficiently deliver food to over 45,000 Larimer County residents experiencing food insecurity annually. We are proud to partner with Congressman Neguse on these critical infrastructure upgrades. The funding will allow us to continue our focus on our important work - a hunger-free Larimer County. Thank you, Congressman Neguse, for supporting us in this critical mission!\" said Amy Pezzani, CEO of Food Bank for Larimer County.</p><p>\"We are grateful to Congressman Neguse for recommending funding that will upgrade our airstrip, Christman Field, for emergency firefighting operations across the Front Range and improve drone training and research for our region,\" said Christopher Robertson, Drone Center Director, Colorado State University Drone Center.</p><p>Additional information about the Larimer County-based projects:</p><p>Food Bank for Larimer County Refrigeration Upgrades - Larimer County, CO - $640,000</p><p>* To provide necessary updates and replacements to the refrigeration and freezer systems of the Food Bank for Larimer County to ensure that food is stored safely and to increase the capacity of storing perishable food for distribution.

Bernie Sanders is his second-most common guest. On Tuesday, Sanders was on again as Colbert turned The Late Show into The Socialist Show as he opened the floor to Sanders to predict Donald Trump will lead to more wildfires, the erosion of women's rights, and the reason why the Biden Economy isn't doing so well is because of greedy corporations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Colbert put the ball on the tee for Sanders as he inquired, 'As someone who spent his life trying to push our nation forward, how does it feel for you to see so many voters returning to a person that I, for one, thought have been politically discredited even among his own party, Donald Trump.'</p><p>After calling it 'distressing,' Sanders went through a list of reasons why 'take something like climate change. Every sane person on this earth understands that the world is getting warmer. I mean, right now in Texas, there is a horrible forest fire, the worst they've ever had. We've seen fires all over the world, heat waves, storms, unprecedented. Truth is Trump doesn't even believe in the concept of climate change. Will work with the fossil fuel industry to increase oil production, et cetera and that will send a signal all over the world that the fight against climate change has basically been lost and I wonder what kind of climate our kids and grandchildren will inherit.'</p><p>Sanders also freaked that 'Then if you look at women's\u00a0rights.\u00a0My god, women have struggled forever and to be full citizens of this\u00a0country, to be able to control\u00a0their own bodies.\u00a0If Trump wins, it will be a massive-- and his Republican\u00a0colleagues-- a massive setback to\u00a0women's rights and the right of\u00a0women to control their own\u00a0bodies.'</p><p>After a commercial break, <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/alexchristy17/status/1765745472684032467\">Colbert</url> once again opened up the floor, 'If Bernie Sanders was giving the\u00a0State of the Union address on\u00a0Thursday, what would he say the\u00a0state of our union is?'</p><p>Sanders gave his usual stump speech before adding, 'But, I think what the president has got to recognize is that there are a lot of people who are hurting out there. People going to the grocery store, can't afford food, can't afford to fill up their gas tanks, working incredible hours, having a hard time taking care of their kids or their parents.'</p><p>Sounds like quite the indictment of the Biden economy, but Sanders insisted that it is not Biden's fault, 'we have made some progress, but the president has got to\u00a0understand we have a long way to\u00a0go here, we have to have the\u00a0courage, Stephen, and this is\u00a0not easy, to take on a very\u00a0powerful corporate ruling class\u00a0whose greed in many ways is\u00a0destroying this country. We got to take them on and create\u00a0an economy for all, not the few.'</p><p>Sanders wants to impose policies that make gas more expensive, then gets mad at the fossil fuel companies when prices get more expensive. If Colbert was more of an interviewer than a fan, he might have pointed this out.</p><p>Here is a transcript for the March 5-taped show :</p><p>CBS\u00a0 The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</p><p>3/6/2024</p><p>12:06 AM ET</p><p>STEPHEN COLBERT:\u00a0As someone who spent his life\u00a0trying to push our nation\u00a0forward, how does it feel for\u00a0you to see so many voters\u00a0returning to a person that I, for\u00a0one, thought have been\u00a0politically discredited even\u00a0among his own party,\u00a0Donald Trump.\u00a0</p><p>BERNIE SANDERS: It's\u00a0distressing.\u00a0To say the least.\u00a0And what I am concerned about is\u00a0I think many people don't\u00a0understand what a Trump\u00a0presidency will look like and it will be a disaster not\u00a0only for our country but I think, you know,\u00a0for the world.\u00a0And if you look at -- and if you look at, you know, Stephen, if\u00a0you just look at the issues and I don't\u00a0want to rattle them all off, but take something like climate\u00a0change.\u00a0Every sane person on this Earth\u00a0understands that the world is\u00a0getting warmer.\u00a0I mean, right now in Texas, there\u00a0is a horrible forest fire, the\u00a0worst they've ever had.\u00a0We've seen fires all over the world,\u00a0heat waves, storms,\u00a0unprecedented.\u00a0</p><p>Truth is Trump doesn't even\u00a0believe in the concept of\u00a0climate change.\u00a0Will work with the fossil fuel\u00a0industry to increase oil\u00a0production, et cetera and that will\u00a0send a signal all over the world\u00a0that the fight against climate\u00a0change has basically been lost and\u00a0I wonder what kind of climate\u00a0our kids and grandchildren\u00a0will inherit.\u00a0That's just one thing.\u00a0</p><p>Then if you look at women's\u00a0rights.\u00a0My god, women have struggled forever and to be full citizens of this\u00a0country, to be able to control\u00a0their own bodies.\u00a0If Trump wins, it will be a massive-- and his Republican\u00a0colleagues-- a massive setback to\u00a0women's rights and the right of\u00a0women to control their own\u00a0bodies.\u00a0</p><p>COLBERT: The State of the\u00a0Union Address to a joint session\u00a0of Congress is this Thursday.\u00a0We'll be here live afterwards\u00a0making the jokes.\u00a0If Bernie Sanders was giving the\u00a0State of the Union address on\u00a0Thursday, what would he say the\u00a0state of our union is?\u00a0</p><p>SANDERS: God, I\u00a0wish I was going to give that address.\u00a0Matter of fact, now that you\u00a0mention it.\u00a0</p><p>COLBERT: You gave it a\u00a0shot.\u00a0</p><p>SANDERS: I gave it\u00a0a shot. Alright, this is what I would say.\u00a0I would say that in the last\u00a0couple of years we've made some\u00a0progress on a number of\u00a0important issues.\u00a0We have a long way to go. This is the greatest country on\u00a0Earth.\u00a0This is the wealthiest nation on\u00a0Earth.\u00a0We should not have the highest\u00a0rate of childhood poverty of any\u00a0major nation on Earth.\u00a0We should not be the only\u00a0wealthy country that doesn't\u00a0guarantee health care to all\u00a0people as a human right.\u00a0We should not have a federal\u00a0minimum wage of $7.25 an hour.\u00a0We should not have, as you\u00a0mentioned, billionaires and large\u00a0corporations not paying a nickel\u00a0in federal income tax.\u00a0We should lead the world in\u00a0transforming our energy system\u00a0to save the planet for our kids\u00a0and grandchildren.\u00a0You know, those are some of the issues.\u00a0</p><p>But, I think what the president has\u00a0got to recognize is that there\u00a0are a lot of people who are\u00a0hurting out there.\u00a0People going to the\u00a0grocery store, can't afford\u00a0food, can't afford to fill up\u00a0their gas tanks, working\u00a0incredible hours, having a hard\u00a0time taking care of their kids\u00a0or their parents.\u00a0So we have made some progress, but the president has got to\u00a0understand we have a long way to\u00a0go here, we have to have the\u00a0courage, Stephen, and this is\u00a0not easy, to take on a very\u00a0powerful corporate ruling class\u00a0whose greed in many ways is\u00a0destroying this country. We got to take them on and create\u00a0an economy for all, not the few.\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/alex-christy/2024/03/07/colbert-turns-late-show-socialist-hour-sanders\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXNG-NBST107778170982427945125876100237</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBST-6588</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BGY-6BG1-JCMN-Y2V3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484270</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1084\"/><timeReceived>3:11 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Newstex LLC</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2024 Newsbusters.org</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Newsbusters.org</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"03\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>March 7, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Tax Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Wages</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTA1QjQ4NEIwODZFNDVENDg0NjVERkQ4N0JDNkZFOEE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTc1NTlCNTZDODRENDVBRUE4Q0MyMjFGRkJDQTA0NzI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D89F</classCode><className>FEMINISM &amp; WOMEN'S RIGHTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001851</classCode><className>WOMEN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000CET8</classCode><className>GRANDCHILDREN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A0J4</classCode><className>LATE NIGHT TELEVISION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001240</classCode><className>OIL &amp; GAS INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001900</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp; UTILITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>ST000DSGI</classCode><className>FOSSIL FUELS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>PE0009UB9</classCode><className>BERNIE SANDERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>PE0009THX</classCode><className>DONALD TRUMP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE0009X6B</classCode><className>STEPHEN COLBERT</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Depending on the height, hourly averages varied between 418 +/- 5 at 100 m and 422 +/- 8 mu mol mol(-1) at 10 m for CO2, while CH4 varied between 1999 +/- 30 nmol mol(-1) at 100 m and 1986 +/- 25 at 10 m and similar to 102 +/- 19 nmol mol(-1) for CO.\" </p><p><br/> Financial support for this research came from INDALO (Scientific Infrastructures for Global Change Monitoring and Adaptation in Andalusia) project. <br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from National Institute for Aerospace Technology (INTA), \"A monthly variation with a common maximum in January-February was obtained while the minimum was found in June for CH4 and CO, whereas the minimum for CO2 was in August. The seasonal daily patterns showed a maximum between 5:00 and 10:00 UTC while the minimum was observed at 15:00-18:00 UTC. The daily variations are controlled by atmospheric stability, photochemical activity and vegetation influence, among other factors. The CO2 gradient was strongly conditioned by the photosynthesis, plant and soil respiration and vertical mixing with peaks higher than 19 x 10(-2) mu mol mol(-1) m(-1) at similar to 5:00 UTC in spring and autumn. The CH4 gradient, greater in winter and autumn (12-27 x 10(-2) mu mol mol(-1) m(-1)) is affected by vertical stability, local emissions and photochemical activity while CO depicted small vertical gradients. A different behavior was found in the CO2 and CH4 gradients, for CO2 the 10-50 m gradient is higher than 50-100 m while CH4 was the opposite; which could reflect a lower CO2 surface layer than CH4.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The observations at 100 m registered CO and CH4 peaks that were not recorded at 10 m, which could be associated with the arrival of a forest fire plume and potential CH4 fugitive emissions.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Greenhouse Gases In the Tall Tower of El Arenosillo Station In Southwestern Europe: First-year of Measurements.

Those two projects have been planned for a later time when conditions are more appropriate.</p><p>A modified and smaller area of the Sawmill Project, located 2.5 miles southeast of Stoneman Lake, is planned for Wednesday due to optimal winds from the south/southwest that will transport the smoke north/northwest and keep smoke away from large powerlines, as well as Verde Valley</p><p>Forecasted strong winds from the southwest today through Wednesday should help clear the airshed and improve air quality, especially for areas such as the Verde Valley.</p><p>*Rest of the document can be viewed at: (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/coconino/news-events/?cid=FSEPRD1150659\">https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/coconino/news-events/?cid=FSEPRD1150659</url>) For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:contentservices@htlive.com\">contentservices@htlive.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USFDNW-PR4602337</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USFDNW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69KK-JXV1-JDKC-R3T0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">282801</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"236\"/><timeReceived>7:10 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 HT Media Ltd.

(Conafor) <br/>Earlier Monday, President Andrs Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador addressed the wildfires during his press conference at the National Palace. At that time, his data showed 84 fires were still active. <br/>The nation's silver-haired leader also took time during his ma\u00f1anera to deny that Mexico's more than 100 fires this year have been caused by real-estate developers wanting to build on that land, something he hinted at last week. <br/>'Real estate interests are also always there,' he said on Wednesday. 'I don't rule it out.' <br/>AMLO clarified his statements on Monday by saying, 'From what we have investigated, the number of fires has to do with the drought [and] very high temperatures.' <br/>Firefighters try to get ahead of a forest fire in Acapulco's El Veladero National Park earlier this month. (Carlos Carbajal/Cuartoscuro) <br/>He said it cannot be established that there are 'bad intentions of developers who want to burn a forest to establish housing,' adding, 'More than anything, it is due to accidents' or 'the burning of grasslands for livestock and agriculture.' <br/>As of last Wednesday, there were a record 120 wildfires burning in 19 states,[2] according to Mexico's National Forestry Commission (Conafor). The agency noted that 6,195 firefighters and seven helicopter teams were fighting the blazes that had ravaged 7,137 hectares. <br/>On Monday, Conafor posted[1] updated numbers through 11 a.m. that included 69 active fires in 19 states, covering 11,882 hectares and including 12 fires in natural protected areas. <br/>The president noted that the state of Mxico had the most fires with 11, followed by Guerrero with 10. <br/>According to his data at the time, 3,845 people were fighting the fires: 723 from the forestry commission (Conafor), 1,045 from the Ministry of Defense (Sedena), 338 from the National Guard, 666 from state governments and 1,073 from other agencies. <br/>Overall, from Jan. 1 to March 21, Conafar said 667 forest fires had been recorded in 23 states, in an area of \u200b\u200b22,247 hectares. Last week, there were 20 new fires, mostly in the states of Tlaxcala, Veracruz, Chiapas, Durango and Morelos. <br/>Federal officials say they have ramped up coordination between different government agencies and entities. The synergy has reportedly allowed a rapid response to fire reports, with an average response time of less than 2 hours, even in remote and difficult-to-access areas, according to officials. <br/>As of last Wednesday, there are 1,000 firefighters working to extinguish wildfires in Veracruz. (Cuartoscuro) <br/>In terms of area, the state most affected by the fires is Oaxaca, where 6,633 hectares have burned. Mxico state, Veracruz and Guanajuato have each suffered more than 2,000 hectares of damage. <br/>The natural areas affected include the Nevado de Toluca in central Mexico, the Sierra Gorda in northern Quertaro and neighboring states, the La Sepultura Biosphere Reserve in Chiapas and the El Tepozteco archaeological site in Morelos. <br/>With reports from Excelsior[3] and Aristegui Noticias[4] <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/CONAFOR/status/1774865770234704205\">https://twitter.com/CONAFOR/status/1774865770234704205</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/four-dead-mexico-battles-record-120-wildfires-19-states/\">https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/four-dead-mexico-battles-record-120-wildfires-19-states/</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.excelsior.com.mx/nacional/amlo-incendios-forestales-activos-personas-combaten-siniestros/1644077\">https://www.excelsior.com.mx/nacional/amlo-incendios-forestales-activos-personas-combaten-siniestros/1644077</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://aristeguinoticias.com/0104/mexico/incendios-son-por-sequia-no-por-malas-intenciones-de-desarrolladores-amlo/\">https://aristeguinoticias.com/0104/mexico/incendios-son-por-sequia-no-por-malas-intenciones-de-desarrolladores-amlo/</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-MXND10009654171201640097525876100012</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MXND-10009654</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BPD-94J1-JCMN-Y2BK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567764</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"646\"/><timeReceived>11:43 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

As the overnight freezes have subsided, mushrooms have been sprouting from the wet soil in darkened forests, blooming mountainsides and everywhere between.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And with them, the treasure hunt has begun.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are a lot of motivations for the recreational mushroom hunter. Some home chefs seek strange ingredients that cannot be found in a grocery store, or just don't want to pay a small fortune for the available species. For many others, like Tom Sahlberg, a Spokane-area resident, mushrooms simply add another layer of joy to their existing love for the great outdoors.</p><p>\"I'm hiking with a purpose,\" he said. \"Even if I don't find what I'm looking for, I spend an amazing day in nature. But when I can find something that I don't know, but learn about?\"</p><p>That's what it's all about, Sahlberg said. He's already been on the hunt for over 25 hours this season, with expeditions ranging from Mica Peak to Kettle Falls.</p><p>He's proud of his hauls, including the several pounds collected from a recent successful morel hunt. But it's his expanding understanding of the species since he began mushroom hunting at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic that he seems proudest of.</p><p>Like many avid foragers, Sahlberg was introduced by a friend with more experience. They had gone out in search of morels, and if that was the metric of their trip, it was a failure. But every morel-less search bore other fruits - namely, Sahlberg's own curiosity at the other species he had surely come across along the hikes of years past but had never considered so closely.</p><p>\"First year, I knew probably five to 10 species, last year I learned another 10-15, and I've foraged and eaten three new ones this year,\" he said.</p><p>Sahlberg's favorite find is the chicken of the woods, an orange and yellow meaty fungus that helps to decay trees and is often abundant when found, though it can be sometimes confused with species like the Jack-o'-lantern mushroom, which, while unlikely to be lethal, can cause very unpleasant symptoms when eaten.</p><p>For many, sharing that knowledge with others is a key source of the hobby's joy. Spokane resident Ginny Abdallah grew up eating the random vegetation and mushrooms found in the woods near her childhood home - perhaps a bit carelessly, she jokes now - and cherishes teaching the next generation about the various species that dot the region.</p><p>It's not just her own children that she gets to educate, either; she also leads educational field trips into the woods for the local alternative schooling Garfield APPLE program.</p><p>\"I think that they get a greater appreciation for the things that surround us on the outside, as opposed to what's around us in our house, and also knowing things the other kids don't know,\" Abdallah said. \"They learn a lot about safety, too.\"</p><p>Abdallah, who forages much more than mushrooms, also finds it empowering to know that she could feed her family if the world around her broke down. While unlikely, for the horror-loving forager who has appeared over a dozen times as an extra playing a zombie on the TV series Z Nation, it can simply be fun to indulge in a post-apocalyptic fantasy and feel she'd be able to care for her family even in the end times, she said.</p><p>The mushroom community can be a tight-knit but occasionally cantankerous group of people, sometimes squabbling about the particulars of mushroom hunting decorum and best practices. A well-known debate that has largely died out in recent years, for instance, entailed whether a forager should pull a mushroom out of the ground or cut it at the base, arguing that one or the other could harm the health of the underground mycelium system.</p><p>\"I've seen a lot of urban myths surrounding mushrooms, but the biggest one is cut vs. pull,\" Sahlberg said. \"The truth is, anything that is not the mycelium base is the fruit of the larger network - just like you could pick an apple with the stem or not, it's not going to affect how that apple tree produces next year.\"</p><p>There is one rule universally agreed upon, however: do not eat something without absolute certainty about what mushroom is being eaten. Newcomers to the hobby are encouraged to go with a well-versed friend, or even better, with a trained guide.</p><p>Some coveted species, like the morel, are distinct enough to have relatively few lookalikes, but even they can be confused by the uninitiated with the more brainlike and globular Gyromitra, which can be dangerous if improperly handled. Others, such as the almond-scented prince Agaricus, can be more easily confused with deadly poisonous species of Amanita, which beardiscomforting names like death cap and destroying angel.</p><p>Many of the most dangerous species are not known to appear in the immediate vicinity around Spokane but can be found in Western Washington and other parts of the country.</p><p>\"You don't want to pick a lookalike, although we're lucky (in this region) that you're probably not going to find anything deadly,\" Abdallah said. \"There's Amanita pantherinoides, those can make you 'trip' and poop, but you're likely not going to find anything that can kill you.\"</p><p>Even once a mushroom has been well-identified, people should exercise caution when eating a species, particularly for the first time. Very few mushrooms can be safely eaten raw, and many others need to be very thoroughly cooked or undergo even more complicated processing to be edible. People sometimes are allergic to particular species, as well.</p><p>The recent story of Peter Dayton, a Missoula man and experienced forager, is forefront on the minds of many foragers this season. At 69, he died in April after eating morels, which he had been foraging and consuming for years without issue. Some questions remain about what specifically killed Dayton, but a prevailing concern is that they may not have been fully cooked.</p><p>The mushroom hunting season is largely split in two, with distinct spring and fall crops. For most prized species, the summer sun is too harsh and the ground too dry for much to grow outside of hidden well-shaded mountain glades and creekside ravines. Winter snow and freezing nights spell the end of most species' season, with a few exceptions, such as the woody shelf mushrooms that often grow on rotting logs whether fallen or still-standing. They usually make poor dinners but are sometimes prized for various medicinal qualities.</p><p>A mushroom's season can also vary drastically based on geography and elevation. A mushroom that appears during a sunny California March may not appear in a Washington mountainside until May, for instance, where winter lingers longer and the height of summer is delayed. Covetous mushroom hunters may be guarded with their treasured mushroom patches, wary of revealing locations or directions that are too specific, but will commonly share the elevation and general region of their finds, clues that the right conditions have arrived for a particular variety.</p><p>Chanterelles are among the best-known fall foragables, a typically golden, trumpet-shaped mushroom prized by foragers and chefs alike. Of the five states that have named an official state mushroom, Oregon and California claim a species of chanterelle.</p><p>Washington is yet to name a state mushroom, though the state Legislature has previously considered adopting another fall variety: the pine mushroom or matsutake, a large but shy species that can be found hiding under the mountain duff beneath the trees. Prized in Japan as a delicacy, the matsutake is typically positively identified by its distinct smell, infamously described by famous mycologist David Arora as a blend of Red Hots and gym socks.</p><p>Some kinds of mushrooms seem to straddle the seasons. The stately porcinis, which can grow as large as a child's head and are topped with a cap often compared to a deep brown brioche bun, are mostly found during the fall, for instance, but a variety recently determined to be a distinct species, colloquially called the spring king, can be found nestled beneath pines much earlier in the year. The species more commonly found in the fall was named Utah's state mushroom last year.</p><p>Spring's poster child may be the odd honeycomb-shaped morel, with its pitted and hollow cap. Like with chanterelles and porcinis, morels are an umbrella term for a variety of species, the exact boundaries between which are still being explored, and it is not unusual to find black and blond varieties interspersed during a hunt, with the occasional gray and fuzzy specimen hiding among its frequently larger cousins.</p><p>While it is Minnesota alone that has claimed a species of morel as its state mushroom, varieties can be found across North America, Europe, Asia and beyond. The morel can be found in rich soil in forests and particularly near creeks, but it is also one of the strange species that can proliferate in areas devastated by a forest fire, such as last year's Oregon Road fire that ripped through communities around Elk.</p><p>Hunting for morels during the spring following a forest fire can be a contradictory experience, unnerving and oddly hopeful. Morel flushes are most common in the areas where a fire burned fiercest, so hot that not only the trees burn but their roots as well, leaving holes in the blackened dirt</p><p>Unlike the isolated fires deep in mountains and surrounded by state or national forests, wandering through areas where a fire ripped through a populated area the previous summer can be tricky, as a forager needs to be especially cognizant of what land is private and where they're allowed to wander. But more pressingly, it is a deeply somber experience. The Oregon Road firekilled one person and destroyed hundreds of homes, and it can be difficult to justify a jovial outing in a scarred landscape where so much devastation occurred.</p><p>But the morels that emerge from the soot and ash are a harbinger of life returning to a deadened place, as are the miniscule cup fungus dotting the ground and the vivid fireweed blooms.</p><p>With this weekend's rainy forecast, next week's harvest will likely be bountiful.</p><p>There are relatively few areas in the Oregon Road fire's footprint open to public access, with a scattering of publicly owned lands without public access and most properties under private ownership. Foragers should be cautious that they have received the proper permits or permission to enter a property.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPOKSR-43272058</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPOKSR2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C39-RJP1-JC0C-J0MM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">157554</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1775\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Spokane Spokesman-Review</copyright><publicationName>Spokesman Review (Spokane, WA)</publicationName><edition>MAIN Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"05\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>May 19, 2024 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Education Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Field Trips</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzA1OEE0MjNCMjgyNEEwNTkwNkYwMDAwOUQ4QzMyQ0Q7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTNDOTREN0QwMTQwNDJCMkJGODMxOUY2QUIyNzI2QTE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001183</classCode><className>MUSHROOMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CEAJ</classCode><className>HIKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001501</classCode><className>RIVERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DL5G</classCode><className>HOBBIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX000394</classCode><className>COOKING &amp; ENTERTAINING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>STX002064</classCode><className>EPIDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>ST000DOXW</classCode><className>PANDEMICS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST000D1LG</classCode><className>SPOKANE, WA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS163</classCode><className>WASHINGTON, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

It concludes that last year's fire season was the second worst in the EU territory in terms of burnt area (since records began in 2006), after 2017 when over 10,000 km(2) had burnt. More than 5,500 km(2) of land burnt in 2021 - more than twice the size of Luxembourg - with over 1,000 km(2) burnt within protected Natura 2000 areas, the EU's reservoir of biodiversity.</p><p>The report does not yet cover this year's fires, which have been even more destructive than the ones in 2021. The annual reports allow having past fire seasons as a reference when analysing preliminary data on the impact of wildfires in the current year. With this perspective, 2022 is looking even worse, confirming the worrying destructive trend of recent years. In fact, an area covering 8,600 km(2) already burnt this year. This is one of the largest area scorched by wildfires in Europe by the end of October, setting new burnt records in nine EU countries. In total, since the worst fire season on records in 2017, 35,340 km(2) - an area larger than Belgium - have been scorched by wildfires. About 35% of the total area burnt, more than 11,600 km(2), was in the Natura 2000 network area.</p><p>Although the area burnt by wildfires has been remarkably extensive in 2022, the number of human casualties has been contained thanks to prevention measures implemented by EU Member States and the EU Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM). In 2021, the EU further strengthened this mechanism's capacity by increasing aerial firefighting means to assist countries during that fire season. This support was extensively used during the fires that hit the Mediterranean region in 2021 and in 2022. This stronger capacity is coordinated by the Emergency Response Coordination Centre of the European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Office. The Joint Research Centre offers support by providing timely information on fires in progress, helping to deploy EU-funded aerial means where they are most needed.</p><p>Key findings of the report</p><p>In 2021, fires were mapped in 22 of the EU27 Member States, burning 500,566 hectares (ha) in total, more than the approximate 340,000 ha of 2020 but far from 1 million ha of 2017;</p><p>The 2021 report on forest fires shows that Italy was the most affected country in terms of burnt area, followed by Turkiye, Portugal and Greece, especially in August, as highlighted by national reporting;</p><p>Wildfires severely affected Europe's Natura 2000 protected sites: the total area burned in 2021 was 102,598 ha (about 20% of the total area of all Natura 2000 sites), less than the last two years and slightly below the average of the last 10 years;</p><p>In 2021, Italy accounted for almost a quarter of the total area burned within Natura 2000 sites, followed closely by Spain, which together accounted for 45% of the total area;</p><p>In southern EU countries with longer recording periods, burnt areas doubled compared to 2020 and it was the second worst year since 1986 in terms of average fires size. The total number of fires was the lowest recorded, meaning that there were far fewer but larger fires;</p><p>The EU Civil Protection Mechanism was upgraded with rescEU in 2019, further strengthening its capacity to assist countries during this fire season in 2021 and further extended in 2022 for the 2023 fire campaign.</p><p>This year alone, the EU Civil Protection Mechanism was activated 11 times by six countries requesting planes, helicopters and firefighters: it is the second year with more requests to the UCPM over the last decade.</p><p>Background</p><p>The Joint Research Centre supports the work of the Commission's Emergency Response Coordination Centre through the development of decision support systems that provide an insight and forecast for all the ongoing fires in the EU, allowing for informed allocation and distribution of RescEU firefighting means across EuropIn close collaboration with the Expert Group on Forest Fires (EGFF), EFFIS provides continuous monitoring from satellites of the fire situation in Europe and the Mediterranean area. EFFIS has been used by government organisations and citizens, with over 414,000 users from 197 countries in 2021. EFFIS is also complemented by the Global Wildfire Information System (GWIS), which extends monitoring to the entire globe.</p><p>The JRC forest fire reports provide harmonised information and assessment of forest fires' effects in the pan-European region. They give detailed information on the actions taken in the countries as regards wildfire prevention, preparedness and firefighting, while addressing adaptation measures to mitigate wildfire effects. Forest fires reports are published regularly in October of the year following the fire season finally assessed, preceded by an advance report in March. The final forest fire reports include information gathered at national level, shared during the year with the JRC for data comparison and comprehensive final overview of the fire season in Europe, Middle East and North Africa. The 2021 edition is the result of a successful collaboration between the European Commission services and fire management agencies in 34 countries.</p><p>At policy level, the EU is continuing to work on measures to mitigate the unavoidable impact of wildfires, publishing the EU Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change in March 2021. The European Green Deal includes an ambitious agenda on sustainable climate change adaptation and in March 2021, the Commission adopted the EU Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change, which underlines that adaptation needs to become faster, smarter and more systemic. The EU Forest Strategy for 2030, published in July 2021, is also setting the basis for increased fire prevention and climate resilience of forests, building on the guidelines for prevention of wildfires that call for managing vegetation and avoiding the accumulation of fuels on the ground to facilitate firefighting. The Nature Restoration Law proposal that the Commission presented just before the summer is a key tool for adaptation and mitigation efforts as nature lessens the impact of natural disasters such as floods, droughts and heat waves.</p><p>* * *</p><p>For More Information</p><p>Report Forest Fires in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa 2021 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/publications/forest-fires-europe-middle-east-and-north-africa-2021_en\">https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/publications/forest-fires-europe-middle-east-and-north-africa-2021_en</url>)</p><p>European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) (<url normalizedValue=\"https://effis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\">https://effis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/</url>)</p><p>Global Wildfire Information System (GWIS) (<url normalizedValue=\"https://gwis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\">https://gwis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/</url>)</p><p>EU Copernicus program (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.copernicus.eu/en\">https://www.copernicus.eu/en</url>)</p><p>Expert Group on Forest Fires (EGFF) (<url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/expert-groups-register/screen/expert-groups/consult?lang=en&amp;do=groupDetail.groupDetail&amp;groupID=416\">https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/expert-groups-register/screen/expert-groups/consult?lang=en&amp;do=groupDetail.groupDetail&amp;groupID=416</url>)</p><p>* * *</p><p>REPORT: <url normalizedValue=\"https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/document/download/482c07e7-3595-42f5-82cd-dfe627ec24ff_en?filename=Forest_Fires_Annual_report_2021_online.pdf\">https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/document/download/482c07e7-3595-42f5-82cd-dfe627ec24ff_en?filename=Forest_Fires_Annual_report_2021_online.pdf</url></p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_6465\">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_6465</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>null-7986652 T40-MgEditor</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7986652</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66S1-1J81-DYG2-R0W2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1202\"/><timeReceived>8:30 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"11\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>November 1, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

That said, the Camden County Office of Emergency Management has been monitoring the situation in Medford Township through their peers in Burlington County and the New Jersey Forest Fire Service. The last report we received is what started out as a brush fire has grown into a working wildfire encompassing about 180 acres. Our latest report was that the fire was approximately 60% contained now and the fire service was making good progress. Nevertheless, the fire is not physically near our county, but the wind has carried some of the smell and ash our way.</p><p>That said, tonight, depending on the force and trajectory of the wind, residents may continue to smell more smoke during the shifting atmospheric conditions. Based on that, know that the source of the forest fire is far away, and that Camden County is not under any threat. We will continue to monitor this situation and brief the public if more pertinent information is relayed back to us from our partners.

(Nasdaq: RKLB) (\"Rocket Lab\" or \"the Company\"), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today successfully launched its 50th Electron mission, deploying satellites for French Internet-of-Things (IoT) company Kin\u00e9is.

The mission was the first of five dedicated Electron launches for Kin\u00e9is, a company backed by private and public investors including the French government's space agency CNES (Centre National d'\u00c9tudes Spatiales) and CLS (Collecte Localisation Satellites), an international space-based solutions provider, to improve global IoT connectivity. The Kin\u00e9is constellation is designed to make it possible to connect and locate any connected object anywhere in the world, enabling data transmission to users in near-real time, at low bit rates and with very low energy consumption. By enabling internet connection to the Earth's most remote locations, Kin\u00e9is constellation can support forest fire detection, water resource management, infrastructure and energy network monitoring, transport and logistics tracking, and much more.</p><p>Rocket Lab founder and CEO Peter Beck said: \"When Electron lifted off the pad for the first time in 2017, we knew we'd unlocked a new era in spaceflight, one where small satellites got to call the shots for the first time with frequent, tailored and reliable access to orbit. Fifty launches later Electron is the most successful commercial small rocket globally. Making it to fifty launches faster than any commercially developed rocket in history is testament to the incredible team we have behind us. Today's precise, tailored mission for Kin\u00e9is is yet another demonstration of the value Electron continues to provide to the small sat community. Congratulations to our team and thank you to our customers and supporters for helping us continue to break records and set new industry standards.\"</p><p>Across 50 launches Rocket Lab has now deployed 190 satellites for a diverse range of customers and missions, including NASA missions to the Moon, the National Reconnaissance Office and Space Force missions supporting national security and defense, scientific research to combat climate change, and commercial constellations providing vital data and services to millions of people on Earth.</p><p>Launch images: <url normalizedValue=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fflic.kr%2Fs%2FaHBqjBujsx&amp;esheet=54084525&amp;newsitemid=20240620523437&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fflic.kr%2Fs%2FaHBqjBujsx&amp;index=1&amp;md5=defa8e4558a7602ede8ce4a32e59fc38\">https://flic.kr/s/aHBqjBujsx</url></p><p>Launch webcast: <url normalizedValue=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Flive%2FMYpQkHw9s1I%3Fsi%3DRj36QbF_lMQKghf2&amp;esheet=54084525&amp;newsitemid=20240620523437&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Flive%2FMYpQkHw9s1I%3Fsi%3DRj36QbF_lMQKghf2&amp;index=2&amp;md5=0de24ddbbd257fba861de2bf2e779f69\">https://www.youtube.com/live/MYpQkHw9s1I?si=Rj36QbF_lMQKghf2</url></p><p>+ About Rocket Lab</p><p>Founded in 2006, Rocket Lab is an end-to-end space company with an established track record of mission success.

Achieving the new standard will save thousands of lives each year. The EPA has been regulating levels of airborne particulate matter since 1971 and we've seen some striking changes over this time. First, the scientific evidence shows that health impacts occur at lower and lower levels, and thus the EPA has changed the level and form of the standards some half-dozen times. This trend will continue, but it's still a catch-up game and standards lag the science. For example, the World Health Organization has a guideline level for fine particulate matter of only 5 micrograms per cubic meter, almost twice as stringent as the EPA's new standard.</p><p>A second and related trend is the very significant advances in understanding the diverse impacts caused by exposure. Particulate matter not only causes cardiovascular and respiratory illness, but it also increases the risk of adverse birth outcomes, psychiatric disorders and Alzheimer's disease, to name a few. A third trend is even newer. As old so-called legacy pollution sources like coal-fired power plants are phased out and as forest fire smoke increases, the chemical composition of contributing sources and even the toxicity of this pollutant is shifting. The new standard is helpful, but it's not going to be the final word.</p><p>Any details on how long before this change might improve overall air quality?</p><p>The EPA lays out a schedule giving about eight years to reach the standardassuming that legal challenges don't upset the plan. While each area is different, the gradual phase-out of dirty fuels like coal, the introduction of electric vehicles and continuing replacement of older technologies with cleaner ones bode well for improved air quality. Also, emissions and new air permits in these areas will get more scrutiny and may be strengthened. However, a big wild card is how frequently and intensively wildfire smoke affects air quality. Last year had two dramatic episodes in July that can offset progress.</p><p>Could you describe how and why fine particulate matter is harmful to humans?</p><p>Particulate matter is anything solid or liquid that is airborne.The term fine is a bit of a misnomer. It means small, specifically less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, referring to what's called equivalent aerodynamic diameter. These are tiny particles, irregularly shaped and diverse in chemical composition. If the particle was a sphere, it would be about 25 times smaller than the diameter of human hair, and most airborne particles are much, much smaller. This size allows these particles to reach the deepest portion of the lung, get absorbed into blood and even cross the blood-brain barrier. These particles can cause many harmful effects that cause or worsen disease.</p><p>Do the detrimental health effects extend to plants, animals, water?</p><p>In ways, yes, but really there's no simple answer. Mammals including pets could be similarly affected as humans. Plants and water bodies certainly do experience effects from air pollution, including acidification and accumulation of toxics like PCBs and mercury, and most people are surprised to learn that levels of these chemicals in Great Lakes fish don't arise from industrial outfalls and rivers feeding into the lakes, but actually from air pollutants. However, the new standard was revised specifically to protect human health.</p><p>How do industries limit the amount of fine particulate matter they release into the air?</p><p>It's not just industry. We have shown major emissions from diesel engines that are used in heavy-duty vehicles, including trucks and construction equipment. Both industrial and these mobile sources can reduce their emissions by going electric, if we have a clean grid, and by using cleaner fuels, improved emission controls, increased efficiency and sometimes by changing manufacturing processes.</p><p>Does a change such as this potentially mean the air won't be as quickly affected by wildfires or other natural or man-made disasters that create air pollution, such as in 2023 when wildfires led to dangerously unhealthy air quality in the U.S. and Canada?</p><p>That's a key question and a key loophole in the regulatory system. All of the air quality planning, rules and permits in Michigan and elsewhere won't stop a wildfire. Forest management practices can help, but the EPA and the state haven't had much impact yet and there are obstacles. In Michigan, for example, about half the forest land is privately owned and most landowners do not participate in programs designed to lower fire risk, despite some incentives from the state.</p><p>Another issue affecting the clean air program is that the EPA allows states to discount forest fire plumes and smoke events, thus, they may not feed into the long-term average concentration that determines attainment with the air quality standard. This is a little technical, but what happens, for example, is that people in Detroit will be breathing air that's polluted by both industry and forest fires, but legally the area could still meet the clean air standard because the smoky days are considered \"exceptional events\" that do not feed into the regulatory determination. This has not happened yet for particulate matter but it has happened for other pollutants, specifically ozone last year. I believe that we need a more comprehensive approach to protect public health.</p><p>Anything individuals can do to improve air quality?</p><p>There's lots people can do to minimize their own exposure to particulate matter. Advocating for designated trucking routes, promoting stricter emission controls and even monitoring your own quality using low-cost sensors are positive actions. Lastly, I'll note that while the EPA standards apply outdoors, you can remove particulate matter quite effectively in your home, business or school using filters rated MERV 13 and up. Often, the default furnace filters are just sieves that don't remove the small particles. This is important since most of us are indoors most of the time.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126381507</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B9D-DHR1-JCBF-S02M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1171\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"02\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>February 10, 2024 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Our collective efforts to promote equitable economic growth and opportunity are rooted in a belief that democratic governance requires delivering tangible results for our people. Shared values anchor our commitment, including respect for democracy and the rule of law, diversity and inclusion, environmental and social protection, labor rights, and human rights.</p><p>At the inaugural Americas Partnership Summit on November 3, 2023, our leaders stated their intention to significantly strengthen our economic partnership through an enduring, high-level forum for deepening economic collaboration and integration that can take on the major global challenges of our time, from combatting the climate crisis to promoting greater social and economic opportunity. The leaders offered a roadmap to strengthen cooperation, integration, and innovation, asking foreign, trade, and finance ministers to focus on the following cross-cutting priorities:</p><p>Strengthening regional competitiveness and integration</p><p>Fostering shared prosperity and good governance</p><p>Building sustainable infrastructure</p><p>Protecting the climate and environment</p><p>Promoting healthy communities</p><p>High-Impact Cooperation on Priority Issues for Our People</p><p>Today, we report important progress in advancing our objectives by promoting inclusive entrepreneurship, clean hydrogen, respect for the rule of law and transparency, sustainable food production, digital workforce development, and civilian space cooperation.</p><p>To expand entrepreneurship opportunities and provide entrepreneurs access to capital, Canada, the United States, and Uruguay are co-leading an effort to train an inclusive, diverse cohort of entrepreneurs. The USAID CATALYZE Americas Partnership Accelerator has started training the first cohort of social impact entrepreneurs from four Americas Partnership countries. The Accelerate Women Entrepreneurs Program will soon begin training its first cohorts of women-led/owned small and medium sized enterprises from six countries. These accelerator programs are designed to support approximately 750 entrepreneurs in ten Americas Partnership countries over three years and steer some of those graduates toward an Angel Investor Network led by the Uruguay Innovation Hub in partnership with IDB Lab.</p><p>To expand access to opportunity in the digital economy, we plan to build upon the successful semiconductor workforce symposium held in January in Costa Rica with a second semiconductor symposium September 5-6 in Mexico to identify opportunities in the semiconductor supplier ecosystem. We plan to accelerate efforts to work together with Costa Ricas Center of Excellence to offer virtual regional courses in cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence, cloud computing, and other related digital areas. We seek to offer virtual digital skills and training region-wide to accelerator graduates and startups as part of the Angel Investor Network platform, under a joint entrepreneurship and digital workforce umbrella.</p><p>To advance our shared clean energy and decarbonization goals, the Americas Partnership clean hydrogen working group was established to promote clean hydrogen and derivatives in our respective countries and realize our hemisphere's potential as a leading region for investment in clean hydrogen and derivatives. Co-led by Chile, Uruguay, and the United States, the working group aims to help all countries assess the viability of clean hydrogen and derivatives in meeting their national clean energy and climate goals and where viable, through commercial development of projects. The working group launched a series of technical workshops focused on developing national policy, regulatory, and investment frameworks to support production and use of clean hydrogen and derivatives in which all partners benefit from the collective experiences of Americas Partnership members governments, independent experts, and private companies investing in clean hydrogen and derivatives projects in Americas Partnership countries and globally. By fostering the development and adoption of national strategies and roadmaps, the Americas Partnership is accelerating the development of clean hydrogen markets, value, and supply chains across the region. To support this aim, the working group is building upon the successful technical workshops by pursuing additional capacity building activities.</p><p>To strengthen the rule of law, transparency, and anti-corruption efforts, we are exchanging best practices and sharing information, most recently in a workshop hosted by the Dominican Republic, which showcased different models for fostering a culture of transparency and ethics in critical government functions. Between now and the Americas Partnership Summit of 2025, all partners plan, with technical assistance from sources such as the UNODC anti-corruption hubs, to convene stakeholders, including the private sector and civil society, to adopt and maintain measures for improved procurement practices and greater transparency in the same, consistent with their obligations under the UN Convention against Corruption and domestic law.</p><p>To strengthen food security and sustainable food production, experts gathered for workshops in Ecuador and Peru. With support from the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA), the Interamerican Development Bank (IDB) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), we defined a regional agenda on bioeconomy initiatives, smart agriculture, deforestation-free sustainable production, and food systems transformation. Going forward and with the assistance of IICA, we intend to create a digital platform on sustainable agriculture best practices, resources, and opportunities, to promote the technical development of value chains for a more sustainable agricultural industry. We also intend to work on digital tools for traceability like the use of georeferencing to promote deforestation-free production and in a new generation of public policies that strengthen the agricultural and food systems of the Americas, which is essential to improve economic opportunities in rural areas and food security.</p><p>We are also strengthening our cooperation on the peaceful civilian uses of space through a working group co-led by the United States and Chile. That includes demonstrating how space-based assets and data can be used to improve forest fire and water management and exploring the impact of satellites on night sky astronomical observations. Going forward, we are continuing to focus on practical, impactful, environmental, and societal applications of space technology through the realization of additional workshops on the application of space and a possible space conference in 2025.</p><p>Innovative Financing Solutions for Sustainable Infrastructure and Biodiversity</p><p>We applaud the work being done in the trade and finance tracks of the Americas Partnership to enhance competitiveness, strengthen trade facilitation, and accelerate cooperation on financing for sustainable infrastructure. We recognize the importance of the ongoing collaboration between the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and IDB Invest to accelerate cooperation on financing for sustainable infrastructure through the Americas Partnership Platform.</p><p>We welcome our continued partnership with the IDB providing innovative financing mechanisms to mobilize investments in natural capital and biodiversity that advance climate change objectives through the Fund for Nature and looking forward to announcing specific projects in the coming years.</p><p>Strengthening Value and Supply Chain Competitiveness and Resilience</p><p>We appreciate the expertise and assistance of the IDB as we work to develop and strengthen resilient, secure, sustainable value and supply chains. We value the IDB competitiveness studies on critical minerals, semiconductors, and medical supplies coordinated under the finance and trade tracks.</p><p>Sustained Stakeholder Engagement for Results</p><p>We have engaged with private sector, civil society, and labor organizations to inform our work and continue to identify opportunities for further engagement with these key stakeholders. In this regard, we look forward to exploring the possibility of undertaking business delegations to partner countries, in coordination with the trade track.</p><p>Expanding the Partnership Consistent with High Standards</p><p>We collectively intend to expand the Americas Partnership to prospective participants and endorse a process that upholds the highest standards anchored in the principles of the East Room Declaration. To advance inclusive economic prosperity in the Western Hemisphere, we have adopted a formal process for considering prospective participants. Any nation in the Western Hemisphere that wishes to join the partnership can be considered by submitting an expression of interest to the foreign ministers of the Americas Partnership.</p><p>2025 Summit</p><p>We look forward to the 2025 Americas Partnership Leaders' Summit in Costa Rica.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126642531</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CH7-7CJ1-JCBF-S02S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1598\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>July 17, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news reporting originating from St. Petersburg State University by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Data on the main properties of Histic Podzols in the pine forests of semi-hydromorphic landscapes in the middle taiga of the Komi Republic after forest fires are presented.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include President of The Russian Federation. <br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from St. Petersburg State University: \"A decrease in topsoil horizon thickness by more than 7.6 times, an increase in litter density by 6 times, and a decrease in litter stock by 4 times were observed in postfire soil. There was an increase in carbon content in the pyrogenic horizon (48%) and in the upper part of the podzolic horizon-from 0.49 at the control plot to 1.16% after the fire. The accumulation of all studied trace metals (Cu-from 2.5 to 6.8 mg x kg<sup>-1</sup>; Zn-from 35.7 to 127.4 mg x kg<sup>-1</sup>; Ni-from 2.2 to 8.1 mg x kg<sup>-1</sup>; Pb-from 1.4 to 28.3 mg x kg<sup>-1</sup>; Cd-from 0.3 to 1.1 mg x kg<sup>-1</sup>) in soils after wildfires was recorded. The effect of the fire can be traced to a depth of approximately 20-30 cm. A significant influence of the pyrogenic factor on the alpha and beta bacterial diversity was noted.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The bacterial response to a forest fire can be divided into an increased proportion of spore-forming and Gram-negative species with complex metabolism as well.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Wildfires' Effect on Soil Properties and Bacterial Biodiversity of Postpyrogenic Histic Podzols (Middle Taiga, Komi Republic).

Achieving the new standard will save thousands of lives each year. The EPA has been regulating levels of airborne particulate matter since 1971 and we've seen some striking changes over this time. First, the scientific evidence shows that health impacts occur at lower and lower levels, and thus the EPA has changed the level and form of the standards some half-dozen times. This trend will continue, but it's still a catch-up game and standards lag the science. For example, the World Health Organization has a guideline level for fine particulate matter of only 5 micrograms per cubic meter, almost twice as stringent as the EPA's new standard.</p><p>A second and related trend is the very significant advances in understanding the diverse impacts caused by exposure. Particulate matter not only causes cardiovascular and respiratory illness, but it also increases the risk of adverse birth outcomes, psychiatric disorders and Alzheimer's disease, to name a few. A third trend is even newer. As old so-called legacy pollution sources like coal-fired power plants are phased out and as forest fire smoke increases, the chemical composition of contributing sources and even the toxicity of this pollutant is shifting. The new standard is helpful, but it's not going to be the final word.</p><p>Any details on how long before this change might improve overall air quality?</p><p>The EPA lays out a schedule giving about eight years to reach the standard-assuming that legal challenges don't upset the plan. While each area is different, the gradual phase-out of dirty fuels like coal, the introduction of electric vehicles and continuing replacement of older technologies with cleaner ones bode well for improved air quality. Also, emissions and new air permits in these areas will get more scrutiny and may be strengthened. However, a big wild card is how frequently and intensively wildfire smoke affects air quality. Last year had two dramatic episodes in July that can offset progress.</p><p>Could you describe how and why fine particulate matter is harmful to humans?</p><p>Particulate matter is anything solid or liquid that is airborne.The term fine is a bit of a misnomer. It means small, specifically less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, referring to what's called equivalent aerodynamic diameter. These are tiny particles, irregularly shaped and diverse in chemical composition. If the particle was a sphere, it would be about 25 times smaller than the diameter of human hair, and most airborne particles are much, much smaller. This size allows these particles to reach the deepest portion of the lung, get absorbed into blood and even cross the blood-brain barrier. These particles can cause many harmful effects that cause or worsen disease.</p><p>Do the detrimental health effects extend to plants, animals, water?</p><p>In ways, yes, but really there's no simple answer. Mammals including pets could be similarly affected as humans. Plants and water bodies certainly do experience effects from air pollution, including acidification and accumulation of toxics like PCBs and mercury, and most people are surprised to learn that levels of these chemicals in Great Lakes fish don't arise from industrial outfalls and rivers feeding into the lakes, but actually from air pollutants. However, the new standard was revised specifically to protect human health.</p><p>How do industries limit the amount of fine particulate matter they release into the air?</p><p>It's not just industry. We have shown major emissions from diesel engines that are used in heavy-duty vehicles, including trucks and construction equipment. Both industrial and these mobile sources can reduce their emissions by going electric, if we have a clean grid, and by using cleaner fuels, improved emission controls, increased efficiency and sometimes by changing manufacturing processes.</p><p>Does a change such as this potentially mean the air won't be as quickly affected by wildfires or other natural or man-made disasters that create air pollution, such as in 2023 when wildfires led to dangerously unhealthy air quality in the U.S. and Canada?</p><p>That's a key question and a key loophole in the regulatory system. All of the air quality planning, rules and permits in Michigan and elsewhere won't stop a wildfire. Forest management practices can help, but the EPA and the state haven't had much impact yet and there are obstacles. In Michigan, for example, about half the forest land is privately owned and most landowners do not participate in programs designed to lower fire risk, despite some incentives from the state.</p><p>Another issue affecting the clean air program is that the EPA allows states to discount forest fire plumes and smoke events, thus, they may not feed into the long-term average concentration that determines attainment with the air quality standard. This is a little technical, but what happens, for example, is that people in Detroit will be breathing air that's polluted by both industry and forest fires, but legally the area could still meet the clean air standard because the smoky days are considered \"exceptional events\" that do not feed into the regulatory determination. This has not happened yet for particulate matter but it has happened for other pollutants, specifically ozone last year. I believe that we need a more comprehensive approach to protect public health.</p><p>Anything individuals can do to improve air quality?</p><p>There's lots people can do to minimize their own exposure to particulate matter. Advocating for designated trucking routes, promoting stricter emission controls and even monitoring your own quality using low-cost sensors are positive actions. Lastly, I'll note that while the EPA standards apply outdoors, you can remove particulate matter quite effectively in your home, business or school using filters rated MERV 13 and up. Often, the default furnace filters are just sieves that don't remove the small particles. This is important since most of us are indoors most of the time.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5720356</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B96-NN51-JBSN-303W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1160\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Michigan Independent: University of Michigan - Ann Arbor</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"02\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>February 9, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Ann Arbor</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>MI</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Business &amp;

European countries and Israel are placing their bets on AI's algorithmic capabilities as a potential solution to more effectively manage and combat the uncontrolled spread of wildfires during the summer.  </p><p><br/>Greece and Israel are collaborating on a joint AI-based initiative for the early detection of wildfires. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis recently held discussions with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Cyprus President Nikos Christodoulides, confirming that the three countries will unite their efforts to address this common issue. <br/>Wildfires have become an increasingly urgent problem in the Mediterranean region, and Greece has been particularly hard-hit this summer, resulting in the loss of entire forests and 20 lives. AI algorithms have the potential to enhance detection capabilities for authorities and firefighters, ultimately saving lives and preserving forests during the hottest months of the year. <br/>Mitsotakis said[1] Greece could serve as a testing ground for Israel's AI wildfire detection technology. The two countries are actively discussing specific AI solutions for practical deployment. Meanwhile, Netanyahu confirmed that the three leaders are intensifying their collaborative efforts to combat wildfires. Over the past two months, Israel and Cyprus have dispatched firefighting aircraft and crews to Greece to assist in addressing Europe's deadliest wildfire season to date. <br/>Mitsotakis also advocated for Israel's participation in Europe's collective effort against wildfires known as SAFERS[2], or Structured Approaches for Forest Fire Emergencies in Resilient Societies. SAFERS is an integrated platform that incorporates a \"forest fire decision support system.\" Various data sources, including satellite imagery, fire sensors, weather forecasts, and crowdsourced data, feed into AI algorithms. In return, these AI systems provide[3] valuable information to local authorities, enhancing preparedness for wildfire risks. <br/>The SAFERS project is expected to continue until 2024, with a total budget of \u20ac3.25 million. The European countries currently involved in this project include Italy, Greece, Finland, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and Spain. The ultimate aim of the project is to develop an effective AI-based wildfire control system that could potentially be expanded to cover the entire European territory. <br/>In addition to combating wildfires and enhancing the coordination of firefighting efforts, Greece, Israel, and Cyprus have engaged in discussions regarding the potential utilization of recently discovered natural gas reserves beneath the Mediterranean Sea. Netanyahu mentioned that a joint decision is anticipated within the next three to six months. Energy remains a central topic in the ongoing series of conversations among these three Mediterranean leaders. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/cyprus-israel-greece-wildfires-ai-8aa20b2136ad12a0637135049814d9fc\">https://apnews.com/article/cyprus-israel-greece-wildfires-ai-8aa20b2136ad12a0637135049814d9fc</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://safers-project.eu\">https://safers-project.eu</url>/ [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/58276/20230905/artificial-intelligence-detect-wildfires-greece-israel-develop-early-wildfire-detection.htm\">https://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/58276/20230905/artificial-intelligence-detect-wildfires-greece-israel-develop-early-wildfire-detection.htm</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techspot.com/news/100069-greece-israel-developing-ai-based-capabilities-early-wildfire.html\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TSPT133881169411443686725876100239</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSPT-133881</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6948-B3H1-F03R-N19B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567839</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"557\"/><timeReceived>7:20 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

According to news originating from Harbin, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"With the increasingly severe damage wreaked by forest fires, their scientific and effective prevention and control has attracted the attention of countries worldwide. The breakthrough of remote sensing technologies implemented in the monitoring of fire spread and early warning has become the development direction for their prevention and control. However, a single remote sensing data collection point cannot simultaneously meet the temporal and spatial resolution requirements of fire spread monitoring.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include University of Science And Technology of China; Fundamental Research Funds For The Central Universities. <br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Northeast Forestry University: \"This can significantly affect the efficiency and timeliness of fire spread monitoring. This article focuses on the mountain fires that occurred in Muli County, on 28 March 2020, and in Jingjiu Township on 30 March 2020, in Liangshan Prefecture, Sichuan Province, as its research objects. Multi-source satellite remote sensing image data from Planet, Sentinel-2, MODIS, GF-1, GF-4, and Landsat-8 were used for fire monitoring. The spread of the fire time series was effectively and quickly obtained using the remote sensing data at various times. Fireline information and fire severity were extracted based on the calculated differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR). This study collected the meteorological, terrain, combustibles, and human factors related to the fire. The random forest algorithm analyzed the collected data and identified the main factors, with their order of importance, that affected the spread of the two selected forest fires in Sichuan Province. Finally, the vegetation coverage before and after the fire was calculated, and the relationship between the vegetation coverage and the fire severity was analyzed. The results showed that the multi-source satellite remote sensing images can be utilized and implemented for time-evolving forest fires, enabling forest managers and firefighting agencies to plan improved firefighting actions in a timely manner and increase the effectiveness of firefighting strategies. For the forest fires in Sichuan Province studied here, the meteorological factors had the most significant impact on their spread compared with other forest fire factors. Among all variables, relative humidity was the most crucial factor affecting the spread of forest fires. The linear regression results showed that the vegetation coverage and dNBR were significantly correlated before and after the fire. The vegetation coverage recovery effects were different in the fire burned areas depending on fire severity. High vegetation recovery was associated with low-intensity burned areas.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"By combining the remote sensing data obtained by multi-source remote sensing satellites, accurate and macro dynamic monitoring and quantitative analysis of wildfires can be carried out. The study's results provide effective information on the fires in Sichuan Province and can be used as a technical reference for fire spread monitoring and analysis through remote sensing, enabling accelerated emergency responses.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Forest Fire Spread Monitoring and Vegetation Dynamics Detection Based on Multi-Source Remote Sensing Images.

The exact timing of each project will depend on weather, site conditions and available personnel.</p><p>Piles were created from thinning projects in nearly a dozen locations, including near Canjilon, El Rito (Rio Arriba County), Hopewell Lake, Las Trampas, Ojo Sarco, Red River, San Cristobal, Taos Ski Valley and Tres Piedras. A list and map of potential projects are available.</p><p>Fire managers are monitoring weather and conditions for opportunities to implement each pile burn project during the winter weather season. As potential opportunities arise, public information officers will make notifications.</p><p>What is Pile Burning?</p><p>Prescribed fires are planned operations that can either be understory burns or pile burns. Crews this fall implemented what are called understory burns in Valle Vidal, Canjilon and next to Vallecitos (Rio Arriba County). Prescribed fire was used to treat fallen pine needles, logs, small brush and other surface fuels under the forest canopy. The fire burns through a predetermined area, often in a mosaic pattern, leaving islands of untreated fuel. The end result resembles the effects a lightning-caused wildfire would have in a healthy, resilient forest.</p><p>*Rest of the document can be viewed at: (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/carson/news-events/?cid=FSEPRD1153708\">https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/carson/news-events/?cid=FSEPRD1153708</url>) For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:contentservices@htlive.com\">contentservices@htlive.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USFDNW-PR4622058</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USFDNW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69S0-BBP1-JDKC-R3FT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">282801</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"287\"/><timeReceived>10:24 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 HT Media Ltd.

In June, DCR deployed 11 firefighters to assist in fighting wildfires in Quebec, Canada, and in July, in partnership with DFG, the department deployed to the region another crew of 16 wildland firefighters that included two firefighters from DFG. Response efforts are now shifting to the western United States, with more than 80 large fires currently burning more than 534,000 acres in 14 states.</p><p>\"As these wildfires continue to rage on across the country, burning thousands of acres of forest to the ground, DCR and DFG firefighters have stepped up again to help our partners in need fight these devastating blazes,\" said DCR Commissioner Brian Arrigo. \"DCR is proud of our dedicated and hardworking firefighters who will be on the frontlines in the Northern Rocky Mountain region over the next two weeks, working to stop further destruction of our natural resources.\"</p><p>\"Changes in climate create warmer, drier conditions, leading to longer and more active fire seasons. Wildfires are negatively impacting public health, forest health, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity here in Massachusetts and throughout North America,\" said DFG Commissioner Tom O'Shea. \"We are extremely grateful to the dedicated staff from DCR and DFG who have volunteered for this important and difficult assignment.\"</p><p>The crew, which is also referred to as \"Type 2 Initial Attack Hand Crew,\" departed DCR's Bureau of Forestry and Fire Control headquarters in Carlisle early Thursday morning to head to Logan Airport, where they flew to Idaho Falls, and then drove to the 4,000-acre fire burning at Bowles Creek. The fire burning at Bowles Creek is approximately 27 miles south of Phillipsburg, Montana. Fuel conditions continue to dry in the western states as temperatures continuously run above average and recent precipitation has been minimal.</p><p>Crew members will engage in direct fire suppression, working on the fire line for about 14 days building fire breaks, securing fire perimeters, containing fires, and protecting structures. The crew will operate for an average of 14 to 16 hours a day while on assignment.</p><p>Thursday's deployment was in response to a request DCR Commissioner Brian Arrigo received this week from the Northeastern Interagency Coordination Center at the White Mountain National Forest in Campden, NH. Massachusetts was one of the original members of the Northeast Forest Fire Protection Commission, a compact comprised of the six New England states, New York, and four eastern Canadian provinces and provides international and interstate wildland fire mutual aid assistance.</p><p>Warmer temperatures, drier conditions due to years of prolonged droughts, and a lack of rain and snowfall, all caused by climate change, are fueling increased fire activity over the last several years, making the fire season last longer and its effects more severe. These conditions have made wildfires more extreme and active. Climate change also affects wildlife in forested areas, including an increase in insect activity which affects tree mortality and can create more fuel for fires to feed off. The increase in fire activity in the western U.S. is just the latest in an ongoing international wildfire issue across the globe this year. So far this year in Massachusetts, more than 847 wildfires have burned 1,500 acres. According to the National Interagency Fire Center, there are more than 10,600 wildland firefighters and support personnel assigned to fire incidents across the country.</p><p>DCR's Bureau of Forestry and Forest Fire Control has been partnering with the U.S. Forest Service and the Northeast Forest Fire Protection Commission since 1985 to fight fires in areas of the western and Rocky Mountain States, Alaska, Florida, Virginia, and Quebec.</p><p>All deployed wildland firefighters are federally certified for the work, having passed a 40-hour federal wildland firefighting class and physical fitness test. Through the mutual aid agreement of the compact, the requesting state or province pays all expenses of the out-of-state crews, including salary, transportation, lodging, and food.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126086065</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6900-WT71-JCBF-S31X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"804\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 18, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Just three survived.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The smokejumpers lost to the flames in the Gates of the Mountains Wild Area on Aug. 5, 1949 included two Kalispell natives, Henry Thol Jr. and William Hellman. A third man, Philip McVey, is buried in Ronan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The deadly fire didn't just scar the land, it also reshaped how wildland crews prepare for and battle wildfires.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Although young men died like squirrels in Mann Gulch, the Mann Gulch fire should not end there, smoke drifting away and leaving terror without consolation of explanation, and controversy without lasting settlement,\" wrote author Norman MacLean in his book detailing the event, \"Young Men and Fire.\" \"This is a catastrophe that ... might go on and become a story.\"</p><p>That story, and its principal players, have taken center stage again this year. Events marking the anniversary of the conflagration are occurring throughout the state. In Kalispell, Thol and Hellman will be honored on Aug. 8. The main honorary tribute in Helena is Aug. 5 at the Montana State Capitol building.</p><p>\"The Mann Gulch fire was a catalyst for the formalization of the training and some of the tools \u2014 the thinking tools \u2014 that firefighters use to address safety. It was a catalyst for fire research,\" said Carl Seielstad, fire and fuels manager and associate professor at the University of Montana's Fire Center.</p><p>Sparked by dry lightning, the fire started on a day with low humidity and temperatures in the high-90s. Wind shifts and fuel types quickly changed its behavior. At the bottom of the hill, the firefighters couldn't see what was happening.</p><p>When the team arrived, the flames covered between 50 and 60 acres. Most smokejumpers on the mission had never seen a fire that large.</p><p>By the time the fire was under control, it had burned 4,500 acres, between 7 and 8 square miles, and taken the effort of 450 men, MacLean wrote.</p><p>There are 10 standard firefighting orders that provide wildland crews with a set of best practices for fire response. Many stem from lessons learned at the Mann Gulch fire, according to Chiara Cipriano, Forest Service spokesperson.</p><p>Those include staying informed on fire weather conditions and knowing what the fire is doing, both tactics that could have saved lives 75 years ago. The weather on that August day saw perfect conditions for a fire.</p><p>\"You need this freakish alignment of like 20 things for a fire like Mann Gulch to happen,\" Seielstad said.</p><p>On Aug. 5, 1949 they aligned, he said.</p><p>The fire exploded due to a blowup, a concept that officials better understood after Mann Gulch. A blowup to a forest fire is something like a hurricane to an ocean storm, MacLean wrote in his book.</p><p>The suddenly expanding fire cut off the men's route to the Missouri River and forced them back uphill as it climbed fiercely behind them.</p><p>It was later estimated that the fire covered 3,000 acres in 10 minutes.</p><p>A Forest Service employee also died while investigating the fire.</p><p>Today, the Forest Service and other groups use lookouts and communication between ground teams \u2014 while constantly watching weather conditions \u2014 to determine if it is safe for firefighters to go on the attack.</p><p>As the smokejumper team fled, foreman Wag Dodge, one of the only survivors, lit his own fire ahead of Mann Gulch's flames. The first of its kind, it became known as an \"escape fire.\"</p><p>Dodge laid face down in the ashes of the fire he made as the Mann Gulch fire passed over him, breathing in the last of the oxygen found on the hot ground. Dodge called out for the other firefighters to join him. None of them did, likely because they didn't know what was happening.</p><p>The escape fire tactic was initially deemed controversial by some members of the public, including Kalispell smokejumper Henry Thol Jr.'s father, Henry Thol Sr.</p><p>Thol Sr., a retired Forest Service district ranger, believed Dodge's fire was responsible for the death of the other smokejumpers as they ran up the ridge.</p><p>His son, Thol Jr., was found closest to the top of Mann Gulch ridge after the fire, showing he made it farther to supposed safety than to the rest of his comrades.</p><p>The Forest Service ultimately cleared Dodge of responsibility and instead highlighted the escape fire for saving his life, and possibly saving more that day had a plan been communicated.</p><p>Dodge never performed another jump. He died of cancer in 1955.</p><p>Today, firefighting standard orders state that teams must identify escape routes and safety zones and then communicate clear instructions on escape plans before a fire attack starts, making sure everyone understands.</p><p>CHANGE TOOK time, Seielstad said. The publishing of MacLean's book had a big impact on elevating the Mann Gulch fire into something with more significance, he said.</p><p>The way agencies fight wildfires continues to adapt with additional failures and successes; the memories of those who lost their lives at Mann Gulch continue.</p><p>\"I think [this year] is a chance to reflect on the actual men themselves and just recognize the huge ripple effect that their lives had on this industry,\" Cipriano said. \"Safety always has to come first. The safety of people is huge.\"</p><p>Henry J. Thol, Jr. was born in 1930. The summer of 1949 was the second summer Thol worked with the Forest Service and his first as a smokejumper. He was 19 years old when he arrived at Mann Gulch.</p><p>Before the fire, Thol hoped to enroll at the University of Montana with his income as a smokejumper.</p><p>The smokejumper organization was just nine years old in 1949, a relatively new and dangerous job that was mostly staffed by young men, 10 of them military veterans.</p><p>Philip R. McVey, born in 1927, spent most of his childhood living along the Canadian border. A veteran, he joined the U.S. Navy for the last year of World War II before going to the University of Montana. The summer of 1949 was Philip's fifth season with the Forest Service, where he worked clearing trails, and his second season as a smokejumper.</p><p>He was 22 at the time of the Mann Gulch fire.</p><p>William J. Hellman was born in 1925. Second in command to Dodge, Hellman was a veteran of World War II, serving in the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps. Earlier in 1949, he was among an elite group of smokejumpers to perform a ceremonial jump onto the White House lawn.</p><p>Hellman made it to the ridge on Aug. 5 but succumbed to his injuries in a Helena hospital the following day. When the survivors found him, his pants and shoes had burnt off.</p><p>\"[Hellman's] burned flesh had a terrific odor. He was in severe pain but took his experience magnificently. [His] courage made men weep,\" said District Ranger John Jansson, who led the rescue team, according to McLean's book.</p><p>THE SWITCH to focusing on the human costs of firefighting was important to accurately learn how to effectively \u2014 and safely \u2014 fight fires, according to Seielstad.</p><p>\"We have a perception that we can control nature in ways that we can't, and I think these accidents remind us that we can't always,\" he said.</p><p>The Forest Service and the National Smokejumper Association will honor each of the men who died at grave sites across the country this week. The memorial tribute for Thol Jr. and Hellman at C.E. Conrad Memorial Cemetery in Kalispell will be held on Aug. 8 at 11 a.m. and 11:30 a.m., respectively. The memorial tribute for Philip McVey is on Aug. 10 at 2 p.m. at the Ronan Cemetery in Ronan.</p><p>Brass plates have been added to the gravestones in recent weeks, picturing smokejumper wings, a parachute, and highlighting the event that took their lives.</p><p>\"It is time to rededicate ourselves to the memory of these fine young men and the lesson they best taught us, that wildfires are, and always will be, dangerous and we must respect its potential to put a firefighter in harm's way,\" said Bob Sallee, who was one of three Mann Gulch fire survivors, at the 50th anniversary memorial. \"Life is precious\u2014 and for some very short.\"</p><p>Reporter Kate Heston can be reached at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:kheston@dailyinterlake.com\">kheston@dailyinterlake.com</email> or 758-4459.</p><p>An August 1949 photo shows the scope of the Mann Gulch fire near Helena, Mont., which took the lives of 12 smokejumpers and a forest ranger when a wall of flame raced up a steep hillside.

According to news reporting originating from Harbin, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"In this article, we propose a mathematical model for insect outbreaks coupled with wildfire disturbances and an optimization model for finding suitable wildfire frequencies.\" </p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Northeast Forestry University: \"We use a refined Holling II function as a model for the nonlinear response of fire frequency against trees and insects. The results show that for the tree-insect-wildfire model, there is a coexistence equilibrium in the system. Sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the effect of wildfire on trees in the optimization model. The results show that forest fires have a significant impact on the equilibrium mechanism of tree-insect coexistence. Numerical simulations suggest that in some areas of high fire intensity, there may be positive feedback between disturbances from wildfires and insect outbreaks.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The result is consistent with the present theory in this field.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Stability and Optimal Control of Tree-Insect Model under Forest Fire Disturbance.

The potential lawsuits were disclosed in an annual report filed by PacifiCorp's Iowa-based parent company, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, on Monday - two days after Buffett lamented the disappointing results at the conglomerate's utility division in his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. This new liability comes after the utility already agreed to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in lawsuits related to the fires. </p><p>In its annual report, Berkshire Hathaway Energy said the U.S. Justice Department told the company it is seeking $625 million in firefighting and cleanup costs related to the September 2020 Archie Creek and Susan Creek fires. Oregon's Justice Department said it is also seeking $109 million in damages related to those fires. In addition to that, the U.S. Forest Service has asked PacfiCorp to pay $356 million for firefighting costs and damages related to the Slater Fire that started in California but also crossed over the border into Oregon. The fires were among the worst natural disasters in Oregon's history. They killed nine people, burned more than 1,875 square miles and destroyed upward of 5,000 homes and other structures. The Oregon lawsuits say PacifiCorp negligently failed to shut off power to its 600,000 customers during a windstorm over Labor Day weekend in 2020, despite warnings from state leaders and top fire officials, and that its power lines caused multiple blazes. Representatives of PacifiCorp and Berkshire Hathaway Energy declined to comment about the new liabilities. The Justice Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the potential lawsuits. Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire estimates that its utilities face at least $8 billion in claims across all the wildfire lawsuits already filed in Oregon and California although the damages could be doubled or even tripled in some of those cases and some of the lawsuits don't list a dollar amount. Those costs, combined with the uncertain regulatory environment in western states where wildfires have become more prevalent, are making it harder for utilities like PacifiCorp to decide when it makes sense to invest in major new power plants and transmission lines. \"It will be many years until we know the final tally from BHE's (Berkshire Hathaway Energy's) forest-fire losses and can intelligently make decisions about the desirability of future investments in vulnerable western states,\" Buffett said in his letter. \"It remains to be seen whether the regulatory environment will change elsewhere.\" Buffett said that in extreme cases like with Pacific Gas and Electric in California or Hawaiian Electric utilities could face bankruptcy and the country may have to decide whether to turn to public power if private investors are no longer willing to take the risks associated with the utility business.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-0000018deb3bd5b2adddfffbaef20000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BN1-KH31-DY7N-F009-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"521\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"02\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>February 27, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Later that day, a large forest fire along the Klutina River was reported near that area.</p><p>The government alleges McDonald started the fire despite knowing there was a high fire danger at the time. Investigators determined the fire started when he failed to properly extinguish the camp fire, according to the statement.</p><p>Messages were sent to three email accounts and a voicemail was left at one phone number, all believed to belong to McDonald.</p><p>Stephanie Holcomb, who owns the guiding service, told The Associated Press in a phone interview that it\u2019s not certain that others may be to blame, but in a civil case, the preponderance of evidence favors the plaintiff, in this case the government.</p><p>\u201cEven in the settlement report, one of the last sentences was it cannot be substantiated that there wasn\u2019t other users at the site after Josh, so that\u2019s why I say life isn\u2019t always fair,\" Holcomb said. \u201cI\u2019m more than willing to take responsibility and to face this, but it\u2019s only a 51% chance \u2014 maybe, which seems like an awful lot of wiggle room to like really ruin someone\u2019s business.\"</p><p>A copy of the settlement was not available on the federal court online document site, and a request for a copy was made to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office.</p><p>The $900,000 will help cover the costs incurred by state and federal firefighters to extinguish the fire, which burned about 0.28 square miles (0.71 square kilometers).</p><p>\u201cAs we experience longer fire seasons and more extreme fire behavior, we will hold anyone who ignites wildland fires accountable for the costs of fires they cause,\u201d S. Lane Tucker, the U.S. Attorney for Alaska, said in the statement.</p><p>Escaped campfires like this one are the most common for human-caused wildfires on Bureau of Land Management-managed lands in Alaska, the federal agency said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-6d028bff641ec68e086c8d2bfdc1847120240124</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B5T-J2W1-DYMD-651G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304479</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"383\"/><timeReceived>10:36 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

Where will we find refuge? Where? How?\" <br/>Santa Juana is considered ground zero in the fires that have been burning for five days now. Ten of the fatalities happened in the town, five of them from just one family. <br/>It is home to about 13,000 people, including in adjacent farming estates set amid rolling hills. <br/>\"It is rough land, with difficult access,\" mayor Ana Albornoz said Saturday. <br/>\"Most of the homes were lost because we got no help. With help from the air we could have saved most of the houses, but this was not the case,\" said Hernandez. <br/>Parts of Santa Juana appeared as disaster zones: buildings in smoldering ruins, shells of vehicles baked into the scarred earth, all enveloped in a smokey, orange-tinted sky. <br/>Some of the areas burned in these fires are poor and isolated, and beset with violent clashes between Mapuche Indigenous people on one hand and the government, timber companies and private land owners on the other. <br/>Miguel Angel Henriquez, a 58-year-old farmer in Santa Juana, said he and his wife deliberated too long over whether to escape the approaching flames and are lucky to be alive. <br/>\"We waited until the end, but the fire cut us off on all sides,\" he said. <br/>They went back in the direction from which they had started and ran into firefighters, neighbors and police. <br/>\"As the fire approached I told them, 'either we get out of here now or we die right here.' We hid behind the firetruck.\" <br/>Henriquez recalls seeing a neighbor brave the flames to try and rescue some of his animals. \"He did not come out. I yelled at him to come out of the fire, but he didn't listen.\" <br/>The home of Carmen Cuevas, 49, escaped all damage, so she went out in a pickup truck to distribute water and other relief supplies to hard hit neighbors. <br/>\"This hurts all of us. It is a shame to see all of this reduced to ash,\" she said. <br/>Other towns were also heavily damaged in the fires, such as Puren in the Araucania region. The stories of total loss come one after another. <br/>A Mapuche man named Jose Ankalao said 70 percent of his village in an ancestral area called Wallmapu was destroyed, including land he inherited from his great-great-grandfather. <br/>\"This is such a huge tragedy. I don't know if people can comprehend what is happening,\" he tweeted. <br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ibtimes.com/chileans-who-survived-deadly-forest-fire-fear-flames-will-return-3664652?utm_source=newstex&amp;utm_medium=Feed&amp;utm_campaign=_content\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767167565244505225876100230</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67GM-RT71-JCMN-Y0DH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484255</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"460\"/><timeReceived>3:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"02\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>February 6, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>World</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>Tax Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>Corporations Engaged in Farming</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0I4QkEzOTVFOEMwNDBCMThDRDgyMkM5MzAzQUQ0RDg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjU1QUYzRTdGNkU2NDkwMkE4MjM2MzI1Q0MwNDM1Njg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N624230GC</classCode><className>DISASTER RELIEF</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001473</classCode><className>RESCUE OPERATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N113110CC</classCode><className>TIMBER TRACT OPERATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001949</classCode><className>LAND USE &amp; DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DMKX</classCode><className>BUSINESS REPORTS &amp; FORECASTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001463</classCode><className>RELIEF ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp; DYING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0008X7K</classCode><className>INDIGENOUS PEOPLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DRMO</classCode><className>SOCIAL WORK</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N113110CC</classCode><className>TIMBER TRACT OPERATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N113300CC</classCode><className>LOGGING INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX001174</classCode><className>MOTOR VEHICLES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC340</classCode><className>CHILE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Investigators determined the fire started when he failed to properly extinguish the camp fire, according to the statement.</p><p>Messages were sent to three email accounts and a voicemail was left at one phone number, all believed to belong to McDonald.</p><p>Stephanie Holcomb, who owns the guiding service, told The Associated Press in a phone interview that it\u2019s not certain that others may be to blame, but in a civil case, the preponderance of evidence favors the plaintiff, in this case the government.</p><p>\u201cEven in the settlement report, one of the last sentences was it cannot be substantiated that there wasn\u2019t other users at the site after Josh, so that\u2019s why I say life isn\u2019t always fair,\" Holcomb said. \u201cI\u2019m more than willing to take responsibility and to face this, but it\u2019s only a 51% chance \u2014 maybe, which seems like an awful lot of wiggle room to like really ruin someone\u2019s business.\"</p><p>A copy of the settlement was not available on the federal court online document site, and a request for a copy was made to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office.</p><p>The $900,000 will help cover the costs incurred by state and federal firefighters to extinguish the fire, which burned about 0.28 square miles (0.71 square kilometers).</p><p>\u201cAs we experience longer fire seasons and more extreme fire behavior, we will hold anyone who ignites wildland fires accountable for the costs of fires they cause,\u201d S. Lane Tucker, the U.S. Attorney for Alaska, said in the statement.</p><p>Escaped campfires like this one are the most common for human-caused wildfires on Bureau of Land Management-managed lands in Alaska, the federal agency said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-6d028bff641ec68e086c8d2bfdc1847120240124</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B5T-J1H1-DYMD-6507-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"379\"/><timeReceived>10:36 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"01\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>January 24, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
