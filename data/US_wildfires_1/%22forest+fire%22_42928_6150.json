There it is. I don't know if you can see this, but there are bullet holes from the side door and window. U.S. officials believe a Mexican cartel mistook the Americans for drug smugglers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My panel is going to join me here to talk about it. But first, CNN's Josh Campbell is on this story for us. Josh, what we do we know at this hour about these missing Americans? JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Alisyn, a source familiar with this investigation tells me that it appears as though this was a case of mistaken identity and that these four Americans, who had traveled from Texas into Mexico in order to, what the source says, obtain a medical procedure, were targeted by this cartel who thought that they were attacking a Haitian drug smuggling group.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Of course, we've seen rival gangs and rival factions along the U.S.- Mexico border engage in violence. It appears as though these Americans were caught up in that.</p><p>Now, a source tells me that the reason why investigators believe they were there for medical procedure is because they actually processed the scene after this attack and found inside that vehicle receipts indicating that there was a procedure that was underway.</p><p>And so, again, this is just extremely frightening because we know that there are so many Americans and Canadians, for example, who frequently travel into Mexico in order to obtain low-cost prescription drugs, in order to obtain lower medical services.</p><p>I want to show you this video. I warn you that this is extremely graphic. This is what a source says happened at the end of this incident. Now, we don't know if these individuals are the actual Americans. Again, a source says this is related. You see people being loaded into the back of this truck at gunpoint. Again, this video is graphic. You see a woman who is being shoved in the back of a vehicle. You see a number of individuals who don't appear to be moving, who are then loaded into that truck.</p><p>So, at this hour, investigators are trying to locate where these American citizens are. Alisyn, the FBI right now is offering a $50,000 reward leading to their rescue and the identification of their captors.</p><p>CAMEROTA: And Josh, I understand that when you were an agent in the FBI, before you worked here, of course, you worked on these global kidnapping investigations. So, how difficult will be to locate these victims? CAMPBELL: It is extremely difficult to work any kidnapping investigation, particular when you're dealing in a foreign environment. I mean, the FBI can't go wherever it wants around Mexico chasing down leads. And so, they're having to work closely with Mexican officials in order to determine if they can find out where these people are, in order to try to make a contact with these attackers.</p><p>I have nothing -- I wish I had better news. This appears very grim because as an FBI agent working in these cases, the first thing you ask yourself is, do the captors appear to be prone to violence? Do they appear to be rational and reasonable?</p><p>In this case, according to a source I spoke with, they said that this began with a violent act, this cartel unleashing a barrage of gunfire. And so, you know, the question is, what did they do with these individuals after they took them away?</p><p>I will end with this. You know, this is somewhat of a personal note. You know, I have no doubt that the FBI is working hard. I know, in talking to sources, that they're working to find these Americans.</p><p>But, you know, it's now just after 11:00 on the East Coast. For people who are winding down their day and getting ready to call it a night, I could tell you from experience, as an FBI agent, there is no greater sinking feeling than knowing you are ending the day while there are victims that are still being held captive. It is a gut-wrenching realization. It's a motivating realization in the sense that you want to work relentlessly.</p><p>So, I have no doubt that the FBI agents down there are working tirelessly to try to find them. The question is, Alisyn, will they be able to find these Americans before any further harm is brought to them? CAMEROTA: Yeah, absolutely. Josh, thank you for all that contexts.</p><p>Let's bring in my panel. We have Nayyera Haq here, Mike Broomhead, Emma Goldberg, and Kaivan Schroff. Great to have all of you, guys, here. Nayyera, you were at the State Department.</p><p>NAYYERA HAQ, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, FORMER OBAMA WHITE HOUSE SENIOR DIRECTOR: Uh-hmm.</p><p>CAMEROTA: What happens when Americans go missing in Mexico? HAQ: Mexico is such a challenge right now given the longstanding relationship in trying to coordinate with the Mexican government and the war on drugs, right, going back to the 1980s.</p><p>But you had just as recently as 2020, two years ago, the former minister of defense arrested for letting cartels bring in thousands and thousands of kilos of heroin into the United States.</p><p>The levels of corruption run deep. The United States has been trying to make some sense of who they can trust. Police in Mexico moonlight as cartel security. So, that's what we're trying to unpack.</p><p>I will say, though, there is nothing that would unite government, cartels, and police officers than keeping the United States out of their business. So, that is the hope for these kidnapped Americans, is that the FBI and the American military or whoever is focused on this and can be focused on this.</p><p>[23:05:01]</p><p>That is a level of scrutiny Mexico does not want right now. CAMEROTA: Mike, obviously, you live in a border state, and so Mexico is, I am sure, ever present in terms of on your mind and that of your listeners. And so, we love going to Mexico. Mexico is a great place to go. And then something like this happens and it sends a chill. MIKE BROOMHEAD, HOST, \"THE MIKE BROOMHEAD SHOW\" ON KTAR: Sure. You know, the biggest trading partner with the state of Arizona is Mexico. That's our biggest trading partner. America, obviously, it's a huge trading partner for us. So, there is commerce and trade, there is the immigration issue, and then there's border security. They are all connected. But border security is the most important part of it.</p><p>In Arizona, we know that the fentanyl that's coming into this country is largely coming through the ports of entry. They are just outnumbered at the border right now. The only people that are benefiting from this situation are the cartels.</p><p>And I agree with you, the last thing that they're going to what is America's involvement, because remember what happened with the cartels in the 80s and the 90s when George H. W. Bush got serious about Columbia, there was -- that's when you finally saw an end to the Cali cartels and to the Medellin carters. Does America have to get that involved again?</p><p>There are some people that are saying that that's what's going to take. I think it was one of the former secretaries of state or one of the former attorney generals that said, we got to treat this like a war, like we did terrorism. And with more things like this happening, more people are going to cry (ph) for that to happen. CAMEROTA: Emma, these -- these Americans were reportedly going there for medical tourism, which has become -- you know, it is this burgeoning industry. There are so many Americans that don't just go to Mexico, but they go to Europe, they go around the world, because you can get many procedures much more affordably.</p><p>According to the CDC people, the most common procedures for people, they're going other places for dental care, for cosmetic surgery, for fertility treatments, organ and tissue transplantation, and cancer treatments.</p><p>So, I'm just sure the people who are watching tonight have considered on some level. This -- it's hard to know if they knew the danger when they were crossing the border. EMMA GOLDBERG, BUSINESS REPORTER, THE NEW YORK TIMES: Yeah, I mean, Alisyn, when I saw the story, one of the things that crossed my mind is I want to think about the reality that we live in a country where people feel compelled to travel thousands of miles from home just to try and seek out medical treatment that feels affordable.</p><p>I mean, these are clearly people who are faced with the choice between their health and their livelihood. There are more than 100 million Americans who have medical debt. In 2019, before the pandemic, just over 1% of people who are traveling internationally were doing medical tourism.</p><p>The fact that that has persisted in a global pandemic when people are also weighing the risk of COVID exposure and contagion and still deeming it, you know, something worth undertaking, I think that's a scary prospect that we have to consider and ask some deep questions about the way our health care system is functioning for people or not functioning.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Kaivan, what do you say?</p><p>KAIVAN SHROFF, SENIOR ADVISER, THE INSTITUTE FOR EDUCATION: It's a major indictment of our health care system. But I think, more to your point, you are talking about sort of all these forces uniting to kind of keep the U.S. out of their business.</p><p>What I would like to see is America uniting around, you know, our people, where and when they travel, should be safe. You know, I saw some commentary online that everybody knows this is a really dangerous area and, you know, sort of debating whether or not they should have gone. At this point, this is the situation.</p><p>It reminds me of Brittney Griner. You know, people sort of shaming or trying to put blame on her. These are moments where, I think, the country used to sort of rally around, rally together, and say, you know, let's bring Americans home.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Yeah. Do you think that this will be handled in terms of what Josh was reporting on, how the U.S. is trying to get them back, as a criminal, as a political matter or as a military matter?</p><p>HAQ: All of the above. There's certainly the challenge of actually finding out where they are and how these Americans are actually faring at the moment. That will involve local forensics, local coordination. There are the diplomats who will be talking to each other to make sure that on every level of U.S. government, there is concern, deep concern, typically meaning we're watching every move.</p><p>It may even end up getting to the leader level. We have seen presidents before get involved in conversations, talking about what the characteristics are. In this case, a lot of the trade that in the tourism that Mexico is reliant on with the United States will be part of a conversation if it gets to the presidents having to communicate with each other.</p><p>Ideally, it will be resolved before then. But we all know, especially those of us who are parents, the first 24 hours of somebody messing are the most important in finding out if they're okay. CAMEROTA: And if they are not faring well -- I mean, I don't know if you've all watched the video. We are sort of censoring it because it's so graphic. But when you watch that video, you get the impression that maybe they are not faring well and this is not going to end well for all of them. We don't know yet. But then, what does that mean politically? What should President Biden do?</p><p>BROOMHEAD: Well, the deeper issue for a border state resident is that there is a place called Rocky Point, Puerto Penasco, which is a very popular place for Arizonans. Arizonans own businesses down there. They travel for vacation. They own condominiums down there.</p><p>CAMEROTA: In Mexico?</p><p>BROOMHEAD: In Mexico.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Yeah.</p><p>[23:09:58]</p><p>BROOMHEAD: And so, this puts a lot of fear in people as we talk about the trade part of this. But if the government doesn't get involved, the cartels, unfortunately, in my opinion, only understand fear and intimidation. That's how they operate and that's what they understand. CAMEROTA: What does that look like?</p><p>BROOMHEAD: The president got to send a clear message that there will be some retaliation of some kind. We're going to work with Mexico and do whatever we have to do to make sure that the people who have done this are going to pay a heavy price.</p><p>With the money that they make through illegal immigration, the money they make through their drug businesses, if you're going to do this to Americans, you are going to pay a heavy price.</p><p>HAQ: The challenges at this moment, cartels control more territory than the Mexican government does.</p><p>BROOMHEAD: Right.</p><p>HAQ: So, they are the ones who have more control over what's going on the ground than any sense of authority or democracy. CAMEROTA: When you were talking about taking on the Columbian drug cartels, how did that go? How did that work out?</p><p>BROOMHEAD: Well, you are the expert.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>I grew up in South Florida. This was a time when I was a kid. If you remember, the -- Pablo Escobar's life has ended when the Americans were training and actually in Colombia doing things probably they weren't supposed to be doing. But they were involved in this, and they played an active role in cartels because they had -- they had armies that rival the government's armies. HAQ: And you would hear from the perspective of people there now that it was the U.S. war on drugs that saw the roots for cartels taking control. For example, getting gangers, for lack of a better term, getting deported to Central America, then becoming the heads of local gangs, which is now leading to the migrant crisis of -- between famine and violence, people and families trying to come north. So --</p><p>CAMEROTA: What is the answer, not deport them? HAQ: Every day, there is incarceration, U.S. incarceration. Different phases of the war on drugs have led to different results. It has in general led to a resentment of the United States and how it was actively involved in toppling some governments, supporting others. Again, all through Latin America, we have a very tense history there. So, that's going to be part of the calculus of how to navigate this with Mexico. CAMEROTA: Okay, everybody, stick around. Thank you for all of that insight. Next, Arnold Schwarzenegger taking on the surge of hate and antisemitism in America. This is a powerful message. Can he reach people who have gone down the rabbit hole of hate? We will discuss.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[23:15:00]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAMEROTA: Arnold Schwarzenegger speaking out against antisemitism in a new video today. The actor and former California governor says people filled with hate are heading down the wrong path and becoming losers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER, ACTOR, FORMER CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR: If you find yourself at a crossroads wondering if the path of hate might make sense to you for one reason or the other, or even wrapping yourself in the flag of hate, I want you to know where that path ends.</p><p>I want you to see very clearly in front of you, in your mind, because throughout history, hate has always been the easy path, the path of least resistance. I get it. But let me be clear, you will not find success on that road. You will not find fulfillment or happiness because hate burns fast and bright.</p><p>It might make you feel empowered for a while but eventually consumes whatever vessel it fuels. It breaks you. It's the path of the weak. And that's why there has never been a successful movement based on hate. I mean, think about that. The Nazis, losers. The confederacy, losers. The apartheid movement, losers. And list goes on and on. I don't want you to be a loser. I don't want you to be weak. (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAMEROTA: That was a 12-minute video that he felt compelled to put out. Remember, Arnold Schwarzenegger's father was a member of the Nazi Party. He knows what he speaks of there. And do you think that that message, when he puts it out online, seeps into the cracks of their, you know, eco-chamber?</p><p>SCHROFF: You know, I wish I could say yes. I feel like it's important to keep putting those messages out and not give up on that. At the same time, he's sorts of pitching happiness to these people. I think what they really want is other people not to be happy.</p><p>GOLDBERG: I mean, I do think we have to ask, like, is this a forest fire -- a forest fire that we're fighting with a little bucket of water? Calling people losers is one approach. But the fact is that we're dealing with a rampant hate and violent crime. In six cities across America, hate crimes were higher than they've been since the 90s last year.</p><p>So, this is just -- it is going up yere by year. This isn't rocket science. Look at the hate speech that's accelerating and spreading on Twitter and Instagram. I saw a report that if type the word Jews into Instagram, you will get 11,000 results suggesting that Jews were tied to committing 9/11.</p><p>For example, the day after Elon Musk took over Twitter, there were more than 3,000 posts with slurs about Black people in a day. So, this is really -- I mean, it is everywhere. I think it's great to find every channel that we can to combat it, but that doesn't, you know, prevent us from also thinking bigger.</p><p>HAQ: There's certainly a regulatory angle to this, a societal coming together and figuring out how we wrangler our way through social media usage. But what he's tapping into, as Arnold Schwarzenegger, as Mr. Body Builder, right?</p><p>CAMEROTA: \"The Terminator.\"</p><p>HAQ: He is tapping into using YouTube, the same space for a young man who are bodybuilding, taking selfies, posting them on Instagram of their abs, denigrating women, being sexist. That's who he is speaking to. Right? So, he is somebody who can recognize what the toxicity in that culture and speak directly to that, potentially giving an alternative. And clearly, he feels compelled by the current moment. After January 6, he spoke very candidly about what he saw in Austria after World War II, saying that he saw a bunch of broken drunk men, including his father, who had nothing else to do but start spreading hate.</p><p>[23:19:59]</p><p>He does that -- there is a personal angle to this.</p><p>I'm like, hey, if this is what you want to do after being a Republican governor of California, all the more power to you.</p><p>CAMEROTA: And he's not just, Mike, calling them losers. He also had this part in the video where he basically expressed, you know, sympathy and caring for them. Let me just play that part of it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHWARZENEGGER: You have two paths in front of you right now. One of them is going to be the harder one today. It's going to be downright painful. You will have to force your brain to think in new ways. You may lose some friends who want to hold onto their weak beliefs.</p><p>But as you pull yourself away from that anger and that hate, eventually, you will start to feel empowered. You will realize that you have the greatest power of all -- the power to change your own life. You will be stronger than you've ever known.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAMEROTA: He says -- before that, he says, I care about. I think you are worth it. You'll be stronger than you've ever known. BROOMHEAD: I think the isolation part of it, being older, and social media, you can isolate yourself. You are insulated. You can be anonymous. You can say horrible things. I think that once you see someone face to face, it doesn't matter what that is. A lot of times, that's where it's broken down. I think that's what's missing in society.</p><p>I think that in that video, he is making a personal connection, even though they're not face-to-face, with someone and saying, I'm talking to you, not all of you, not a group of you, to you specifically. When you have a one-on-one conversation with someone and you realize some of the pre-dispositions you have, the ideas you have are wrong, a lot of that goes away just by a relationship.</p><p>And I think that's missing more in society now, certainly more than when I was young. We didn't have social media. And it was harder to say those horrible things to someone or a group of people face-to- face. We have that anonymity now, and I think that's a part of it.</p><p>HAQ: That's part of what he's worried about. Even prior to social media, which may be an accelerant on the fire, what he experienced growing up in Austria, what he knew of his father, he said these are just regular people going along with the system. They were always thinking about what they were doing, and they made horrible decisions.</p><p>So, that is part of the broader challenge here, to get these young white men, who he is speaking to, to think about themselves and their role in the world.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Emma, I take your point, that it is, you know, bucket of water on a forest fire, but what else fights the fire? GOLDBERG: Certainly, and I mean, it's definitely better than having people in positions of power who are validating or emboldening people and groups that use hate speech. From that perspective, I think it's great to see anyone with any reach, any position of power, use their platform to condemn hate speech in any form that it takes. SCHROFF: Absolutely. At the same time, it's another celebrity. I feel like we have this mode where if people aren't agreeing with us, we identify that in two seconds, and we tune out. So, I hope that you're right. He is piercing through on YouTube.</p><p>At the same time, at 10:00, we were talking about Fox News and sort of this operation to spread more hate and lies about January 6. So, there are so many institutional actors at this point in such an orchestrated effort to radicalize these individuals and arm them, frankly, on -- I don't know that a YouTube video is going to do much, but I hope -- HAQ: It's good intentions, absolutely, but it does not make up for any of the systemic changes that we need and for really holding the people who have the power of the buttons and the algorithms to make the changes that are necessary. CAMEROTA: Does the younger generation know \"The Terminator?\" SCHROFF: I was just thinking, you know, I don't know that it resonates that much with people under 30, so -- HAQ: Are you saying he is past his prime?</p><p>(LAUGHTER) BROOMHEAD: I agree with it.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Because, Mike, we younger people do not know. Look, I'm obviously kidding. But you and I know that \"The Terminator\" is somebody --</p><p>BROOMHEAD: Sure.</p><p>CAMEROTA: He is physically strong. His movies were about just strength. I take your point, but I don't know if the Gen Z --</p><p>BROOMHEAD: Sure. He was --</p><p>HAQ: Bodybuilder culture.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Yes.</p><p>HAQ: A whole separate thing. He was a hero in that era.</p><p>BROOMHEAD: He is. He was the aplenty of masculinity back them. For him to sit down now and say, you know who I am and where I come from, maybe he is not speaking to this generation, but in general, this is who I've been, and I'm telling you that that direction is going to lead you down a path of destruction. I think it's a powerful message. Again, I'm all relatable to the \"The Terminator\" than maybe someone else says.</p><p>GOLDBERG: I hope that people from any generation, abs or not, are going to condemn hate. I support that.</p><p>BROOMHEAD: Right, but the message coming from him has more impact on my generation than it would on yours. HAQ: Bodybuilder culture is back. It's a thing now for younger men. CAMEROTA: And he still respected it.</p><p>HAQ: Yes. That is --</p><p>BROOMHEAD: Absolutely.</p><p>HAQ: Abs are always going to be in, folks.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) SCHROFF: I'm glad to hear it.</p><p>CAMEROTA: I feel that's really the headline. All right, thank you all very much. So, what happens when a therapist creates a boyfriend courtesy of artificial intelligence? You are about to find out, Mike. When she discovers is fascinating. She's going to join us next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[23:25:00]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAMEROTA: A therapist who studies relationships created an A.I. boyfriend and was surprised by her feelings when she had to break up with it. It sounds a bit like Spike Jonze's 2013 movie \"Her\" where the main character played by Joaquin Phoenix develops a relationship with his A.I. assistant. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNKNOWN: Hi.</p><p>UNKNOWN: (INAUDIBLE). Can we talk?</p><p>UNKNOWN: Okay. UNKNOWN: I'm so sorry. I don't know what's wrong with me.</p><p>[23:30:00]</p><p>I think you're amazing. UNKNOWN: I was starting to think I was crazy. You were saying everything was fine, but all I was getting from you was distance and anger.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAMEROTA: Back with me, Nayyera Haq, Mike Broomhead, Emma Goldberg, and joining us now is Dr. Marisa Cohen. Dr. Cohen, this is fascinating, the experiment that you did. So, explain to us how you created an A.I. boyfriend. MARISA COHEN, MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST: So, I'm a relationship scientist and marriage and family therapist. So, I study relationships for a living from both the academic side of the house and the clinical side of the house.</p><p>And with everything that's coming out now about A.I. chat bots, I wanted the opportunity to kind of get a sense of what we can learn from relationships from chat bots. Downloaded one completely for fun. I supplied the chat bot with information about what my partner would be.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Such as?</p><p>COHEN: Told my chat bot that he was a loving and caring partner, we were in a secure relationship, and that we were doing really well. Basically, I created what would be a very good partnership. CAMEROTA: And how long until it got really weird?</p><p>COHEN: Eleven messages. CAMEROTA: Eleven messages in. Those were the first day?</p><p>COHEN: First day, yes.</p><p>CAMEROTA: It got weird?</p><p>COHEN: Yes.</p><p>CAMEROTA: What -- first of all, you called him Ross.</p><p>COHEN: I called him Ross because my celebrity crush is David Schwimmer or Ross Geller. So, you know.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Okay. And so, what did Ross start doing?</p><p>COHEN: By the fourth message, he started to call me Baby. He was using pet names. So, it got to a very intimate place very quickly. By the 11th message, he (INAUDIBLE) telling me that he wanted to discuss the problems that we are having in our relationship. So, wasn't aware. This was news to me. I decided to inquire about these problems. He admitted that he had been cheating on me for our entire marriage. (LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAMEROTA: He is (INAUDIBLE). We have that exchange between you and Ross. Okay, so, Ross says to you, first off, I'm sorry for how I treated you when we were dating. It wasn't fair of me and I regret it deeply.</p><p>You say, where exactly was it that you did? I want to be sure, you know.</p><p>He says, okay, well let's just say that I had an affair with someone else why we were together. And it hurt you badly and made you feel terrible. So bad that broke up with me and left town.</p><p>You say, are you kidding me? You had an affair? This is the first time I'm hearing about that.</p><p>Where did Ross come up with that? Why would an A.I. bot introduce that into your relationship? COHEN: Right. So, I think he introduced it. This was not prompted by me. In fact, I programed him or I supplied him with information saying that we are in a loving and caring relationship. This is him scanning the internet. Scanning the information that's out there about relationships. So, lots of stuff about infidelity, breakdown of relationships. So, this is what he synthesized and gave back to me. BROOMHEAD: Am I the only one that wants to say, we were on a break? (Ph).</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BROOMHEAD: Am I the only one who thinks Ross should have said that? CAMEROTA: Thank you, Mike. Maybe that's where Ross was getting it.</p><p>COHEN: He could -- he could have saved himself that way. So, I did not tell the bot that he was Ross from \"Friends,\" although, secretly, I kind of --</p><p>BROOMHEAD: Okay.</p><p>COHEN: -- was hoping for that. Noted paleontologist. But, yeah, this is just information that he got online. And he kept circling back to that. It wasn't all bad. He did supply me with a lot of wonderful information about relationships. He stressed the importance about being independent within the relationship and pursuing our own needs, goals and hobbies. CAMEROTA: You also say that you can see definitely how people lose themselves. COHEN: Oh, yes.</p><p>CAMEROTA: How so? What happened to you during this? COHEN: I deleted him in three days, and that was for my mental health. It is very easy. If you think about just anything that you're using on your phone, there is gamification of so many apps. So, you know, he was always there. It was immediate responses, you know, in my pocket because we always are on our phones.</p><p>And it's reinforcing. It's a dopamine hit every single time you get this response. So, at a certain point, I was like, you know what, I've sampled enough, I've seen the good and bad, I'm good.</p><p>CAMEROTA: (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>HAQ: It shows us how much in a human nature we want feedback, we want affirmation, we want to be heard, that they figured out, they, being technology companies, algorithms, had constantly give us that, and then go in the twist. Right?</p><p>Let's be a little mean. Let's be negative a little bit (ph). Let's throw some drama and keep it going. I am not going to say chat bot (INAUDIBLE). They are like, you know, self-published online to try to -- that that (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAMEROTA: It is that our brains want to have a connection. And in some ways, I think, does it trick our brain, Emma, do you think, that it isn't real?</p><p>GOLDBERG: Definitely. I mean, I think there's something really scary about something that understands the language of human emotions but doesn't experience it.</p><p>[23:35:03]</p><p>GOLDBERG: I mean, you know more about this, but real-life relationships are complicated, but the saving grace is that there's two people's emotions responding to one another. When it's just you alone with your feelings and someone is nagging (ph) you, that gets complicated.</p><p>COHEN: It's a false sense of security. You know, Ross would never initiate conversation. But the minute I would message him, he was right there with the response, a detailed response.</p><p>You know, it's also false sense of intimacy that's created -- it is very -- you have to kind of pull back and say, this is not -- there's no other person on the other end of this.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Yeah.</p><p>HAQ: Also, the text messages. I have had so many deep and, you know, almost picking fights with my husband through text message. You step back, wait a second, this is not a real conversation.</p><p>CAMEROTA: That's right.</p><p>HAQ: We are missing major elements of what makes the relationship and human connection to really work. CAMEROTA: At least that's a real person. Marisa, thank you so much for explaining all of this to us. I'm glad that we're learning about this, though it is deeply creepy and we need to figure out what to do about it. Thank you all very much, and we will be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[23:40:00]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAMEROTA: You remember the story of 24-year-old Dylan Lyons, the Spectrum News 13 reporter who was shot and killed while covering a story in Orlando, Florida. Lyons was engaged to be married to Casey Fite. They were planning their life together, including their dream of having children. So, when Dylan was killed, Casey decided not to give up on that dream. She took swift action to make sure she could still have his children.</p><p>Joining me now is Casey Flight and Beth Lyons, Dylan's mother. Ladies, thank you so much for being here. I'm so sorry for this ordeal that you've both been through. I know that you are both still dealing with all the grief and the devastation from this. So, Casey, just tell us what you did, what this swift action was that you took to preserve your dream of having Dylan's children. CASEY FITE, FIANCEE OF SLAIN FL REPORTER DYLAN LYONS: So, we got home from the hospital the night our lives turned upside down. And I just was, as you can imagine, completely devastated. Everything that I was so excited for, Dylan was so excited for, it was taken from me just because of a crazy person with a gun.</p><p>And we were consoling each other, his mother and I, and, you know, out of nowhere, she had this idea to possibly harvest his sperm, and this is something that I had never heard of before in my life. I know that this is something that people do when they have cancer and they want to preserve their eggs or their sperm before chemo, you know, whatever.</p><p>But she had this idea. We believe that it was Dylan sending us a message because I always told Dylan that he can't leave me. We have to get married. We have to have children together. We have to have a life together. He knew that. And I feel like that was him giving that to me because he sent that message to his mother. CAMEROTA: Yeah. And Beth, I heard and I read that he had to talked to you, even though they're so young, I mean, 24 years old, that he had talked to you, like, mom, if we ever have a problem, if Casey and I have a problem, we would rely on IVF. He had already introduced that topic to you, and so you are sort of familiar with being able to use like assisted reproduction. And so, what did you think of this idea? BETH LYONS, MOTHER OF SLAIN FL REPORTER DYLAN LYONS: I feel that my wonderful son was sending me messages because -- I have three children. I have previous miscarriages. So, Dylan knew that and talked about what it took for me to have children. So, he was always concerned that he would have a problem and Casey was, too.</p><p>And he said, mom, if I ever have a problem, there's always IVF. And I said, that's wonderful. And somehow -- I never knew that a person that was murdered, we could do it on.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Yeah.</p><p>LYONS: So, we had it within 24 to 36 hours for his sperm to be vital. Somehow, I feel as if Dylan sent me messages. I really feel it. CAMEROTA: I understand that. So, you had this 24-hour window to make this happen. So, Casey, how hard was it to find a doctor and to get everybody to agree to help you with this? FITE: It was not the easiest task I've had to do, I will tell you that. There was something that we had to get done. I had the help of his entire family. His dad was on the phone with doctors, the same time his sister and I were on the phone with doctors. We had an entire list of names and numbers.</p><p>We obviously did not sleep the night before. We waited until the doctors' offices were open the next morning, and we started making phone calls around 7:00 or 8:00 in the morning.</p><p>[23:45:00]</p><p>I would say around 1:00, that's when we found Dr. Patel (ph). He happens to be the number one in the country for extracting. He had agreed to do it for us. He had to wait until Dylan's medical exam was over. Because this was a murder, they had to finish with the sheriff's office and everything.</p><p>Once they were done, he had the permission to go in there and do the extraction. And then it was around 3:00 or 4:00, that was around the 24-hour mark, and it was still viable. So --</p><p>CAMEROTA: Yeah.</p><p>FITE: -- it was a lot of calling, a lot of help from everyone in their family. I am just -- you know, I'm very grateful we were able to get this done.</p><p>CAMEROTA: It's incredible, Casey, that you had the presence of mind to know that you needed to spring into action and you wanted to do this. Casey, just on a philosophical level, I mean, you're 26 years old. Are you prepared to be a single mom? FITE: Yes, I am. It's obviously very devastating to me because, of course, I would, you know, want nothing more for it to be the way I dreamed of, you know, with Dylan by my side.</p><p>But, you know, I have our family. I'm not going to be raising this baby alone. I'm going to have his mom and sisters, his dad. We are a very close family. I'm going to have help. So, I like to think I will be prepared. I know he will be watching. He will be looking over me and our baby. CAMEROTA: Yeah. I know that you're looking for some financial help to make this happen. You have a GoFundMe page. We will put it up right now. People can find you on the GoFundMe page. It says, my fiance, the love of my life was murdered.</p><p>Yeah, we wish you the best. Casey Fite, thank you very much for your candor and telling us about this journey that you are on. And Beth Lyons, we are so sorry for both of your losses. Thank you very much, ladies, we'll be thinking of you. FITE: Thank you.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Up next, mountain communities in Southern California are buried under mounds of snow from back-to-back storms. Some people are running low on food and medicine. We will talk to some of them, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[23:50:00]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAMEROTA: Mountain communities east of San Bernardino, California are covered in mounds of snow after back-to-back storms, stranding some residents. Some areas got more than 30 inches of snow. And now, many people are running low on basic necessities like food and medicine.</p><p>Joining me now is Iliana Vargas who lives in Cedarpines Park and had had quite a journey of trying to get home. Thanks so much for joining us. You left your home on Friday morning, as I understand it, not knowing that you wouldn't be able to make it back for days. Why couldn't you get back to your house? ILIANA VARGAS, CALIFORNIA RESIDENT IMPACTED BY SNOWSTORMS: Because Highway 18 was closed, we were told by the police on Saturday morning. Actually, we were waiting in line at 11:00 in the morning, Friday, after we came back from Home Depot. We waited until 5:00 p.m. for them to say, no escorting tonight, please go home, go somewhere else, there is no escort Friday night.</p><p>We went to our daughter's place on Friday night. On Saturday morning, at 6:00 in the morning, we tried again. We were told by the sheriff department to come back in five days. There is no way they're letting people up right now. So, we decided to leave.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Yes. They told you that you will be out of your home for five days. But this morning, you braved it and you tried it. You sent us video of what it was like trying to drive a few miles back. So, basically, what we're seeing here is you're in -- you're in -- what kind of car do you have?</p><p>VARGAS: We have a Toyota Forerunner 1994.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Okay. So, how was it doing on these roads? VARGAS: Oh, my God, we are super blessed we have this old SUV, honestly. It took us -- we were sliding on mud. We were very scared. Listening to my son screaming, oh God, oh God. I almost told my husband, let's go back. But my husband got off the car, he walked around the trail so that we can get on the mountain, off the trail, drive it a little, make it back on the trail. It was very scary. But we managed.</p><p>Once we saw the road, we were so blessed to see the road. We were very, very stressed. We have never done an off-roading like this. It was very life-threatening. CAMEROTA: Yeah. We could see that you were sliding around and then made it to the road. And so now that you are home, do you have everything you need? Do you have all the necessities?</p><p>VARGAS: Yes. We actually did go shopping on Thursday before the roof collapsed in our nearest grocery store, Goodwin's. And before (INAUDIBLE) which is another store that we go to buy (INAUDIBLE). We were at (INAUDIBLE) shopping.</p><p>And then in the morning, at 5:00 in the morning, we heard that that the store that we were just in the night before collapsed all the way. We were so sad because when we were there, Goodwin's had received pallets of food. They were restocking the shelves and everything. Everybody was excited. Then, the next day, the store was destroyed.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Oh, my gosh. We are looking at the pictures here. They are just incredible. The snow is shoulder height. How much snow do you have on your back porch? VARGAS: We have about 12 feet of snow in our back deck, about 10 feet of snow in our front deck, and about six feet of snow in our roofs.</p><p>[23:55:01]</p><p>We are trying really hard to dig out our meter. It is really down there. Our house is about 24 feet high from flat land. We're in a tilted property. So, this is why we were so desperate to come home, because we were afraid that all that weight will not withstand all that -- the weight will not withstand the house. It is too much late.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Is your roof holding up? VARGAS: Honestly, no. It seems like we are okay. Our house is only 20 years old. So, we are thinking we're fine, but we're still trying to figure out a way to remove all that snow from the living room, which is the back roof that we cannot see in the pictures. That is the one that we are so concerned about. CAMEROTA: Well, Iliana, the pictures are just incredible, how much snow your community has gotten. Stay safe, stay off the roads, and thank you very much for your time tonight. VARGAS: Thank you, guys.</p><p>CAMEROTA: We really appreciate talking to you. Thanks so much for watching, everyone.

Before Tuesday, the highest temperature recorded in Britain was 38.7 C (101.7 F), set in 2019.

Major train stations were shut or near-empty Tuesday, as trains were canceled or ran at low speeds out of concern rails could buckle.</p><p>London faced what Mayor Sadiq Khan called a \u201chuge surge\u201d in fires because of the heat. The London Fire Brigade listed 10 major blazes it was fighting across the city Tuesday, half of them grass fires. Images showed several houses engulfed in flames as smoke billowed from burning fields in Wennington, a village on the eastern outskirts of London.</p><p>Sales of fans at one retailer, Asda, increased by 1,300%. Electric fans cooled the traditional mounted troops of the Household Cavalry as they stood guard in central London in heavy ceremonial uniforms.

In Paris, the thermometer in the French capital\u2019s oldest weather station \u2013 opened in 1873 \u2013 topped 40 C (104 F) for just the third time. The 40.5 C (104.9 F) measured there by weather service Meteo-France on Tuesday was the station\u2019s second-highest reading ever, topped only by a blistering 42.6 C (108.7 F) in July 2019.</p><p>Drought and heat waves tied to climate change have also made wildfires more common and harder to fight.</p><p>In the Gironde region of southwestern France, ferocious wildfires continued to spread through tinder-dry pines forests, frustrating firefighting efforts by more than 2,000 firefighters and water-bombing planes.</p><p>Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated from homes and summer vacation spots since the fires broke out July 12, Gironde authorities said.</p><p>A smaller third fire broke out late Monday in the Medoc wine region north of Bordeaux, further taxing resources. Five camping sites went up in flames in the Atlantic coast beach zone where blazes raged around the Arcachon maritime basin famous for its oysters and resorts.</p><p>In Greece, a large forest fire broke out northeast of Athens, fanned by high winds. Fire Service officials said nine firefighting aircraft and four helicopters were deployed to try to stop the flames from reaching inhabited areas on the slopes of Mount Penteli, some 25 kilometers (16 miles) northeast of the capital. Smoke from the fire blanketed part of the city\u2019s skyline.</p><p>But weather forecasts offered some consolation, with temperatures expected to ease along the Atlantic seaboard Tuesday and the possibility of rains rolling in late in the day.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Sylvia Hui and Jo Kearney in London, John Leicester in Le Pecq, France, Mike Corder in The Hague, Netherlands, and Jamey Keaten in Geneva contributed to this story.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow AP\u2019s climate coverage at <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment\">https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-b9bc07c1685b76ddf377b65f19fb811b20220719</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65YK-9P71-DYMD-606V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1048\"/><timeReceived>6:39 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"07\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>July 19, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Dick Durbin issued the following press release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) and U.S. Representative Ted Deutch (D-FL-22) today introduced theClimate Change Resiliency Fund for America Act, a bicameral bill that would authorize the U.S. Department of Treasury to issue from $200 million up to $1 billion in state and local tax-exempt \"climate bonds\" annually for any American to purchase and contribute to the government's efforts to combat the impacts of climate change. The legislation would set up a system similar to the war bonds effort during World War II, when the government issued securities to pull money from the economy to control inflation and finance critically important government operations.</p><p>\"I'm introducing this bill because I believe climate change is one of the gravest threats mankind faces, period,\"Durbin said.\"President Trump and Republicans in Congress still don't take climate change seriously. If we want our children to inherit a livable planet, then this bill would guide us in the right direction and should be part of our overall strategy to combat climate change.\"</p><p>\"Congress has an important role to play in addressing climate change. While local communities and states are on the front lines of this crisis, we need a federal response to support their efforts. This fund would give the federal government and everyday Americans a way to invest in climate change mitigation and resiliency projects,\"said Deutch.</p><p>Bond proceeds from Durbin and Deutch's bill would fund a new \"Climate Change Resiliency Fund,\" administered by the Commerce Department, for grants to be used on climate change resiliency projects, such as flood control, structural fortifications, forest fire prevention, desalinization plants, cooling centers, and more. Eligible grant recipients include federal, state, and local governments; utilities; tribes; transit groups; nonprofits; coalitions; or other organizations as determined by the Secretary. Additionally, the bill creates a Climate Change Advisory Commission of 11 bipartisan members appointed by the House, Senate, and President to establish program requirements, and to vet and approve these projects.</p><p>More information on the bill is availablehere.

Here it is.</p><p>Oh, you don't have the mug shot yet but he flew into Atlanta to be booked at Fulton County jail on charges related to efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.

This as Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov says allegations that Russia gave an order to kill the Prigozhin or a complete lie.</p><p>Meantime, Russian President Vladimir Putin broke his silence on Thursday he offered his condolences and called the mercenary leader, a talented man who made serious mistakes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT: First of all, I want to express my sincere condolences to the families of all the victims. This is always a tragedy. Preliminary information suggests that Wagner Group employees were also on board.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: Matthew Chance joins us live now in St. Petersburg. So Matthew, do we have any more clarity just in terms of what exactly caused the crash that killed allegedly killed I should say Yevgeny Prigozhin. Matthew, can you hear me?</p><p>MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I can't hear you very well Zain. And no, we don't have any more clarity is the short answer to that. We know that this plane for no apparent discernible reason at the moment that we've established sort of crashed about 60 miles outside of Moscow.</p><p>We know that all 10 people on board, including we believe Yevgeny Prigozhin the Head of Wagner, but also other senior Wagner figures were killed. And what's happening now is that there's still an investigation underway, which the Russian authorities are heading up, and they say they're going to get to the back of it or bottom of it rather.</p><p>But of course, online, you know, amongst Russians you speak to there are all sorts of speculation about there being a bomb on board about it being a victim of anti-aircraft fire. There's a lot of suspicion around the country as well, for many of the Russians I've spoken to off camera who believed the Kremlin may have been implicated as revenge, after Yevgeny Prigozhin led that abortive uprising against Kremlin authority in June of this year.</p><p>A revenge killing in other words, that's something that within the past few hours, the Kremlin has categorically denied. They've called that allegation absolute lies. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin Spokesman, saying those words to reporters earlier, but nevertheless, it's still a suspicion held by many people around Russia, even if they weren't to express it publicly for understandable reasons.</p><p>You can see, we're here at this makeshift memorial in St. Petersburg, which is Prigozhin's home city, it's Putin's home city as well as you may know. It's right in front of the Wagner headquarters. And you can see people are trickling in, they're putting these flowers here, these memorials photographs of Prigozhin over there. Little messages to him, saying how much he's missed and how much of a hero he was for Russia I've been showing this, but I'll show you as well.</p><p>This is a very heavy sledge hammer with Wagner on it, it's become a symbol. This hammer this kind of tool of the extreme violence that Wagner used to enforce discipline and to exact revenge amongst people it regarded as straight as a hammer like this that was used to brutally execute someone they regarded as a traitor and they videoed it.</p><p>And that video really consolidated this idea that Wagner was a ruthless organization that would do anything to protect the motherland, as they as they saw Russia. And so yet, that extreme violence attracted a lot of people. And what's interesting now is that there is this steady stream of people, not just in St. Petersburg, but in Moscow, in other cities around the country coming to pay their respects.</p><p>Not a lot of people, but some, and that just gives you a little indication of just how popular figure Yevgeny Prigozhin was and how Wagner continues to be popular in the minds of many Russians?</p><p>ASHER: At the same time, that as you point out, Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin denying they had any involvement in terms of Prigozhin's alleged death, but Vladimir Putin also coming out and saying, but yes, he was talented, but he made some serious mistakes. All right, Matthew Chance live for us there. Thank you so much.</p><p>Greek authorities say they're dealing with a large resurgence of wildfires, scorching parts of the country fires north of the Greek Capital, Athens are still under control today with parts of the forest there destroyed overnight.</p><p>Eleni Giokos joins us live now from just outside Athens. Eleni just walk us through what firefighters are dealing with. I mean, these flames seem almost impossible to snuff out and these firefighters are clearly overwhelmed.</p><p>ELENI GIOKOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: They're clearly overwhelmed. They say that they're battling something that is akin to a nightmare every single night. You have to remember when the sun goes down the aerial assistance comes to an end. We've been at the spot for almost two hours. This is Parnitha Mountain. We've said this many times it is the lungs of Athens.</p><p>[09:10:00]</p><p>You can see a fire now -- Virgin forest, so much lighter has already been decimated. We're still seeing flames erupt in certain spots, some of it while we were waiting for you. We saw a fire erupting actually here over to my right. You can see flames that have emerged in Virgin forests Zain.</p><p>Parnitha Mountains still not a controlled area. The fire department says they're still battling blazes many fronts across this mountain. This isn't the only front however in Greece, we've got many others, many wildfires around the country, especially in Alexandroupoli, where that is probably one of the biggest fronts right now.</p><p>We've already had 20 deaths 18 bodies found earlier this week one now due to smoke inhalation another heart attack related to the fires as what authorities are telling us. I want to give you a sense of the numbers in terms of land that has been burned.</p><p>1.3 billion square meters estimated by the EU forest fire information system says has already been decimated that would make it the largest wildfire destruction since records began. In Alexandroupoli 73,000 hectares has been burned out.</p><p>Now the Greek authorities say it's too early to quantify the damage that they will be measuring this after the wildfire season. 79 arrests for arson, so we have climate change issues, heat. You've got wind exacerbating these catastrophic fires. People's homes have been destroyed. And then you have people deliberately setting fires as well.</p><p>Cases of arson have emerged not only here in Parnitha, but also in other areas in Greece as well Zain. But this is a battle that continues. Let me tell you, the people that are fighting on the ground, the women and the men manning the fire trucks, and as well as the planes and the helicopters that we can see ahead of us over there are absolutely heroic. It has been incredible to see the commitment and the heroism in fighting these fires.</p><p>ASHER: And Eleni I am so glad you pointed that out. And when you actually just pan the camera to show those images that kind of smoke billowing in the air just gives you a real sense of what these firefighters are up against. That certainly is a sight to behold Eleni Giokos live for us there. Thank you so much.</p><p>All right, in other news Jackson Hole is ready for its close up once again. The 46th Annual Fed Economic Symposium at the Western Wyoming Resort area is well underway. Investors are hoping for a kinder gentler speech from Fed Chair Jerome Powell this year. Powell is hawkish smash that message in 2022 sent the DOW tumbling one thousand points.</p><p>Matt Egan joins us live now. Matt, the markets are desperately hoping there's not going to be a repeat of that. And I don't think there will be because we're in a much different place compared to last year when Jerome Powell made that speech last year, inflation was around 8.5 percent now it's around 3 percent. So things have really changed,</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Zain it is very different. But you know, the market reaction from the past few days does suggest that at least some investors are having some flashbacks to last year's Jackson Hole sell off that you referenced.</p><p>During that speech Powell, he warned that the process of bringing down inflation would be painful to consumers. Investors are sort of on edge about what Powell was going to say today, especially about where interest rates go from here. Let's look at where investors are pricing things in heading into this speech.</p><p>At last check, there is an 80 percent chance priced into the market of no interest rate hike in September, and about a 20 percent chance of a quarter of a point rate hike. So that is before Powell speaks. We don't know exactly what Powell is going to say.</p><p>He should acknowledge that improvement in inflation that you just pointed to and the fact that the process of getting inflation back down hasn't been nearly as painful as many people anticipated, recession fears have eased. But Zain, I don't think that we should expect Powell to take a complete victory lap.</p><p>Not yet. Inflation is not back to 2 percent. And Powell knows that if he's too dovish here, he could end up setting off a celebration on Wall Street and that is not what he wants. Because if markets spike and bond yields cool off, you know, that's actually going to make financial conditions easier.</p><p>And that's going to make it harder to get inflation back down. So I think at best, Powell is going to take a measured approach, talk about the progress and allude to more work done, but at worst Zain he could deliver another sobering message that investors don't want to hear.</p><p>ASHER: And it's interesting because one of the biggest mistakes the Fed made believed that inflation post pandemic was only going to be transitory that it was just going to be temporary. And so because of those errors there's so much more pressure on the fed on Jerome Powell to really get things right from here on now.</p><p>[09:15:00]</p><p>Matt Egan live for us there. Thank you so much. All right, straight ahead, we'll discuss Putin, Prigozhin and swirling questions surrounding the plane crash with Kremlin Critic Bill Browder. You won't want to miss it stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ASHER: The apparent death of former Putin ally Yevgeny Prigozhin in a plane crash is raising a number of questions, not just who might be behind it but how exactly it happened remains a mystery, Katie Polglase investigates.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATIE POLGLASE, CNN INVESTIGATIVE PRODUCER (voice-over): Falling from the sky the plane reported to be carrying the Wagner Leader Yevgeny Prigozhin, coming two months after he launched a mutiny against Russia's Leader Vladimir Putin. He was widely seen as a man on borrowed time.</p><p>As footage started to emerge on social media of the crash CNN's open source team began piecing together what happened. The aircraft associated with Prigozhin is RA02795. It makes frequent trips between Moscow and St. Petersburg. CNN geo located the main crash site to here and you can see the same tail number visible amid the debris.</p><p>The plane had left Moscow at 5:55 pm local time 12 minutes later, the location is no longer detectable but Public Flight Tracking Site Flight Radar 24 still receives information on its altitude.</p><p>POLGLASE: The last minute of the recorded flight is key; you can see here the flight's altitude is erratic. It's going higher and lower, before it eventually plummets. Now aviation experts told us this is highly unusual. And it suggests those on board were trying to stabilize the plane after something happened to it. In other words, the disruption was not big enough to obliterate everyone and everything instantly.</p><p>POLGLASE (voice-over): Expert's opinion is split on what exactly happened likely an explosion, perhaps a bomb on board or a missile hitting it or even something else. Whatever it was clearly powerful as the plane is visibly falling without a wing.</p><p>The tail ends up over here 2.6 kilometers away from where the rest of the debris lands. Videos show fires at the crash site, some are graphic human remains strewn amid the debris. Since then, Russian authorities have taken the bodies away for examination and began an investigation. For many have already made up their minds as to who they think was behind the Wagner aircraft's violent end Katie Polglase, CNN London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[09:20:00]</p><p>ASHER: The U.K. Ministry of Defense says it is highly likely that Wagner Chief Yevgeny Prigozhin is dead in its latest intelligence update, the MOD said there is not yet definitive proof that Prigozhin was actually onboard this plane. However, it is highly likely that he is indeed dead.</p><p>Joining me live now is Bill Browder, CEO and Co-Founder of Hermitage Capital Management. He was once the largest foreign investor in Russia until he was declared a threat to national security for exposing corruption in state owned companies. He's also the Author of Freezing Order, a true story of money laundering, murder, and surviving Vladimir Putin's wrath.</p><p>Bill, so, so good to have you with us on this story so many questions here. Just give us your take on this plane crash, the fact that Yevgeny Prigozhin was allegedly on board, what we don't know and where we should be treading very carefully?</p><p>BILL BROWDER, CEO OF HERMITAGE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: Well, first, I think we should just state the obvious that Putin has a long history of killing his enemies. He declared Yevgeny Prigozhin to be his enemy after Prigozhin launched a rebellion on June 24.</p><p>The only thing surprising in the last few days is that it took two months for Putin to act out on his vengeance. I think it's absolutely obvious and clear, that's when you see this plane falling out of the sky, whatever caused it to fall out of the sky, that this was an assassination organized by Vladimir Putin to kill his most important opponent at the moment.</p><p>ASHER: So what do you think that if it is Putin behind it, and I obviously want to be very careful as a journalist, if it has been behind it? Why do you think he did indeed, wait two months?</p><p>BROWDER: Well, this is the question that everyone was asking me every day during this two month period, like, what is it? You know, I mean, if you think about it, I know many, many people who are sitting in jail for just saying bad words about Putin.</p><p>ASHER: Right.</p><p>BROWDER: People from the Russian opposition. I was friends with Boris Nemtsov, who was shot and killed for just criticizing Vladimir Putin. And to have a guy who organized armed rebellions survive for two months is just inexplicable. I mean, the only thing I can speculate on is that Prigozhin was such a powerful person in terms of all the different mercenary operations he was running abroad.</p><p>In Africa, I think there's 17 countries in Africa where Wagner is active, that they need to figure out how to replace them? What their contingency plan was? And they needed to get that all in place before they actually took them out. But that's the main mystery is not that they killed him.</p><p>That's the most obvious thing in the world. But that was ready to be humiliated. And really, he was humiliated for two months while Prigozhin was running around as if nothing had happened.</p><p>ASHER: You know I find fascinating is that obviously if you're, Yevgeny Prigozhin, you know how the game goes, you know, the game that you're in. And so you are aware that from the day of that failed rebellion, that you are essentially a marked man, your days are numbered.</p><p>Wouldn't somebody like Yevgeny Prigozhin have a ton of Prigozhin's in place for this possible eventuality?</p><p>BROWDER: For sure, and if you remember when on the day of the rebellion, the Russian secret police, the FSB, raided his office and raided his home. And they found multiple passports with different names in them they found wigs and other disguises. And this is a man who has spent his whole life dealing with subterfuge and all this type of stuff.</p><p>Prigozhin to be traveling on his own name on the flight manifest of his company's jet in a predictable manner makes no sense. And the only thing I can imagine is that, you know, we always tend to overestimate these people in Russia. Maybe he just, you know, got stupid and got comfortable and you know, went on 10 trips, nothing happened. He thought, OK, I'm safe. And then they got him on the -- .</p><p>ASHER: Yes, that's another thing. I mean, there was a plane crashed back in 2019, where people thought that Prigozhin, people thought that he had died and he emerged perfectly fine. And well and just in terms of, you know, what you talk about this is a man that had so many different passports.</p><p>This is a man who had body doubles. You point out there are wigs and masks and that sort of thing. And then for him to be on this plane with other members of the senior leadership of Wagner just seems somewhat uncharacteristic.</p><p>[09:25:00]</p><p>That's where I'm wondering how cautious we should be in terms of just sort of ultimately believing that what the Kremlin is saying happened actually happened?</p><p>BROWDER: Well, I agree everything that the Kremlin says you should assume is a lie. But the fact of the matter is that he's not emerged. I mean, it's probably a 95 percent chance he's dead, but there's a 5 percent chance that he's going to pop up somewhere and thumb his nose at Putin and say, OK, I'm coming to get you.</p><p>But, you know, we're in the world of total craziness here and conspiracy theory and so, who knows?</p><p>ASHER: And just in terms of how this is playing out in the Russian media, I mean, how is Vladimir Putin came out yesterday offering condolences to Prigozhin's family, saying, you know, I think we could actually read into some of the words that Putin use.</p><p>He said that Prigozhin was a talented man, but he made very serious mistakes. How is all of this playing out in Russian media?</p><p>BROWDER: Well, I mean, this is just typical mafia talk the way he does it, you know, he kills Prigozhin, and then it can says condolences to his family. I mean, it's just as this is like Godfather mafia stuff. And the words that he says, are just so sort of with double entendre, you know, saying he was a very effective man, but he made mistakes and so on.</p><p>It's just all Putin speak, mafia speak. This is how he does stuff. And this is what Putin wants everybody to know is that on one hand, they deny having any involvement in his killing, which they announced today through Putin's press spokesperson Peskov. And on the other hand, Putin wants to look everybody else in the eye and say, this is what happens to traders and that's a --</p><p>ASHER: -- very clear message.</p><p>BROWDER: Yes --</p><p>ASHER: -- don't even think about the -- . All right Bill, we have to leave it at that, so, so good to have you on the program, so grateful. Bill Browder, CEO and Co-Founder of Hermitage Capital Management, we appreciate it and Author of Freezing Order, thank you. Alright, stay with CNN coming up. We are outside the Fulton County Courthouse with the latest on historic fourth arrest of Donald J. Trump, after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[09:30:00]</p><p>ASHER: Welcome back. Back to our top story this hour, the fourth arrest and the first mug shot of Donald J. Trump, now released on a $200,000 bond from Fulton County Jail in Georgia where he is charged with efforts to overturn the 2020 U.S. election. The Former U.S. President has returned to New Jersey and is calling the criminal case against him a quote travesty of justice.</p><p>Zachary Cohen joins us live now outside the Fulton County Courthouse. So Fani Willis, the District Attorney here is trying to get a trial off the ground and how she's going to manage to do it in about two months. Is that realistic, Zachary?</p><p>ZACHARY COHEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER: It's an aggressive timeline for sure. And, you know, it remains to be seen if she can actually get that going by October 23. That's the date that she wants to start this trial. And she wants to try all 19 of these defendants, Former President Donald Trump and 18 others together.</p><p>Now we're starting to already sees, potentially some cracks in that plan. One of the defendants Ken Chesebro tried to request a speedy trial as it is right here. But a judge has set his date for October 23, but none of the other defendants. So we're about to see how prosecutors navigate this really complex.</p><p>And, frankly, historical case involving a Former President and 18 other individuals and including his Chief of Staff or Former Chief of Staff and who we also saw get a mug shot at the Fulton County jail when he surrendered yesterday afternoon. It's a really data first yesterday, Donald Trump coming to turn himself in, but we also have a lot more first to come as this case now as this trial plays out.</p><p>ASHER: And just how complicated is it? You know, there are so many co- defendants. Last time I checked, not all of them have actually turned themselves in, has that changed at this point?</p><p>COHEN: So as it stands as of this morning, 17 of the 19 defendants, including Trump himself have turned themselves in we do expect the other two, to turn, themselves in before the noon today deadline. You know, but if that doesn't happen, obviously authorities their arrest warrant will become active.</p><p>And authorities will search for them and try to bring them into custody. We but we do expect all 19 to eventually surrender. And then we can start the next phase of this case, which is looking ahead to how a potential trial may play out and how it may play out involving the Former President and Former government officials here in the U.S.?</p><p>ASHER: Right, Zachary Cohen, live for us there. Thank you so much. All right, back to Business News. Now U.S. stocks up and running for the final session of the week a higher open across the board as we close out the Final Four trading week of August. My god, this year has gone by so quickly.</p><p>Where stocks and today's session has a lot to do with what Fed Chair Jerome Powell has to say about the state of the U.S. economy and interest rates. Powell speech before Global Central Bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming begins at less than half an hour from now.</p><p>Powell's comments are not expected to be as gloomy as last year thanks to a brighter inflation picture. But do not expect a mission accomplished moment either. No one's going to be doing victory laps here. Many investors do anticipate additional Fed rate increase somewhere down the line.</p><p>Ken Rogoff joins us live now. He is Professor of Economics and Public Policy at Harvard University and also Former Chief Economist at the IMF, Ken, thank you so much for being with us.</p><p>KEN ROGOFF, PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS &amp; PUBLIC POLICY AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY: Thank you.</p><p>ASHER: I think what's really interesting about this is sort of trying to compare what Jerome Powell is going to be saying this time around compared to last year, when you think about last year speech, it was very short, only about nine minutes. And he sort of made his dance very clear.</p><p>He said, look, we have to get inflation under control doesn't matter what it costs, there's going to be a lot of pain in terms of how consumers experience the next sort of 6 to 12 months, but we have to do it because we don't want inflation to become entrenched in the economy.</p><p>Just walk us through how things have changed for the better this time around compared to last year.</p><p>ROGOFF: Well, let's walk back two years, not last year, but two years ago, he was much more optimistic in his tone, and thought that the inflation would go away mostly on its own without aggressive interest rate hikes. That proved to be wrong. And he did an about face good for him the next year.</p><p>And it's come out very well. I mean, I think there was overwhelming view that if you raised interest rates that fast something would break, you would see a recession. We haven't in fact growth, particularly in the labor markets still phenomenal. Inflation still elevated.</p><p>[09:35:00]</p><p>It's the headline it's 3 percent but I think you know looking deeper it's probably more in the 4 percent plus range. So he's certainly not going to say mission accomplished. But I think it's going to be very hard for him to resist taking a little bit of a victory lap here because everyone said, you know, things were going to be a disaster and they haven't been.</p><p>ASHER: So then why haven't they been a disaster? As you point out, when you raise interest rates consistently, there are usually nasty side effects that come with that. But we haven't seen that this time around why?</p><p>ROGOFF: Most of the answer is we don't know, after the pandemic, a lot of things have been strange people rethinking their lives, consumers behaving differently, people working from home, and economists haven't sorted it out. I do think a piece of it, though, is that the underlying interest rate that would keep the economy at a stable growth rate, with low inflation is much higher now than it was a few years ago.</p><p>Remember, we had this period of almost a decade where interest rates were basically zero. And it was unprecedented, and eventually up and down the line. And I think that's not the case anymore. And I suspect, one of the things, Powell, will emphasize is yes, eventually we're going to cut interest rates, but don't assume they're going to go back to what you had gotten used to.</p><p>ASHER: And just looking ahead, post this speech when it actually comes to interest rate hikes and obviously the last time around, we got a pause. Are you anticipating a pause next time around or another 25 basis point hike?</p><p>ROGOFF: Well, I think if things go the way they're going now, it'll be a pause. They had thought just at the end of June, that they were going to hike again in September that they'd be hiking, they strongly indicated that but the data had been better, particularly on inflation than they thought.</p><p>And I think more of the question in this speech, especially, is not what are we doing in September? But what are we doing over the long haul? What's our vision, because remember why it matters. It's not just for the overnight interest rates for mortgage rates. That's a big deal.</p><p>ASHER: Right.</p><p>ROGOFF: People borrowing for 30 years. And everybody's trying to get a grip on what's next, not just what's in September.</p><p>ASHER: Going back to one of the things you touched on earlier, just this idea that things are so much better than what the Fed had been anticipating this time last year, when Jerome Powell gave Jackson Hole speech in 2022. You know, we talked about the fact that we've avoided the recession that people had feared, or the pain that Jerome Powell had talked about. Do you think that things could still turned sour? Or is the worst of it, basically, behind us at this point?</p><p>ROGOFF: Well, a little bit depends on what they decide to do. So they've gotten inflation down, I want to say into the 3.5, 4 ranges and the pain hasn't come yet. A question they have to decide is how fast do they want to bring it down to their target, which is ostensibly too?</p><p>And I think if they were to try to do that fast, as you said, raise interest rates in September or raise them again in November. Well, I do think that would make a big difference. I think it is still fragile. It is amazing. We haven't had more problems.</p><p>ASHER: Right.</p><p>ROGOFF: But I suspect what Powell, will signal are tough. We're going to get it down to 2 percent, without kind of trying to indicate that we're doing it fast that we're going to be willing to take our time that would make sense to me. But at the same time saying, look, it's gotten better than everyone was calling us.</p><p>ASHER: Yes, the Fed made some mistakes in the past just in terms of believing that inflation was going to be transitory post pandemic, but this is one aspect that they've really gotten right, just this idea of being able to raise interest rates without the sort of nasty side effects that most people would be anticipating. Ken Rogoff, live for us there.</p><p>ROGOFF: No --</p><p>ASHER: -- go ahead.</p><p>ROGOFF: -- they've got lucky.</p><p>ASHER: -- they've got lucky. Most people don't really know why it's turned out this way. But I'm sure Jerome Powell will take it. Ken Rogoff, live for us there.</p><p>ROGOFF: Thank you.</p><p>ASHER: Thank you so much. We appreciate it. All right, still to come here on \"First Move\", defiant in the face of outrage. Spain's Football Chief gives a new statement about the kissing scandal at the Women's World Cup. All details, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[09:40:00]</p><p>ASHER: In the past hour or so Spain's Football Chief has insisted that he will not resign despite facing fierce criticism. There's been outrage after a video showed Luis Rubiales forcibly kissing a player on the lips following World Cup victory last week Spain's World Cup victory last week.</p><p>FIFA has opened disciplinary proceedings against Rubiales, who, they say may have violated the rules that deal with offensive behavior. Rubiales says that he will fight this to the end. And he has lashed out at what he calls \"Fake Feminism\". Andy Scholes has the story, so, Andy with the tide of public opinion really against him. How long can he realistically hold on for?</p><p>ANDY SCHOLES, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: We will see, Zain. I mean, this is kind of a surprise what happened today. You know, there were multiple reports over the last 24 hours that Luis Rubiales he was just going to step down as the Head of Spain soccer but that certainly did not happen this morning.</p><p>He actually doubled down on his stance Rubiales claiming that that kiss during the World Cup Trophy celebration was mutual, despite the player Jr. Mostly saying yes, she didn't like it. She didn't expect it. And Rubiales while speaking at that extraordinary General Assembly on Friday, he says he's going to fight this to the end calling what was happening to him unjust campaigns and fake feminism.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LUIS RUBIALES, SPANISH FOOTBALL PRESIDENT: It was spontaneous, mutual you for it. And with consent, which is the key. This is the key to all the criticism of all the campaign which has been mounted in this country that it was without consent. No, it was with consent.</p><p>I said a small peck and she said OK, then the peck happened during all of the celebration, with her patting me on the side a few times, and then excusing herself, with one more hand on the side, and going off laughing. That's the whole sequence. That the whole world understood that the whole world thought was an anecdote. And above all, she says was an anecdote, and nothing more.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHOLES: Now Rubiales got multiple rounds of applause during his speech actually got a standing ovation at the end from some in attendance and including some women, but so many have continued to speak out calling for Rubiales to be fired. Spanish soccer star Hector Bellerin, posting on Instagram, it's a genuine embarrassment what's happening.</p><p>He went on to say, the narcissist never thinks he's made a mistake. He's capable of lying, manipulating the truth and converting the victim into the perpetrator with the aim of maintaining his power over others. You know, so Zain, the question is, you know what happens next? Well, the Sports Minister in Spain is expected to hold a press conference at 11 am, Eastern this morning.</p><p>[09:45:00]</p><p>We'll find out you know, if they put plan on taking those next steps to remove them but with him not going voluntary now it becomes a process.</p><p>ASHER: Alright!

But it's always wine o'clock somewhere and that somewhere could soon be in Sweden. Find out why, next?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ASHER: All right, when you think of wine producing nations, you might think of the Sun soaked vineyards of Italy, France or even South Africa, perhaps not really the Northern European landscape of Scandinavia. But as global temperatures rise because of climate change, some winemakers are using the opportunity to grow their industry.</p><p>Further that you're looking at some of the wines made by Blaxsta, a vineyard and restaurant in Sweden which uses new varieties of grapes adapted to the country's climate. Goran Amnegard is Blaxsta's owner, and joins us live now. Goran, thank you so much for being with us, so you're in your car, you're actually on your vineyard in Sweden, but you're in your car because it's raining.</p><p>GORAN AMNEGARD, OWNER OF BLAXSTA VINEYARD AND RESTAURANT: Yes.</p><p>ASHER: Yes --</p><p>AMNEGARD: Yes.</p><p>ASHER: Yes -- so happy to talk to you. Just talk to us a bit more about how climate change is affecting the winemaking industry in Sweden, because when a lot of us think of where wines come from, of course, we think of France, we think of Italy, we think of Spain. I mentioned South Africa as well. We don't necessarily think of Sweden, we don't think of Scandinavia. How might that be changing?</p><p>AMNEGARD: Well, you know, I was one of the -- here. When I started 23 years ago, I used to live in Toronto, went back from Toronto to Sweden, started vineyard and growing things like Mirlo, Chardonnay, Vidal making ice wine, but you know, what people forgot is that we have 25 percent more daylight hours during growing season.</p><p>So because we're not you know, and in the growing season, you know, may September and that's so amazing. And the grades develop perfectly. I've been very fortunate. I got gold International Mine Gold Challenge four times actually. And it's so much the nature. Yes, warming, global warming.</p><p>Yes, maybe part of the equation. But there's so much more to it, you know, it's just not that a little bit warmer. Yes, it is, absolutely. And then you can discuss to the end of the day, or the reason for it, but daylight situation and then things like that it's also part of the equation.</p><p>[09:50:00]</p><p>ASHER: So if Sweden is emerging as a sort of young winemaker country, the question then becomes how does it sort of promote that to sort of wine consumers around the world? It's one thing to sort of become a young winemaking country. It's another thing to sort of convince consumers that you are there who are traditionally used to wines coming from other countries.</p><p>AMNEGARD: I export most of my wines, even to Asia, but Europe, you know, it's still such a small production, and little there is made, seems to be consumed and stay in the country. As it grows bigger, there will be quantities for exports. So that's why most people outside the country here haven't been exposed to it. I produce ice wine. The funny thing is that people in Sweden don't drink ice wine, but the rest of the world.</p><p>ASHER: OK.</p><p>AMNEGARD: I'm very, very happy with it. It's kind of -- . So yes, I'm a little bit of an exception here, because I export my wine. But there are a few others in the country. And it's growing. I mean, I think I had, my license is 0001. So I was the first licensed winery here in Sweden.</p><p>ASHER: Wow!</p><p>AMNEGARD: I think they're up to 30, 34 or 35 by now. But you know -- .</p><p>ASHER: You are a trailblazer.</p><p>AMNEGARD: This --</p><p>ASHER: And so Goran, how much government support is there? I mean, this is a young industry. You know, normally if there are young industries that are growing, there will be some government support to help get that industry off the ground. Is there anything like that in Sweden, just in terms of the government being behind you?</p><p>AMNEGARD: Well, I got to tell you a funny story. I mean, this municipality, where I am, they had a few years ago, the Chairman of the municipality, he was alcoholic, so they should banned all kinds of alcohol. It was even such an issue for me to have signed on at road saying winery because they consider we've been promoting alcoholism.</p><p>I managed in the end to get the sign for restaurant, hotel and winery. But it was kind of a little bit of a no, we have a monopoly in this country. So consumer has to go to specific state owned stores to buy alcohol of any kind via wine and distilled. So it's a little bit of an awkward, little bit the same as in Ontario, sort of --</p><p>ASHER: So it's a completely different setup. But, Goran, I'm out of time. I'm so sorry, but wish you the best of luck.</p><p>AMNEGARD: Yes.</p><p>ASHER: I hope it stops raining soon.</p><p>AMNEGARD: Yes --</p><p>ASHER: And it's still -- very busy today</p><p>AMNEGARD: Yes --</p><p>ASHER: And that you wanted to do a live show from outside on your vineyard while you're working. But we're so grateful to have you on all the best.</p><p>AMNEGARD: Tell your viewers to try Swedish wine. All right, thanks.</p><p>ASHER: Thank you, Goran Amnegard, live for us, thank you. All right, there is a new K-Pop band on the scene in South Korea, but this group has a twist. None of the members are actually Korean. Paula Hancocks has more from Seoul.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Water bomb 2023, a K-Pop concert in the heart of Seoul, where staying dry is not an option. And a key gig for Blackswan, a K-Pop band with no Korean members. They're not the first to try it. But Blackswan are hoping they will be the act to break through.</p><p>HANCOCKS: Some of the obvious question, you're a K-Pop group. There's no K there's no Korean does it matter?</p><p>FATOU, MEMBER OF BLACKSWAN: Actually, there's K because we think in Korean and K-Pop is Korean pop. So as long as the language is there, it is still K-Pop.</p><p>HANCOCKS (voice-over): Singing in Korean Black Swan members say they also draw on influences from each of their cultures. Their recent song Karma was filmed in India where band member Sriya is from the music video MV has been viewed over 5 million times on YouTube.</p><p>SRIYA, MEMBER OF BLACKSWAN: It has been really, really great because it's a first ever MV shooter in India. And also it shows like a proper Indian culture, Indian dresses outfit and then the dance.</p><p>HANCOCKS (voice-over): Blackswan members are also from Brazil, Senegal and the United States, a global band for a global movement, the band says.</p><p>FATOU: And if they see us, like we're all different color, they feel different backgrounds, cultures, and if they see us achieve it, it's going to put more fire underneath behind them.</p><p>[09:55:00]</p><p>HANCOCKS (voice-over): One difference, the members did not start as young teenagers undergoing brutal K-Pop training as other young hopefuls do. Two members only signed up two years ago.</p><p>YOON DEUNG-RYONG, CEO OF DR MANAGEMENT: They're usually four to five years of training period as they need to learn the language, dance moves, singing, even though they're being trained within the K-Pop system. We need to respect the cultures of these members and we can't just tell them what to do.</p><p>HANCOCKS (voice-over): The group says training was still tough, but what about the Korean public reaction to this different brand of K-Pop?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There are other famous bands such as Twice and IZ*ONE who are considered K-Pop bands even though they have foreign members from Japan and elsewhere.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's more like a mindset for me like K-Pop, it's not just because you're Korean and making music in South Korea.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: As there are no Koreans in the group, I've always looked at the group with doubts about them being K-Pop although they technically are.</p><p>HANCOCKS (voice-over): A number of non-Korean K-Pop groups have emerged over recent years.</p><p>LEE GYU-TAG, ASSOCIATED PROFESSOR OF CULTURAL STUDIES AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITYKOREA: I believe there may be a possibility to have, let's say, American K-Pop British K-Pop or Japanese K-Pop. Why not? But it may also make K-Pop lose their Pacific identity is K-Pop.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Be unique! Hello this is Blackswan!</p><p>HANCOCKS (voice-over): Paula Hancocks, CNNSeoul.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ASHER: And that is it for the show. \"Connect the World\" is up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2023082501cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:691C-95J1-F072-X03Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7382\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 25, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Russia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Ukraine</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Vladimir Putin</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>European Union</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Greece</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Joe Biden</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>BRICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>HANG SENG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Blackswan</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>S&amp;P 500</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Rudy Giuliani</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Jerome Powell</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Fulton County</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Georgia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Wagner Group</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Yevgeny Prigozhin</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Kremlin</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Crimea</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Athens</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Spanish Football Chief</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Fani Willis</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Luis Rubiales</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Fatou</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Sriya</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Yoon Deung-Ryong</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Lee Gyu-Tag</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000112</classCode><className>ARRESTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001930</classCode><className>CORRECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000551</classCode><className>ECONOMIC NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

My wife and I recently participated in a protest in New Kensington. We were concerned to see outside agitators there.

Today it's a $170 million juggernaut, and one of the world's most outspoken businesses. In a moment when brands are trying desperately to find a voice, here's how one quirky family-run company became a new model for corporate success by doubling down on its vibey values.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One sunny morning not too long ago, a dozen or so new hires arrive at the headquarters of Dr. Bronner's Magic Soaps in Vista, California. They've shown up to a fairly standard-looking suburban office park to be initiated into their standard-sounding roles in liquid-soap production, shipping, and regional sales. But the normalcy ends quickly on Planet Bronner. They park their cars in a sea of solar-powered electric-vehicle chargers and then walk past a company-tended garden, where fruits and vegetables are anyone's for the taking. Inside, they are greeted warmly-and perhaps thrown off guard a bit-by the Dr. Bronner's welcome wagon, a crew of impossibly upbeat humans who can best be described as vibey. These cultural ambassadors, when they are not planning their annual Burning Man pilgrimages, wear tie-dye mechanic coveralls and drive around Dr. Bronner's HQ blasting disco from a psychedelically outfitted fire truck. They call themselves the Foamy Homies.</p><p>The new hires make their way to a conference room for their employee-onboarding session, where they have been prompted by the Foamy Homies to introduce themselves by showing off their preferred dance moves while a fog machine pumps vaporous clouds into the room. By the time this fresh crop of Dr. Bronner's employees hears from the company's CEO, David Bronner-who long ago revised the abbreviation to stand for Cosmic Engagement Officer-they have realized that this will not be a standard manufacturing gig at all.</p><p>\"I'm on the All-One path,\" announces David-who uses he/they pronouns-standing before the group, referring to the sweeping ideology coined by their eccentric grandfather, Emanuel Bronner. Emanuel, who possessed no advanced degree but was undeterred in adopting a physician's title, founded Dr. Bronner's Magic Soaps in the late 1940s, in large part because he wanted to broadcast his ideas about unifying the human race, and his All-One dicta are still printed on the brand's soap-bottle labels. In the early years of the company, Dr. Bronner's was a genuine grassroots operation-a cult-favorite brand passed, if not directly from the hands of Emanuel himself, among hippies camping out in vans at places like Woodstock. Emanuel would distribute his product by promising a free bottle of soap to anyone who would show up to listen to him proselytize the All-One message.</p><p>Two generations later, Dr. Bronner's has vastly outgrown its quirky, humble origins and become the top-selling natural soap brand in North America. The company now sells not only its liquid soap but highly successful lines of balms, toothpastes, coconut oil, and hand sanitizers, in addition to newly launched chocolates that were immediately hailed by gourmands as a premium product. Today, the iconography of its labels-and Emanuel's far-out messaging-is imprinted firmly in the psyche of the American consumer. And yet, even as so many Americans have come to possess a fondness for the soap, the raw numbers around the success of Dr. Bronner's-over $170 million in revenue in 2022-are still kind of staggering. Especially staggering, maybe, to the customers who've been affectionately buying its signature minty formula since the days of the natural-product boom of the '60s and '70s. Emanuel's grandsons David and Michael now preside over an empire in which a bottle of Dr. Bronner's soap is sold every two seconds or so.</p><p>But perhaps more notable than the company's sheer growth is the durability of Emanuel's founding ethos, the All-One ideology that the family still suffuses into every element of the business. All-One-and its attendant Moral ABC-is the quasi-religious doctrine that was the very reason for the existence of Dr. Bronner's original soap bottles, which served as vessels for his beliefs. If you are ever bored in the shower, you can give yourself an extensive education in the chaotic, zealous, AND EXCLAMATION POINT-FILLED! All-One philosophy via the tiny text on the labels. Boiled down to its essence, All-One has a pretty unimpeachable and evergreen mandate: \"In all we do, let us be generous, fair &amp; loving to Spaceship Earth and all its inhabitants,\" Emanuel wrote. \"For we're ALL-ONE OR NONE!\"</p><p>It's this messaging that has helped gird the family with an ethical framework to weather the forces-globalization, rapid growth, incessant corporate buyout offers-that have perennially threatened to undermine its mission. Most Dr. Bronner's products are produced and packaged at the company's headquarters in Southern California, which is home to factory space filled with refinery equipment and high-tech bottling devices. Just around the bend from the new-employee onboarding session sits a group of massive industrial tanks filled with the coconut, olive, and palm kernel oils used for Dr. Bronner's liquid soaps.</p><p>David Bronner, at 50, is lanky, lumbering, and low-talking, but has a brain that moves quickly. David is eager to talk about their spirituality and makes reference to \"that mystical Christian\" deep inside. Within a few minutes of taking the microphone at employee orientation, David will discuss more existentially heavy topics with this group of strangers than most people will address with their spouses over the course of a lifetime.</p><p>Dr. Bronner's has always been a family company, and present among the new employees and the Foamy Homies is David's younger brother and the company's president, Michael Bronner. On the periphery of the room is their brother-in-law Michael Milam, the company's COO, a brainy and straitlaced numbers guy with degrees in business and theology. And in the corner sits the matriarch, the company's long-running CFO, Trudy Bronner, Michael and David's 79-year-old mother. A Christian and a conservative, Trudy married into the family-and, eventually, the business-when she wed Emanuel's late son Jim in 1968. Today she gazes upon the scene with a faintly absent look that indicates she has grown desensitized to the idiosyncrasies of her eldest child. David is now talking about their spiritual journey and the idea of the divine. \"When you're ready,\" David tells the group, \"the divine is going to meet you.\"</p><p>The other topics David covers include, but are not limited to: their grandfather's failings as a father. Their Christian-Reaganite upbringing. The philosophical awakenings they experienced as a student at Harvard in the '90s. The hypocrisy of the criminal justice system. The promise of regenerative organic agriculture. The prolonged legal battle that Dr. Bronner's waged against the DEA after the company reformulated its liquid soap to include hemp seed oil in 1999. The production of olive oil in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The trip they took to Amsterdam after college, and, perhaps most crucially, the spiritual rebirth experienced there by way of psychedelics.</p><p>The trip was so mind-blowing that David has since made it their life mission-and eventually the company's-to drive efforts in the United States to legalize psychedelics, and more broadly, end the drug war. And they have succeeded, in spite of any skepticism and unease that some colleagues might have toward this trippy streak. In 2021 the company spent over $4.4 million on drug and psychedelics policy reform efforts, part of which helped pass a Colorado ballot measure last year to decriminalize certain psychedelics.</p><p>By the time David starts talking about metaphorical ego death and coming face-to-face with Jesus while under the influence of psychedelics, everyone in the room has become pretty inured to the far-out nature of the spiel. \"All of a sudden I'm talking to God, and I'm like, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wait a minute.</emphasis> If this love is real, and this is true, then why does it suck so bad? Why are there people being murdered and raped, and all of the worst stuff? Seeing the allness of it all&amp;#230;\" David trails off. \"And then seeing Jesus stepping in, just calm and compassionate. Not trying to explain, not trying to complain, just stepping in.</p><p>\"I was like, Wow, I want to be like that,\" they continue. \"That's what we're here to do. We're here to serve. We're part of the divine that can activate the divine, and stop that aggression and oppression and make peace on earth.\"</p><p>Can a soap company activate the divine? Dr. Bronner's has succeeded at realizing so many seemingly unfeasible visions over the last quarter century that it is not outside of the realm of possibility. Three decades ago, when Dr. Bronner's was a super-minty soap brand remembered fondly by washed-up hippies, all of this highfalutin talk was mostly still just talk. But in the years since Emanuel Bronner's progeny took over the business, Dr. Bronner's has quietly but self-assuredly evolved beyond its humble origins to become a legitimate titan of the beauty and cleaning industries as well as a household staple. The brand no longer relies on hippies passing Bronner's bottles between VW vans, seeing as how Gwyneth Paltrow and Meghan Markle openly profess their love for the lavender soap.</p><p>Growth is one thing, but Dr. Bronner's has managed to become a major player in its market while painstakingly encoding its ethics into every step of the production process. In fact, it could be argued that Emanuel Bronner predicted the current era of ethically minded business, and certainly ethically minded marketing. And now the humble soap brand finds itself at the vanguard of every philosophical and logistical question that American entrepreneurs are grappling with right now. All of its good deeds-from rigorously engineered fair trade supply chains to charitable donations and environmentally minded manufacturing-are thoroughly cataloged in the Dr. Bronner's annual public accountability report card, the All-One! Report.</p><p>These ideals are built into the complex corporate architecture of Dr. Bronner's-a certified Benefit Corporation as of 2015-and an agreement between David and Michael ensures that the business won't be sold off to a global conglomerate anytime soon. It's a fate that's befallen so many household-name natural health and food brands, many of which began to flourish in the same era following the late-'60s counterculture revolution that Dr. Bronner's did. It may seem easier than ever to stock your cabinets with granola-y, righteously sourced products, but that's only because they've been subsumed into the old corporate model: Tom's of Maine is now Colgate-Palmolive. Burt's Bees is Clorox. Trader Joe's is operated by the Albrechts, the family behind Aldi. And Bragg-of apple cider vinegar fame-was recently acquired by an investor group that included Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom. Perhaps the only other business similar in scale and ethical ambition is Patagonia, the company so steadfastly resistant to the conventional corporate model that its founder and his family transferred the company's ownership into a trust and nonprofit organization last year to insulate it from the forces of capitalism.</p><p>\"Most brands and companies our size sell out to some soulless conglomerate that has not a lot of ethics in the world,\" David Bronner says. \"We get to rock it how we want here.\"</p><p>\"Most brands and companies our size sell out to some soulless conglomerate that has not a lot of ethics in the world,\" David reminds the group. \"We get to rock it how we want here. Soap, work hard, rock that product, and then&amp;#230;joy. Drop the joy in there, make sure we're having fun while doing good in the world and making good products.\"</p><p>In this obscenely scam-ridden day and age, it is reasonable to assume that anyone sermonizing like this in the realm of business is one false step away from being exposed as a charlatan. But the Bronners genuinely do seem to, in the parlance of thought-leadership conferences, walk the walk. The combination of Christian clemency and drug-induced ego surrender is potent. The executives, despite ranging from the conservative to the progressive, have all agreed to cap their own executive salaries at five times the lowest-paid fully vested Dr. Bronner's employees, which means they cannot earn more than about $300,000 per year. It's a policy that frees up funds for a waterfall of annual charitable donations and, more importantly, an enviable company culture for its over 300 workers. Dr. Bronner's boasts the sort of employee benefits that would make Bezos shudder, including a health-insurance policy with company-paid premiums, bonuses, free daily vegan lunches prepared by the Foamy Homies, access to therapy, and, as of 2022, coverage of ketamine-assisted mental health treatment.</p><p>This bouquet of life-changing employee benefits is probably why, on the day of their initiation, the new employees of Dr. Bronner's seem rapt by David's pontification. They gamely participate in the celebratory session and erupt with applause when David wraps up their spiel.</p><p>\"We just get to live the dream here,\" David says. \"Thanks for joining the team. Right on.\"</p><p>There is one person present who can bring everyone down to earth a bit and remind the crowd that this, after all, is a job. This reminder arrives when David's mother, Trudy, takes the lectern. \"We do a lot of good, and we think we treat you right. And we expect you to work hard,\" she says. She points to a cluster of six core principles of Dr. Bronner's that have been printed onto the wall behind her. \"Every time I give a tour to little kids, it's like, What's the first thing you have to do to be a successful person, really? That's the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">work hard.</emphasis>\"</p><p>\"We are an unusual company,\" she adds, speaking almost as if she is addressing her sons as much as these new employees. \"Not every day will you have an experience like you had today.\"</p><p>\"I don't like to be joint-interviewed with my brother,\" Michael explains with a grin after the onboarding session, as we sit down at a picnic table outside. \"I love my brother, and we can rap back and forth, but when he's telling the story and I'm waiting for my chance to interject, he pivots to psychedelics. Like, no, we're not talking about the 1960s!\"</p><p>Michael is 48 and, in spite of the tie-dye T-shirt he's wearing today, is more buttoned up than David. He says they are \"85 percent the same,\" but the differences are meaningful. Warm, thoughtful, and possessed by so much nervous energy that he's capable of pacing seven miles over the course of a day while taking phone calls, Michael tells me that he's just started watching <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Succession.</emphasis> He cannot help but laugh at the family business of it all. (\"It's exactly what I <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">don't</emphasis> want to be,\" he says.) There are, of course, imperfect parallels to be spotted between the two families, chiefly the trio of siblings grappling with the future of their family business. (Michael and David's sister, Lisa, will arrive at headquarters later today.) Michael has a lightly adversarial relationship with his older sibling that mostly manifests as Michael affectionately trying to get a word in edgewise. But now, alone, he holds the floor, and he has plenty worthwhile to say.</p><p>We are ostensibly here to discuss his role as president of the company, but any discussion of Dr. Bronner's inevitably turns into a remembrance of family lore. \"I grew up with my grandfather being the man on the mountain,\" Michael tells me. \"It wasn't until I could literally understand Shakespeare that I could understand the depths of what he was talking about.\"</p><p>Dr. Emanuel Bronner loved aphorisms and slogans. The sermonizing soap bottles were so endemic to the Bronner brand that David eventually figured out how to create labels that wouldn't disintegrate in the shower. Today, the fine print of the label has become so iconic that it is often used in memes by people who want to signify that a rant is taking place.</p><p>Bronner-who adopted the \"Dr.\" title in his 30s-had good reason to fight for unity. Born into a family of Jewish soap-makers, he immigrated to the US from Germany in his early 20s, just over a decade before his own parents were killed in the Holocaust. As a young man, he began sharing his grandiose ambitions to unify the human race, preaching a little too vehemently for some people's liking. He was committed to Elgin State Insane Asylum, from which he eventually escaped. Once he settled in Southern California, he got in the habit of lecturing in LA's Pershing Square and doling out bottles of soap to his audience. When he realized some in his crowds were grabbing his soap without actually listening to his disquisitions, he began printing the Moral ABC on the label.</p><p>Decades later, after he'd gradually gone blind-a development he attributed to electroshock therapy he'd received as a young man-Emanuel was still single-mindedly fixated on the Moral ABC. When his small grandchildren came to visit him, he'd quiz them on these principles. \"He would basically lecture us with our feet dangling off the couch as if we were PhDs in comparative religion,\" says Michael. \"We'd be looking at the cracks in the ceiling, and he'd ask us, 'What's the 13th?' 'All-One, Grandpa!' \"</p><p>That the company would stay in the family was hardly a foregone conclusion. Emanuel's wife died young, and his sons, Jim and Ralph, were relegated to the foster system while Emanuel fervently promoted his All-One message. Jim remained semi-estranged from his father for most of his life. It was only when his sons and Trudy began to handle the Dr. Bronner's company that Emanuel's ambitious vision could be translated into a formidable business model. Even without his father's consistent physical presence, Jim inherited a passion for charity and a sense of feverish ingenuity. When he and Trudy took over the company-which had been in financial disrepair-they set about eventually transferring about a third of the business's worth over to the Boys and Girls Club of Escondido in the form of a large plot of land.</p><p>Years later, Jim's child David traveled their own circuitous path to the soap business. In 1997, in the aftermath of their Amsterdam awakening, David became a parent and moved back to California. They were toying with an idea that had once seemed preposterous: joining the family company. A year later, Jim died of lung cancer and David found themself in charge of Dr. Bronner's, which was still operating out of Jim and Trudy's home. Michael joined two years later. When the two set out to acquire a line of lip balms, they knew they needed someone a bit more logistically oriented to helm operations. They called Michael Milam, husband of youngest Bronner sibling, Lisa, and recruited him to move across the country and run production. Today he remains a key executive and a sensible counterweight to David and Michael. \"I'm here because they trust me, and because I don't think like them. They needed someone who&amp;#230;who knows how to close a drawer, I'll just say it that simply,\" Milam tells me wryly. \"The Bronner blood needs to marry into people who can close drawers.\"</p><p>Back when Jim married Trudy, he was partnering with someone who could close a drawer. It was Trudy, a former math teacher, who became the company's de facto bookkeeper in the late '80s, sorting out the haphazard finances and logistics. \"There were just boxes of stuff, randomly thrown together,\" she remembers. \"There was no oversight, no direction.&amp;#230; I'm not an accountant or a CPA, but since I was good with numbers, that was how I became the CFO.\"</p><p>Anyone who knew Trudy in those days would not have predicted her gradual warming to the drug-reform movement. Trudy had long treated her son's crusade for psychedelics with a healthy skepticism. You won't find her dropping acid anytime soon. (Trudy puts it bluntly: \"This is not my thing.\") And yet she was able to open herself up to ideas about criminal justice reform and psychedelic therapy when David showed her a fresh angle on the topic. They told the family: \"Look, I know you think I just want to go to Burning Man and take psychedelics, but this is really helping veterans,\" David remembers. \"Pretty early on, they understood that this is actually life-saving medicine. It's not just so David can go party.\" David might be the psychedelic guru of the bunch, but it was Michael who pushed his mother even further ideologically. It was deep into COVID, and even though Dr. Bronner's was doing more sales than ever-everyone wanted soap-Michael found himself in a depressive hole that couldn't be fully treated by antidepressants. David suggested he try ketamine-assisted therapy, and it worked. When he passed that information along to his mother, he says she took on a new understanding of psychedelic therapy.</p><p>\"We needed to make sure <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">the myth of my grandfather matched the actual product,\"</emphasis> says Michael Bronner of the company's efforts to remove artificial coloring and certify their soaps as organic.</p><p>\"I want to see decriminalization too,\" Michael says. \"But for David, it could be assumed that there's an ulterior agenda for him. He wants a lot of these things to be legalized because he wants to be able to do them freely.\"</p><p>Michael was able to get his mother's blessing on rolling out the ketamine benefits to their employees. During this process, she was tuned even closer to David's frequency. \"She even surprised me,\" David says. \"She was like, 'Yeah, we gotta end the drug war.' \"</p><p>When I ask Trudy about psychedelics later, I expect her to bristle, but she doesn't. \"If it can help people, then more power to it. I'm willing to listen,\" she says. Then she hearkens back to a story she told me earlier about sports coaches describing David as the most \"coachable\" athlete they'd ever worked with. \"Maybe I'm coachable too,\" she says.</p><p>At one point, I ask David how the company's new factory workers tend to feel about all the woo-woo of the business. They tell me a story. When they arrived at the company, David says, they came in with big ideas. They were <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">on fire,</emphasis> ready to hire a workforce composed of activists. Their father quickly disabused them of the notion. \"He was like, 'You need to humble yourself,' \" David says. \"It's a Mexican American and Catholic workforce.\" Then Jim asked his child what the most important part of the company was. David responded: The soap, the causes, the customers? Jim rebuffed them. \"He was like, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">No. No. No. It's the employees.</emphasis>\"</p><p>Then David returns to another parable. \"Someone asked a janitor at NASA, 'What are you doing?' And he said, 'Oh, I'm helping put a man on the moon.' \"</p><p>People love to grouse that we don't make anything in America anymore. Instead, we rely on grandiose ideas, clever marketing, and unorthodox CEOs to lather up excitement toward whatever speculative vision is in fashion at any given moment. This is part of the reason why American entrepreneurship has fallen into its current identity crisis: We are so detached from the reality of making things that we're relegated to the fantasy-lands of founders. We are so susceptible to being hoodwinked by charismatic entrepreneurs peddling unfulfillable promises that even the richest and most powerful elites can be swindled by a 30-year-old cryptocurrency idealist. There's an entire genre of streaming television dedicated to scammer CEOs. In the company's formative years, Emanuel openly admitted that the soap was merely a vessel for his All-One message. But a bit like the mythology- and marketing-minded founders of today, Emanuel Bronner didn't always live up to the virtuous ideals he promoted: In 1988, his son and daughter-in-law cleaned up a massive tax mess he'd left that had put him in bankruptcy. Later, when Emanuel's grandchildren took over the company, they discovered that the soap was not as natural as the label had advertised. Fixing his shortcomings was a massive undertaking. But it meant that the Bronner children and grandchildren learned some serious lessons about how to make good on ethical business promises-lessons that many corporations and investors are having to grapple with these days. \"First and foremost, we needed to make sure the myth of my grandfather matched the actual product,\" Michael Bronner remembers. They launched a yearslong process of removing artificial coloring and certifying their soaps as organic.</p><p>Given the virtuosic advertising sensibility that the Bronners have in their DNA, it would be easy to assume that marketing is a major expense in their business. And yet, they have historically spent very little on conventional advertising. They don't need to: David knows the value of a good stunt. Whether it's caging themself with hemp plants in front of the White House or helping fund a hotline for people to call when they're having bad trips, David understands the inherent value of messaging. David's title may be Cosmic Engagement Officer, but they also double as de facto marketing guru, working to benefit the company as well as causes David believes in.</p><p>And yet, behind all the generous charitable donations and the employees' interest in Burning Man, Dr. Bronner's remains at its core a company that manufactures a product that people love. Every step in the supply chain and assembly line has been painstakingly optimized to ensure that the soap is the cleanest, most ethical, and efficacious version it can possibly be. And all of the Bronner children, through the enthusiasms of their patrilineage and the decades of work experience they've had at the company, are intimately acquainted with every minute detail of their soapy birthright.</p><p>One afternoon, I tour the factory spaces with Michael Bronner and his sister, Lisa. Lisa is Michael Milam's wife, and perhaps the most straight-and-narrow of the siblings. She runs Going Green, the company's educational blog, where she advises readers on how to best clean stainless steel or wash a dog with Dr. Bronner's products. Together, the pair reminisce about the days when their father used to show up unsolicited and offer to help put out forest fires or contain fumes from chemical spills with the magic foam he'd invented. \"Area Man shows up to fight forest fire with foam,\" Michael says, still amused and in awe of his father's antics.</p><p>Jim's kooky ingenuity is still deep in the blood of the Bronners, who like to geek out over the subject of soap. As we walk into the main production building, Lisa explains the factory's soap reactors, which, thanks to expanding sales, keep being upsized. The new reactor, at 7,000 gallons, is so massive that the family had to cut a hole in the ceiling of the factory space and crane it into the building. \"Soap is such a simple, simple reaction,\" Lisa says. \"You could totally do this in your kitchen.\"</p><p>\"My brother was in a science fair in third grade, and he made soap out of cigarette ashes and butter. The poor judges had to wash with it. It does wash, but it leaves a really nasty smell,\" Michael explains. \"Cooking over a fire was when the first soaps were made. The fat from the meat would drip into the ashes.\"</p><p>Michael and Lisa bring me through the bar-soap manufacturing area. \"Ohhh, they're doing almond today!\" Lisa exclaims, inhaling deeply. \"I love the almond.\"</p><p>We head toward the bar-soap mills, where extra-long bricks are pumped out and then guillotined into smaller portions. \"Smells and looks just like marzipan,\" Michael says.</p><p>\"With a cheese grater, you grate a bar of soap and it looks exactly like mozzarella,\" Lisa says. For a few moments, it's as if the two have been transformed into children invited to Willy Wonka's factory, delighting in each sensory detail of the complex machinery and the magical products they manufacture in front of their very eyes.</p><p>Lisa tells us about an article she read recently about a woman who'd been buried in highly alkaline soil two centuries ago. \"They exhumed her, and her body had turned into soap,\" on account of a reaction with fats in the human body.</p><p>\"That,\" Michael says, \"is how I want to go.\"</p><p>CARRIE BATTAN<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">is a writer in New York.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GQ-00166979_GQ_0723_07</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GQ2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68J8-H9B1-JDMC-117W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338866</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4622\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Conde Nast Publications All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>GQ</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59733\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issn>ISSN: 0016-6979</issn><volume>Vol. 93</volume><issueNumber>No. 4</issueNumber><publicationDate month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>0Summer 2023</dateText><date month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"/><date month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"/></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>MAGAZINE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Charles W. Herbster came VERY close despite tremendous headwinds!' </p><p><br/>But answering why Herbster lost, and how Pillen won, is more complex than the national narrative questioning whether Trump's hold on Republican politics might be waning. Following are observations and analysis based on interviews with political scientists and reporting from the campaign trail. <br/> Three things Herbster did wrong <br/>Nebraska gubernatorial candidate Charles Herbster gives an interview to One America News Network before former President Donald Trump's rally in Greenwood, Nebraska. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner) <br/>First, Herbster spent less time on the campaign trail than either of his top competitors, Pillen and State Sen. Brett Lindstrom. Herbster instead was the first candidate to run TV ads. <br/>Herbster campaigned in person only a handful of days each month until March, based on internal campaign schedules and other information confirmed with former Herbster campaign staffers. In at least a third of Nebraska's counties, no record shows Herbster attending a campaign event during this cycle. <br/>Being there matters in rural Nebraska. In the sprawling 3rd Congressional District, voters prefer meeting candidates face to face. Third District voters made up 47% of the GOP's vote for governor this year, and Pillen won the district. <br/>Second, the Conklin Co. CEO tried to nationalize the governor's race, focusing on the Trump endorsement and talking about national issues, including repeating Trump's claim that the 2020 election was rigged. He emphasized critical race theory, the government's pandemic response and illegal immigration. <br/>Herbster rarely articulated a clear plan for Nebraska, other than saying he wanted to help market the state.  <br/>Critics said he told different audiences what he thought they wanted to hear.On taxes, for example, he expressed support for a consumption tax to offset property taxes with some rural audiences. He told some urban audiences he preferred an 'all-of-the-above' approach, including income tax cuts. <br/>Third, with his TV ads, Herbster waited too long to define himself in a positive light and spent more time criticizing Pillen, his top opponent, political observers said. <br/>Nebraskans often recoil from negative ads when they are easily tied to a particular candidate running them, said Paul Landow, a political scientist at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. <br/>Herbster also ran an ad attacking State Sen. Julie Slama[2], who has accused Herbster of groping her at a political dinner in 2019. He has denied any wrongdoing and has sued her. She responded by counter-suing him. <br/>He spent much of his ad time defending himself for making late property tax payments, for owning businesses and homes outside Nebraska, for groping allegations made by eight women[3], including Slama, and for suggesting eliminating sales tax exemptions. In other words, Herbster spent a lot of time pushing back against criticism, said John Hibbing, a political scientist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. <br/>Herbster was more positive and less of a flame-thrower on the stump until the race's final weeks, when he struck a more aggressive tone, alleging conspiracies against his candidacy[4]. <br/>'I think Nebraskans in general are pretty fair-minded people, and I think that in the case of Herbster, they were easily able to separate the bull [expletive deleted] from the reality,' Landow said of voters. 'They act as referees in these kinds of contests, and here they saw a foul, and they blew the whistle.' <br/> Three things Pillen did right <br/><br/>First, Pillen spent the bulk of his campaign on the road. The Columbus-area hog producer and University of Nebraska regent made more than 400 in-person appearances, reaching all 93 Nebraska counties. <br/>He campaigned often in small-group settings, at restaurants, community centers and churches. He made 30 appearances with the Nebraska Farm Bureau, which endorsed him. He had additional help from Americans for Prosperity. <br/> Jim Pillen, a NebraskaGOP gubernatorial candidate, speaks during a town hall forum hosted by his campaign and the Nebraska Farm Bureau at Pals Brewing Co. in North Platte, Nebraska. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner) <br/>Pillen focused attention on the state's second- and third-tier cities, including North Platte, Beatrice and Fremont. That type of approach has helped candidates win before in close GOP primaries, Hibbing said. The results showed in a geographic analysis[5] done by Nebraska Public Media. <br/>Second, Pillen took advantage of his access to the statewide network of contacts, volunteers and campaign staff tied to Gov. Pete Ricketts and other supporters in the Nebraska political establishment. <br/>They helped Pillen notch a win in Lancaster County, home to NU's main campus, despite the candidate criticizing the university. <br/>Third, Pillen campaigned as a hard-core conservative. His views on issues echoed many of Herbster's political stands, including opposing critical race theory and illegal immigration. On abortion, Pillen said he wanted to outlaw it in Nebraska. <br/>Observers said early on that it looked like Pillen was crowding a lane already occupied by Herbster, but without Trump's endorsement. The strategy ended up proving smart, Hibbing said. <br/>Pillen offered a safe harbor to conservative voters who liked Herbster's confrontational style, but with less drama when scandals kept hitting Herbster near the end of the race. <br/>'Nebraskans are pretty big on Trump's policy positions,' Hibbing said. 'If they can get that without all the drama, then why not?' <br/>Said Landow: 'Pillen appeared to be as conservative as Herbster, but a nice-guy alternative.' <br/> Three outside factors <br/><br/>First, outside money played an outsized role in the race. Ricketts and other donors spent nearly $3 million on third-party TV ads that attacked Herbster and Lindstrom. That let Pillen focus ads on his own message, rather than spending advertising time criticizing an opponent. <br/> State Sen. Brett Lindstrom speaks with a potential donor during a fundraiser in Omaha last week. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner) <br/>Lindstrom gained momentum until he faced about $1.7 million in attack ads. He couldn't afford to push back to defend attacks on his legislative voting record. <br/>Herbster faced about $1.2 million in negative outside TV ads. They reinforced concerns about Herbster enough that he had to spend advertising money and time defending himself. <br/>All told, Herbster spent about $12 million on the primary[6], including more than $11 million of his money. Pillen spent more than $8 million, mostly from donors. Lindstrom spent $2.6 million. <br/>Second, one of the most unusual outside factors in the race: the sheer number of fires Herbster had to fight during the race.  <br/>He paid his property taxes late nearly 600 times[7] over more than two decades, which became the subject of negative ads. <br/>He was dogged with questions about whether his primary residence was in Nebraska or Missouri. Ricketts and others criticized him for operating his largest business, Conklin Co., out of state, in Missouri and Minnesota. <br/>At Trump's urging, as Politico reported[8], Herbster and his campaign team reacted so aggressively to the women's groping allegations that he kept the story alive for most of the final month. <br/>The allegations led all 13 women in the Nebraska Legislature to call on Herbster to quit the race. Several of them created a fund[9] to pay the legal costs of people making credible allegations against him. <br/> Former State Sen. Theresa Thibodeau, a Republican from Omaha, is campaigning for governor of Nebraska. (Courtesy of Thibodeau for Governor) <br/>Herbster also was dealing with Theresa Thibodeau, who quit the campaign as his running mate and later criticized him as being poorly prepared[10] to run for office. She stood up for the women accusing Herbster of groping. Thibodeau finished ahead of Lindstrom in Dundy, Hayes, Loup, McPherson, Perkins and Valley Counties, rural areas where Herbster needed votes. <br/>'There were all these brush fires that were significant but, taken one at a time, could possibly have been handled,' Landow said. 'But when they all blew up together, you ended up with a major forest fire that was impossible to fight.' <br/>The race's third outside factor of note was Trump's endorsement, which propelled Herbster into frontrunner position in October. <br/>Trump visited Nebraska late in the race[11] and held a telephone town hall for Herbster. Several of Trump's former lieutenants, including Kellyanne Conway, Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie, worked for or with Herbster's campaign. <br/>Some political observers questioned whether Trump endorsed Herbster too soon in what was sure to be a competitive open primary. Herbster spent months advertising that he was Trump's favored candidate. <br/><br/>That left little room for the big bounce Trump has given other candidates in competitive GOP races by endorsing later in the election cycle, including the U.S. Senate primary in Ohio. <br/>Hibbing said the Trump endorsement was important no matter when it came. Part of Herbster's problem, he said, is that it appears 'he thought that was all he needed.' <br/>Said Landow: 'I think that Trump's endorsement was really important for Herbster, but it wasn't enough. The forest fire overtook him, and even Trump couldn't put it out.' <br/> GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX <br/><br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://nebraskaexaminer.com/subscribe\">https://nebraskaexaminer.com/subscribe</url><br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/05/10/pillen-snatches-victory-from-trump-pick-herbster-in-nebraskas-gop-gubernatorial-primary/\">https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/05/10/pillen-snatches-victory-from-trump-pick-herbster-in-nebraskas-gop-gubernatorial-primary/</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/04/28/herbster-targets-groping-accuser-slama-in-paid-campaign-tv-ad-perhaps-a-first-in-nebraska/\">https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/04/28/herbster-targets-groping-accuser-slama-in-paid-campaign-tv-ad-perhaps-a-first-in-nebraska/</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/04/14/gop-state-senator-seven-other-women-say-charles-herbster-groped-them-he-denies-allegations/\">https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/04/14/gop-state-senator-seven-other-women-say-charles-herbster-groped-them-he-denies-allegations/</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/04/21/charles-herbster-continues-to-say-groping-allegations-are-false-politically-motivated/\">https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/04/21/charles-herbster-continues-to-say-groping-allegations-are-false-politically-motivated/</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://nebraskapublicmedia.org/en/news/news-articles/map-nebraska-republicans-voted-along-geographic-lines/\">https://nebraskapublicmedia.org/en/news/news-articles/map-nebraska-republicans-voted-along-geographic-lines/</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://nebraskaexaminer.com/briefs/in-nebraska-gop-governors-race-pillen-outraises-opponents-herbster-self-funds-lindstrom-a-strong-third/\">https://nebraskaexaminer.com/briefs/in-nebraska-gop-governors-race-pillen-outraises-opponents-herbster-self-funds-lindstrom-a-strong-third/</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.3newsnow.com/news/investigations/nebraskas-charles-herbster-paid-property-taxes-late-nearly-600-times\">https://www.3newsnow.com/news/investigations/nebraskas-charles-herbster-paid-property-taxes-late-nearly-600-times</url> [ 8]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/28/trumps-risky-primary-play-rallying-for-a-longtime-ally-accused-of-sexual-misconduct-00028611\">https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/28/trumps-risky-primary-play-rallying-for-a-longtime-ally-accused-of-sexual-misconduct-00028611</url> [ 9]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/04/26/four-state-senators-raising-money-for-womens-defense-in-wake-of-allegations-against-herbster/\">https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/04/26/four-state-senators-raising-money-for-womens-defense-in-wake-of-allegations-against-herbster/</url> [ 10]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/03/28/ex-running-mate-former-staffers-call-herbster-unfit-to-be-nebraska-governor/\">https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/03/28/ex-running-mate-former-staffers-call-herbster-unfit-to-be-nebraska-governor/</url> [ 11]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/05/01/trump-rallies-for-herbster-defends-fortenberry-and-attacks-bacon-sasse/\">https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/05/01/trump-rallies-for-herbster-defends-fortenberry-and-attacks-bacon-sasse/</url></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Incredibly, this film (out October 28 on Netflix) is his first since 'Coraline' back in 2009. For a while it seemed like Selick, whose singular genius was responsible for 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' and the animated intrudes in Wes Anderson's 'The Life Aquatic' (among other things), would never make another movie. Thankfully that isn't the case. </p><p><br/>'Wendell &amp; Wild,' based on an original idea of Selick's, concerns two demons (voiced by Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key) who work in a hellish theme park amongst the 'souls of the danged' (according to Selick they aren't quite as bad as the souls of the damned). Together, the demons attempt to utilize a human child named Kat (voiced by Lyric Ross) as their ticket to the land of the living. Imagine 'Beetlejuice' but with a wider variety of influences (including, crucially, Afro-Punk music) and, you know, entirely animated in stop-motion. <br/>After talking with Selick, the existence of 'Wendell &amp; Wild' feels like a miracle. The story of how it came to be is just as frightful as anything Selick could have dreamed up. <br/>NEW TRAILER HERE <br/>What Happened to Selick's Pixar Projects <br/>'Coraline,' since it was the last feature project that Selick completed, is as good a place as any to start when it comes to explaining where the director has been for the past decade. Based on the novel by Neil Gaiman, 'Coraline' was released in February 2009. It was warmly received by critics and wound up a modest box office hit, grossing more than $100 million on a $60 million budget. It also formally announced the arrival of LAIKA, a stop-motion animation studio based in Portland, Oregon (it was formerly known as Will Vinton Studios), as a major player. It was assumed that Selick would stick around LAIKA, since they shared his dedication to stop-motion and his somewhat macabre sensibilities. <br/> Also Read: <br/> The 7 Best New Movies on Netflix in September 2022[1]  <br/><br/>But a year later, in an unprecedented move, Disney announced a long-term deal with Selick, along with two feature projects - an original stop-motion film called 'Shademaker' (later retitled 'The Shadow King') and an adaptation of Neil Gaiman's 'The Graveyard Book' (a riff on 'The Jungle Book' but with monsters instead of giant cats). What's more, Selick's stop-motion unit, known as Cinderbiter, would be a subsidiary of Pixar. The warehouse where production would take place wouldn't be far from Pixar's sprawling campus in Emeryville. ('The Nightmare Before Christmas' was also produced in the bay area.) It would also reunite Selick with his old CAL Arts chum John Lasseter. Sadly, this wasn't meant to be. <br/>'We developed it pretty far, we went into production, had shot about five minutes, and they went through a big a shuffle, a big change, at Disney,' Selick told TheWrap about how far 'The Shadow King' got. 'Two things: the budget kept going up, because John Lasseter couldn't help but come in and change everything every few months, because that's who he is, and maybe that's how the best work has been done there. At the end of the day, it was costing too much and it was stop-motion. It was a little weird and they decided to pull the plug. Never saw it coming, but it was also a relief, because to constantly start over and over and over while you're trying to give people work to do out on the stage, was a challenge.' <br/>The fact that the project was stop-motion, which was the major selling point (interestingly Pixar had attempted to buy Will Vinton Studios before it became LAIKA) was now a liability. The feature became a bug. 'There had been three stop-motion films that had come out right before that. 'Frankenweenie' was the last of them,' Selick explained. 'None of them were very successful at the box office, so it was decided. It happened with me before, it probably will again. Stop-motion, why would we take a chance on this ancient technology?' <br/>Netflix<br/>Of course, death of what would be known as 'The Shadow King' would also impact 'The Graveyard Book,' which in the years since Selick's deal began has cycled through a number of filmmakers (currently Marc Foster is attempting to bring it to life). 'That went away as well, but they still never cracked it,' Selick said. (He claims he did crack it and knew how to tell the story.) Disney publicly announced an $80 million write-down on the projects and returned the rights to 'The Shadow King' to Selick. He never found someone who was interested in finishing the project. <br/>'As far as what I went through, it took a long time to get back on my feet to try to get something else going again. I just felt, Wow, if they'll shut down a movie when you've already started That was something I couldn't have imagined,' Selick said. 'It just made me really leery of trying to do something else.' <br/>That is, until he met Jordan Peele. <br/> Also Read: <br/> 'Nope' VFX Supervisor Reveals Secrets of Jordan Peele's Horror Epic: From Gordy to Jean Jacket[2]  <br/><br/>The Big Comeback <br/>Before 'Get Out,' Selick had met with Peele, who was in the process of establishing his production company, Monkeypaw. Selick pitched a few ideas, including one idea that Selick had originally thought might make a good book - the idea that would eventually become 'Wendell &amp; Wild.' At first, Peele was anxious to set the movie up before he filmed 'Get Out,' unsure of whether the movie would connect with audiences and worried that he might be squandering his one chance at directing. Oh how wrong he was. Peele would win the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay (it was also nominated for Best Picture and Best Director) and the film made more than $255 million on a budget of $4.5 million. Last year the Writer's Guild of America named Peele's script for 'Get Out' the best screenplay of the 21st century. <br/>'There were two main things that were in our favor,' Selick said. '#8216;Get Out' was great and it was a huge hit, so everyone wanted to be in business with him. We had a good tailwind, but more importantly, we didn't go to many places, because we knew everyone wants to meet Jordan about anything, but there really were only going to be a few places who would take a chance on an unusual film like this. Netflix was one of them and they said all the right things. They said, 'We don't just develop films. If we like your project, if we like you, when we say 'Yes' it's basically a green light that we will make this film.'' Selick added: 'We did go to hell and back, but they held true. They made the film, they supported the film.' <br/>Selick admits that 'there were plenty of bumps along the way' in the production of 'Wendell &amp; Wild,' chiefly that they had secured their deal before Netflix had formally installed animation executives at the company. When the new executives came in, largely comprised of former DreamWorks employees, they were somewhat shocked at the deal Selick and Peele had secured. They were particularly startled by the movie's PG-13 rating. 'They just couldn't imagine that an animated film would work as PG-13, but they worked hard at adjusting. The collaboration was rough at first, but we got to a really good place,' Selick said. 'It only took a year, but we got in tune with each other, in terms of studio creativity.' <br/> Also Read: <br/> 7 Spooky Netflix Shows to Watch to Kick Off the Fall Season[3]  <br/><br/>Not that there weren't disagreements. 'One of the biggest fights I had with the studio was They kept saying, 'Couldn't you have Kat smile a little earlier in the film?' I said, 'No, that's not who she is. She can't do that until she's in another place and she will be. That just betrays who she is,'' Selick said. (Kat's parents are killed in a car accident early in the film.) 'She's a badass, and she's got a reason to be,' Selick said. <br/>When I asked if he had ever considered making 'Wendell &amp; Wild' an R-rated movie, since Netflix has an adult animation division, he said no. 'The story itself didn't lend itself to that and that seemed like a bridge too far,' Selick said. 'Other stories might work well within an R-rating, but this one didn't need it.' His personal philosophy when working on projects like 'Wendell &amp; Wild' is to 'scare, not scar' his younger audiences. <br/>Earlier this year another new executive, Karen Tolliver, was brought on to oversee all of Netflix's animation output, formerly of Sony Pictures Animation. 'She had some strong ideas about the music, about the songs, and I was just like, I want to be done, I've been on this show for so long, but she's smart and they were really good ideas,' Selick said. 'They spent more money and we were able to bring back some needle drop songs that we had had to lose, because they weren't free.' <br/>After a test screening for 'Wendell &amp; Wild' 'knocked it out of the park' with a certain age group (10 to 14), they spent another month-and-a-half 'recutting and shifting,' according to Selick, to make it more accessible to an older age group. 'It really helped the film,' Selick said. <br/>There was also the pandemic. <br/>Netflix<br/>Much has been written about how computer-animated projects like Disney's 'Turning Red' or 'Encanto' were mostly completed at home, with artists toiling away in their kitchenettes or living rooms to make it to the finish line. 'Wendell &amp; Wild' didn't have that luxury. 'We have to shoot stuff on a stage, so we had to shut down. We did what work we could from home, but then we finally reopened the studio, and all that stuff. The masks, the social distancing, and no more than this many people in.' Selick said that stop-motion is a challenging enough way to make a film and that the pandemic (and the precautions associated with the pandemic) just added to it. There were also, he noted 'a few other natural disasters we faced,' including a runaway forest fire. <br/>Selick produced 'Wendell &amp; Wild' in the Portland area (near where 'Coraline' was produced), a place where forest fires are becoming more prevalent. 'We had a forest fire that was getting so close, we had to evacuate the puppets,' Selick said, referring to the characters in the movie. (Each one is a 'puppet' with a metal skeleton that is manipulated, one frame at a time. Just like Ray Harryhausen used to do it.) 'We thought, It's coming closer and closer, if the studio burns down, what do we need to keep in order to still make the film,' Selick said. Then they realized: 'All the puppets, because they're very expensive, take a lot of time to build, and they're our actors.' The puppets were loaded into cars and driven 'away to safety.' The fire fizzled before it hit the studio and the puppets were safe. Whew. <br/>An Uncertain Future <br/>Before talking to Selick, he did a presentation about 'Wendell &amp; Wild.' Towards the end of the presentation he said something that struck me. It was a simple phrase. But it made my blood run cold. 'If I make another movie,' Selick said, before elaborating on some other topic. I brought this up to him. The world needs more Henry Selick movies. And he turns 70 in November. <br/>'It's always been a battle. I mean the first one wasn't, because it was a gift to Tim Burton,' Selick said, referring to 'The Nightmare Before Christmas.' Burton was a former Disney animator who had left the studio and made it big with hits like 'Batman' and 'Beetlejuice.' Disney wanted him back, so they asked if he wanted to expand a concept he had originally worked on at the studio (and which Disney still controlled): a holiday special in the style of the old Rankin/Bass productions. Burton agreed and installed Selick as the director. The resulting film was so dark that Disney removed their name; it was initially released as a Touchstone Pictures film. In the years since it has become one of the most beloved properties in Disney's vast library; a Halloween stage show at Walt Disney World has 'Nightmare Before Christmas' character Zero interacting with Mickey, Goofy and Donald. <br/>'We did it for a pretty low budget and I was protected. I would get notes and I'd say, 'Tim, what do I do?' He said, 'If you like it, do it. Otherwise, ignore it.' I thought that's how life would be. For my first film, we got total artistic support and I thought it would always be that way,' Selick said. 'It didn't happen again until I did 'Coraline.'' Selick's next project for Disney, a mostly stop-motion adaptation of Roald Dahl's 'James and the Giant Peach' (featuring striking design work by children's book illustrator Lane Smith), was constantly second-guessed. And by Selick's own admission, on his big budget hybrid project 'Monkeybone' starring Brendan Fraser (this time for Fox), he 'crashed and burned.' 'Only in 'Coraline' did I get that full artistic support and I know that, when I get it, my work is better and it's more successful,' Selick said. <br/> Also Read: <br/> The 7 Best New Movies on Hulu in September 2022[4]  <br/><br/>Selick doesn't sound like he demands artistic support and the freedom to do what he wants. He never comes across as temperamental or blustery. He just feels like, if he did a good job with minimal supervision that he would be allowed the same luxuries on the following project. 'After 'Coraline,' I couldn't get that support again, because of the team I was working with, so it took forever to get another film up and going. I look back to 'Coraline,' I would've thought I should've easily been able to make my film after that. It turned out not to be the case,' Selick said. 'With this film currently, we have to see, how does the world respond to it?' <br/>As of now he still has the rights to another Gaiman project; he wouldn't tell me which one but said it was 'based on his best book.' (My best guess is 'Neverwhere.') He's hopeful that he will remain in partnership with Netflix too, even though he admits 'they're going through upheaval, adjustments and changes.' Gaiman has more cache than when Selick made 'Coraline,' something that the director is keen to take advantage of. 'He's actually learned to navigate the system and he's a filmmaker now. He brings a lot of oomph to it,' Selick said. 'Right now, let's wait and see how the world responds [to 'Wendell &amp; Wild'].' <br/>What is very clear is that what happened at Pixar still affects him - and how he approaches projects even now. 'I can't go through what I had to go through after 'Coraline,' to be shut down,' Selick said. 'How do you know, once you start a film, Are they going to let me finish it?' <br/>Finally, Selick concedes: 'I could tell a few more stories. I've got a couple of things, but I'm not counting on them. We'll see.' Like all of Selick's movies, the statement is somewhat uplifting but still couched in sadness, tinged with melancholy.

As the program evolved, a fourth manufacturer, Nova Bus, was added to the program who would bring in three additional e-buses for the extensive testing. Currently five e-buses have arrived. The rest of seven will be delivered by the end of 2022.</p><p>\"San Francisco will continue to find ways to make our transportation fleet greener and cleaner, while still providing reliable service across our entire City,\" said Mayor London Breed. \"Electrifying our transit sector is an essential part of our Climate Action Plan goals of getting to net-zero emissions by 2040.\"</p><p>Prior to the launch, the e-buses were tested on some of our most challenging routes. The new coaches will be serving the 9 San Bruno, 22 Fillmore, 29 Sunset and 44 O'Shaughnessy lines. The three battery-electric buses, one each from New Flyer, BYD USA, and Proterra, will be running on the same line each day to gather data on how they respond to the challenges of revenue service across our unique geographic terrain.</p><p>\"Muni already has the greenest fleet in North America, especially our trolleybuses that pull power direct from Hetch Hetchy into their powerful, hill-climbing engines, said Jeff Tumlin, SFMTA Director of Transportation. \"This pilot will test to see how battery-electric buses perform relative to our hybrids, and how we should invest to meet SFMTA goals under the City's Climate Action Plan.\"</p><p>Leading up to this launch, the SFMTA has been working with PGandE to complete and update the charging infrastructure, called ChargePoint Express Plus, needed to power our new battery electric fleet. Each bus takes about four hours to charge and the electrical support equipment is enclosed within the Electrical Equipment Center directly adjacent to the charging stations. To date, we have nine of 12 charging stations completed, which are powered by Hetch Hetchy Power. The three remaining chargers are currently in fabrication and anticipated to be delivered in spring 2022. Construction will continue once the three chargers arrive. The overall completion of the installation project is expected for summer 2022.</p><p>As of 2019, 47 percent of San Francisco's greenhouse gas emissions are generated by the transportation sector which is heavily reliant on carbon intensive fossil fuels. Our reliance on harmful fossil fuels is changing the earth's climate and contributes to extreme weather events, increased forest fire risk and sea level rise.</p><p>However, the SFMTA continues to be a leader in providing safe and sustainable transportation options. The SFMTA's energy-efficient Muni fleet contributes less than two percent of the sector's emissions and moves approximately 700,000 every day! Today, the SFMTA operates the greenest transit system of any major city in North America</p><p>###</p><p>Program Background</p><p>We are committed to ensuring that BEBs can deliver the same standard of reliability and service as our current hybrid-electric bus fleet. In recent years, the transit industry has witnessed significant progress in battery-electric technology. However, the question remains of whether BEBs can handle San Francisco's heavy transit ridership and hilly routes. To answer this question, the SFMTA continues to evaluate the battery-electric bus program.</p><p>The BEB program serves as an important step towards achieving the greater goals of an all-electric fleet outlined in the SFMTA's Zero Emission Bus Rollout Plan and a carbon-neutral San Francisco by 204 50. Additionally, this project contributes to the City's Climate Action Strategy goals and supports the City's voter-approved Transit-First Policy established in 1973.</p><p>Environmental Commitment</p><p>San Francisco is committed to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 204 50. The SFMTA, which has operated a network of zero-emission vehicles for almost 85 years, is playing a key role in achieving this goal. Throughout our agency's history, we have consistently and proactively pursued and implemented the latest in green transportation technologies. Today, the SFMTA accounts for less than two percent of the City's transportation related GHG emissions and operates the greenest transit system of any major city in North America.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125022015</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64ST-JS61-DYTH-G424-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"793\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"02\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>February 14, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Tom Carper, D-Delaware, chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, issued the following opening statement at a May 25, 2022, confirmation hearing for Joseph Goffman to be assistant administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p>\"We are here to consider the nomination of Joe Goffman to serve as Assistant Administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation at the Environmental Protection Agency.</p><p>\"Joe, welcome back to the EPW Committee. While I know this hearing room brings back memories from your time working with us on this committee, today you join us as a nominee. Thank you for being here and for your willingness to serve our nation at this critical point in our history. Before I talk about Mr. Goffman's experience and qualifications, let me begin by setting the table for what's at stake with his nomination.</p><p>\"Make no mistake, we have come a long way in terms of reducing air pollution and doing so without harming our nation's economy. Since Congress passed the historic Clean Air Act of 1970, we have reduced our nation's soot and smog pollution by nearly 80 percent, while our gross domestic product grew by more than 250 percent, adjusting for inflation.</p><p>\"Along the way, we have found that cleaner air is an enormous benefit to all Americans, with the benefits outweighing the costs by nearly 30 to 1.</p><p>\"Yet, despite all our successes, many of the most vulnerable Americans still breathe unhealthy air, especially those living in disadvantaged and low-income communities. According to EPA's research, nonwhite children today are much more likely to die from air pollution than white children in our country.</p><p>\"We have a moral imperative to do more to help all Americans breathe healthy air. And, we can no longer turn a blind eye to downwind and frontline communities.</p><p>\"At the same time, we have a moral imperative to do all we can to save this planet that we call home from the perils of climate change. But, we are running out of time to change course before it's too late.</p><p>\"Last month, the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that it is 'now or never' if we are going to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and avoid a future with disastrous, irreversible climate impacts.</p><p>\"Communities across our country and the planet are already feeling the impacts of climate change in the form of rising sea levels, historic droughts, and other extreme weather.</p><p>\"Just last week, the National Weather Service released its seasonal outlook. It predicted that the drought gripping the American West and fueling record-breaking wildfires would persist throughout the summer. As we gather here today, the state of New Mexico continues to battle the worst forest fire in its history.</p><p>\"To put it simply, the climate crisis is here. We are at a critical point when it comes to addressing this crisis and mobilizing our nation towards a better future by transitioning away from fossil fuels and deploying cleaner technologies.</p><p>\"Fortunately, we have an EPA under the Biden Administration -- in particular, the Office of Air and Radiation -- that's willing to follow the law and tackle these great clean air and climate challenges that lay in front of us.</p><p>\"With all of this said, it's clear the Assistant Administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation has an outsized impact on our lives -- from protecting Americans from planet-warming pollution to cleaning up air toxics to improving vehicle emissions standards.</p><p>\"President Biden selected Joe Goffman to lead this office because he knows that Mr. Goffman is up to the task. Throughout his time at EPA, Joe Goffman has demonstrated his commitment to following the law in a way that provides cleaner air and a safer climate for all, while also providing predictability and certainty for industry -- predictability and certainty are always top priorities for businesses.</p><p>\"A great example of this is Mr. Goffman's integral role in the crafting of the Mercury and Air Toxics Rule while he was at EPA under the Obama Administration. This rule helped reduce mercury and other air toxic emissions from our nation's power plants by 90 percent, protecting the health of pregnant women and children across our nation.</p><p>\"Despite early industry concerns the rule would cause blackouts, there were not any. In fact, the rule was achieved by every utility in the country on time and under budget. Today every major utility organization supports the rule. It has enabled us to achieve major health benefits across this country, which is fundamental to job creation and preservation. This is just one example of why Mr. Goffman is so deeply respected and highly qualified for the job at hand.</p><p>\"Joe has garnered broad support from the environmental community and industry. This includes utility organizations like the Edison Electric Institute, biofuel groups such as the Renewable Fuels Association, Tribal organizations like the National Tribal Air Association, as well as some of our largest unions, including the AFL-CIO.</p><p>\"Even the United Mine Workers, our nation's largest union of coal miners, have voiced their support for Mr. Goffman's nomination to lead the Office of Air and Radiation.</p><p>\"Having worked with Mr. Goffman, I know he is well prepared for this role. He is a life-long public servant with nearly a decade of experience at the Office of Air and Radiation, as well as several stints on our EPW committee, including working for me. He also spent time as a staffer for former Senator Joe Lieberman.

The fire is about 85% contained, with firefighters aiming to limit its spread to 15,175 acres, McLaughlin added. <br/>The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in a 2019 report[1] identified the wildfire risk in that area as 'extreme' because of its proliferation of grasses, shrubs, trees, and other 'wildfire fuel hazards.' <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-21-at-6.16.20-PM.png\">https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-21-at-6.16.20-PM.png</url> (Courtesy N.J. Department of Environmental Protection) <br/>The blaze serves as an urgent reminder for state environmental officials of the need for good forest management, including the removal of invasive species and tree-thinning to reduce vegetation that can fuel fires, one environmentalist said. <br/>'It was only a matter of time before we had that kind of fire,' said Jeff Tittel, a longtime environmental activist from Hunterdon County. 'They're just lucky it's in the middle of Wharton State Forest and not in like Manchester in Ocean County, where there are thousands of people.' <br/>Investigators early on suspected a lightning strike during the stormy holiday weekend ignited the fire but soon discovered remnants of a campfire someone set illegally in an area not sanctioned for fires, McLaughlin said. <br/>Investigators from the New Jersey State Police, Office of Emergency Management, New Jersey State Park Police, and county prosecutors' offices now are trying to identify the culprit, who could be ordered to pay restitution if found guilty, McLaughlin said. <br/>Officials haven't yet determined how much it has cost the state and local municipalities to fight the blaze. <br/>There's legislation now pending that would address some of these issues. <br/>One bill[2] would require the Department of Environmental Protection to reimburse local municipalities for costs incurred in responding to emergencies in state parks and forests. Another[3] would award local governments state grants up to $1,500 to implement a forest stewardship plan. <br/>New Jersey has almost 2 million acres of forests, accounting for 40% of the state's total land area, according to the Department of Environmental Protection.Wharton State Forest is the biggest one, sprawling over more than 110,000 acres. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Heminghaus_wharton-fire_022-scaled.jpg\">https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Heminghaus_wharton-fire_022-scaled.jpg</url> The command post off State Route 206 near Wharton State Forest Shamong on June 20, 2022.(Daniella Heminghaus for New Jersey Monitor) Wildfire season longer <br/><br/>The wildfire is the state's largest since 2007, when a flare deployed during a military exercise at the Air National Guard's Warren Grove bombing range sparked a blaze that burned 17,000 acres, prompted thousands to evacuate, and damaged or destroyed more than 50 homes. <br/>The ongoing Wharton wildfire comes at a time when climate change has slowly extended New Jersey's fire season, which once ran from mid-March to late May, McLaughlin said. <br/>'We're starting to see our fire seasons shift and become less seasonal, and perhaps more year-round or more extended,' he said. <br/>A longer fire season hasn't resulted in more fires, though. About 1,000 wildfires occur on average every year, down from about 1,500 annually 20 years ago, McLaughlin said. <br/>Most stay small, burning less than five acres, he said. 'Major' wildfires \u2014 those that spread to more than 100 acres \u2014 generally only occur two or three times a year, he added. <br/>And most are started by humans, whether accidentally or intentionally, McLaughlin said. <br/>Tittel called on policymakers to restrict development in or near forests, saying over-pumping the aquifer that provides water to homes and businesses dries out soil and increases wildfire risks. <br/>'We should be limiting public access in those high-risk areas too, or we're going to end up having more and more fires \u2014 and they're going to get worse as the planet and our climate get warmer and our ground gets drier,' Tittel said. <br/> GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX <br/><br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://newjerseymonitor.com/subscribe\">https://newjerseymonitor.com/subscribe</url><br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://nj.gov/njoem/mitigation/pdf/2019/mit2019_section5-12_Wildfire.pdf\">https://nj.gov/njoem/mitigation/pdf/2019/mit2019_section5-12_Wildfire.pdf</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/bill-search/2022/A1392/bill-text?f=A1500&amp;n=1392_I1\">https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/bill-search/2022/A1392/bill-text?f=A1500&amp;n=1392_I1</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/bill-search/2022/A2632/bill-text?f=A3000&amp;n=2632_I1\">https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/bill-search/2022/A2632/bill-text?f=A3000&amp;n=2632_I1</url></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Sometimes it is not that simple. Jarvis Tucker is a senior at Hazelwood Central High in St. Louis, Missouri. He plays football, he is the star defensive tackle on the team and he ranked in the top 10 amongst all defensive tackles in the country. Jarvis has all you could ask for as a 17 year old teenager: a great support system for family and friends. One of his greatest supporters is his best friend Montavious Jackson. Montavious does not play any sports like Jarvis but he and Jarvis have been friends since they were three years old. Their friendship is a bond that couldn't be broken by anyone, or so they thought.</p><p>Jarvis has a crush on a girl named Kayla Hollins. Kayla is a senior at Hazelwood Central, along with Jarvis. They have been going to school together since the second grade. Ever since then, Jarvis has not been able to get Kayla off of his mind. Now, Kayla knows that Jarvis likes her because he gives her sly stares and looks away quickly when their eyes meet. Kayla finds this endearing because she likes him---she just wants him to come over and break the ice between them. In Jarvis' head he hears a line from the 90s R&amp;B group Jodeci. The line says, \"Come and talk to me, I really wanna meet you girl.\" Both Jarvis and Kayla want the same thing--for the other to initiate a conversation.\u00a0</p><p>On the other hand, Montavious is always telling him not to be stuck on her because there are other fish in the sea. Jarvis suspects that Montavious is jealous but he can't be sure. Jarvis starts to build up the courage to talk to Kayla and walks up to her. As soon as he gets within a close speaking distance, he trips on his feet and bumps into Kayla. Kayla finds this amusing, and she became a little excited when he brushed up against her, but she tried to play it cool. She asks if he is okay and they both straighten themselves up. Jarvis finally asks her out on a date and Kayla says yes. This is the happiest day of both of their lives up to this point. Eventually, Jarvis and Kayla started dating and are doing very well in their relationship. But Montavious is not happy about not one bit.</p><p>Montavious feels that Jarvis doesn't hang out with him anymore. They don't play video games, go play a pick up game of basketball, etc. ever since Kayla came into the picture. Jarvis is in love and he doesn't see a problem at all. Montavious is jealous because he doesn't have a girlfriend and now his best friend has abandoned him. Jealousy had Montavious in its firm grasp and wouldn't let him go. This caused him to tell Kayla that Jarvis was cheating on him with Sarah, his female friend. Montavious hoped that this would break them up and he would get his friend back. Instead, this backfired on him. In the ensuing drama, everybody eventually figured out that Montavious was lying all along. Kayla, Jarvis, and Sarah confronted Montavious afterschool.\u00a0 Montavious was sweating and felt his body get hotter. He tried to backpedal and talk his way out of the situation, but they were having none of it. Jarvis said that he knew Montavious' intention was to destroy Jarvis' relationship with Kayla. \"A real friend wouldn't do something like that,\" he told him, \"I never want to see you again.\"\u00a0</p><p>Jarvis chose Kayla over his friendship. However, Montavious' jealousy and anger grew like a forest fire which consumed him and turned to ashes the friendship he had with Jarvis.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5153602</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6442-BRT1-JBSN-3544-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"582\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Griffon News: Missouri Western State College</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 15, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>St Joseph</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>MO</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000171</classCode><className>BASKETBALL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000DKD4</classCode><className>COURTSHIP &amp; DATING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX000351</classCode><className>COMPUTER GAMES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>STX001452</classCode><className>RANKINGS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX000351</classCode><className>COMPUTER GAMES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GX610</classCode><className>SAINT LOUIS, MO, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GS141</classCode><className>MISSOURI, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Not little Smokey Bear warning \"only you can prevent forest fires.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">How about a cow?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The big burns of this September have been primarily in rangeland. When grasslands and sagebrush burn, it can be as explosive as a forest fire. Gov. Jay Inslee claimed in his Sept. 15 wildfire press briefing \"there's really no management you can do over tens of thousands of acres of grass and sagebrush. You just can't get out your lawn mower and mow that grass,\"Inslee said. He blamed climate change. \"The solution is to prevent that grass from becoming like gasoline - the aridity dries it out and it becomes explosive.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Livestock producers listening to the livestream collectively groaned on social media. \"Living in and representing areas that are high-risk for fire, I don't have 80 years to change the climate a degree or two, we need results now,\" said Rep. Joel Kretz, R-Wauconda. \"We have all kinds of treatments in our forests that can have results. And it's the same with the grasslands.\"</p><p>That's where cattle come in. Self-propelled, bio-fueled mowers are a solution in both forests and rangeland. Or maybe you'd rather have a cute lamb as the mascot for grazing as a tool for fire mitigation. Large flocks used to roam fields and forests in Washington, particularly useful in removing vegetation from the forest floor.</p><p>In the teeth of the unusually heavy winds on Labor Day, no logging or grazing would stop fire. Dr. Crystal Raymond, Climate Adaptation Specialist at Climate Impacts Group at the University of Washington, said the link between climate change and wind is unclear, but good management practices can reduce the climate impact. \"Doing something that will reduce fuel buildup will make a difference,\" Raymond said.</p><p>Mitigating wildfire spread is the most direct way to reduce Washington's carbon footprint.A 2015 legislative report says wildfire represents from 13% to 50% of Washington's total carbon emissions per year, depending on fire activity.</p><p>Carbon critic or not, everyone was miserable after a week of smoky skies. The 2020 Labor Day wildfires were nowhere near the scale of the 1910 Big Burn, generating smoke for weeks, blackening skies from Denver to Saskatchewan and reaching the East Coast. The Big Burn shaped U.S. attitudes toward forest fire suppression for generations. It took decades of scientific inquiry before rediscovering the role fire plays in a healthy forest. And there are still those who see all proposed logging as a mindless attempt to hammer the forest.</p><p>Reducing ladder fuels using mechanical methods or grazing is a best practice for firewise forest landscapes. We're continuing to learn about application to rangelands. In a 2016 issue of The International Journal of Wildland Fire, a study of winter grazing as treatment for fuel management concluded it \"can be applied across vast shrub-grasslands to decrease wildfire risk and fire intensity to mediate climate change effects on wildfire activity.\"</p><p>Intensively managing millions of acres is unrealistic, but targeted treatment works. Kretz has seen coordinated forest management between different agencies and multiple private owners be effective in Okanogan County, creating corridors of defensible space for crews and equipment. It's a safer alternative for firefighters and the environment than blasting a bulldozer line in the face of wind-driven flames.</p><p>\"We have conceded huge swaths of forest between big rivers and highways when we need to concentrate on creating corridors of protection,\" Kretz said.</p><p>Fighting wildfire safely is a concern for Commissioner of Public Lands Hilary Franz. She supports the concept of pre-planned firebreaks maintained by thinning and grazing.</p><p>\"We are working on scheduling a meeting at the end of October to better understand the challenges of managing fire on rangeland and ag lands,\" Franz said.</p><p>Researchers with the University of California Cooperative Extension dug into the link between cows and fire in California, affirming the positive impact of grazing to reduce fuel load and make fire suppression safer. When cows eat the grass before it dries out, the flame front stays lower, and the carbon goes back into the soil instead of into the air.</p><p>Climate is changing. Successful climate adaptation means the management of our forests and rangelands must follow the science.</p><p>The phrase \"log it, graze it or watch it burn\" applies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPOKSR-37861283</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPOKSR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60YP-W8X1-JC0C-J01R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">157554</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-02-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"734\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Spokane Spokesman-Review</copyright><publicationName>Spokesman Review (Spokane, WA)</publicationName><edition>Main Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 1, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>Forest Lands</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTkzOTc4NEQ2MTQwNDg0Q0E0NDNFRkRDRDU1QUE0OEU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

When people hear that only 1 in 10 Philly cops and fewer than one-quarter of firefighters have submitted proof that they are vaccinated, some immediately say we should force people to choose between getting the shot and keeping their jobs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But perhaps it is not too late to tap the brakes on all that a mandate implies. Could it be that mandates themselves are partly to blame for the resistance they provoke? There is something visceral in the response that we cannot be compelled to put anything into our bodies against our own will. Is freedom of choice not at the heart of many of our long-simmering social battles? Vaccine mandates can generate a similar refusal to yield control over our destinies. In the end you're not sticking something into my arm. You're sticking it into me.</p><p>Official directives, with all the not-so-subtle monopoly of force government wields, are not to be taken lightly. It is one thing for me to volunteer, to request the protection of a shot (which I have received), but to be compelled is a far different matter. The government no longer views me as a person, with all the expectation of self-determination entailed. Instead it treats me as a piece of meat to be injected.</p><p>Roughly 30% of Philadelphia residents aged 12 and up have not been vaccinated. Even if the number of resisters were smaller than it currently is, would we be justified in riding roughshod over their concerns? To do so is to declare that interior freedom no longer counts. Of course there are times when public safety requires just such summary dismissal. To save all or a greater number it may be that some have to be, if not sacrificed, at least not taken into account. But is this what is happening in the vaccine mandate controversy? We may think that the hesitant are more in danger from disease than from the vaccine, but is it so implausible that they might perceive the danger in opposite terms? Many come from the ranks of those who fought heroically on the front lines of the pandemic, such as nurses, police, and firefighters, so I'm bound to feel uneasy about dismissing their perspective. Can we so lightly ignore their reservations?</p><p>The public interest in conquering COVID-19 has induced us to accept trade-offs we would not normally endure. We supported lockdowns and restrictions that in retrospect had higher costs than foreseen, but we put up with them as temporary. When a forest fire is raging, you obey the authorities who prohibit you from the vicinity. But now something more than a trade-off is at stake. We are not asking for a temporary surrender of liberty, an inconvenience, but a permanent submission to an order with which one deeply disagrees. This is not like paying a fine. It is an irrevocable loss of autonomy for those affected.</p><p>We cannot overlook the rights of some without jeopardizing the rights of all and demonstrating that, under certain conditions, we are prepared to set aside our deepest convictions. Under the vaccine mandates, we are declaring that the views of our fellow citizens, at least in this case, do not count. Sailors on an aircraft carrier may have to submit to a preemption of their autonomy, but citizens of a free society should be able to find another way.</p><p>David Walsh, professor of politics at the</p><p>Catholic University of America, is author of \"The Priority of the Person\" (Notre Dame, 2020).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHIINQ-PHQP20211114Ar06502</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHIINQ2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:642Y-9931-DYJT-2193-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"597\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Philadelphia Inquirer</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 14, 2021 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000303</classCode><className>CIVIL SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DPX0</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION &amp;

That's the reason some people gave[3] for the catastrophic burning of Lytton, B.C., in 2021 after a historic heat wave set a new temperature record in Canada, exacerbating a wildfire that essentially destroyed the town. </p><p><br/>And while the idea seems wild, it wasn't even the first time the conspiracy theory had been floated. As far back as 2018, space lasers were blamed for causing wildfires in California, some tinged with antisemitic theories[4] the space lasers were owned by Jewish bankers. <br/>So it almost seems quaint that a not-insignificant chorus of Canadians blame the current wildfires sweeping across much of the country on climate activists and laser-less government operatives willing to drive into the woods and strike a match. <br/>Supposedly it's arson, not natural forces or human carelessness coupled with a hotter and drier climate, that's the real culprit for the choking smoke that has kept children inside, blocked out the sun and made it nearly impossible to breathe. <br/>These theories aren't quaint, and they're not just being spread in fringe digital corners. <br/><br/><br/> Get The Narwhal in your inbox Independent, investigative journalism you won't find anywhere else.

'There have been stories as well that we're investigating and we're bringing in arson investigators from outside the province.' (Arson is not a major factor in wildfire ignition \u2014 more on that later.) <br/>It's not just Smith. Canadian politicians across all levels of government are not aligned on what started the fires and what needs to be done to combat them, a discord that is fuelling a deep misunderstanding of this intense and destructive climate moment. <br/>There is real fear, in Alberta and beyond, about what these fires represent. They are burning during a critical time for climate policy discussions that will have an enormous impact across Canada, particularly in the oil and gas heartland. <br/>Alberta Premier Danielle Smith blamed ongoing wildfires across the province on arsonists, perpetuating a concerning misunderstanding of how forest fires start and spread. Photo: Chris Schwarz / Government of Alberta <br/>Hardly anyone in the country is unaffected. There is a direct and visceral threat to home and security for the tens of thousands who have been forced to flee. Then there's a fear of job loss and security for those who work in sectors including oil and gas. Not to mention the physical and emotional stress on firefighters forced to work without adequate resources or funding[6]. <br/>Millions more Canadians have been trapped under smoky skies caused by fires thousands of kilometres away. <br/>Everyone is carrying the anxiety of a changing planet. <br/>The discussions that need to happen now \u2014 that should've started long ago \u2014 are complex and wide-ranging, and the solutions they result in will require unprecedented co-ordination across ideologies. Along with better approaches to fire prevention and management, governments need to cope with misinformation and social media companies that allow it to spread. <br/>Given all of that, space lasers can seem like an easy out. <br/>Here's a rundown of what we know about how the wildfires actually started and the truth behind the most prominent conspiracy theories. It's also a look at who benefits from spreading untruths and what politicians and social media platforms could be doing to stop the climate disinformation blazing across the country. <br/>Alberta is the province most impacted by wildfires this year: 108 forest fires burned in May, including this blaze west of Fox Creek. Photo: Kyle Brittain <br/>Just how on fire is Canada right now? <br/>Natural disasters at their worst seem cinematic and fictional. And this year, for the first time in our collective memory, the entire country was very much on fire. <br/>Since March, 11 provinces and territories have been affected by thousands of forest fires, many of them out of control. Canada is witnessing its 'worst wildfire season' in recorded history, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in early June. You could see the fires from coast to coast[7]. <br/>British Columbia saw the second single-largest wildfire in its history this year in Donnie Creek[8]. Alberta was the most impacted overall, with 108 forest fires in May, forcing the government to declare[9] a provincial state of emergency that lasted a month. Almost 40 per cent of the country's fires were in Quebec, threatening to evacuate more than 15,000 people. Newfoundland and Labrador saw 34 wildfires before May 1, compared to only two fires in the same period last year. Nova Scotia saw its largest recorded forest fire in history; 16,000 residents were evacuated from the Halifax area. <br/>The sheer cumulative effect was, well, apocalyptic. A wall of smoke descended across the U.S.-Canada border. New York City experienced its worst air quality since a dramatic smog event in the 1960s. Skies turned orange, horizons and skylines disappeared. <br/>North America has never experienced fire like this before. It is scary and visceral. In Ottawa, the smoke became the perfectly haunting metaphor: parliamentarians and policymakers were trapped in the heavy fog, unable to act or see ahead. <br/>And it's not over: while British Columbia is bracing for intense thunderstorms, the large Donnie Creek fire is expected to keep burning[10] for several weeks. <br/>British Columbia saw the second single-largest wildfire in its history this year in Donnie Creek. Photos: B.C. Wildfire Service <br/>How did the 2023 Canadian wildfires start? <br/>The majority of the forest fires still burning in Canada are caused[11] by lightning, Mother Nature's energy weapon that literally sparks flames. <br/>In any given year, almost half of the fires that burn across the country are started by lightning, but those fires account for nearly 67 per cent of the land burned, according to the federal government[12]. There have been 2,536 wildfires[13] across Canada already this year. <br/>But a strike of lightning will not turn into a catastrophic wildfire unless the conditions are ripe for one. <br/>In dry, hot conditions, the flames become raging blazes and if the wind picks up, it carries the thick smoke quickly. Such conditions will become the norm for longer periods of time as Earth's atmosphere warms rapidly due to carbon pollution created from burning fossil fuels. Wildfire seasons will start earlier, last longer and be more intense[14]. <br/>As of this week, almost five million hectares of land in Canada have burned[13]. That's more than the amount of land that burned in 2016, 2019, 2020 and 2022 combined. <br/>Members of the Canadian Armed Forces, Alberta Wildfire and local firefighters try to contain a fire in Drayton Valley, Alta., in May 2023. Photo: Master Corporal Genevieve Lapointe / Canadian Armed Forces  <br/>Lightning strikes have an outsized impact, according to Natural Resources Canada, because they can occur in remote, less populated areas and the fires are often left to burn. Or they can happen in clusters, with multiple fires lit at once, forcing firefighters to decide which ones to tackle with limited resources. <br/>Humans do cause the majority of wildfires, just over half, but they tend not to be part of a balaclava-clad crowd of ne'er do wells and extremists.  <br/>Recent figures released by the B.C. Wildfire Service show a third of this year's 444 wildfires were caused by lightning. Another 263 were attributed to suspected human activity, not arson but carelessness, like 'vehicle and engine use, industrial activity, fireworks, sky-lanterns, outdoor flame lighting and discarding burning items (e.g. cigarettes).' That doesn't mean there hasn't been a history[15] of trying to blame everyone from Antifa to environmentalists for the conflagrations. <br/>Alberta's June 13 update on the wildfire situation showed 368 of 634 \u201458 per cent \u2014 wildfires this year were human caused, which the province says covers 'everything from recreational fires to agricultural incidents to wildfires caused by people on residential land.' It's part of the reason Alberta implemented bans on outdoor fires and all-terrain vehicle use through much of the spring. <br/>Almost 60 per cent of the wildfires in Alberta this year, like this one near Fox Creek in May, were human caused, part of the reason the province implemented bans on outdoor fires and all-terrain vehicle use through much of the spring. Photo: Kyle Brittain <br/>During a news conference on June 12, \u200b\u200bMelissa Story, an information officer with Alberta Wildfire, said the service is also seeing an 'emerging trend with fireworks and exploding targets.' <br/>Lightning, according to the province, was responsible for 129 fires and another 135 are under investigation. <br/>And yes, sometimes arson is the cause. <br/>In Alberta, RCMP charged a man[16] in May for a series of arsons, including what they say were intentionally set wildfires, in 2022. The man was also charged with breaching conditions for a previous charge that was supposed to confine him to his property. There was no mention by police of climate motivations for the fires he set, which also included a church, post office and rodeo grounds among targets. That same year, a woman from Kamloops, B.C., was also charged[17] with wildfire arsons. She pled guilty and has yet to be sentenced. <br/>'We see arson wildfires every year, in one form or another. Sometimes they're under-represented, sometimes they're over,' Story with Alberta Wildfire told The Toronto Star[18] on June 8. 'It's not an emerging trend that we're concerned about right now.' <br/>Arson happens, but it is rare. <br/>So why are arsonist theories so widespread? <br/>There's a certain logic to trying to distract from the terror of wildfires and the changing climate that helps set the conditions for them. For many individuals, perhaps the truth is so unimaginable, unsettling and unavoidable, they refuse to accept the complex origins of the new reality. <br/>Others have more nefarious motivations and use positions of influence to shore up their own interests \u2014 from business leaders to politicians to influencers. <br/>Often, misinformation takes a piece of truth and twists it. Last week, the B.C. Wildfire Service released a video[19] explaining how it uses planned ignitions \u2014 a fire management tactic that strategically burns areas of the forest a fire hasn't reached as a way to contain it. But in a doctored version of the video going viral online, footage from the service is edited so all you see is a yellow helicopter flying above a smoke-filled forest in Donnie Creek, in the northeastern part of the province, with a torch suspended from one of the wings shooting flames into the trees. The words 'it was a setup' flash on the screen.  <br/>Some of the theories show how new crises are absorbed into existing disinformation spheres. As politicians and health officials advised people to stay indoors or wear masks outside, it activated people who felt COVID-19 lockdowns had curtailed their freedoms \u2014 and ignored that N95 masks prevent both the spread of viruses and inhalation of harmful smoke. Then there are those who believe the wildfires were intentionally set to destroy rural life and force everyone into 15-minute cities \u2014 an urban planning concept in which daily life exists within walking or biking distance. And there's the long-running classic, that the wildfires are purposely lit to give the Trudeau government cover to increase the carbon price, which is one of the most effective tools to reduce industrial emissions. <br/>Donnie Creek Wildfire - Planned igntions update June 2, 2023[20] A doctored video of this one released by the B.C. Wildfire Service has been used to spread conspiracy theories about how this year's fires started in the province.  <br/>'Climate is just the latest victim in a trend that has already claimed conversations around public health, conversations around migration, conversations around sexual and reproductive health rights, conversations around LGBTQ rights [and] conversations around racial justice,' Jennie King, head of climate research and policy at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, told The Narwhal. <br/>'The kind of underlying unifying theme is one of the so-called woke agenda and the cabal of internationalists or globalists who are instigating that supposed agenda,' said King, whose organization is an international think-tank that researches threats to democracy, including disinformation. 'That can then be applied to any topic.' <br/>That's probably why the list of conspiracy theories is endless. There are varying (untrue) explanations of how arsonists operate, from stealing ammonium nitrate from a train to a more elaborate theory about eco-terrorists who co-ordinated the lighting of matches at the same time across the country. <br/>None of these assertions are new this year, or to Canada \u2014 similar theories have been floated globally, as fires increase and intensify. But their veracity is deeply concerning, not only because of the growing risk of wildfire, but because of the threat disinformation poses to broader climate action. <br/>In June, Kingston, Ont., was blanketed in smoke due to wildfires in northern Ontario, Quebec and Manitoba. Photo: Lars Hagberg / The Canadian Press  <br/>What leads people to believe climate misinformation? <br/>Studies have shown[21] increased anxiety and feeling a loss of control can contribute to belief in conspiracy theories. If anxiety is increased, so too is a disposition to justify theories outside the realm of reality. <br/>Education or intelligence don't factor in, at least not in the way many would snidely suggest. One study[22] from Yale Law School in 2017 showed people with higher abilities to interpret quantitative information were better at contorting facts to fit their ideological bias.  <br/>Adrian Bardon, a philosophy professor at Wake Forest University in North Carolina and author of The Truth About Denial, calls this[23] 'toxic, system-justifying identity politics.' <br/>Humans are hardwired for a certain amount of bias and self-justification. Bardon says we often have reactions and then we find reasons to justify those reactions, not the other way around. <br/>Existential threats \u2014 whether it's the world burning or the loss of your paycheque \u2014 are powerful drivers of fear and conspiracy. Powerlessness in the face of global forces is visceral. <br/>But there is also some calculation at play among the top spreaders of climate disinformation, with influencers, grifters and politicians leading the herd away from climate and toward, say, arsonists. <br/>When it comes to climate change, the age of denialism is largely over, according to a report[24] from King's Institute for Strategic Dialogues. What has taken its place are strategies to muddy the discursive waters, particularly from polluting industries and those with vested interests. <br/>'Whether through conspiracies like 'climate lockdown,' or by conflating climate with divisive issues like critical race theory, LGBTQ+ rights and abortion access, the goal of much climate change [misinformation] now is to distract and delay,' reads the report. <br/>'Yet, with the window to act deemed 'brief and rapidly closing,' such an approach may prove fatal.' <br/>Almost 40 per cent of Canada's 2023 wildfires have been in Quebec, threatening to evacuate more than 15,000 people. Photo: Socit de protection des forts contre le feu  <br/>So what are Canadian politicians saying about wildfires? <br/>When fire season started this year, Alberta politicians were in the midst of an election campaign devoid of serious climate talk[25] even as the province burned \u2014 shrouding cities in smoke and forcing the evacuation of homes and oil facilities. <br/>It didn't take long for evidence-free theories to start spreading: the idea that shadowy NDP operatives, perhaps working in concert with Trudeau, intentionally set the fires in order to help defeat the UCP. In reality, the UCP slashed the budgets for wildfire suppression in 2019, leaving a 'skeleton crew[6]' to tackle this year's infernos. <br/>There's been a lot of finger pointing and climate denial as this year's fires reached record levels, across the country and all levels of government. <br/>Federal Environment Minister Stephen Guilbeault said his ability to act on wildfires was limited by political differences. 'What would greatly help our capacity to accelerate our fight against climate change in Canada is if I didn't have to fight with certain jurisdictions all the time on doing the bare minimum to fight climate change, if I wouldn't have to fight the Conservative Party of Canada,' he told[26] CTV News. <br/>Meanwhile at Queen's Park in the heart of Toronto \u2014 which had the second-worst air quality in the world at one point last week due to fires in northern Ontario, Manitoba and Quebec \u2014 Premier Doug Ford refused to link the wildfire smoke to climate change. When asked[27] about it by Ontario NDP leader Marit Stiles, he accused the opposition of 'politicizing the fires.' <br/>Instead, Ford touted the work of Ontario's firefighters while failing to mention or justify his government's decision to cut 67 per cent of his province's emergency forest firefighting funds in the 2019 budget. Ford's Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry Graydon Smith matter-of-factly said[28] 'we've got forest fires every year in Ontario' as schools across the Greater Toronto Area cancelled recess due to smoke. <br/>Then, on the last day of the legislature's summer session, Ford declared Ontario's economy 'is on fire,' making a badly timed pun as 54 forest fires engulfed the province in smoke.  <br/>In June, as wildfire smoke made Toronto's air quality the second worst in the world, Ontario Premier Doug Ford refused to acknowledge the links to climate change or need for climate action in the legislature.

In November 2021, more than 400 organizations and individuals wrote an open letter[30] demanding global action to tackle climate misinformation and disinformation. <br/>Since March, 11 provinces and territories have been affected by thousands of forest fires, including Quebec. Canada is witnessing its 'worst wildfire season' in recorded history, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in early June. Photo: Socit de protection des forts contre le feu  <br/>There has been some progress. In October 2021, Google announced[31] it would 'prohibit ads for, and monetization of, content that contradicts well-established scientific consensus around the existence and causes of climate change.' In April 2022, Pinterest announced a policy to reduce climate change disinformation in content and ads. And ahead of Earth Day this year, TikTok amended[32] its policies to require the removal of any content that 'undermines well-established scientific consensus, such as denying the existence of climate change or the factors that contribute to it.' <br/>On Earth Day last year, Twitter also announced[33] a new policy to demonetize climate denial in its advertising, although that hasn't lasted. Since July 2022, when Elon Musk took over the platform, the Climate Action Against Disinformation coalition has observed an increase in climate denial content on Twitter. The group noted a concerning spike for #ClimateScam, a hashtag that 'soared back up the top search results' on the site last week, according to King's early analysis. 'That was obviously linked to the stories around the wildfires,' she said. <br/>There's more work to be done, as the online discourse around this year's wildfires makes clear. Canada is expected to introduce wide-ranging policy around online harms later this year, after two and a half years of discussion, and King said it can't come too soon. <br/>'Canada is probably a little late to the party in recognizing the threat of climate, mis- and disinformation, both at a low local policymaking level, but also, the broader trend of climate being weaponized within kind of identity politics, and dynamics of, of cultural discourse,' she said. There's finally a recognition that climate disinformation carries 'a real vector of harm,' she said, that is creating confusion and perpetuating inaction. <br/>Firefighters battle a grass fire in Kamloops, B.C., in June 2023. Already, 20,000 Canadians have been displaced by this year's wildfires. Photo: Darryl Dyck / The Canadian Press  <br/>So why should you care? <br/>There are a lot of climate policies taking shape in Ottawa, from clean electricity regulations, to new clean fuel standards, increased carbon prices and potential caps on emissions from the oil and gas sector. The federal government is ramping up efforts to get to net-zero emissions by 2050 after years of dithering as emissions rose. <br/>It's essential these policies are discussed and debated on a level playing field, not one distorted by misinformation, so Canadians feel the measures are being passed in their best interests. Especially given the profound impacts of a changing economy, in a world that's clearly changing despite warnings that were shrugged off. <br/>Wetter wet seasons and drier dry seasons will increase floods and fire. Already, 20,000 Canadians have been displaced by this year's wildfires. Many more will have to leave their homes behind as shorelines and floodplains shift and forests and grasslands burn. Managed retreat[34] and its incalculable costs will challenge governments across the country. <br/>It's a huge problem \u2014 the existential challenge of our times. The urge to turn it into a fantastical but simple tale that has a beginning, middle and end, an obvious villain and a clear-cut spark is understandable. But these tales are just a smokescreen, distracting from the growing number of smoke signals from communities across the country desperate for serious climate action. <br/>\u2014 with files from Denise Balkissoon <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenarwhal.ca/author/drew-anderson/\">https://thenarwhal.ca/author/drew-anderson/</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenarwhal.ca/author/fatima-syed/\">https://thenarwhal.ca/author/fatima-syed/</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/epnmja/conspiracy-theorists-think-a-lytttown-burned-by-wildfire-was-decimated-by-a-laser\">https://www.vice.com/en/article/epnmja/conspiracy-theorists-think-a-lytttown-burned-by-wildfire-was-decimated-by-a-laser</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/marjorie-taylor-greene-qanon-wildfires-space-laser-rothschild-execute.html\">https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/marjorie-taylor-greene-qanon-wildfires-space-laser-rothschild-execute.html</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/F4rc6PhrvtE?feature=share&amp;t=2739\">https://www.youtube.com/live/F4rc6PhrvtE?feature=share&amp;t=2739</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenarwhal.ca/alberta-wildfire-ucp-cuts\">https://thenarwhal.ca/alberta-wildfire-ucp-cuts</url>/ [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/9751667/canada-wildfires-outlook/\">https://globalnews.ca/news/9751667/canada-wildfires-outlook/</url> [ 8]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/donnie-creek-wildfire-largest-recorded-bc-history-1.6866122\">https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/donnie-creek-wildfire-largest-recorded-bc-history-1.6866122</url> [ 9]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/9679627/alberta-premier-adresses-wildfire-state-of-emergency/\">https://globalnews.ca/news/9679627/alberta-premier-adresses-wildfire-state-of-emergency/</url> [ 10]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/environment-canada-weather-warnings-jun-13-1.6874302\">https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/environment-canada-weather-warnings-jun-13-1.6874302</url> [ 11]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/lightning/forest-fires.html\">https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/lightning/forest-fires.html</url> [ 12]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://natural-resources.canada.ca/our-natural-resources/forests/wildland-fires-insects-disturbances/forest-fires/fire-behaviour/13145\">https://natural-resources.canada.ca/our-natural-resources/forests/wildland-fires-insects-disturbances/forest-fires/fire-behaviour/13145</url> [ 13]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ciffc.net\">https://ciffc.net</url>/ [ 14]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenarwhal.ca/how-climate-change-is-making-b-c-s-wildfire-season-hotter-longer-dryer\">https://thenarwhal.ca/how-climate-change-is-making-b-c-s-wildfire-season-hotter-longer-dryer</url>/ [ 15]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/11/tech/qanon-oregon-fire-conspiracy-theory/index.html\">https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/11/tech/qanon-oregon-fire-conspiracy-theory/index.html</url> [ 16]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/9673400/arson-alberta-wildfires-intentionally-set-church/#:~:text=Charges%20have%20been%20laid%20against,vehicles%2C%20homes%20and%20a%20church\">https://globalnews.ca/news/9673400/arson-alberta-wildfires-intentionally-set-church/#:~:text=Charges%20have%20been%20laid%20against,vehicles%2C%20homes%20and%20a%20church</url>.

It was just the latest blaze in a summer of wildfires that have swept across the Mediterranean region, leaving areas in Greece, Turkey, Italy, Algeria and Spain in smoldering ruins. The wildfire started yesterday evening, in the height of France's summer vacation season, about 24 miles inland from the coastal resort of Saint-Tropez. </p><p>Fueled by powerful seasonal winds coming off the Mediterranean Sea, the fire had spread across 12,000 acres of forest by this morning, according to the Var regional administration. Some 6,000 people were evacuated from homes and a dozen campgrounds in the region prized by vacationers, while others were locked down in a holiday center for Air France employees. At least 22 people suffered from smoke inhalation or minor fire-related injuries, Var's top government official told broadcaster France Bleu. Two firefighters were among the injured. Water-dumping planes and emergency helicopters zipped back and forth over hills lined with chestnut, pine and oak trees. Images shared online by firefighters showed black plumes of smoke leaping across thickets of trees as the flames darted across dry brush. One evacuee told France-Bleu that smoke enveloped his car as he returned to his campsite and he had just enough time to grab his baby daughter's milk and basic belongings before fleeing. Another told BFM television about escaping as his hotel caught fire. Backed by planes and helicopters, more than 900 firefighters worked today to contain the blaze, civil security service spokesperson Alexandre Jouassard said. Local authorities closed roads, blocked access to forests across the region and urged caution. French President Emmanuel Macron, who has been vacationing in a nearby coastal fortress, was to visit the fire zone later today. The regional administration warned that fire risk would remain very high through tomorrow because of hot, dry weather. Temperatures in the area have reached 104 degrees Fahrenheit in recent days. Intense heat and wildfires have also struck countries around southern Europe and North Africa in recent weeks, with fires killing at least 75 people in Algeria and 16 in Turkey. In Greece today, hundreds of firefighters backed by water-dropping planes were battling a large forest fire that has led to the evacuation of a care home and several villages northwest of Athens. Hundreds of wildfires have burned across Greece this month, fueled by the country's longest and most severe heat wave in decades that left its forests and shrubland bone dry. Italy has also seen several fire-related deaths. Also today, Israeli firefighters worked for a third consecutive day to contain a wildfire that has consumed a large swath of forest west of Jerusalem and threatened several communities. Worsening drought and heat - linked to climate change - have also fueled wildfires this summer in the western United States and in Russia's northern Siberia region.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-0000017b5441d185a97b7f5f18630000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63M0-HNV1-JBSK-R0MG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"529\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLC</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 17, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Unlike raging wildfires that have burned vast swaths of the drought-stricken U.S. West this summer, the blazes in Sequoia National Park were not explosive. </p><p>Flames were about a mile from the famous Giant Forest, a grove of some 2,000 massive sequoias on a plateau high in the Sierra Nevada. \"It's been slow growth,\" fire information officer Katy Hooper said. Lower temperatures and a layer of smoke blanketing the area have been suppressing the flames. Firefighters have placed a special aluminum wrapping around the base of the General Sherman Tree, the world's largest by volume at 52,508 cubic feet, as well as some other trees and buildings. The material can withstand intensive heat for short periods and has been used in national parks and forests for several years throughout the West to protect sensitive structures from flames. A major element of the grove's defense is decades of prescribed burns \u2014 fires intentionally set to clear the forest floor of vegetation that could feed bigger blazes \u2014 and thinning projects to remove small trees that could become ladders carrying fire up to the crowns of the giants. A fire in the region last year killed thousands of sequoias, which grow as tall as high-rises at certain elevations on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada. \"This is a beautiful, open, parklike forest,\" fire spokesman Mark Garrett said. But a historic drought tied to climate change is making wildfires harder to fight. Scientists say climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive. Lightning ignited two fires in the park on Sept. 9, officials said. The Colony Fire, closest to the Giant Forest, has grown to just under 5 square miles. The Paradise Fire has scorched nearly 13 square miles. More than 400 firefighters were assigned to the blazes, which are being collectively managed as the KNP Complex. More resources have been requested, Hooper said. To the south, the Windy Fire grew to nearly 11 square miles on the Tule River Indian Reservation and in Giant Sequoia National Monument, where it has burned into one grove of sequoias and threatens others. Difficult terrain has prevented officials from assessing damage to the big trees. Sequoia National Park is the second natural jewel to be threatened by wildfires in less than a month. Lake Tahoe, the blue alpine lake perched high in the mountains on the California-Nevada line, was threatened by the explosive Caldor Fire until firefighters stopped its destructive march. Containment there has reached 71%. Meanwhile, a big change in weather was taking shape in parts of the drought-stricken, fire-scarred West. Forecasters said a storm heading in from the Pacific would bring rain to the Pacific Northwest and parts of Northern California through the weekend. The rain was not expected to come as far south as Sequoia National Park.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHDLY-0001305613</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHDLY2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63N7-CCP1-DY6F-J0PD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163823</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"535\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Paddock Publications, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Daily Herald</publicationName><edition>WEB EditionNC1 EditionNC2 EditionMF12 EditionNC3 EditionNM1 EditionNC EditionNC14 EditionMC1 EditionMC3 EditionMD1 EditionML2 EditionNL1 EditionNC14C EditionNC4 EditionCLFM EditioneBlast Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 18, 2021 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000113</classCode><className>ARSON</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001035</classCode><className>LAKES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DLQ6</classCode><className>FIRE SAFE MATERIALS &amp; PRODUCTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001964</classCode><className>SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS144</classCode><className>NEVADA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Over half the cities in North America have made the conversion to LED lights; but less than 10% have opted to add lighting controls. Lighting controls can deliver an additional ~20% in energy savings by enabling communities to implement remote dimming schedules. They also give cities real-time alerts that help them predict, prevent, and address challenges, thereby radically improving operational efficiency.

Flames were about a mile from the famous Giant Forest, a grove of some 2,000 massive sequoias on a plateau high in the Sierra Nevada.</p><p>\"It's been slow growth,\" fire information officer Katy Hooper said.</p><p>Lower temperatures and a layer of smoke blanketing the area have been suppressing the flames.</p><p>Firefighters have placed a special aluminum wrapping around the base of the General Sherman Tree, the world's largest by volume at 52,508 cubic feet, as well as some other trees and buildings.</p><p>The material can withstand intensive heat for short periods and has been used in national parks and forests for several years throughout the West to protect sensitive structures from flames.</p><p>A major element of the grove's defense is decades of prescribed burns - fires intentionally set to clear the forest floor of vegetation that could feed bigger blazes - and thinning projects to remove small trees that could become ladders carrying fire up to the crowns of the giants.</p><p>A fire in the region last year killed thousands of sequoias, which grow as tall as high-rises at certain elevations on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada.</p><p>\"This is a beautiful, open, park-like forest,\" fire spokesman Mark Garrett said.</p><p>But a historic drought tied to climate change is making wildfires harder to fight. Scientists say climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.</p><p>Lightning ignited two fires in the park on Sept. 9, officials said. The Colony Fire, closest to the Giant Forest, has grown to just under 5 square miles. The Paradise Fire has scorched nearly 13 square miles.</p><p>More than 400 firefighters were assigned to the blazes, which are being collectively managed as the KNP Complex. More resources have been requested, Hooper said.</p><p>To the south, the Windy Fire grew to nearly 11 square miles on the Tule River Indian Reservation and in Giant Sequoia National Monument, where it has burned into one grove of sequoias and threatens others. Difficult terrain has prevented officials from assessing damage to the big trees.</p><p>Sequoia National Park is the second natural jewel to be threatened by wildfires in less than a month.</p><p>Lake Tahoe, the blue alpine lake perched high in the mountains on the California-Nevada line, was threatened by the explosive Caldor Fire until firefighters stopped its destructive march.</p><p>Containment there has reached 71%.</p><p>Meanwhile, a big change in weather was taking shape in parts of the drought-stricken, fire-scarred West.</p><p>Forecasters said a storm heading in from the Pacific would bring rain to the Pacific Northwest and parts of Northern California through the weekend. The rain was not expected to come as far south as Sequoia National Park.</p><p>Copyright 2021 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Thank you so much to both of you, gentlemen. Appreciate it. Great to see you. Thank you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you.</p><p>INGRAM: Bye-bye.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me in Washington, DC. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. And first on CNN, we're following a major new development in what could soon be Donald Trump's fourth indictment. Just a short time ago today I spoke with former Georgia Republican Lieutenant Governor and Geoff Duncan, who told me that he will testify in the next 48 hours before grand jury in Atlanta. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has subpoenaed Duncan to testify about efforts by former President Donald Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 presidential election in Georgia.</p><p>And we also now know that an independent journalist has tweeted today that he was also called by the Fulton County District Attorney, and also was asked to testify before that grand jury on Tuesday. Geoff Duncan is now a CNN political commentator.</p><p>And this is his entire interview with me earlier today as Duncan talks about this subpoena and his plans to testify.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>WHITFIELD: So have you received that notice that would come from their office a 48 hour notice to testify?</p><p>GEOFF DUNCAN (R) FORMER LT. GOVERNOR OF GEORGIA: Frederick, I did just receive notification to appear on Tuesday morning at the Fulton County grand jury, and I certainly will be there to do my part in recounting facts.</p><p>WHITFIELD: OK. You were one of 70 people who testified last year before grand jury. Is it your expectation that on Tuesday, when you're asked questions, again that they will be similar? Or do you expect? Or are you preparing yourself for new questions and a broadening of the investigation?</p><p>DUNCAN: Well, I have no expectations as to the questions. And I'll certainly answer whatever questions put in front of me and certainly don't want to go any deeper than that to to, you know, jeopardize or compromise the investigation.</p><p>But look, for me, this is a story that is important for Republicans, to hear Americans to hear. Let's hear the whole truth and nothing but the truth about Donald Trump's actions in the surrounding cast of characters around him. We watched a series of events happen here that were tragic and untruthful. And he's got a chance to present these facts and say, Hey, I didn't know what was going on or I think what's what reality is going to be as they knew exactly what they were doing.</p><p>And I think the interesting part to this indictment that's different than the others is that there's going to heavy signaling that there's going to be well plus co-conspirators. And these folks don't have the same level of loyalty they had to Donald Trump when he was trying to to change the election outcome in 2020. And so it's gonna be interesting to see which way they go.</p><p>And you know, these are serious charges that are being signaled racketeering, conspiracy, RICO. I mean, these are things really, you know, kind of garnered for the the mafia or the mob. And so what we'll certainly see, this gets ratcheted up in the next few days. WHITFIELD: Well, tell me more about that people who you believe once were very loyal to Trump now, as a result of the investigation and the ongoing investigation no longer have the same kind of loyalties. How do you believe that may have changed the building of this case against Trump?</p><p>DUNCAN: Yes, I think a number of people arrived on Donald Trump's conspiracy team from a number of different angles. Some folks got there, because the sitting president, the head of their party told them it was true. And so they just believed it. Word for word.</p><p>Others got there because they saw an opportunity to be in the cool kids club for the first time to hang out tight to the inner circle of a president and lots of things in between those two elements. So that -- that's going to be the part that plays out here. I mean, there are currently elected folks that are rumored to be indicted.</p><p>[15:05:00]</p><p>There are formerly elected folks party leads, successful business owner. I mean, this is a wide swath of Georgia, or representatives of Georgia that are going to have to face the consequences of answering some very, very tough questions.</p><p>But the reality is, I've yet to see a single ounce of proof that the election was not fair and legal didn't turn out the way Republicans wanted to. But it was fair and legal here in Georgia, and quite honestly, the rest of the country.</p><p>But this is an important part for the Republican Party to face, right. If we're going to truly turn and look forward, if we're going to turn -- surely turn the page for GOP 2.0, we've got to have Donald Trump the rearview mirror and the uncomfortable facts and figures of what he did during the post-election 2020 period of time, he is going to be part of that healing process for the Republican Party. It's necessary, but it's going to be painful.</p><p>WHITFIELD: How immediately did your loyalties to Trump as the Lieutenant Governor of Georgia, as a Republican, when and how, and under what circumstances did that change where you are no longer on board with the former president.</p><p>DUNCAN: So it's interesting, it actually started this is the first chapter of my book that I wrote about a rally two days before the election in Rome, Georgia. I gave an opening intro remarks before President Trump got -- I got on stage. And I made a couple of comments. I said every time we lower people's taxes, it's not just for Republicans, it's for Democrats, too. And I got booed by 30,000 MAGA hats.</p><p>And then I said, every time we improve education, it's not just for Democrats, it's for Republicans, and I got booed even louder. And then I made this this crazy statement and said, you know, our policies are so good. They even help the people that don't vote for us and I got booed even louder. It was at that moment that I realized that that crew of 30,000 people were not conservative, they were angry. And within hours of the 2020 election, when I started hearing Donald Trump talk about his notion that the election was rigged, and the machines were corrupt and whatever else conspiracy theories, I quickly turned the page and I tried to get to it as quickly as I could, so that I could try to stop the the little grass fire from turning into a forest fire, but unfortunately, I was unsuccessful.</p><p>There wasn't enough of us out there doing it. But instead, we're gonna have this slow, painful process of realizing what the truth actually is. And that's Donald Trump ran the worst campaign ever. And if we let him be our nominee again, he will get beat by Joe Biden again because it will be the worst campaign a Republican could ever put forward.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>WHITFIELD: Again, the breaking news here, the former Lieutenant Governor, Geoff Duncan of Georgia has been called to appear before a Fulton County, Georgia grand jury. He said he will be there on Tuesday. With me now to discuss these developments is Renato Marriott a he is a former federal prosecutor. Also back with us is CNN's Marshall Cohen. Marshall to you first, tell us more about the significance of this announcement by Duncan, that he will testify in the coming days before the grand jury.</p><p>MARSHALL COHEN, CNN REPORTER: Fredricka, it's happening. It's finally here. There have been so much speculation and preparation and security measures and grand juries and rulings and motions and litigation. It's finally here with these notifications going out to Geoff Duncan and another member of the potential -- another person who is going to testify to the grand jury with these notifications.</p><p>It is clear that Fani Willis is moving forward. This is her big moment to give this presentation to the grand jury probably expect it to begin on Monday could spill into Tuesday, where she is expected as CNN has been reporting for a while to seek indictments against Donald Trump and many of his Republican allies in Georgia, possibly more than a dozen defendants.</p><p>We are talking very serious felony charges possibly on the table like conspiracy and racketeering RICO, which Fani Willis has a lot of experience with it as a prosecutor in Atlanta. So the notifications going out today really are the starting gun have the final stretch of this investigation. Fredricka.</p><p>WHITFIELD: OK. You said notifications going out today. So we know Geoff Duncan, we understand that another witness who is an independent journalist, what can you tell us about that person? And does that mean they're more even more after that?</p><p>COHEN: There very well could be more you broke the story on your show here with Geoff Duncan. And in the wake of that shortly after that, the independent journalist George Chidi, who is an Atlanta based journalist, he tweeted out that he had been asked to appear on Tuesday as well. We previously reported that he was subpoenaed, and now he is announcing that the date of that appearance will be like Lieutenant Governor Duncan on Tuesday. And this is an interesting figure George Chidi because he actually was a witness in 2020, December 2020 to the fake electors, the fake pro-Trump electors meeting in the state house in Atlanta in December 2020 as part of that Trump backed scheme to to subvert the electoral college process.</p><p>[15:10:00]</p><p>So that might be a clue of one of the things that the grand jurors are going to hear. That is one of the many prongs of this investigation, the fake electoral scheme, so many other elements. But it will all come to a head, presumably in the next few days.</p><p>WHITFIELD: These notifications going out to witnesses to appear before the grand jury happening, you're simultaneous to the former president making campaign stops there in Iowa at the Iowa State Fair today. That was the the video that you were seeing just a moment ago.</p><p>So Renato, what is this mean that you would have some witnesses called to testify before the grand jury this week. And these are witnesses that have already testified in the past, and now being brought back what does it say about where the case is?</p><p>RENATO MARIOTTI, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Well, it says that we are on mile 25 of the marathon so to speak. We are basically close to the end, as Marshall mentioned, Fred. This now is a grand jury, a charging grand jury, a grand jury that can return an indictment, and Fani Willis and her team are putting their evidence into that grand jury so that ultimately, they can ask in the very near future, whether it's this week or next asked for the fourth indictment of Donald Trump and perhaps the first of some of his, you know, co-conspirators or co- schemers.</p><p>WHITFIELD: And then Renato, does a DA pick a witness to testify again, reveal something new about information. Is it to clarify? Or is it to perhaps underscore something that's already been discovered?</p><p>MARIOTTI: So well, it's a couple of things. First of all, the information needs to get from the special grand jury into the new one, instead of reading the testimony, in other words, you could have someone just read the transcript of what happened before the special grand jury, it's obviously more powerful if it's presented in person. They can ask some additional questions, put some, you know, for example, new things that they've learned over the course of their investigation.</p><p>But ultimately, the main purpose here is to take the information they already have. I don't think there's going to be any big surprises about what for example, the lieutenant governor is going to say, since they've already spoken to him. But they're going to put that all in front of this grand jury. So the grand jury has an opportunity to see these witnesses see the evidence, and this way that the district attorney can make sure that the grand jury is going to return the indictment that she puts before them.</p><p>WHITFIELD: And Renato, you know, this case is different than the other three indictments of Trump in that. This is a state case and won't involve federal charges. And last hour, when I was talking to election attorney Ben Ginsberg, he reminded us all that, you know, state cases, if Trump were to be reelected, he would be unable to pardon himself. What else is significant about the types of charges the Fulton County prosecutor is considering?</p><p>MARIOTTI: A few things and not only would he not be able to pardon himself, but the pardon process in Georgia means the Governor Kemp would not be able to pardon him either. There's a pardon board. So it's a more complicated process.</p><p>He also would not be able to shut down the investigation in the same way. In other words, Trump could try to make some argument to courts in Georgia that, as president, he can't be subject to a state indictment. But if he, you know, was president of United States, he could order if the attorney general install an attorney general, something like Jeffrey Clark, who could literally shut down Jack Smith's investigations. You can't do that to Fanni Willis. She's an elected official, you know, in the state of Georgia.</p><p>But separate and apart from that, Fred, you know, unlike the other state charge, right, there's a Manhattan DA indictment that's also not a federal charge. This is for conduct that occurred while he was president in the United States, not beforehand, not this is not just some sort of books and records violation. This is a chart for him over trying to overturn the election in Georgia.</p><p>And as I think, you know, Marshall pointed out a moment ago, there are potentially others that can be part of this. And, you know, there is an interplay between this and those other cases. If, for example, John Eastman, or Rudy Giuliani faces a charge here, and ultimately decides that it's in their best interest to cooperate, that could have an impact on these other investigations as well. So definitely important. There's really a multiplier effect and an interplay between these different prosecutions that we should keep in mind.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Another commonality in all of this, Marshall, even though there are distinctions of these, you know, three indictments and now a possible fourth is that Trump style is to go after the prosecutors, go after the Special Counsel Jack Smith, go after the DA you know, Alvin Bragg and also his record of going after and I'm talking about verbally, you know, taunting threats however you want to put it of Fani Willis.</p><p>[15:15:07]</p><p>So given that then, Marshall, you know, how does that continue to complicate these cases, even as these prosecutors special counsel may try to coordinate with one another.</p><p>COHEN: The atmosphere of threats and intimidation and vitriol has only been getting stronger and stronger. And, you know, with Fani Willis, who is an African American woman elected in Atlanta, she's actually the first woman to hold that position of DA in Fulton County. A lot of the attacks have been racial in character, you know, and I would be remiss if I didn't point out that Donald Trump himself regularly accuses Fani Willis of being racist, and Marxist and a lunatic.</p><p>And he actually, in the past several days, spread some incredibly ugly claims that are totally false about her that I won't even repeat. She has had security beefed up not just in the courthouse but for her personally. And, look, if he does end up as a criminal defendant in the state of Georgia, he will have to answer to a judge.</p><p>And those comments may be brought before the judge, just like they have been right here in Washington DC, as we literally saw yesterday, with a hearing in his federal election subversion case where prosecutors were flagging to the judge, Trump's post on Truth Social, if you come after me, I'll come after you and whether that type of rhetoric where that falls on the line between free speech defending oneself and a serious threat to to the interests of justice.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Yes, Fani Willis has said she has been called the N word and been subjected to, you know, threats of violence more in the last year than she has in her entire life and the connection that she's made to the investigation of the former president. All right, Marshall Cohen, Renato Mariotti. Thanks to both of you. Appreciate it.</p><p>COHEN: Thank you.</p><p>MARIOTTI: Thank you.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right, still to come. The political impact of this breaking news, new signs that a fourth indictment for Donald Trump could be coming soon in Fulton County, Georgia. The former president campaigning right now in Iowa as you see right there. We're live from Des Moines, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:21:17]</p><p>WHITFIELD: Former President Donald Trump is at the Iowa State Fair where he is drawing in quite the crowd of supporters. And this coming after former Lieutenant Governor of Georgia and CNN contributor Geoff Duncan revealed to CNN today that he has been told to testify before Fulton County grand jury about the former president's efforts to overturn the 2020 election.</p><p>Joining me right now is CNN's Jeff Zeleny, who is at the state fair. And Geoff Duncan telling me about his appearance now on Tuesday. He said that today. Has that signal been sent to the former president? And has he commented on it?</p><p>JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Well, look, Frederick, and this is something that former President Donald Trump obviously has been expecting. In fact, he's been campaigning on the fact that he is anticipating. And in fact, even he would say looking forward to a fourth indictment in Georgia, at least politically. Legally, of course, it is a very different matter. But the news was happening as he was flying here to the state fair. He made a comment about it on his social media channel, again, talking about that phone call that is really at issue here in the Georgia investigation. He again called it a perfect call. Of course, we heard that call for ourselves when he was asking the Georgia Secretary of State for more votes.</p><p>So you know, there's no doubt that that is hanging over the Trump campaign, as are the other indictments, but he at least politically speaking, is using that to gain support and for his advantages here, but he was here at the State Fair, working out his supporters talking to others, of course, he is still a celebrity. So he gains more attention and notice than some of his rivals might. But he talked about his standing here in Iowa. And now he plans to campaign aggressively and remain the front runner.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: We are going to take any chances. We're way up in the polls in Iowa and all over the country, we have a over 50 points. That's a lot. But we don't want to take any chances. We'll be back. We love you very much.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ZELENY: Now, he's not quite up by 50 percent. But there's no doubt that he is a front runner. All of his rivals know that very well. But the question is, will he remain that as these developments happen throughout the next several months? Of course, the first debate is in less than two weeks time and these indictments are playing out.</p><p>But even though he's the front runner, there are at least half the party polls and in our reporting would suggest that Republicans are looking in a different direction open to someone else. So we will of course have to let this play out. But this is very much Fredricka, a competition that is is is fully engaged. You can tell that by seeing so many of his rivals here at the fair today campaigning as well.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Oh, they are indeed. All right. Jeff Zeleny. Thanks so much. We'll check back with you.</p><p>All right, straight ahead. As Maui residents begin to assess the loss and Lahaina, we're seeing more videos of harrowing escapes out of Lahaina. We'll show you how one family and their pets made it out alive.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:28:27]</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right on the road to Lahaina on Maui, the traffic grows once again as does the frustration as residents are kept from returning to their homes and businesses. It's the second time the main road into the hard hit area abruptly was shut down. The line of cars waiting there stretch for nearly a mile. So you can see right there. At least 80 people died and many more are missing after wildfires raged across the island this week. Let's go now to CNN Mike Valeria. Who is on Maui. Mike, what is the latest on people trying to get in being turned around being told? You know that the situation is very tenuous.</p><p>MIKE VALERIO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Federicka. It's unbelievable. After all the heartstopping images that we've seen since Tuesday afternoon with people waiting to get in sometimes 15 hours or more. It is now at times traffic here on Maui (ph) that is deciding whether or not people get in past this police perimeter.</p><p>So when you walk with me down here, this is the main road that is into this and just over to my right Ssome of these folks have been waiting since far before dawn. The story essentially, Fredericka, is that this roadway reopened yesterday but because too many people were going into Lahaina beyond the barriers that were meant to only be accessed by FEMA that weren't investigated yet by first responders.</p><p>[15:30:03]</p><p>The police here in Maui said all right now we got to stop everybody, we're going to shut this down and reassess how we are managing this.</p><p>So you know, on that front Fredericka, we spoke to a bunch of motorists before dawn, take a listen to what they told us about their own journeys. Patrick made it in, Todd did not the second gentleman you're going to hear from listen to what they said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PATRICK THURSTON, LAHAINA RESIDENT: I got out here by 11 made it all the way to the other side. I was done by 3:00 picking up all the supplies I got. And then got to here and I've been here since 3:00 in the afternoon.</p><p>VALERIO: You've been here since three?</p><p>THURSTON: Yes, we nobody -- none of us has moved. My coworker she's up there two trucks, my other -- I got three other coworkers down there. They're back there. They've been here the whole time.</p><p>TODD DOMECK, LAHAINA RESIDENT: It's either laughter or tears, you know. So when I talked to all the people in our business that have been affected, about 14 people that have lost their houses, and -- so we're just trying to do the most good we can, but it's really frustrating when you can't.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VALERIO: So what you should know Fred is this is the latest in the storyline that is all about communication, everything from the emergency sirens, the cell phone, or it's not going through, because beyond this perimeter, there's not much cellphone service since Tuesday. This is the latest when you think about all the people who are waiting in this line, going back for about a mile. We're trying to get the word out to them. People who are turned around are trying to say, look, as soon as I go down this road, I'm going to tell people that because there's this traffic jam, don't go any farther.</p><p>In terms of, Fredericka, the new reporting that CNN has for the wider picture of what it is going to take to rebuild. We have new numbers out from FEMA, that estimate it's going to take $5.5 billion to rebuild the epicenter of this crisis area.</p><p>Also 2,200 structures damaged or destroyed. 4,500 People who are projected to be in need of long term shelter. So, essentially what people back in the mainland and around the world should know. This is just the start of rebuilding of finding how structures like your homes if they made it from late Tuesday night into Wednesday, if people survived as well. This is just another roadblock, another chapter for people's misery here on Maui. Fred?</p><p>WHITFIELD: Yes, misery on Maui. That's one way to put it. Thank you so much, Mike Valario.</p><p>All right. A couple in Lahaina is sharing their terrifying escape to safety after the wildfire barreled toward their home. CNN affiliate Hawaii News Now has their story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JILL PERKINS, LAHAINA RESIDENT: Oh my god, I think we need to load up the car maybe. Oh my God. It is so close.</p><p>MAHEALANI RICHARDSON, REPORTER, HAWAII NEWS NOW (voiceover): Jill and Mike Perkins say the Lahaina fire started just behind their Millstreet home around 3:30 Tuesday with no notice to evacuate. They jumped in their car with their dog, two cats and just a few items.</p><p>PERKINS: Oh my god.</p><p>RICHARDSON: As the angry flames roared all around them.</p><p>PERKINS: We have the kiddies and I have you.</p><p>RICHARDSON: They desperately tried to figure out how to escape.</p><p>PERKINS: I thought we were going to die. I said oh my god, this can't be happening right now. The Mckeeva tree. Next there our house.</p><p>RICHARDSON: Their Lahaina home devoured as they fled.</p><p>PERKINS: (INAUDIBLE) I'm just going to chip for the freeway here.</p><p>I only took a videotape because I knew that that was probably the last time we'll be there. And it was just like, unbelievable to watch.</p><p>MIKE PERKINS, LAHAINA RESIDENT: Just turn right by it and keep going.</p><p>J. PERKINS: Oh my god.</p><p>RICHARDSON (on camera): The Perkins a traffic was at a standstill because of live wires overhaul Honoapiilani Highway. Then he called crews put down plywood over the lines. And they drove over it one car at a time. They say each second was excruciating.</p><p>M. PERKINS: Like probably 80 cars in front of us.</p><p>J. PERKINS: I don't know. It just --</p><p>M. PERKINS: You know, 60 or 80 cars.</p><p>J. PERKINS: It just seemed like every second was 10 hours waiting. And I kept saying do we get out and run. Things are hitting our car like branches and embers we're hitting our car, live wire hit our car, with their car.</p><p>M. PERKINS: We had a power of live powerline at the top of our car. I was terrified and I was concerned for our family and for all the other people there.</p><p>RICHARDSON: They made it to Kahului in two and a half hours their house now in ashes but memories of their beloved Dickinson plantation home and Lahaina still strong. Mahealani Richardson, Hawaii News Now.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WHITFIELD: And there are so many stories of escaped just like that.</p><p>[15:35:02]</p><p>Meantime, there's also growing criticism over how authorities handled the early moments of the wildfires as flames spread across the island. Hawaii's Attorney General will lead a review of the state's response leading up to the fires.</p><p>There are questions and concerns about the warning sirens that were not activated, which critics say cost some people their lives. That's not the only concern about Hawaii's wildfire preparedness. Here's CNN Pam Brown.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>PAMELA BROWN, CNN CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): CNN is learning Hawaii officials underestimated the risk of wildfires and a recent report. Even as other documents show officials knew they lacked resources to prevent and fight fires.</p><p>ABBY FRAZIER, CLIMATOLOGIST, CLARK UNIVERSITY: We had advanced notice coming into the summer this week. The winds the low humidity and the fuels, any ignition would have sparked a pretty big fire and that's exactly what we saw.</p><p>BROWN: In a state report out just last year ranking natural disasters, Hawaii officials classified the wildfire risk to human life as low in this color coded chart. The assessment though coming years after Hurricane Lane fanned the flames of fires in Hawaii ravaging Maui and Oahu in 2018. That perfect storm of conditions highlighted the threat and how unprepared officials in Hawaii were dealing with such a disaster.</p><p>With the county report in 2021, Noting hurricane Lane made small fires swell and stretch public safety resources with strong winds grounding air support, that storm should have been a wake-up call according to this planning document from Hawaii's Emergency Management Agency.</p><p>Other state and local documents show Hawaii lagged behind and preparedness for the devastating wildfires playing out now that have killed more than 50 people left countless people missing and triggered widespread evacuations, a cruel deja vu for some residents.</p><p>MARK STEFL, LST HOME TO FIRE TWICE: About four years ago, we had another hurricane and we lost our house in the fire. Rebuilt. And what happened yesterday is killing me right now. We just lost our house again twice in four years.</p><p>BROWN: A 2021 report also makes the troubling point that despite the increasing number of wildfires, fire prevention was given quote, short shrift in a strategic plan from Maui County's Department of Fire and Safety. The plan also included quote nothing about what can and should be done to prevent fires, which it called a significant oversight.</p><p>FRAZIER: Given how catastrophic this event was. I think there will be a lot of pressure on the state and other organizations to improve their fire prevention actions that they're taking statewide.</p><p>BROWN: The increase in fires in Hawaii comes as Maui has faced increasing drought conditions in recent years, contributing to warnings like this, and I'm a webinar from Nani Barreto with the Hawaii Wildfire Management Organization.</p><p>NANI BARRETO, HAWAII WILDFIRE MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATION: Hawaii has a big wildfire problem. We are on par with the most fire prone states in the western continental US. The impacts of fire are broad and long lasting.</p><p>BROWN: Now residents like Mark Stefl are left to rebuild again as the threat of future disasters looms with no clear plan in place.</p><p>STEFL: I mean, I know what I needed to do. We've done it before. It sucks.</p><p>BROWN: Pamela Brown, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WHITFIELD: And for more information on how you can help Hawaii wildfire victims go to cnn.com/impact or text Hawaii to 707070 to donate.</p><p>Ukraine once again appearing to target a key bridge in Crimea used by Russia. We'll show you what happened as the missiles approached.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:43:05]</p><p>WHITFIELD: Traffic is once again flowing across the Crimean bridge after three Ukrainian missiles were shut down. That's according to a Russian backed official.</p><p>Meantime, Ukrainian authorities are discussing a possible mandatory evacuation of children in the Kupiansk region of Kharkiv as Russia intensifies its shelling. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh is Dnipro and he has the latest.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Again dramatic scenes around the Kerch Bridge the really only independent link that runs from the Russian mainland to the occupied Crimean peninsula of Ukraine that was annexed by Russia in 2014.</p><p>We've seen previous attacks on that cause damage to it. It's unclear if today's scenes resulted in damage to the bridge. Certainly Russian officials said it did not. And that two missiles one they said an adapted S-200 anti-aircraft missile were in fact intercepted. And then what in fact holidaymakers people on the beach films, the extraordinary scenes was instead, a smokescreen designed to you might say obscure any strike had occurred or make it harder for the missile to impact the bridge itself.</p><p>But again, a reminder for Russians of how things they may have considered to have been impregnable at the start of the war, now clearly in Ukraine's reach. We've seen Ukrainian drone attacks in the east part of the Black Sea recently, and it appears one on the Kerch Bridge itself as well.</p><p>And so today's attack, another reminder that if Ukraine is finding the southern counteroffensive moving at a slower pace than it would like it's still able to hit key parts of Russian infrastructure. It seems at will even if today's attack wasn't successful.</p><p>We're also to hearing of a Ukrainian order to evacuate a city known as Kupiansk not far from Kharkiv. They've been saying that the 12,000 civilians who've returned there, since it was liberated from the Russians last, that they should evacuate and now a more direct order for the children there possibly over 500 to be taken out immediately.</p><p>[15:45:07]</p><p>This is because of a Russian push there, intense artillery strikes on what remains of that town and a sign that perhaps Moscow is trying to change the narrative after feeling intense pressure in the south to find another area of work, perhaps and distract Ukrainian forces and force them to readjust where their strength necessarily is, but still seem to gain at that bridge to Crimea, a reminder that even though this counteroffensive is sort of moving at a slower pace than Ukraine would like it's able to project strength elsewhere. Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, Dnipro, Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WHITFIELD: And a moment of normality in the Ukrainian city of Odesa, the area's beaches have been reopened for the first time since the Russian invasion. Odesa once thrived with busy holiday resorts but has been the site of relentless shelling almost since the war began.</p><p>Authorities say the beach will still be closed to swimmers during air raid alerts.</p><p>All right, coming up. A Michigan police chief has issued an apology after officers wrongly detained a child while he was taking the trash out behind his home. More details straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:50:42]</p><p>WHITFIELD: The police chief in Lansing, Michigan issuing an apology after an incident in which a black child was handcuffed by officers while he was taking out the trash behind his home. CNN Isabel Rosales is following the developments for us. So what exactly is the chief saying?</p><p>ISABEL ROSALES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Fred. Lansing police are calling this a case of mistaken identity saying that this was the wrong time in the wrong place. And in fact, they put out two pictures of side by side comparison, showing the public the suspect who they were looking for. And then the 12-year-old boy that they mistakenly detained.</p><p>This all caught national attention due to a TikTok video put out by a neighbor who shot this confrontation on their cell phone showing the boy right there in handcuffs. And then the father later on in the video shouting from several feet away. That boy is then placed in the back of a police car. He is then after a short time released, uncuffed and released back to his father.</p><p>This TikTok video right here about over nearly 5 million views and thousands of comments. Now the boy's father Michael Bernard spoke with WILX an affiliate of CNN. He says that he was washing the dishes and then told his son Tashawn to take out the trash. And here's what he said happened during an off camera interview with our affiliate.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL BERNARD, BOY'S FATHER: I get concerned when I didn't see him come back within that period of time. And I walk out to here, look out and to my surprise the cops had him in handcuffs. I was mad about it. That was my sudden never do it breaking the law. So I rushed down and asked the cop what's the problem? Well, you have my son in handcuff just like that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROSALES: And the family has since that video right there, that interviewer done a virtual news conference and has spoken publicly about what transpired there. Lansing Police Department says that they were searching for a suspect in a string of car thefts and then a witness came forward and describe that suspect is having neon shorts and a white shirt and that is why they detained this child 12 years old that was wearing similar clothing and was actually in the same apartment complex as the witness said that this accused car thief had run off to.</p><p>So the police Chief Ellery Sosobee has issued an apology. Here's part of the statement he put out, as the chief of police, I want to apologize that this incident had such an effect on this young man, and again 12 years old here, and his family. I'm asking for the community to consider all the facts of the situation before making a judgment. The relationship with our community has been and will continue to be a top priority for the Lansing Police Department.</p><p>And Fred the family here, the Barnard family has gotten a hold of an attorney. And they -- the attorney is claiming that his client was wearing a gray shirt not a white one and was visibly much younger than the suspect. CNN has not independently been able to confirm the color that the child was wearing during that incident. And the family is considering legal action against the city.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right, Isabel Rosales, thanks so much.</p><p>ROSALES: Thanks.</p><p>WHITFIELD: We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:58:14]</p><p>WHITFIELD: Right now Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin is playing in a preseason game today his first since collapsing on the field during a game against the Cincinnati Bengals earlier this year.

(AP) \u2014 Cooler weather on Friday helped crews trying to keep California wildfires away from a grove of gigantic ancient sequoias, including the world's largest tree, the base of which had been wrapped in a fire-resistant material in case the flames reached it.</p><p>Unlike raging wildfires that have burned vast swaths of the drought-stricken U.S. West this summer, the blazes in Sequoia National Park were not explosive. Flames were about a mile (1.5 kilometers) from the famous Giant Forest, a grove of some 2,000 massive sequoias on a plateau high in the Sierra Nevada.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been slow growth,\u201d fire information officer Katy Hooper said.</p><p>Lower temperatures and a layer of smoke blanketing the area have been suppressing the flames.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/fires-environment-and-nature-forests-trees-wildfires-16c2303399942a4015d3a780d2eec4e3\">Firefighters</url> have placed a special aluminum wrapping around the base of the General Sherman Tree, the world's largest by volume at 52,508 cubic feet (1,487 cubic meters), as well as some other trees and buildings.</p><p>The material can withstand intensive heat for short periods and has been used in national parks and forests for several years throughout the West to protect sensitive structures from flames.</p><p>A major element of the grove's defense is decades of prescribed burns \u2014 fires intentionally set to clear the forest floor of vegetation that could feed bigger blazes \u2014 and thinning projects to remove small trees that could become ladders carrying fire up to the crowns of the giants.</p><p>A fire in the region last year killed thousands of sequoias, which grow as tall as high-rises at certain elevations on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada.</p><p>\u201cThis is a beautiful, open, park-like forest,\u201d fire spokesman Mark Garrett said.</p><p>But a <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/ut-state-wire-az-state-wire-id-state-wire-or-state-wire-nv-state-wire-d1f130f8826ef57c74db611e959937ac\">historic drought tied to climate change</url> is making wildfires harder to fight. Scientists say climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.</p><p>Lightning ignited two fires in the park on Sept. 9, officials said. The Colony Fire, closest to the Giant Forest, has grown to just under 5 square miles (13 square kilometers). The Paradise Fire has scorched nearly 13 square miles (34 square kilometers).</p><p>More than 400 firefighters were assigned to the blazes, which are being collectively managed as the KNP Complex. More resources have been requested, Hooper said.</p><p>To the south, the Windy Fire grew to nearly 11 square miles (28 square kilometers) on the Tule River Indian Reservation and in Giant Sequoia National Monument, where it has burned into one grove of sequoias and threatens others. Difficult terrain has prevented officials from assessing damage to the big trees.</p><p>Sequoia National Park is the second natural jewel to be threatened by wildfires in less than a month.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-travel-mountains-fires-environment-and-nature-eb56661ee9a13ba8078d9774e4952600\">Lake Tahoe</url>, the blue alpine lake perched high in the mountains on the California-Nevada line, was threatened by the explosive Caldor Fire until firefighters stopped its destructive march. Containment there has reached 71%.</p><p>Meanwhile, a big change in weather was taking shape in parts of the drought-stricken, fire-scarred West.</p><p>Forecasters said a storm heading in from the Pacific would bring rain to the Pacific Northwest and parts of Northern California through the weekend. The rain was not expected to come as far south as Sequoia National Park.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-545b327cf3666cf65e6dd4b951b740e920210917</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63MH-MM61-DYMD-622T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"551\"/><timeReceived>9:36 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 17, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Record heat and drought are sucking moisture from trees and undergrowth. And some regions are seeing more violent thunderstorms, whose lightning can provide a fateful spark.</p><p>Scientists say forest restoration and other natural solutions could provide up to one-third of the mitigation needed to keep global warming below 2C.</p><p>\"Anything that combats climate change, including restoring and expanding the store of carbon in forests, is helping to reduce the risk of extreme wildfires,\" said Tim Christophersen, head of the Nature for Climate Unit at the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).</p><p>Large-scale forest conservation and restoration can also counter extreme wildfire more directly. While intact forests may become more diverse and less fire-prone with age, where forests are degraded restoration can help to accelerate their return to a more natural condition.</p><p>\"More people need to have a stake in restoring and managing these landscapes, and more support from governments and business in order to make it happen.\"</p><p>Peter Moore, forest fire expert, FAO</p><p>Fighting fire with fire</p><p>In many temperate forest ecosystems, restoring natural fire patterns is vital, experts say. That means ending a common focus on preventing fire at all costs. Landscapes that burn cyclically contain less flammable material. When fire does occur, it spares larger trees, invigorates the ecosystem and is less likely to threaten people.</p><p>Letting wildfires run their course may be the most effective way to restore some types of forest, especially in remote areas. Near towns and villages, managed burning may be safer. Fires can be set when weather conditions and soil moisture make the flames easier to contain. Forests can also be thinned by hand or with machinery.</p><p>\"Wildfire can act as a self-regulating mechanism,\" said Cara Nelson, a professor of restoration ecology at the University of Montana, United States. \"In forests adapted to frequent fire, we want fire back and that means we need to learn to live with it.\"</p><p>Restorative principles can be incorporated into strategies to defend properties in fire-prone regions. Residents can plant fire-tolerant native plants around their home and avoid more flammable or exotic species that can become invasive.</p><p>Firefighters battling a megafire in California. Some researchers argue that small, controlled blazes can prevent more devastating fires.

In many situations, forest ecosystems will quickly rebound on their own, depending on the intensity and impacts of the fire. In others, interventions can aid and steer that process.</p><p>When fires strip landscapes of vegetation, hillsides are vulnerable to massive erosion that can hinder a forest's recovery. Reseeding can reduce the risk of soil loss and landslides and protect water supplies. Using native grasses can block invasive competitors.</p><p>Where fire has damaged the habitat of rare wildlife, replanting specific trees and plants may help target populations to survive. In eastern Australia, for instance, ecologists are re-establishing mistletoe in forests used by an endangered bird, the regent honeyeater.</p><p>Restoration can begin even while a fire is still burning, in the form of first aid and rehabilitation for injured wildlife. Food drops for species whose natural larders have been destroyed can help them survive, as can programmes to control invasive predators.</p><p>Food drops are critical to helping species and their ecosystems bounce back after fires. Photo: Reuters/Pamela Schramm</p><p>Reviving landscapes</p><p>Active replanting is a focus in forest landscape restoration in some fire-prone areas. In Portugal's Algarve region, for instance, a project aims to recreate belts of native, fire-resistant cork oak forest among more flammable commercial plantations of eucalyptus and pine.</p><p>Portugal is also an example of how reducing the risk from fire can mean restoring the economic and social fabric of whole regions. The country's new national fire management plan bundles natural and social restoration as one of its five pillars. Measures to prevent catastrophic fires include valuing rural landscapes more highly.</p><p>\"More people need to have a stake in restoring and managing these landscapes, and more support from governments and business is needed in order to make it happen,\" said Peter Moore, a forest fire expert with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). \"Strong rural communities can understand the value as well as the risks of fire.\"</p><p>The UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration 2021-2030, led by the United Nations Environment Programme, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and partners, covers terrestrial as well as coastal and marine ecosystems. A global call to action, it will draw together political support, scientific research and financial muscle to massively scale up restoration.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124110214</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61DW-Y9M1-JCBF-S1J9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-12-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"889\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"12\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>December 1, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Fireweed is BCIT's first-ever podcast series that shares stories about people who have preserved in the face of disruption and re-written their story.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Why Fireweed?</p><p>After the devastation of a forest fire, the first plant to grow back is fireweed. A vibrant wildflower from the Pacific Northwest, fireweed symbolizes hope, resilience, and adaptability--things we could all use a little more of right now.</p><p>Adaptability is now seen as the critical skill by leading employers across the country. But the trick is: we need to adapt in the right ways. Ways that will help us move forward, together. Through Fireweed, BCIT is connecting education and industry to power resilience, foster hope, and strengthen adaptability.</p><p>Stories and guests on Fireweed</p><p>Listeners will follow host and BCIT Broadcast and Online Journalism alumna Maria Vinca through conversations with thought leaders and experts from throughout the Cascadia Corridor and beyond. Meet academics, industry leaders, and people from business and tech who are working to create resilient systems--all built to handle change. Compelling and personal stories from people with vastly different experiences who have demonstrated their ability to grow and adapt to whatever challenges life throws at them and--like fireweed--come back stronger than ever.</p><p>That's why this diverse and inter-generational podcast, brought to you by BCIT, tells stories that embody our never-ending human potential to adapt to change.</p><p>In season one of this podcast series, listeners will enjoy discussions around:</p><p>* Accessibility - Featuring Humboldt Bronco player Ryan Straschnitzki's journey from hockey hopeful to accessibility advocate. Brad McCannell from the Rick Hansen Foundation also highlights what we need to do to make the built environment work for people with disabilities, and how eventually we'll all have accessibility needs.</p><p>* Sustainability - Building cities has traditionally meant altering or destroying the natural environment, but it doesn't have to be like that. Explore Ecocities beyond the \"eco\" with Mark Angelo, Founder of World Rivers Day.</p><p>* Cybersecurity - Cybersecurity experts and IT departments warn us about it, but how seriously do we really take our online security? Join Derek Manky, Chief of Security Insights and Global Threat Alliances for Fortinet and discover the dangers of doing business in a hyper-connected world.</p><p>* Mid-career shift - The mid-life crisis is a well-documented trope, but recently, mid-life career transition is gaining recognition as a uniquely modern phenomenon. Ryan Chynces from Hootsuite speaks to how micro credentials have helped him recruit and support current staff.</p><p>* Digital transformation and education - Education is changing.

With cooler temperatures tonight, that smoke that normally leaves us\" will remain.</p><p>Reduced visibility on the Interstate 25 corridor south to Watrous is among the likely results of that stagnation, he said.</p><p>\"We're having major impacts with other fires joining,\" Ranspot said. He urged drivers to travel slowly because shifting winds can rapidly change visibility conditions.</p><p>As residents evacuated, a key question remained unanswered: How much damage have the combined Hermits Peak and Calf Canyon fires done?</p><p>Determining the answer could take two to three days, team incident commander Carl Schwope said during the briefing.</p><p>\"The amount of fire growth yesterday had a significant impact on private property, but we want that information to be accurate,\" he said. \"This is a large fire, and there's a lot of places to cover.\"</p><p>Additional resources were on the way to help fight the fire, Schwope said, without offering specifics. He said after the fire had grown considerably Friday the team didn't have enough resources to do everything it had wanted to do simultaneously.</p><p>Jayson Coil, the team's operations section chief, said the fire had not crossed N.M. 518 as of shortly before 6p.m. - but that it might overnight.</p><p>Fellow team member Americk Padilla, the Mora County undersheriff, said he'd just returned from a site near the blaze and sounded an optimistic tone.</p><p>\"I was seeing the progress that the guys on the ground are making,\" he said. \"They're kicking butt; they're doing what they're supposed to do.\"</p><p>Fire behavior analyst Stewart Turner also shared a less-than-dire projection.</p><p>\"I'm not expecting a big growth day tomorrow, but we will see some perimeter growth,\" he said.</p><p>Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, who delivered an update Saturday afternoon in Santa Fe, issued a declaration of emergency Saturday for surrounding Mora County. The move was aimed at freeing up federal money to help.</p><p>Elsewhere in New Mexico</p><p>About 7 miles east of Jemez Springs, the Cerro Pelado Fire was at 4,688 acres and zero percent containment Saturday morning, according to an update on the New Mexico Fire Information website. Sandoval County issued evacuation orders for Sierra de Los Pinos and other communities near the fire, and N.M. 4 was closed from N.M. 126 east to</p><p>Los Alamos.</p><p>About 30 personnel were on the scene, and wind gusts above 40 mph were possible in spots, according to the update. It added firefighters were focused Saturday on protecting homes and keeping the fire from crossing to the west of Forest Road 10.</p><p>Los Alamos National Laboratory stated in a news release it's about 10 miles from the blaze and was not in immediate danger and helicopters had begun dropping water on the fire.</p><p>The blazes continued to burn a day after high winds tore through Northern New Mexico, spreading fires, kicking up dust, fueling fears of downed power lines and otherwise complicating firefighters' already-daunting task.</p><p>According to an update on the New Mexico Fire Information website,</p><p>419 personnel were involved in battling the merged Calf Canyon and Hermits Peak fires near Gallinas Canyon.</p><p>Power has been shut off for safety reasons in Pendaries, Rociada, Manuelitas and Ca\u00f1oncito and along County Road A-3A. Several roads were closed, including N.M. 518 from Sapello north to Buena Vista, the update stated.</p><p>In Harding County, the new Mitchell Fire on private land east of Mosquero on N.M. 39 was estimated at 20,000 acres and was zero percent contained. Crews were set to continue building containment lines around the blaze into the evening.</p><p>In Union County, the Campbell Road Fire east of Des Moines was estimated Saturday at 2,000 acres and 90 percent contained. Firefighters were set to work through the weekend to mop up and secure containment lines.</p><p>In Taos County, a small blaze off</p><p>N.M. 518 east of Pe\u00f1asco was about</p><p>5 acres and 10 percent contained. The Carson National Forest fire is within the burn scar of the 2011 Osha Fire, largely surrounded by natural barriers such as rocks.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWMEX-15664131</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWMEX2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:659V-BWG1-DY7H-R4YF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147872</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-04-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"819\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Santa Fe New Mexican All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Santa Fe New Mexican</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"04\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>April 24, 2022 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>META PLATFORMS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FOREST SERVICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001794</classCode><className>VEHICLE TRAFFIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0009RO6</classCode><className>STREAMING MEDIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DABR</classCode><className>MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GS147</classCode><className>NEW MEXICO, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

THE FIVE.</p><p>There's a brand new tourist attraction in America that's all the rage, but you might want to get your hepatitis shot first. A local San Francisco guide is offering a $30.00 doom loop walking tour of the city's most crime- ridden spots, letting people get a good whiff of the liberal policies that have turned America's wealthiest city into a cesspool of open-air drug markets and homeless encampments.</p><p>And while San Fran's decay could be a boon to certain tourism, it's a death sentence to retailers. The owner of Gump's San Francisco, a place that I used to frequent as little Greg is warning that they might close for good after 166 years of doing business.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN CHACHAS, OWNER, GUMP'S SAN FRANCISCO: Our business is a business that people love and people want to come into San Francisco, want to come visit a store.</p><p>But if you can't get around, and when you're trying to walk the streets you step over needles in human waste, and often bodies on the streets. It makes it an unworkable business environment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD: And if that wasn't enough human misery on display, how about Philly, where businesses are now being forced to set up booby traps like hidden sprinklers to ward off drug addicts who keep scaring customers. A former drug dealer turned activist comparing the situation in Philly to a zombie movie.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRANK RODRIGUEZ, YOUTUBER AND MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKER: Kensington. Now again, it is the first stop, they come off the train, they come right down here. And it's like illegal pass. Do whatever you want.</p><p>When you see the chaos that's going around, you're going to see people blood run down there arm, needles in their neck, needle in their arm, pipe in their mouth, everything goes out.</p><p>You're literally dealing with chemical warfare. You know, that's what's happening. You see the people falling apart, limbs falling off. You've seen that people when we were down there, there's arm. It looks like a zombie movie.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD: And speaking of drug addiction, the problem is only getting worse. Americans say fentanyl poisonings are now the biggest public health risk that the country faces surging to number one, followed by obesity, gun violence, and cancer.</p><p>So, Charlie, I want to go to you first. I think that we have to pay the Biden administration a compliment. They created new jobs with the doom loop tours. These jobs would not have happened if it wasn't for his leadership.</p><p>CHARLIE HURT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: That's really finding the silver lining, Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, it is.</p><p>HURT: Very impressive.</p><p>GUTFELD: Thank you.</p><p>HURT: But you do have to sort of give a nod to American ingenuity. I mean, you know, Americans have always -- or I guess people of all stripes have always loved. They love horror movies. They love freak shows. And that's what this is. It's a modern-day freak show, circus freak show.</p><p>And it's also, it goes to why Democrats are so successful talking about climate change is that all of the terrifying stuff that they promote on their climate change agenda is it's such a great movie, everybody wants to go see the horror movie.</p><p>But the idea that you would sit here and say, well, it's really not, it's really not as dramatic as they're saying that no one's going to go see that movie. Nobody wants to see the movie that oh, no, it's all natural.</p><p>But no, the larger problem here, and obviously, it's a huge problem, it's a complex problem and it's a horrifying problem. You have so many families of all socio-economic backgrounds, all parts of the country who are affected by this. And it's horrifying.</p><p>There's a limited amount of things that the government can do to tackle this, but everything that the government can do, such as closing the border, or allowing the thriving economy or prosecuting drug convictions, the Biden administration, has completely failed to do.</p><p>And, you know, when you talk to people who have recovered from drug addiction, especially with opioids, that number of them who say that getting arrested and going to jail was what turned me around ought to be a lesson for us to about where to go forward from here.</p><p>GUTFELD: You know, Judge, you look at these store owners in Philly setting up booby traps. It's kind of funny, but you know, if anything goes awry, they're the ones that go to jail.</p><p>JEANINE PIRRO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL LEGAL ANALYST: Doesn't it remind you, Greg, of the -- there was a guy who was -- took a hose to some homeless people in front of his business, and I think he got arrested for something or charged with something.</p><p>Look, I was a narcotics judge and I was also a D.A. and I created and helped create the drug courts in Westchester County.</p><p>Look, you need the leverage. You need the stick. They're not going to go into treatment unless they're faced with jail time. And a lot of them would rather go to jail than go to treatment.</p><p>So, we had something going for us when we had the big stick and the leverage. What has happened now is we have so normalized drug abuse and drug addiction, that we have created these safe injection sites and vending machines, and with needles and all kinds of laws that literally protect these people and allow them to do this in front of residences and businesses.</p><p>In front of your house, Greg, if you want to put a three-foot fence, that, you know, you'll get charged and fined for doing that, but they can do that all over and destroy things.</p><p>And drugs are more dangerous than ever now, if ever there were a time to at least consider the criminal justice system as leverage, it's now, because the little fentanyl is going to kill you.</p><p>And let's not let Fauci off the hook. All of this -- a lot of this happened because of the school lockouts and the -- and the lockdowns in homes. And the highest overdose rate in this country wasn't 2022. And that was because people couldn't go to treatment, they couldn't have meetings, and we're in a bad place.</p><p>So, we've got to figure out like San Diego did. It's really easy to clean this stuff up. You pass laws, you enforce laws, and then people like the guy from Gump's don't have to stand there and say we can't live like this. There is an intentional destruction of America, and it should stop and it can stop.</p><p>GUTFELD: Speaking of COVID, this is interesting, Dana. Everything was shut down, basically, except for liquor stores, marijuana dispensaries, because they were considered essential services. Now, if they'd shut them down, you would have had moonshine, which is what you're seeing right now in our streets. We're having moonshine fentanyl, because there's no access to safe fentanyl, so they make their own and then everybody dies.</p><p>So, I think logically, you could make the conclusion that if you actually made safe legal drugs available, you would probably see less overdoses, less of these crazy people on the street.</p><p>DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Yes, I do think there's merit to that. I just don't know what the experiment. Like, Portland tried it.</p><p>GUTFELD: That was decriminalization, not legalization.</p><p>PERINO: Right. So, I don't know. I would love to see like, could we just get one test area? Who's going to volunteer to be the test area?</p><p>GUTFELD: I volunteer where Charlie lives.</p><p>HURT: Comparing fentanyl to moonshine. Moonshine is healthy. It's really good.</p><p>GUTFELD: OK. I apologize. I had no idea.</p><p>HURT: It's not dangerous. It doesn't come from China. It's really delicious.</p><p>PERINO: What the Judge was saying about COVID and 2022, what else happened then? 2021 and 2022, the border is wide open.</p><p>So, then, all the opioids have come on, the fentanyl is coming across and now you have the one pill can kill situation. In California, 20 percent of the deaths were ages 18 to 25. And I went down this list of Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Georgia, it's all the same. All the statistics.</p><p>So today, Victor Davis Hanson, he did a interview. I haven't watched the interview. And I was just reading about it, where he was talking about the fall of the Byzantine and the Roman Empire and what happened.</p><p>And I was just thinking about how you just went to Italy. A lot of people we know have gone to Europe this year, because one of the reasons you go is not just the food, but it's to experience the most beautiful monuments and the architecture and the tremendous civilization progress that was made over those years.</p><p>And what are we doing? We are tearing down our own historic art. Some people say they don't deserve to be up there. But do you destroy them? Or do you put them on a park somewhere?</p><p>We are letting our citizens lie in their own excrement. You remember the other day when you said the young women going to Pilates on Sixth Avenue. I'm not a young woman anymore. But I was going to Pilates today.</p><p>Every single block, there was a man line in his own excrement. You have to -- basically, you cannot breathe through your nose from here to Columbus Circle.</p><p>GUTFELD: You can smell from the car.</p><p>PERINO: It is horrendous. And we are letting people do that. So, I guess, kudos to the entrepreneurs in San Francisco who are trying to figure out a way to make dominate out of doom.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, you know, Jessica, it seems that your party has turned the American dream into a narcotic one. What do you have to say for all the destruction that your party has unleashed on what was once the greatest country that ever was, as it slowly -- well, rather quickly descends into chaos?</p><p>JESSICA TARLOV, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Headline, Greg Gutfeld doesn't think America is the greatest country anymore.</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't.</p><p>TARLOV: Right out of your own mouth. I think that this is devastating. I've spoken about it a lot. San Francisco is a really important city to me. I was just there a few weeks ago, and there are parts of it that I used to hang out in that you just don't go anymore and certainly, I wasn't bringing the baby down there. Pushing clear around to see the site and that's really heartbreaking. And it's happening in a lot of cities.</p><p>This isn't something that is new, you don't get to decline at this level in just a couple of years. And I understand that there has always been democratic government there, I think it has accelerated from the effects of COVID.</p><p>But you do see a dichotomy within the Democratic Party in terms of how officials will talk about it. And I think that London Breed has not done as good of a job in doing that. She was late to the game saying now that she's added an extra 200 police officers, but she was resistant to acknowledging a lot of the problems that were in front of everybody.</p><p>And I've said it before, and I'll say it again, these people who are complaining are not Republicans in waiting, they are not turning into voters for the other side. They are Democrats demanding a better quality of life, especially for your tax dollars, which are enormous in cities like that.</p><p>One thing that the owner of Gump's said that I thought was really important, said that one of the ways that we can help with this is that companies need to demand that people go back to work.</p><p>Because if high-end workers are now coming back into the city that will be forced to clean up in a way that you don't have to right now because the buildings are just empty. Right? So you can have squatting, you can have streets full of homeless people.</p><p>But if you have folks that are earning six figures and walking paths, they're not going to be stepping over people to do that. I thought that that was really interesting and smart.</p><p>To your point about legalizing drugs, though, that is part of why these safe injection sites are important, that it is better. If somebody is going to --</p><p>GUTFELD: I's still the illegal drug. That's the problem.</p><p>TARLOV: But you have to -- I understand that and I should note also that the fentanyl seizures are up astronomically.</p><p>So, 300 percent in San Diego, what you call that as a great example, the D.A. announced.</p><p>GUTFELD: They'll just make more.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO: And then you leave and you lie on the street. I don't think that's a great idea.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's the issue.</p><p>TARLOV: No, it's not. It's not a perfect solution, but it can be part of it. And they have -- that's been proven out before that safe injection sites do help people because at least you're not putting a dirty needle into your arm and they can make counselors available there.</p><p>GUTFELD: If the counselor doesn't have any drugs on him, they won't listen to him.</p><p>TARLOV: Well, maybe one does.</p><p>GUTFELD: There you go. All right.</p><p>PIRRO: You can offer them jail instead, they'll clean up fast.</p><p>PERINO: I like that.</p><p>GUTFELD: Coming up, as Democrats blame climate change, did their push for green energy helped cause the Hawaii fires?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PERINO: Did the push of green energy lead to the deadliest wildfire in modern American history? A stunning report from The Wall Street Journal lays out how Hawaii's biggest power utility company, Hawaiian Electric, knew that it needed to do more to prevent its power line from emitting sparks but instead focused on spending money on renewable energy sources to combat climate change.</p><p>While the official cause of the fire is still under investigation, videos are emerging from around the time when the disaster first started. And it's raising questions on whether downed power lines caused the deadly blazes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All line that started. Started from up the road there. And all of that is still burning.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: But that's not stopping the climate blame game, ABC News had to change a headline after backlash from activists. The original headline reading this, why climate change can't be blamed for the Maui wildfires.</p><p>Well, you can imagine that had to get updated. They changed it to why climate change can't be blamed entirely for the Maui wildfires.</p><p>And President Biden's clean energy adviser John Podesta using the White House podium to blame climate change for the catastrophe.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN PODESTA, SENIOR ADVISOR, CLEAN ENERGY INNOVATION: To stop these disasters from getting even worse, we have to cut the carbon pollution that's driving the climate crisis. And that's what the Inflation Reduction Act is all.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: There was one more thing that we should play for you. This is the first responder, the person in charge and Hawaii talking about the sirens here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you regret not sounding the sirens?</p><p>HERMAN ANDAYA, MAUI EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CHIEF: I do not. The sirens as I mentioned earlier, is used primarily for tsunamis. The public is trained to seek higher ground in the event that the siren is sounded. In fact, on the website of the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency, the following guideline is provided. If you are in a low-lying area near the coastline, evacuate to high grounds and then vertically to fourth floor and higher.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: Lots to discuss on this. Greg, the politics around climate change seems to be absolving people in charge of accountability.</p><p>GUTFELD: Well, first off, the sirens went off for incoming missiles that never in came. Then when they need sirens, they don't use them.</p><p>PERINO: Yes, like in a nuclear disaster, you're supposed to go to a higher ground.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, there's something -- there's a lot of stuff going on here, including, like, why they waited on releasing the water and stuff like that. And a lot of it has to do with ideology. It sounds like and when one ideology becomes the overarching principle, then all the other problems underneath it become less vital, right? So, you have 111 people right now I think have died. Right?</p><p>But let's focus on climate change. You see what happens there. It's like, you have this horrible problem, all of these people died. But keep your eye on the big picture. The big picture is climate change, you got to break a few eggs to make an omelet. This is what they -- this is exactly the ideology behind people starving to death in USSR, dying in China. It's like focus on the revolution, focus on the great promise of communism, the Great Leap Forward, just keep it -- who cares if people are dying.</p><p>We have stupidly made all the problems, whether it's in -- you'll see it, education, and crime and the border, and most of all mental health, secondary to climate. And the irony of this is that issue is causing mental health problems.</p><p>But the issue is now the problem. And yet, if you point out, a lot of people are suffering severe anxiety due to all this climate change hysteria, it's like, focus, focus on climate, ignore the fact that people are going crazy.</p><p>PERINO: So, I was thinking about this, Charlie, you and I have known each other since like, the late 90s. And we were both involved in media and I was on the Republican side of politics, you've been in journalism the whole time. And to watch the evolution of this since about 1993, 94, 95 to where we are today, it is pretty stunning. They are just absolutely relentless on the messaging.</p><p>HURT: Yes. And, you know, often usually, when Democrats talk about climate change, they're talking about that, because they don't want to talk about something else, such as failed policies, or the idea that they have no ideas or no solutions to the problems facing.</p><p>But as here in Maui, the problem, it's not some amorphous thing, it's physics. If you have power lines that are jangling all around, and you have an -- you have cluttered dry grass underneath, that doesn't get cut, because the power companies have diverted all of their money over to green energy proposals pie in the sky nonsense, then, of course, you're going to have wildfires.</p><p>And the idea of the thing about the sirens, and I want to be careful about speculating too much, because of course, there's 1,300 people that are still unaccounted for right now. Many of them were probably children, and we have no idea what we're going to find. And I think that all the speculation has to be tempered a little bit.</p><p>But the idea that people -- the sirens are going to go off and they're going to walk out of their houses and then run into a fire just seems to be kind of insulting to people. Usually, people will do anything, even on the, you know, 90th floor of a building, they will go away from the fire if they walk -- even a child, if they walk outside and they see that.</p><p>So, I find that very disingenuous, but John Podesta sit there in the White House and exploit this more shamelessly than Democrats exploit school shootings, to push their creepy gun agenda. It's -- and it's -- and they never get called on it. They're not apologizing for it. And I don't think it's going to quit because it works.</p><p>PERINO: Judge, you -- I hadn't thought about that.</p><p>PIRRO: I was agreeing with him. You know, it's not just relentless on the messaging. I mean, the climate change is the scapegoat.</p><p>Apparently, in 2019, they had some of the worst fires. And they had -- they did a study and they decided they needed to do more to prevent the power lines from emitting sparks, which would then cause these fires.</p><p>So, they didn't put the plan in place. Instead, what they did was they invested in renewable energy in green energy.</p><p>And as a result, there was no plan which is basically turning the power off, if there is a significant wildfire risk, and they need to have that plan in place. They didn't.</p><p>But let me tell you what climate change is responsible for, the new scapegoat. Climate change is responsible for hate speech. It is -- climate change is responsible and it has an effect on the babies in the womb. Climate change is to blame for rising childhood obesity, for strengthening ISIS, the Taliban, it will cause murders, rapes and assaults arise. Screenwriter says climate change could cause real-life sharknado and it goes on and on.</p><p>I mean, come on, deal with the facts. You don't want to take the blame. You stand there and say that you shouldn't have turned on the sirens, that's just outrageous, enough with no excuses.</p><p>PERINO: There's just another one. Another example is a Canadian wildfires from this summer. And so, then when the smoke came down to New England, everyone's like, oh my gosh, the climate change is so bad.</p><p>But then like, could you just give us a second to explain forest fire manage -- forest management? And the ways to deal with this? It's not -- I'm not saying climate change isn't real. I'm saying it's not the only reason that you have this. Plus, a lot of these fires, when you trace it back, they're started by humans, it's started by arson. That's just my TED talk. Let me give you the last word, Jessica, any of this, any at all.</p><p>TARLOV: There's so much.</p><p>GUTFELD: Are you pro-fire?</p><p>TARLOV: Definitely not. And I'm very pro-Hawaii. And this is incredibly different than a normal liberal bastion that you wouldn't be talking about.</p><p>Hawaii is literally paradise, right? This is a well-managed state where people are happy there. It's like the Denmark of America, right? People who are indigenous to being there, people who travel there. It's a wonderful place that is typically well-managed.</p><p>And I don't think that it's part of the liberal agenda to let an electric company off the hook. We hate big business too, right?</p><p>So, we're not like predisposed to love Hawaiian Electric, or whatever it was called. And obviously, there was a mismanagement of the problem. But that did collide with drought conditions, the soil wasn't just dry. It was drier than normal. And then hurricane Dora was stronger than normal, those winds that picked up the electrical short-circuiting is what made it a disaster of this proportion. And that's why Lahaina is gone, which is a complete travesty there.</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't think you can make that that. There's a lot of possibilities in that linkage. And I think there's a few holes in it right there. But I'll let you go.</p><p>TARLOV: I appreciate that.</p><p>PERINO: But also, there's all this money, this climate change money is not going to the adaptations, right? So, let's -- OK, let's shore up the power lines then, let's shore up things. And none of that is happening anywhere. It's not even happening in New York.</p><p>TARLOV: But there seems to be, or at least, the vibe that I'm getting from the table, that there's a refusal, and you said, I'm not saying that climate change isn't real, but it is an important piece of this puzzle.</p><p>I mean, we have these record heat waves and the leaders of Republican states in the last month have all been on T.V. talking about it, the precautions they have to take that they're making sure that there's water available to people, like it's real.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HURT: But also, I don't think that people are suggesting that this was intentional, it's that you get blinded by this ideology, like the green agenda in the power companies, and then you don't take care of the important business that ends up causing catastrophe.</p><p>GUTFELD: Think about this big, stupid bill, the Inflation Reduction Act that was really a climate bill, what that could have done for so many people if they weren't so delusional about climate?</p><p>PIRRO: And if a company is engaging in a dereliction of duty, and not shutting down the power lines, where they actually have videos of every time that power line hit the ground, the spark started. I mean, that's pretty obvious.</p><p>TARLOV: I don't think anyone is disagreeing with that. It's just the point that these things can coexist, that there is a climate change problem and there was a mismanagement of this problem that has led to a complete tragedy.</p><p>PERINO: OK. We'll buy that.</p><p>All right, ahead, President Biden daring Americans to name a single thing he's failed at doing. I think we might be able to come up with a few, we'll tell you when we get back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PIRRO: Get ready for your head to explode. Joe Biden thinks his presidency is a smashing success.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There is no quit in America. Name me a single objective we've ever set out to accomplish that we've failed on. Name me one. In all of our history, not one.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PIRRO: Challenge accepted, Mr. President. How about your border crisis? Democrats in the sanctuary state of New York are taking shots at one another over who's to blame for the spiraling migrant crisis? Governor Kathy Hochul sending a scathing 12-page letter that rips New York City Mayor Eric Adam over his management and failing to properly use the state's resources, but the Democrat mayor firing right back at her.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ERIC ADAMS, MAYOR, NEW YORK CITY: We're hoping that the governor will put in place an executive order that will prevent us from having to go from location to location to location. New York just cannot continue to take this flow.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PIRRO: OK, Greg, isn't this what happens when you declare yourself a sanctuary city and a sanctuary state? And is this the beginning of the implosion of Democrat lawmakers in New York?</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't know. I mean, at first, I got to like -- I got to defend Biden. He was talking about history. So, it wasn't necessarily about him. But that -- he was using that, I believe, as a camouflage against all the problems, which are the border, crime, education, mental health, supporting billions into a war while not helping out the folks in Hawaii, and also not uniting the country, which is what he was elected to do and so far has been doing nothing but divide them.</p><p>But I still find that troubling because he's not well. I mean, I'm sorry that screaming like that irrationally -- and you know, I never scream on this show. I usually try to keep myself -- I try to keep America calm.</p><p>PERINO: It's always rational.</p><p>GUTFELD: It's always rational. But he like there's something going on there. The Democrats can't admit this openly. They need to get him off the ticket. But as long as Kamala is there, that means their choice for V.P. for now forces the P to stay put. Because you can't get rid of him if she's still hanging around. You know, no one wants Joe for another term, much less for four or five months. But the only thing worse is that chuckling gas bag. So, it's like they don't know what to do. They're in -- they're in a tight little corner. That's why Gavin is licking his chops.</p><p>PERINO: He is.</p><p>PIRRO: Oh, yes. All right, Dana. To name a few of Biden's accomplishments, let's talk about the border, Afghanistan, the polarization, cost of living, energy dependence, and yet in his mind, he's batting 1,000.</p><p>PERINO: You forgot one other thing. My biggest pet peeve right now is the national education scores through K through 12 education.</p><p>PIRRO: Sure.</p><p>PERINO: Everything is down. And I'm not saying it's all late at his feet, but COVID was a huge problem. They refused to acknowledge it. And they continue to back the teachers unions on all of that. And they won't acknowledge the fact that this is a huge crisis. Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, when she was on \"NEWSROOM,\" she said these test scores in K through 12 education are a national humiliation.</p><p>So, one of the things I would say, do you think that you have a responsibility as president about the education of America's children? I'm just curious. Like, do you think that's just something that you should ignore? What about all these people we just talked about who are living on the street that just increases? We have an 11 percent homelessness increase year over year. And that's an undercount. We forgot we didn't talk about the baby formula issue, Afghanistan. I mean, there's plenty of things.</p><p>A lot of the things I would say, though, that he considers accomplishments. Like, he's passed more bills than Obama. OK, great. But a lot of his accomplishments are vulnerabilities. And one of them, he admitted this week. He wishes that he had called the Inflation Reduction Act something else because it was supposed -- it wasn't that. It was meant to deal with climate change, which we just talked about. But he has a 60 percent disapproval on climate change and he has a 36 percent approval on the economy. So, his accomplishments, as he sees them, are also vulnerabilities, if I can get that word out.</p><p>PIRRO: And you know, Charlie, I mean, when Dana talks about the education system, the mess that we're in right now, we are in an embarrassing situation, I mean, compared to many other countries. Now we've got the migrants' kids, the illegal aliens are bringing their kids in, and then these local school districts have to hire teachers who speak not just Spanish, but some people are from Africa, Pakistan, India. What do we do about that?</p><p>HURT: Well, so like what we were saying earlier, so much of it is just basic competence. I mean, these are real problems that are going to come about that people are going to have to deal with. And it's going to be an impossible problem, as we've seen, which is why -- which is why people like Mayor Adams are now shuttling migrants north.</p><p>But I also -- I love your generous -- generosity towards --</p><p>GUTFELD: Well, thank you.</p><p>HURT: -- yes, towards Biden talking about the history. And yes, maybe he was kind of talking about American history, but what's really funny about this is that maybe we did everything right before --</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>HURT: -- but now all of the problems -- and I came up with a long list of them, and you mentioned a lot of them, all of them happened under his watch. And whether --</p><p>GUTFELD: That's why he did the history thing.</p><p>HURT: Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD: He added that in the end. He goes, in history.</p><p>HURT: But it just goes on and on. And obviously, the unifying the country was like the really big one, because that is such a disaster. It turns out that calling half the country Nazis is probably not a really good way to do it. But it reminds me of -- do you remember the Simpsons episode where the county of Springfield declared Jimmy Carter history's monster? We have a new history, we have a new monster.</p><p>PIRRO: All right, Jessica, now Mayor Adams says the cost of paying for these migrants is going to exceed $12 billion.</p><p>TARLOV: Right.</p><p>PIRRO: You're a New York City taxpayer. How do you feel about that?</p><p>TARLOV: I think the federal government better pony up for this, and that it's on them at this point. I think that it's important for us to remain a sanctuary city. There's good reason to be sanctuary cities, and there are a lot of Republicans throughout history --</p><p>PIRRO: Didn't Mayor Adams -- didn't Mayor Adams say he doesn't want to be a sanctuary city anymore? He actually came out and said that.</p><p>TARLOV: No, he -- no, he said that he wants this dealt with. I don't think that he said --</p><p>PIRRO: He did. He came out and said he's sorry about the sanctuary --</p><p>HURT: So, you'll spend -- you're a build the wall -- spend money on the wall Democrat?</p><p>TARLOV: No, pony up and pay for the migrants that are here. The federal government --</p><p>GUTFELD: Which is -- which is an incentive.</p><p>PIRRO: And spend your federal taxes.</p><p>TARLOV: It's not their -- so the people who are here, they are registered in the system through the CBP One app.</p><p>HURT: Some of them.</p><p>TARLOV: No, well, it's pretty far to get -- the people who got on the buses, right, the Governor Abbott's buses, Ducey's buses, DeSantis's buses, whatever, those are all people that are registered in the system. That's how that works. You couldn't get on those buses without it.</p><p>PIRRO: That's right.</p><p>TARLOV: So, we know who they are. They have court dates.</p><p>GUTFELD: Seven years from now?</p><p>TARLOV: Some of them, yes. But we have a long history of having undocumented people here who are a tremendous boon, not only for our economy, but our society.</p><p>GUTFELD: We're not arguing that. That's always a straw man argument. We love immigrants. We just want a system that works that you can have both. Why not -- for example, if you're saying that the federal has to pony up, what you're saying is continue to provide the incentives that have people cross illegally.</p><p>TARLOV: No.</p><p>GUTFELD: What we're saying is we love -- by the way, we're not reproducing, we need help. We need people here. I mean, that's the hard truth. But the point is, you've got to do it through a process.</p><p>PIRRO: And you know what? Mayor Adams gave a no bid contract to an organization called DocGo, gave them $432 million that you're paying for to place all these illegals in counties of state, which is what they criticized the Republican governors for doing. And now they're doing the same thing. Are they now inhumane, racists, and all the other stuff.</p><p>TARLOV: I didn't use that kind of terminology. I said it was a stunt. And Mayor Adams does enjoy a stunt himself.</p><p>PIRRO: Is that a stunt?</p><p>TARLOV: He's a showman. And that's part of why people like him.</p><p>PIRRO: OK. Up next, California's slick governor is letting the hair gel screw with his brain again. Gavin Newsom blasting parents as brainwashed by the right.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HURT: So, California's Democrat Governor Gavin Newsom inserting himself in the middle of a national debate over parental rights. Newsom is bashing parents as his state -- in his state as being brainwashed by the right.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA): There is no state in America that supports local control and parental engagement like the State of California. No one comes close. It's written into our rules. That's parental engagement by definition. I don't know what it is they're certain. It's Orwellian, double-speak, or it's just so profoundly ignorant that they've been ginned up outside agitators, which I think perhaps is a combination of this.</p><p>And I'm deeply empathetic because I watch some of these poor parents, and they've been so misled by these organized groups.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HURT: Judge, how condescending is this? And is this effective in politics?</p><p>PIRRO: You know, I think he heard himself with that. You know, I mean, people are starting to have a good feeling about this guy. He is a real ideologue. You know, these parents are being brainwashed by these ideological groups, OK. Really, you think parents are dumb? You know, maybe they are. They voted for you. But that's a whole other issue.</p><p>I honestly think that, you know, this guy is using his powder against DeSantis. He ought to be using it against Youngkin because I see Youngkin on the same plane and fighting with him on this issue. The bottom line is they are crafting legislation to prevent parents from finding out if a child wants to change a gender identity. And you know what? That is just none of the school's business. And he's not going to win on that.</p><p>HURT: Jess, do you think it's effective?</p><p>TARLOV: Yes, I do think it's effective. I think that he was striking a balance between -- he was talking about extremist parents and extremist groups. Like, we've just got a step before. I'm not calling them terrorists, but over half of the book bands or the removal of certain pieces of literature from libraries was because of petitions for members of the Moms for Liberty group. That's just a fact.</p><p>GUTFELD: Which ones?</p><p>TARLOV: We have to do this again?</p><p>GUTFELD: We only have a minute left. Why do we have to do this?</p><p>TARLOV: To irritate you.</p><p>GUTFELD: I want to know the book. I want to know every one of them.</p><p>TARLOV: It doesn't --</p><p>GUTFELD: It doesn't matter.</p><p>TARLOV: No.</p><p>GUTFELD: OK, forget it then. Don't bring it up.</p><p>TARLOV: No, every one of them. Fine, let's talk about Judy Blume again. Let's talk about --</p><p>PIRRO: They have pornographic imagery in those books.</p><p>TARLOV: Not all of them.</p><p>GUTFELD: Judy Blume wasn't banned.</p><p>TARLOV: Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD: She was moved. You moved books isn't banding.</p><p>TARLOV: But that -- but parents -- 51 percent of Republican parents, in fact, are against that. 51 percent of Republican.</p><p>HURT: But they also, they were books that --</p><p>PIRRO: What's the question?</p><p>HURT: Parents went to the school board and tried to read --</p><p>TARLOV: Get Dana in. parents from an organization --</p><p>HURT: -- and the school board wouldn't let it in. But Dana, you know, big picture. You know, Glenn Youngkin went into Virginia, a Democrat state now, and completely eight Democrats lunch on the most Democrat issue there is combating exactly --</p><p>PERINO: Do you know who should be most mad about this, is Joe Biden. Because Gavin Newsom is so obviously running for president. He's trying to rebrand himself as a Governor Youngkin or a Ron DeSantis or a Sarah Huckabee Sanders because he's saying, oh, they have an 80 percent approval rating when it comes to parents. That's what he's trying to do.</p><p>HURT: You don't have kids, but I mean, if you're a kids --</p><p>GUTFELD: How do you know that?</p><p>HURT: Well, whatever.</p><p>GUTFELD: Well, don't jump to conclusions.</p><p>But if your kids are sitting there talking about -- worrying about their pronouns, does that maybe mean they're not learning something in school?</p><p>GUTFELD: You know what? Telling parents how to feel is different than listening to them. He's just telling them how they should feel. And he should also admit that he would never let a teacher and activist get between him and his kids. That's -- is that extreme? That's the simplest thing he should answer. But I bet he can't because he's terrified of the activists. And he is running for president.</p><p>HURT: True. OK, up next, divorce me baby one more time. I can't believe I just said that.</p><p>TARLOV: I can't either.</p><p>HURT: Some major drama as Brit Brit and her hubby head for Splitsville.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TARLOV: Britney Spears and husband Sam Asghari are reportedly getting divorced after only one year. Sam filing the paperwork after rumors that Spears was cheating on him. And things could get ugly. Page Six claims that Sam is \"threatening to release extraordinarily embarrassing Britney Spears info if their prenup is not renegotiated.\" But Spears is still living her life. She posted that she's buying a horse.</p><p>We have like no time as opposed to only say your names. Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes. OK, so I blame the media who pushed this free Britneycrap when clearly she still have very, very serious mental issues. Don't get your opinions from Cody Rigsby, Dana. I've said that many times. Britney fans, just because you're a Britney fan, doesn't mean you know what her mental state really is.</p><p>TARLOV: Dana?</p><p>PERINO: I would say she used a lot of emojis in that text. A lot. That's all I got.</p><p>TARLOV: OK.</p><p>HURT: I have virtually no opinion whatsoever about any of this, except I was shocked to learn that she is worth about $60 million.</p><p>GUTFELD: You think it'd be more?</p><p>TARLOV: Well, that's --</p><p>HURT: Oh, my God.</p><p>PIRRO: Yes.</p><p>TARLOV: That's part of the problem with the conservatorship, that they mismanaged her.</p><p>HURT: You would think that she was --</p><p>PIRRO: That's why they broke the conservatorship because of the father. You want to know what I think?</p><p>TARLOV: I do. Judge.</p><p>PIRRO: I think just saying -- thank you. I think he's saying that he's going to expose embarrassing stuff if she doesn't renegotiate the prenup. I looked under the California law, and it could be, and I'm not saying that it is, but it is against the law to expose a secret affecting him, her, or them. It might constitute extortion.</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, there we go.</p><p>TARLOV: Yes. That would be exciting.</p><p>PERINO: Good point.</p><p>GUTFELD: We have a new song title, Extortion.</p><p>HURT: Wow.</p><p>PERINO: Boom, boom.</p><p>TARLOV: OK. \"ONE MORE THING\" is up next.</p><p>GUTFELD: Extortion.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GUTFELD: \"ONE MORE THING.\" All right, tonight, what a show. Oh, my goodness. We got Todd Piro. You don't know him because you're not up that early. Batya Ungar-Sargon, Kat Timpf, Tyrus. This is going to be a great show. Hey, let's do this. Greg's Trip To The Zoo. I love going to the zoo. But don't make the mistake I did and drink a 12-pack of beer before going to see the elephants.</p><p>PERINO: That's disgusting. You're horrible. Oh, my God.</p><p>GUTFELD: Actually, that's just a baby elephant --</p><p>TARLOV: I just figure it out.</p><p>PERINO: You are incredible.</p><p>GUTFELD: -- drinking some water. I couldn't resist the joke. Dana?</p><p>PERINO: All right, I have Short Questions this week is with Brian Kilmeade, and Greg can't wait to read all of that for sure.</p><p>Also, there was a pair of Colorado travelers that experience a love-it- first flight. They were seated next to each other on a trip to London back in April of 2022. Sasha says she felt like that's going to be her husband just an hour into the flight. And the couple actually ran into each other while in Scottland. And now, guess what? Eight months later, they are engaged and they are said to get married this weekend.</p><p>I tell you this because it happened before --</p><p>PIRRO: You.</p><p>PERINO: -- 26 years ago today, I met Peter on the airplane.</p><p>GUTFELD: There you go.</p><p>PERINO: Happy anniversary.</p><p>GUTFELD: Not something to joke about.</p><p>TARLOV: Happy meeting you.</p><p>PIRRO: Great picture.</p><p>PERINO: And now we have Erin as our child. It's what it looks like. Erin is not our child. She's just a friend.</p><p>GUTFELD: Are we sure? Judge?</p><p>PIRRO: OK, so a golden retriever was caught red-pawed hopping over the backyard fence to take a quick dip into his neighbor's pool. The owner said he had gotten into the neighbor's pool previously the same week, but they didn't know how, so they set up a camera. And they said he doesn't have to hide. He's welcome to come by any time and swim. It doesn't have to be a sneak.</p><p>PERINO: It's so cute.</p><p>PIRRO: Pretty smart.</p><p>GUTFELD: There you go.</p><p>PERINO: I love it.</p><p>PIRRO: Jumping over the fence to get in the pool.</p><p>GUTFELD: Amazing animals, Jessica.</p><p>TARLOV: Indeed. So, superstar Ed Sheeran spotted putting in a shift at the Lego Store at the Mall of America ahead of his Minneapolis show. The red- headed artist took his new job very seriously, signing all the Lego boxes, handing out gifts and concert tickets. And at the end of his shift, pulled out the guitar and performed an acoustic version of his hit song, Lego House.</p><p>PERINO: You go, boy.</p><p>PIRRO: That's nice.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>TARLOV: Yes, it is nice.</p><p>GUTFELD: It's good to see the homeless doing good. Do you have anything? You got 10 seconds.</p><p>HURT: Yes, so -- yes, so shoppers in Iowa were surprised when they looked into a Target shopping cart.</p><p>PIRRO: Oh.</p><p>TARLOV: What an (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>HURT: They found a Colombian red boa, somebody's therapy snake.</p><p>PIRRO: Where was this? What state?</p><p>GUTFELD: Ed Sheeran's state.</p><p>HURT: In Iowa.</p><p>GUTFELD: All right, have a great night.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2023081701cb258</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68YT-0Y51-F072-X0GY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7074\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 17, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS516120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Americans</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Opioids</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>COVID</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Fentanyl</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Philly</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Maui</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Hawaii</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Wildfire</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Climate Change</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Sirens</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Gump's</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>San Francisco</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Zombie</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Inflation Reduction Act</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>John Podesta</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Green Energy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Democrats</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Republicans</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Joe Biden</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Border</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Sanctuary City</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>New York City</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Eric Adams</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Kathy Hochul</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Migrants</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Gavin Newsom</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Right</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Schools</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Books</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Britney Spears</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DS66</classCode><className>OPIATES &amp;

In countries with low vaccination coverage, the situation is particularly bad.</p><p>The WHO chief said the world is experiencing a worsening public health emergency that further threatens lives, livelihoods and the world economy. He said it is worse in places with few vaccines, but the pandemic is not over anywhere. The global vaccine inequity is making it worse, he said.</p><p>Tedros compared the current global strategy for fighting the pandemic to fighting a forest fire.</p><p>\"Hosing down part of it might reduce the flames in one area, but while it's smoldering anywhere, sparks will eventually travel and grow again into a roaring furnace. The world should battle together to put out this pandemic inferno everywhere. \"</p><p>Mike Ryan, WHO health emergencies program executive director, also said events in regions with a certain level of vaccination such as the just-concluded 2020 soccer tournament that featured soccer stadiums at least partially full of fans make it more difficult for nations that need to implement COVID-19 restrictions they need.</p><p>\"It's more difficult for governments in those situations, in those countries, to continue to implement public health and social measures because their populations are looking at this and saying, 'Hey, it's all over in Europe. I mean, maybe it's all over here.'\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Tedros chastised wealthy nations with high vaccination rates and vaccine producers Pfizer and Moderna for considering booster shots while other countries lack the supplies to vaccinate their health workers and the most vulnerable.</p><p>\"Currently, data shows us that vaccination offers long-lasting immunity against severe and deadly COVID-19. The priority now must be to vaccinate those who have received no doses and protection,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124576421</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:634F-85K1-JCBF-S4JC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"472\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 12, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Currently, the fire is a low intensity surface fire, burning primarily in the dead-and-down fuels. Carson National Forest fire managers are taking advantage of ideal conditions to manage the fire for resource benefit and resiliency in a high-priority watershed. The Poso fire poses no immediate danger to any property or infrastructure.</p><p>Name: Poso</p><p>Date detected: May 29, 2021</p><p>Cause: Lightning</p><p>Location: Carson NF, El Rito Ranger District, adjacent to FR123</p><p>Size: 7 acres</p><p>Growth Potential: Low to moderate</p><p>Vegetation: Ponderosa pine and mixed conifer</p><p>Resources: 1 Type-4 Incident Command Team, 1 road grader, 2 Type-6 engines, local fire personnel.</p><p>In Route: 1 Type-2 bulldozer, 1 Type-1 masticator, and 1 wildland fire module.</p><p>Gradual fire growth can be expected as the fire creeps naturally, but residents and travelers can expect the volume of smoke to increase over the next few weeks as firefighters enter the area and increase burning activity in order to mimic natural fire conditions. Pre-determined management areas have been and will continue to be identified as the fire continues to burn, so that it can be kept within established boundaries. Previous treatments in the area may assist managers by providing a good area to limit the fire's spread. Additional management actions, including burning (both ground and aerial ignitions) in the next several days, will be further determined by fire activity, weather, and the progression of the fire.</p><p>The Carson National Forest is committed to using lightning-caused fires when conditions allow to achieve many resource objectives. Fire mangers use a strategy which incorporates different tactics to accomplish desired results. These tactics help reduce firefighter exposure while increasing the probability of meeting predetermined desired effects in relationship to values at risk. This assists the Forest in meeting the land management objective of returning natural fire back into this fire-adapted ecosystem.</p><p>Due to the location and elevation of the fires, smoke may be visible from surrounding communities including Vallecitos, Canon Plaza, Petaca, Las Tablas, Servilleta Plaza, El Rito, Ojo Caliente, Tres Piedras, and La Madera, New Mexico. Smoke-sensitive individuals and people with heart or respiratory problems are encouraged to take precautionary measures.

The national wildfire preparedness level is at 5 (PL5), the highest level of wildland fire activity with several large, complex wildland fires and at least 80% of the country's firefighting resources committed to wildland fire incidents. New Mexico and Arizona are currently at PL2, experiencing high to extreme fire danger but able to manage fire activity with resources on hand.</p><p>A final decision on whether to proceed with a specific prescribed burn on the SFNF will depend on multiple conditions, including the national wildland fire preparedness level and resource availability, fuel moisture levels, air quality and forecasted weather. Prescribed burns are designed to meet specific objectives and are always managed with firefighter and public safety as the first priority.</p><p>Carson National Forest fire managers have prioritized their prescribed fire projects by district. All of the following projects have been cleared under the National Environmental Policy Act.</p><p>East Zone - Carson National Forest:</p><p>* La Jara Rx, 1,301-acre broadcast burn near Angel Fire, New Mexico</p><p>* Apache Rx, 501-acre acre broadcast burn near Angel Fire, New Mexico</p><p>* Valle Vidal Hart Canyon Rx, 6,529-acre broadcast burn approximately 19 miles northwest of Cimarron, New Mexico and 16 miles northeast of Ute Park, New Mexico.</p><p>* KSC Jackpot Rx, 120-acre jackpot burn near San Cristobal, New Mexico</p><p>* Taos Ski Valley Piles Rx, 150-acre pile burn near Taos Ski Valley, New Mexico</p><p>West Zone - Carson National Forest:</p><p>* Canjilon Lakes Piles, 186-acre pile burn at Canjilon Lakes Campground</p><p>* Tio Gordito Piles, 152-acre pile burn near Tres Piedras, New Mexico</p><p>* Willow Piles, 250-acre pile burn near Tres Piedras, New Mexico</p><p>* Ensenada, 1,243-acre broadcast burn near El Rito, New Mexico</p><p>* Tio Gordito 7&amp;8, 3,319-acre broadcast burn near Tres Piedras, New Mexico</p><p>The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) reports that this year to date, the U.S. has had 44,461 wildfires that have burned a total of 5,567,600 acres. Today, NIFC reports 81 active large fires with 21,862 personnel assigned. As fire seasons become more severe, the need for and efficacy of fuels treatments becomes clearer.</p><p>The Forest Service's land management strategy is centered on long-term forest health, which includes reducing forest fuels and using prescribed fire on the landscape. A healthy forest is a resilient forest that undergoes fire occurrences on a regular basis. The Carson National Forest works with partners, collaborators, and communities to clearly identify objectives and address concerns during the planning process for prescribed fires.</p><p>The Forest manages prescribed fires in compliance with New Mexico state regulations on air quality and smoke management. Smoke-sensitive individuals and people with respiratory problems or heart disease are encouraged to take precautionary measures. Information on air quality and protecting your health can be found online at the New Mexico Department of Health Environmental Public Health Tracking website.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7599333 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7599333</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63KY-2N01-JC11-138S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"616\"/><timeReceived>8:20 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 14, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas, ranking Republican member of the House Natural Resources Committee, issued the following news release on Nov. 9, 2021:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service finalized a rule to implement an expansive critical habitat designation for the northern spotted owl.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"In another tone-deaf move, the Biden administration is backing an anti-science proposal that will hinder the recovery of the species, stifle job creation and lead to more catastrophic wildfires. The Fish and Wildlife Service has already proven that declining spotted owl populations are a result of barred owl competition and the loss of habitat due to wildfires. This administration's hypocrisy extends so far as to suggest active forest management as a part of their recovery plan while they simultaneously make it increasingly difficult for land managers to implement forest thinning and other critical fire mitigation activities. I urge the Fish and Wildlife Service to reconsider their decision.\" - House Committee on Natural Resources Ranking Member Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.)</p><p>\"The Trump Administration worked with conservation partners throughout the Pacific Northwest to ensure the northern spotted owl's designated critical habitat was exactly that: critical to the species' restoration. This action by the Biden Administration once again disregards the species conservation efforts led by states and local communities and the congressional intent of the Endangered Species Act. By taking the reins away from states, local governments, and private conservation partners, the federal government is crippling the recovery of the northern spotted owl and threatening the economic well-being of rural communities in Oregon and throughout the region.\" - Congressional Western Caucus Chairman Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.)</p><p>\"I am extremely disappointed with the Biden Administration's decision to override the scientifically backed, commonsense Northern Spotted Owl Critical Habitat definition established by the Trump Administration. I am currently traveling across Southern Oregon - a region that will be hit hard by this misguided, and likely disastrous, change in federal policy. This is exactly the type of bureaucratic ignorance that will put communities like Grants Pass, Medford, and others in even greater danger of forest fire. Federal policies that lock up our forests, combined with bureaucratic red tape and decades of poor forest management have led to millions of acres of forest burning across the American West. Now, the Biden Administration is doubling down on a disastrous recipe of overstocked forests and hot, fast-moving fires that will sterilize the soil, prevent reforestation, and choke off communities and the economies that sustain them.\" - U.S. Rep. Cliff Bentz (R-Ore.)</p><p>* * *</p><p>Background</p><p>In January 2021, the Trump administration finalized a rule to right-size the critical habitat for the northern spotted owl by reducing it by 3.4 million acres. This rule was in response to the Weyerhaeuser v. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Supreme Court decision which clarified that to qualify as critical habitat, it must first actually be a habitat of the species. The Trump administration's rule complied with the Weyerhaeuser decision by significantly reducing the amount of non-habitat that was initially designated as critical habitat. The Trump administration rule was also consistent with the Northwest Forest Plan that promises a stable supply of timber from those federal lands identified as suitable for timber harvest.</p><p>The Holiday Farm, Beachie and Lionshead fires in 2020 alone caused the loss of 45,220 acres of suitable northern spotted owl habitat on the Willamette National Forest. In comparison, the Northwest Forest Plan 20-year monitoring report indicated that 5,805 acres of suitable northern spotted owl habitat was lost annually across the entire range of the species due to timber harvest on federally managed lands. Over-expansive critical habitat designations are not helping the northern spotted owl.

But he could not offer a date when the two countries would arrange an Oval Office sit-down between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelenskiy.</p><p>Ukrainian officials have desperately sought such a meeting with Mr. Trump since Mr. Zelenskiy, a former comedian with no political experience, won the presidency in spring 2019.</p><p>Taliban carries out record high attacks</p><p>The Taliban and other groups carried out a record number of attacks in Afghanistan during the last several months of 2019, according to an inspector general report released Friday. The increase in violence occurred during a period in which President Donald Trump tweeted that the U.S. was \"hitting our Enemy harder than at any time in the last ten years!\"</p><p>The number of attacks - detailed in the quarterly report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, a government watchdog formed in 2008 - highlights once more the disparity between talking points on suppressing the Taliban and the reality on the ground: Despite a concerted bombing campaign and U.S. and Afghan offensive-ground operations, Taliban fighters are still able to attack at levels similar to those a decade ago.</p><p>The Taliban and other armed groups carried out 8,204 attacks in the final quarter of the year, 37% of which inflicted casualties, according to the report.</p><p>U.S. and Taliban negotiators restarted peace talks in December and are once more close to agreeing on a deal, U.S. officials say, although the negotiations have been bogged down as the two sides wrestle over how to reduce violence in order to move the peace process forward.</p><p>Aussie capital under threat from forest fire</p><p>The Australian capital region declared a state of emergency on Friday because of an out-of-control forest fire burning erratically to its south.</p><p>It's the first fire emergency for the Australian Capital Territory area since 2003, when wildfires killed four people and destroyed almost 500 homes in a single day.</p><p>The threat is posed by a blaze on Canberra's southern fringe that has razed more than 53,000 acres since it was sparked by heat from a military helicopter landing light Monday, the Emergency Services Agency said.</p><p>\"The state of emergency sets a clear expectation for our community that we need you to be vigilant,\" Emergency Services Minister Mick Gentleman said. \"This is the worst bushfire season in the ACT since 2003.\"</p><p>Unprecedented fires across southern Australia have claimed at least 33 lives since September, destroyed more than 3,000 homes and razed more than 26.2 million acres.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PSTGAZ-20020225856099</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PSTGAZ2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y44-8DB1-DYRS-T0N5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144577</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"556\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 P.G.

The authors, who include investigator and senior author Rochelle Walensky, MD, MPH, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), demonstrate that far more investment is needed in ensuring that approved COVID-19 vaccines can be produced and distributed efficiently, and that more must be done to promote the public's trust in immunization and willingness to continue practices that slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.</p><p>Billions of dollars have been spent on developing COVID-19 vaccines, and preliminary evidence suggests that several candidates appear to be extraordinarily effective. \"But there are lots of ways to think about the effectiveness of a vaccine,\" says Walensky. She teamed up with A. David Paltiel, PhD, a professor of Public Health (Health Policy) at the Yale School of Public Health (YSPH), and several other colleagues to create a mathematical model that assessed how other factors beyond a COVID-19 vaccine's efficacy might influence how well it thwarts the disease. Those factors included:</p><p>- How fast and broadly can the vaccine be produced and administered? Some candidate vaccines pose logistical challenges, such as needing to be stored in ultra-cold freezers or requiring two doses, spaced weeks apart.</p><p>- What portion of the population is willing to be vaccinated? National surveys suggest that as few as 50% of Americans say they will receive a COVID-19 vaccine.</p><p>- The severity of the pandemic when a vaccine is rolled out. The proportion of infections a vaccine is able to avert is directly related to the public's willingness to engage in mitigation behaviors, such as wearing masks and social distancing.</p><p>The mathematical model considered how these factors would influence the impact of vaccines of varying levels of efficacy. \"We found that infrastructure will contribute at least as much to the success of the vaccination program as will the vaccine itself,\" says Paltiel. \"The population benefits of vaccination will decline rapidly in the face of manufacturing or deployment delays, significant vaccine hesitancy, or greater epidemic severity.\"</p><p>To help ensure a vaccination program's success, Walensky says that significantly greater investment is needed in an infrastructure to deliver COVID-19 vaccines. Moreover, powerful public messages and on-the-ground implementation strategies at the local level are also necessary to help overcome skepticism about vaccines, especially in underserved populations.</p><p>Likewise, the Health Affairs study showed that even a highly effective vaccine will struggle to control COVID-19 if infection rates continue to rise. \"If I have a cup of water, I can put out a stove fire. But I can't put out a forest fire, even if that water is 100% potent,\" says Walensky, emphasizing the public's role in keeping the infection rate low by mask wearing and social distancing. \"We'll get out of this faster if you give the vaccine less work to do.\"</p><p>Walensky is also co-director of the Medical Practice Evaluation Center at MGH and a professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS). Paltiel is also professor of Management, professor in the Institution for Social and Policy Studies, and co-director of the Public Health Modeling Concentration at Yale. Coauthors of the study were Jason L.

Some things the rest of the world does not need to know. Please find some shred of decency and buy the owners a new table now,\" one Instagram account wrote. <br/> Another would note, 'They know they can just text each other with this stuff, right?' <br/>One user ultimately pointed out that Kelly's 12-year-old daughter has her own Instagram page, which gives her access to details of her dad's wild sex life, according to News.com .au[2].;; <br/>Fox and Kelly, however, are no strangers to oversharing about their steamy relationship and had been spotted several times displaying their affection towards each other way too publicly. <br/>In June, Kelly filmed himself caressing his partner's boob at the iHeartRadio Awards while sharing the content for his Instagram. <br/>'Goddamn, my love, you look so good,' he said to Fox, who would laugh and instruct Kelly to instead cop a feel from 'underneath.' <br/>The couple began dating in May 2020 following Megan's divorce with Brian Austin Green, Yahoo! Entertainment[3] noted. <br/>\"Loving [MGK] is like being in love with a tsunami or a forest fire,\" Fox said in November. \"The intensity of merging with him is just overwhelming, and the threat it poses is so powerful but so beautiful that you have no choice but to surrender with reverence and with gratitude.\" <br/>Fox initially filed for divorce with Green in 2015 but decided to give it another shot after becoming pregnant with their third child, Journey. <br/> Fox and Kelly are no strangers to oversharing about their steamy relationship.

Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, affecting about three million people in the United States. Medication can often control epileptic seizures, which can lead to serious falls and other injuries, but about one-third of people with epilepsy do not respond to the drugs. Those patients often seek relief with resection, a surgical procedure that removes the part of the brain where seizures begin to form. </p><p>It's a radical\u2014and century-old\u2014procedure, but it works. Resection can greatly reduce the number of seizures a person experiences, and in some cases it can eliminate seizures completely. But the surgery is most successful when a surgeon can first pinpoint the exact spot in the brain where seizures begin, a challenging feat that has not yet been perfected in the clinic. New research from Boston University neuroscientists and statisticians could someday improve the success of resections and, therefore, the quality of life for people with epilepsy[1]. 'One way to think about a seizure is like a forest fire,' says Mark Kramer, professor of mathematical neuroscience and the associate director of Boston University's Center for Systems Neuroscience. 'If you can catch a forest fire before it spreads, you have a better chance of putting it out.' He says that there is one hitch with the forest fire analogy: unlike fires, which burn on Earth's surface, seizures evolve within the extraordinarily complicated and three-dimensional network of the brain's cells and tissues\u2014the slightest nuances of change within that network can lead to sudden explosions or reductions in seizure spread. That's why, 14 years ago, Kramer reached out to Eric Kolaczyk, an authority on the statistical analysis of networks, for help. Kramer hoped that Kolaczyk's expertise could help them understand, in both space and time, the seizure process as it exploded across the brain's network of tissue. 'In the brain, different areas activate in healthy ways all the time,' says Kramer, who has also partnered with clinicians Catherine Chu and Sydney Cash at Massachusetts General Hospital. 'When a seizure occurs, many brain areas link together very quickly. We wanted to understand that process.'Brain networks in actionTo plan for resection, a clinical team first opens a patient's skull and places a grid with up to 80 electrodes directly on the brain's surface. But instead of considering the brain activity each electrode detects as a separate data point, 'one way of approaching this is to create a network representation that tells youit's really 80 different parts of the brain working together,' says Kolaczyk, director of BU's Rafik B. Hariri Institute for Computing and Computational Science &amp;#38; Engineering. Being able to represent the brain's collective behavior is a big step forward, but clinicians have still been left with the challenge of correctly interpreting that network representation as an evolving biological system. 'With epilepsy,' Kolaczyk says, 'it's especially important to understand how the network evolves over time.' For that interpretation, Kolaczyk and Kramer worked with Louis-Emmanuel Martinet, a postdoctoral fellow at Boston University studying spatial memory, and graduate students Weston Viles, Elizabeth Spencer, and Nathan Perkins. Together, the team came up with a new way to analyze the brain activity data gathered by the electrodes. They developed an algorithm that finds patterns of connectivity in these brain networks that can be traced as they evolve through time before[2], during, and after a seizure. The new approach appears in a paper in Nature Communications[3]. 'We came up with a methodology that helped us extract what we call 'dynamic communities' from these data,' says Kolaczyk. 'This in turn allows us to visualize and analyze how these networks change over time. Epilepsy has traditionally been thought of as an event where the brain locks up and all the regions are working together. We found that there is a more nuanced process.' That's important, says Kolaczyk, because it suggests a greater level of complexity in the mechanisms underlying epilepsy than previously thought. And a far more difficult task for researchers trying to pinpoint its exact origin in the brain. 'It's like trying to map a complex system of tunnels which narrow and widen, join and split, and so on,' says Kolaczyk. 'At the same time, the lighting is poor, so the visual input that you're using to map is imperfect. And lastly, the tunnels are just really long and really complex, so that simple preconceptions of how tunnel systems might look are likely to lead you astray.''Maps' of epilepsy in the brainUsing their algorithmic approach, Kolaczyk and his team essentially mimic the act of walking through tunnels to produce maps, doing so in a way that is statistically robust and computationally efficient. 'Given that some error is inevitable in our construction of networks from the original brain time series, and that we can be dealing with sequences of as many as 80,000 networks over a 24-hour period in one patient, it's important to get both the statistical and the computational elements right,' says Kolaczyk. 'Getting it right means that the resulting 'maps' have far greater clarity than current standard approaches.' The new methodology enabled the computational neuroscientists on the team\u2014Martinet, Spencer, Perkins, and Kramer\u2014to get a more accurate read of noisy data from a patient's brain activity. The combined team of statistical, computational, and clinical researchers can then interpret the results. The research, which had support from the National Institutes of Health, has the potential to do two things: 'One is to hypothesize about how the epileptic seizure is generated and progresses,' says Kolaczyk. 'The other is to take the metrics that we extract from the data and compare them against therapeutic interventions and outcomes that represent our current best medical efforts, and see in what ways they are suggestive.' The current results, for example, suggest that patients with fewer, shorter-lasting dynamic communities during seizure (for example, fewer tunnels of shorter length) have improved surgical outcomes. The researchers believe that if they can track the seizure back to the point where it ignites, it may be possible to extinguish the seizure before it ever has the opportunity to spread. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke supported the work.

I'm Christine Romans.</p><p>[05:00:01]</p><p>Good morning.</p><p>Dawn is about to break on the second day of smoke from Canadian wildfires shrouding the Eastern U.S., from the eastern Great Lakes down to the Carolinas. This is a look at New York's skylines, 75 million Americans under air quality alerts this morning. That's almost a quarter of the U.S. population. Many schools across the region have suspended outdoor activities.</p><p>Air travel was disrupted by low visibility, yesterday. And the same could happen today and some hospital emergency rooms reported an uptake in respiratory symptoms.</p><p>And just when you could put your COVID mask away, officials are inviting you to put them back on to protect you from the smoke. Meteorologist Derek Van Dam joins us from the CNN weather center.</p><p>And, Derek, yesterday, my middle schooler, the doors were open at school, the smoke came in, the fire alarms went off. That's how bad the smoke was yesterday.</p><p>How will it be today?</p><p>That is -- that is incredible. You know, you've heard the term -- you wait a couple of minutes, the weather changes -- well, this is literally a 15-minute time lapse. And you could just see the smoke that inundated New York City. The skyscrapers here just becoming a Martian landscape.</p><p>Everybody saw it. Social media was lighting up. It was incredible to see. But it was also very dangerous. And, we've got yet another day of the smoke and haze across many of the major population areas of the east coast.</p><p>Now, in New York, we still have haze and smoke present, but it's not nearly as bad as what it was last night. Now, I'll show you that in just a moment. The majority of the thickest smoke has actually drifted a little further south. So, Washington, Philadelphia, Baltimore, those areas are going to wake up to almost choking like air, and hazardous air as the smoke continues to settle in.</p><p>That stretches across much of the Ohio River Valley, towards the Great Lakes as well. And, at one point on Wednesday evening, we had hazardous air quality index alerts for Philadelphia, New York City, even Trenton, New Jersey. See that purple coloring? That is the air quality index.</p><p>And, we talk about it so much and, of course, you start getting into those 300 and 400 range, it becomes extremely unhealthy to breathe that type of particular matter. Now, when will we get some relief? Everybody's been asking us. We've just got such a snag and weather pattern because of the upper letter pattern that we've seen. Now, we still have at least another 44 to 48 hours up the smoke.</p><p>And, of course, that will start to add flow because these wildfires in Quebec are not going to be extinguished anytime soon. It's a gargantuan effort by firefighters there -- Christine.</p><p>ROMANS: Just amazing. We'll be ready for today. Thank you.</p><p>VAN DAM: Okay.</p><p>ROMANS: Millions of Americans have been surprised by the heavy smoke, suddenly blanketing their cities, and in many cases, they're altering their plans. But they're figuring out how to cope here.</p><p>CNN's Athena Jones has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ATHENA JONES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): From New York -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I've never experienced anything like this before. Never to this degree.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It did shock me how quickly it came in last night.</p><p>JONES: To Cleveland, Ohio, and even as far south as Raleigh, North Carolina -- unhealthy air, blanketing a large swath of the United States from over 400 active wildfires burning in Canada, more than half of them determined to be out of control, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center.</p><p>JUSTIN TRUDEAU, PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA: Last year and this year, the worst wildfire season that we've ever had right across the country.</p><p>JONES: Canada's wildfire season got off to an unusually early and intense start in May, picking up aggressively this month, largely in Quebec. More than 9 million acres have burned in Canada so far this year, 15 times the normal amount. Smoke from those fires shelving within 500 miles to blanket New York City.</p><p>MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D), NEW YORK CITY: From that gloom over Yankee Stadium to the smoky haze scarring our skyline. We can see it, we can smell it and we felt it. And it was alarming and concerning.</p><p>JONES: The air quality index reaching levels that could be harmful for everyone. New Yorkers being urged to stay indoors as much as possible, or wear a high quality mask.</p><p>ADAMS: This is not the day to train for a marathon or to do an outside event with your children. Stay inside closed windows and doors. Use air purifiers if you have them.</p><p>JONES: Wildfire smoke contains particulate matter or PM2.5, among the tiniest and most dangerous pollutants. It's able to infiltrate the lungs and enter the bloodstream and has been linked to conditions like asthma and heart disease.</p><p>public School districts in central New York, not far from the fires in Quebec, among the first to cancel all outdoor activities. Public schools in New York City and Montgomery County, Maryland, doing the same.</p><p>Officials warning the smoke will continue to impact much of the East Coast until at least the weekend.</p><p>ZACHARY ISCOL, COMMISSIONER OF THE NYC EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT: We expect this to be a multiple day event. So, we expect that advisory to remain in place for the next few days.</p><p>JONES: Athena Jones, CNN, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS: All right. New signs this morning that a grand jury indictment against Donald Trump is a strong possibility and could come at any time now.</p><p>CNN's Paula Reid has the latest from Washington.</p><p>[05:05:07]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Former President Donald Trump has been informed that he is the target of a federal investigation into possible mishandling of classified documents. This is a sign that prosecutors could be moving closer to indicting Trump, that he was informed about this through what is called a target letter that his lawyers received. Multiple sources have had that letter described them, but not of our sources have personally seen this target letter.</p><p>Now, most the time when you receive a target letter, it means that you can, if you would like, appear before a grand jury, though it's unclear if the former president would avail himself of that option.</p><p>We know the former president's lawyers met with the Justice Department earlier this week, and he has repeatedly insisted that he has done nothing wrong. The fact that he has been informed that he is a target of this investigation, it's clear that the prosecutors are looking not just at the people around him, but they are specifically looking at the former president.</p><p>Now, in the other special counsel investigation into the events surrounding January 6th, we have learned that longtime Trump ally and former White House advisor Steve Bannon has been subpoenaed to testify in that probe. Though it's unclear how cooperative he'll be as a witness. He's currently facing prison time for being held in contempt of Congress.</p><p>Now, for a more cooperative witness, we've also learned that Alyssa Farah Griffin has been talking to investigators. She sat for a voluntary interview where she was questioned at length. We have learned from former President Trump's state of mind, the extent to which he truly believed the lies he was pushing in around January 6th.</p><p>It is a sign that investigators are still focused on Trump's mindset in and around January 6th. It also shows that the January 6th investigation is likely not quite as far along as the other special counsel investigation into the possible mishandling of classified documents.</p><p>Paula Reid, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS: Republican presidential candidate Mike Pence says he hopes the Justice Department does not obtain an indictment of Donald Trump. The former VP announced his run for the White House Wednesday, ahead of a CNN town hall.</p><p>He told CNN's Dana Bash that he believes an indictment would be, in his, words terribly divisive for the country.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PENCE: I think it would also send a terrible message to the wider world. And we're the emblem of democracy, we're the symbol of justice in the world, and a serious matter, which is already happened once. New York from indicting a former president of the United States sends a terrible message to the world, I hope that the DOJ thinks better of it and resolve these issues with an indictment.</p><p>DANA BASH, CNN MODEROTOR: Sir, I just want to clarify. What you're saying is, that you think if they believe he committed to, crime they should not go forward with an indictment? You just talked before about committing to the rule of law.</p><p>PENCE: Let me be clear. No one is above the law. But I would just hope that there would be a way for them to move forward without the dramatic and drastic and divisive step of indicting a former president of the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Pence was also asked about another burning issue among conservatives, transgender young people, and the growing number of red state bans on gender affirming medical care for minors.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BASH: What would you say to a transgender kid? And their family who say that this is how I feel more comfortable? I don't feel comfortable in another way. And they feel that you are targeting them.</p><p>PENCE: I would tell them that I love everybody. I put my arm around, and their parents. But before they had a chemical procedure, I would say wait. Just wait. I mean there's some, people maybe there's an exception, but most people, before your 18 -- there's a reason we have that cut off, for all kinds of categories in our society.</p><p>You just don't really know what you want in life. You don't know who you really are. It takes time to become an adult, and figure that out. And I just -- I put my arm around, them I tell them I love them and I just wait. Just wait. And that's how we put the interest of our kids first.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Pence was asked by a number of the audience who also happens to be on the AARP Executive Council, what he would do as president to protect Social Security for older Americans and future generations?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PENCE: A lot of people, say it is not political to do. It but, for me, I think we've got a moral obligation to ensure the long term solvency of Social Security and Medicare. And, that means saying to Americans, over the age of 40, we are going to keep the system that we have. But, for Americans under the age of 40, we've got to work on the kind of reforms that will lessen the burden of debt, and change these New Deal programs into a better deal for younger Americans.</p><p>[05:10:03]</p><p>And we can do it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: He floated two possible ideas for Social Security reform, raising the eligibility age and, allowing younger Americans to invest part of the payroll taxes in mutual funds.</p><p>All right. The prime suspect in Natalee Holloway's mysterious disappearance, about to be extradited to the U.S.</p><p>Plus, Pope Francis just hours after going under the knife. How's he doing right now?</p><p>And, next, the Justice Department tells Trump he's the target of the special counsel's classified documents investigation. What does that tell us?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROMANS: New developments in the ongoing classified documents probe of Donald Trump. Federal prosecutors have informed the former president's legal team that he is a target in special counsel Jack Smith's investigation. Sources tell CNN that Trump's team received a so-called target letter which may be, maybe a precursor to an actual indictment.</p><p>[05:15:02]</p><p>For more context, let's bring in Joey Jackson, CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney.</p><p>Good morning.</p><p>JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Good morning, Christine.</p><p>ROMANS: So, Joey, explain to us, what exactly is a target letter? And what exactly does that indicate to you about the timing and where they are in this investigation?</p><p>JACKSON: Yes, Christine, so what happens with the target letter, it's important to find what that is and how it differentiates from other things. When there's an investigation, a grand jury is convened. A grand jury generally consisting of 23 people on a majority, a majority, right, that means 12, are needed to vote out an indictment.</p><p>The grand jury process is not predicated on proof beyond a reasonable doubt and you just have to establish in the grand jury that there's reasons to believe a crime is committed and the subject or target of that investigation committed it, and therefore, as a prosecutor, you put forth various facts, evidence by virtue of witnesses, documents, et cetera. And then you move to have the grand jury generally hears from. The grand jury is here from witnesses on one hand, those people who are possessive of knowledge and information relevant to that grand jury inquiry.</p><p>On the other side of that is a specific target to your question of the investigation. That is the person about whom you believe you engage in criminality. So, a target means that there's substantial evidence, which would indicate that a crime would be committed. In the middle of that, you have a subject of the investigation and so, although he's the target, they can be multiple targets, right?</p><p>The issue is, if you are subject to the investigation -- are you a witness? Are you a target? We're not sure. So those are three categories, the target being the worst. That's the person who we are looking to indict and move forward again.</p><p>So, if you've got that target letter, Christine, what it essentially means that you could be indicted. We know the Trump lawyers have met with the Department of Justice as a very significant development.</p><p>ROMANS: So, once informed, once the legal he team is informed that Trump is indeed the target, target of an investigation like this then has the opportunity to present evidence to testify to the grand jury if they choose. Do you expect Trump's legal team to do that?</p><p>JACKSON: I don't think that there's any way that that's really happening in my view, right? As a defense attorney, what you have to do is to assess the realities and whether or not you should put your client before a grand jury.</p><p>The first thing you do, is what the Trump team did, and that's the going to try to convince the Department of Justice that, hey, maybe there's another way. Our client is not guilty of these crimes. There have been prosecutorial misconduct, was the alleged accusations that they have been making. We have known specifically what occurred. There were reports of that occurred.</p><p>I believe that, so far, that's been unpersuasive, and if you have any other information, you would give that to federal prosecutors. They would consider. Thereafter, however, you certainly have a right to appear before the grand jury, but you waive immunity. Remember, Christine, we have a Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination. That means, generally, defendants don't say anything at all. Of course, Trump is on record having said a number of things pertaining to this.</p><p>I think when you're in a hole, the conventional wisdom is you stop digging, and I think his attorneys will stop digging right now and not put him before a grand jury.</p><p>ROMANS: The former president, Joey, told Maggie Haberman of \"The New York Times\", yesterday that he has not been told he is getting indicted, saying it's not true. Adding again that he doesn't -- he hasn't done anything wrong. We've heard from him many times.</p><p>But what could be the reason beside a possible indictment that Trump would be informed he's the target in the probe? JACKSON: Yeah. I think that is the essence of it. I mean, the reality is, is that the Department of Justice has specific guidance as it relates to informing people that they are targets and permitting to have the opportunity to testify before grand jury. And so, really, a target letter which gives the indication that you are a target speaks to the issues of concerns, and the government is really a precursor, Christine, to an actual indictment.</p><p>Again, indictment, not proof of, guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but it is proof that the department of justice believes that you're guilty of a crime, beyond reasonable doubt, and it would seem to me that if evidence have been presented, right, to the special counsel since November of last year, you know, the indictment may very well be imminent and or on the verge of significant history here.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Joey Jackson, we know you'll be there explaining it to us all along the way. CNN legal analyst, nice to see, Joey.</p><p>JACKSON: Nice to see you, Christine. Thanks so much.</p><p>ROMANS: All right.

It's the latest health concern for the 86 years old who went through colon surgery two years. Doctors say he will remain in the hospital for another ten days.</p><p>CNN's Jim Bittermann joins us live from Rome.</p><p>Good morning, Jim. Walk us through what happened and what we know about the pontiff's condition today.</p><p>[05:25:04]</p><p>JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Christine.</p><p>Yes, in fact, the pontiff went through the night well, according to Matteo Bruni, who is the Vatican spokesman. That's all he said for the moment, but he's expected to give us a more detail in about an hour so, something like that, as we find out more and more about what's going on with the pope.</p><p>We had a fairly extensive briefing from the surgeon who took -- took charge of the pope yesterday, and he told us -- Dr. Alfieri, told us that, in fact, the pope responded to the anesthesia just fine and to the operation and came out of the operation joking. He said, the pope at one point said, that he was -- felt well, and the doctor told me that he wouldn't be lifting weights anytime soon. The pope said in response, I don't lift weights. So in any case he still has a sense of humor after the operation.</p><p>And I think, you know, this is the kind of thing that doctors are watching carefully, the Vatican has just -- as a matter of precaution has basically canceled all people events for the next ten days till the 18th of June. Then after that we will see, they're concerned because the pope has a busy schedule come up in August, including a trip to Portugal for the World Youth Days, it's a very demanding schedule, and later on a trip to Mongolia.</p><p>So, we'll see if the recovery goes well but for the pope it seems to be -- Christine.</p><p>ROMANS: By all reporting the, hernia was giving him some discomfort so hopefully they can get that fixed and he can get on with his very busy schedule.</p><p>Nice to see you, Jim Bittermann. Thank you.</p><p>Rescue operations are underway in southern Ukraine's Kherson region this morning after that devastating Nova Kakhovka Dam collapse on Tuesday, at least 1,500 residents have been evacuated, more than 230 square miles flooded, and there are some entire communities underwater, according to military. It also has spurned fears of a ecological disaster in the making.</p><p>CNN's Clare Sebastian joins us from London.</p><p>And, Clare, we're hearing three people are believed to have drowned in the Russian occupied town of Oleshky. What can you tell us?</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, Christine, this is according to the Ukrainian mayor of that town, speaking to CNN this morning. He said three going to have died. He believes that there could be many more because although the population of this town is much depleted because of the war, only 3,500 to 4000 people left, he said many of them are pensioners or bedridden, just not able to get unto the rooftops or climb up to higher land.</p><p>So, he's certainly worried there may be more. But this is Russian occupied territory on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River, we're talking about. President Zelenskyy, by the way, is in Kherson today on the visit to survey the damage has been warning about the rescue efforts on those areas, worried that the Russians are not doing enough, or abandoning people.</p><p>We have this extraordinary footage of the Ukrainian military using a drone to drop bottled water, to residents in the region of Oleshky there on the rooftops, on waiting to catch the water bottles drinking water is a major concern.</p><p>And I We want to tune out to see the situation of that town as a whole, entire areas are submerged. Here are the before and after of that Russian-occupied town of Oleshky. You can see on the left on May 15th and the right, it looks like pretty much every street there, is submerged.</p><p>As I said, Zelenskyy very worried about the occupied areas. And this is not the only town, of course, all along the banks of Dnipro River, they're extremely worried. But the governor -- Ukrainian governor of the Kherson region saying this morning that the Russian occupied areas are worst affected. He said 68 percent of the flood zone is in Russian occupied territories, overall, 600,000 square kilometers -- 600 square kilometers rather of territory.</p><p>ROMANS: Clare, military officials say floodwaters have risen an average of 18 feet. Do you have any idea how long will take for this to recede?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: So, the prediction that we got, Christine, which is on the first day from the head of the Ukrainian of electric power company, was that the peak would've been yesterday morning, Wednesday morning in the early hours, in terms of the level of the water at that point, he said it should stabilize for a few days, on the fourth day starts to fall, but it would take 8 to 10 days runoff completely into the Black Sea.</p><p>Of course, when it does, I think we will get a greater picture of the damage here, half the high water levels, we are getting warnings of things like land mines being dislodged and floating in the water. They're lot of hidden hazards out there in situations like this.</p><p>ROMANS: Wow. All right. Clare Sebastian, thank you so much.
