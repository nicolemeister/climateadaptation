In 2020, Sheri Elliott, the former Forest Service budget director, looked out from her deck near the Tahoe National Forest to see flames raging from the<url normalizedValue=\"https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/6997/\"> North Complex fire </url>. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Elliott consulted a map and determined she didn t need to evacuate. The New Bullards Bar Reservoir stood in the way of the encroaching inferno.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just weeks ago in late June, the<url normalizedValue=\"https://yubanet.com/regional-fires/rices/\"> Rices fire </url> blazed miles to the west of her North San Juan home, sending flames and huge plumes of smoke into the royal-blue northern California sky. Elliott and her husband, who uses heavy machinery to render their property fire-safe, nearly evacuated before authorities deployed tankers to drop retardant and<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/science-technology/fire/people/hotshots\"> hotshot crews </url> to stifle the flames.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Retired from the Forest Service in 2017, Elliott is still working doggedly to mitigate the increasingly ferocious fires in northern California that threaten her property and that of countless others. </p><p>And she s digging in on one often overlooked area of <url normalizedValue=\"http://njour.nl/s/718180?unlock=P6EN8NL4SX27MMUW\"> fire-prevention strategy </url>: the construction of new electricity plants that run on highly-flammable wood removed from the forest. Supporters of biomass electricity say the build-out of new plants like the one Elliott is pursuing will help power homes and strip the forests of the stuff that makes wildfires increasingly catastrophic.</p><p>Elliott is a board member of the Camptonville Community Partnership, an organization that seeks to revitalize a remote region west of Tahoe National Forest. In that role, she s shepherding through a new biomass power plant on a 100-acre property purchased recently from Sierra Pacific Industries just around the corner from the New Bullards Bar Reservoir. </p><p>Similar to natural gas and coal, biomass plants burn organic material like wood and agriculture waste to boil water, which then produces steam to spin turbines and create electricity. </p><p>The pine-and-fir-forests in northern California and across the West are perilously overstocked due to Forest Service policy dating back generations to suppress fire at all costs in order to allow new towns and cities to thrive. Climate change is fueling rising temperatures and unprecedented drought, making the forests tinderboxes. Four of the 20 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/media/4jandlhh/top20_acres.pdf\"> largest fires </url> in California history took place last year. Fires are currently blazing in the state from Yosemite National Park to Shasta County. </p><p>And now, the Forest Service needs to remove the dead and dying vegetation, known as hazardous fuels, to mitigate the fire risk. </p><p>To do that, the Biden administration selected the Yuba River region of the Tahoe National Forest for the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/WCS-Initial-Landscape-Investments.pdf\"> first tranche </url> of more than $3 billion in wildfire funding from the bipartisan infrastructure law passed last year. The North Yuba Forest Partnership, an electric mix that brings together the Forest Service, the National Forest Foundation, Elliott s Camptonville organization, and others, is implementing a <url normalizedValue=\"/s/718180/ccan-new-federal-funds-stifle-the-fires/\"> laundry list of forest-management projects </url> to thin the forests of millions of tons of hazardous fuels.</p><p>Elliott wants to use that waste to power homes and businesses.</p><p> This is literally in the backyard of those projects,  she told <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National Journal</emphasis> from the site just off a local highway where pines, star thistle, dog-tail grass, and sunflowers grow and a Pacific Gas and Electric transmission line runs nearby.</p><p> If you pencil it out, you can make money on these facilities. And particularly this one should be able to make money with the feedstock so close by. But the margins are very narrow,  said Elliott, who wore a Smokey the Bear T-shirt.</p><p>The biomass facility is a dozen years in the making. In late June, contractors started to drill on the site to gauge the soil. The goal is to produce biomass power in 2024. Elliott is now courting investors. </p><p>Meanwhile, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684/text\"> infrastructure law </url> appropriated $400 million in financial assistance for facilities that  purchase and process byproducts from ecosystem restoration projects. </p><p>Elliott hopes to get a piece of that.</p><p> We might need to start really knocking on some doors and figuring out what the agency is really doing with this because I feel like we fit right in,  she said. </p><p>A Forest Service spokesperson, Michelle Burnett, said $7.5 million of that $400 million was deployed in late May to support an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2022/05/27/biden-administration-announces-32-million-advance-climate-smart\"> affordable-housing project </url> unrelated to biomass power. The agency is now working to roll out new funding opportunities for the rest of the financial assistance, Burnett said. Biomass-power projects could access that funding. </p><p>Sheri Elliot and Forest Service employees discuss fire prevention at a high-altitude meadow near Bassetts, Calif.</p><p>Groups that implement the forest-management work, like the National Forest Foundation, a national nonprofit partner to the Forest Service <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/101/statute/STATUTE-104/STATUTE-104-Pg2954.pdf\"> chartered by Congress</url> in 1990, now have to drive long distances to dispose of hazardous fuels they clear from the forests. And the market for timber has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.fed.us/forestmanagement/products/cut-sold/index.shtml\"> plummeted </url> in recent decades, making it harder to encourage foresters to remove those fuels to begin with. </p><p>In November, the NFF contractor Robinson Enterprises, Inc., based out of Nevada City, California, cut down tens of thousands of lodgepole pines as part of the Forest Service s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/project/?project=51549\">French Meadows project </url> near a small town named Bassetts high in the Tahoe National Forest mountains. The project aims to restore meadows and Aspen populations and mitigate fire risk. Now, NFF is organizing the transport of 16,000 tons of the pines, which lay in a towering pile in the middle of a cleared-out strip of forest, to the Honey Lake Power biomass plant 120 miles away.</p><p> The export of that and the transporting fee of that to Honey Lake is pretty exponential. We just increased their cost to perform this work by another $300,000 just due to the fuel,  Carson Clark, an NFF forestry supervisor, told <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National Journal</emphasis> at the site. </p><p>He said the Camptonville facility will be  a lot closer  and  a lot cheaper for transportation.  Elliott s site is 40 miles from the French Meadows project.</p><p>In the 1800s, prior to the industrial revolution that powered homes with coal-fueled electricity, the U.S. relied <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/renewable-sources/\"> almost exclusively </url> on wood combustion for heating, cooking, and lighting needs. Now, wood biomass generates <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&amp;t=3\"> less than 1 percent </url> of electricity on the power grid. </p><p> You are seeing massive forest-fire risk out west, that increasing severity of forest fires season over season. And at the same time, you re seeing biomass power facilities struggle,  said Carrie Annand, executive director of the national Biomass Power Association.  We hope to see things turn around. We believe strongly that biomass is an important tool in addressing wildfire risk and reducing the risk.  </p><p>According to Annand, several biomass facilities that use hazardous fuels are on the verge of shuttering in part due to cheap natural-gas electricity and increasingly cheap wind and solar production. </p><p>Those include Rio Bravo Fresno in Fresno, California, Biomass One in White City, Oregon, and Novo Power in Snowflake, Arizona. Annand is pushing the Environmental Protection Agency to allow biomass electricity to participate in the national Renewable Fuel Standard, a law that forces biofuel blending into gasoline. An EPA spokesperson, Shayla Powell, said the agency is exploring new rules to expand the RFS. She declined to comment on timing for a new regulatory proposal. </p><p>Since 2017, lawmakers in Washington D.C., led by Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, have included language in appropriations bills to designate biomass as carbon-neutral, which can allow facilities to qualify for clean-energy programs.</p><p> Recognizing the carbon neutrality of biomass not only aligns with the science, but also encourages investments in working forests, bioenergy, wood products, and paper manufacturing,  Collins said in a statement. </p><p>In California, a<url normalizedValue=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201120120SB1122\"> 2012 law </url> was signed to force utilities to incorporate small-scale biomass, like Elliott s Camptonville project, into renewable-energy mandates. Experts say PG&amp;E, the power utility that serves the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pge.com/tariffs/assets/pdf/tariffbook/ELEC_MAPS_Service%20Area%20Map.pdf\"> majority of California north of Los Angeles </url>, has frustrated biomass-infrastructure build-out.</p><p> The utilities in California are very, very slow at the process by which these facilities can actually connect to the grid and start selling their power,  said Daniel Sanchez, an assistant professor at University of California (Berkeley) who helps run the institution s Woody Biomass Utilization Group.  Pacific Gas and Electric is kind of notorious for this, having 18-24-month timelines to even get a quote about how much interconnection is going to cost. And then there s no ability to negotiate a quote.</p><p> I think everyone in the state is pretty fed up with the way that Pacific Gas and Electric, in particular, is doing interconnection for these facilities,  he said. </p><p>The Camptonville Community Partnership needs to pony up $2.5 million to connect the biomass facility to the grid.</p><p>A PG&amp;E spokeswoman, Lynsey Paulo, declined to comment directly on the criticisms voiced by Sanchez. </p><p> PG&amp;E strongly supports California s clean energy policies, renewable energy goals and efforts to limit and adapt to the impacts of climate change,  said Paulo.  PG&amp;E has over 260 Renewables Portfolio Standard-eligible power purchase contracts including 42 bioenergy contracts, representing over 390 MW of capacity. </p><p>Paulo said the utility typically gives interconnection-cost estimates to new developers within a year after studying necessary grid upgrades in line with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/rule21/\">California state </url> and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rules. </p><p> Historically, there have been a few projects that have taken longer than six to 12 months, but in such cases there typically was a back and forth between PG&amp;E and the applicant to ensure PG&amp;E fully understood the operational characteristics of the generator in order to produce an accurate study,  she added. </p><p>A separate California<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/industries-and-topics/electrical-energy/electric-power-procurement/rps/rps-procurement-programs/rps-bioram#:~:text=The%20BioRAM%20program%20requires%20the,mitigating%20the%20threat%20of%20wildfires.\"> regulation </url>, stemming from a 2015 emergency order, requires utilities to bring on some bioenergy produced at larger-scale facilities that use hazardous fuels removed from the forest. Julee Malinowski-Ball, executive director of California Biomass Energy Alliance, said PG&amp;E has been more supportive of that program.</p><p> If it weren t for this program, those facilities probably wouldn t be operating today because their contracts would have expired and they would have had to compete   with significantly less expensive wind and solar technologies, which are more subsidized and just simply cheaper,  she said.</p><p>A towering pile of cleared pine at the French Meadows project will soon be transported to the Honey Lake Power biomass plant.</p><p>Advocates say biomass power, equipped with pollution controls, emits far less particulate matter a common cause of asthma, cancer, and other pulmonary health hazards than wildfires and forest pile-burning, which the Forest Service and its forestry allies often do to dispose of cleared hazardous fuels. A 2011 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3155/1047-3289.61.1.63\"> study </url> published by the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Journal of the Air &amp; Waste Management Association</emphasis> concluded that biomass produces 98 percent less particulate matter than open pile-burning and 17 percent less carbon dioxide.</p><p>In its <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lung.org/getmedia/74b3d3d3-88d1-4335-95d8-c4e47d0282c1/sota-2022.pdf\"> State of the Air 2022 report </url>, the American Lung Association, a major public-health organization that focuses on air quality and related health impacts, called wildfires a  growing threat to public health  that pollute  the air breathed by millions of people.  </p><p>Over recent years and decades, the group has increasingly spotlighted concerns about the particulate-matter threat.</p><p> We ve seen this<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/07/20/wildfire-smoke-air-quality-dc/\"> transcontinental event that we had in the summer of 2021 </url>, where we saw Western wildfires impacting eastern cities and everywhere in between,  said Paul Billings, a senior vice president at the American Lung Association who s been with the organization for more than three decades.  I d say the last five to seven years have seen a real marked shift in how much attention we re paying to wildfire in our report and sort of the day-in, day-out. </p><p>But the ALA <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lung.org/policy-advocacy/public-policy-positions/public-policy-position-energy\"> opposes </url> biomass for electricity, arguing that the smokestacks at the plants emit harmful pollutants that pose too many health risks for local residents.  We do not want to be creating more biomass infrastructure for electricity generation. We want to transition to clean, non-combustion, renewable electricity,  he said.</p><p> We also know that biomass plants are not well controlled for pollution and they can be a day-in, day-out threat to the communities that are nearby and downwind. And they re frequently low-income and communities of color,  he added. Biden administration plans to rapidly build out clean energy took a major hit last week after moderate Sen. Joe Manchin quashed budget-reconciliation efforts to give big tax breaks for wind and solar developers. </p><p>Jonathan Buonocore, a former researcher at Harvard University who is now an assistant professor at Boston University School of Public Health, has also been sounding the alarm bells about biomass. Last year, he published a <url normalizedValue=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/abe74c\"> paper </url> that argued biomass caused at least 18,000 deaths far more than the pollution-related deaths linked to coal power plants. </p><p> There are other ways to generate energy that don t involve burning stuff. And those are probably going to be better for health,  he said. </p><p>For utility-scale electricity generation, particulate-matter emissions tied to coal and natural gas far outweigh biomass, according to the EPA.</p><p>In 2017, the most recent year for EPA National Emissions Inventory data, biomass electricity produced <url normalizedValue=\"https://enviro.epa.gov/enviro/nei.htm?pType=SECTOR&amp;pReport=nation&amp;pState=&amp;pPollutant=&amp;pPollutant=PM25-PRI&amp;pSector=&amp;pSector=26&amp;pYear=2017&amp;pCounty=&amp;pTier=&amp;pWho=NEI\"> 1,609 tons </url> of particulate matter. Coal, which makes up 22 percent of utility-scale electricity in the U.S., produced <url normalizedValue=\"https://enviro.epa.gov/enviro/nei.htm?pType=SECTOR&amp;pReport=nation&amp;pState=&amp;pPollutant=&amp;pPollutant=PM25-PRI&amp;pSector=&amp;pSector=13&amp;pYear=2017&amp;pCounty=&amp;pTier=&amp;pWho=NEI\"> more than 74,000 tons </url>. And natural gas, the leading electricity fuel at 38 percent, produced <url normalizedValue=\"https://enviro.epa.gov/enviro/nei.htm?pType=SECTOR&amp;pReport=nation&amp;pState=&amp;pPollutant=&amp;pPollutant=PM25-PRI&amp;pSector=&amp;pSector=25&amp;pYear=2017&amp;pCounty=&amp;pTier=&amp;pWho=NEI\"> more than 24,000 tons </url>. Meanwhile, wildfires emitted a whopping <url normalizedValue=\"https://enviro.epa.gov/enviro/nei.htm?pType=SECTOR&amp;pReport=nation&amp;pState=&amp;pPollutant=&amp;pPollutant=PM25-PRI&amp;pSector=&amp;pSector=59&amp;pYear=2017&amp;pCounty=&amp;pTier=&amp;pWho=NEI\"> 1,655,211 tons </url> of particulate matter in 2017, according to the EPA.</p><p>The debate over biomass is likely to continue to rage on from the community level to the halls of Congress. The Biomass Power Association s Annand says more federal and state policy should acknowledge and reward the contributions biomass makes to the fight against wildfire.</p><p> It s energy production and resource management. But we only get paid for the first part of that,  she said.</p><p>But biomass power faces a steep uphill climb to claim more of the electricity market. Elliott said the Camptonville plant will only process 40 tons of woody material annually, just a fraction of the 16,000 tons of lodgepole pine cut down at the French Meadows project site near Bassetts. </p><p> It s not the answer. It s just part of the answer,  she said. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This is the second </emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"http://njour.nl/s/718180?unlock=P6EN8NL4SX27MMUW\"> story </url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> in </emphasis>National Journal<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> s four-part series,  California burning,  which explores the federal strategy to tackle wildfires ravaging the western U.S.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNGDLY-718229</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNGDLY2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65YM-RHK1-DY4X-T3YK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8371</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2444\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The National Journal Group, Inc.

Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, told him forest management is an issue, but \"climate change is real, and that is exacerbating this.\"</p><p>\"Please respect, and I know you do, the difference of opinion out here as it relates to this fundamental issue ... of climate change,\" Newsom said.</p><p>When Wade Crowfoot, California secretary for natural resources - identified climate change as the primary cause of the wildfires, Trump interrupted: \"It'll start getting cooler - you just watch.\"</p><p>\"I wish science agreed with you,\" Crowfoot told the president.</p><p>Trump responded, \"I don't think science knows, actually.\"</p><p>In a campaign speech Monday, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said Trump's refusal to address climate change threatens to bring more wildfires, floods and other environmental calamities.</p><p>\"If you give a climate arsonist four more years in the White House, why would anyone be surprised if we have more of America ablaze?\" Biden said. \"If you give a climate denier four more years in the White House, why would anyone be surprised when more of America is underwater?\"</p><p>As smoke obscured the view of mountains in Northern California, Trump received his briefing on wildfire damage at McClellan Park, a former Air Force Base that's home to the state's Office of Emergency Services.</p><p>Trump participated in a ceremony recognizing the work of the California National Guard.</p><p>Over the past three weeks, deadly wildfires have destroyed more than 5 million acres in California, Oregon and Washington and forced thousands from their homes.</p><p>Forest management, Trump's preferred solution, can range from clearing out overgrown vegetation - which can serve as kindling - to cutting pathways and roads through the woods to give firefighters easier access.</p><p>Trump has  threatened to withhold federal aid from California and other states if they do not change forest management policies.</p><p>At a rally in Pennsylvania last month, Trump said, \"You gotta clean your floors, you gotta clean your forests - there are many, many years of leaves and broken trees and they're like, like, so flammable, you touch them and it goes up.\"</p><p>Trump took a more tactful tone at the start of his visit Monday, saying he gets along with  Newsom.</p><p>\"He does agree with me on forest management,\" Trump said. \"It's a very important subject. You drop a cigarette on it, you come back an hour later and you have a forest fire.\"</p><p>Asked why he waited so long to visit, Trump told a reporter, \"That's a nasty question. I got a call from your governor immediately. On that call, I declared it a national emergency. That's a nasty question.\"</p><p>The wildfire review came a day after officials in Nevada criticized Trump for holding a mass political rally indoors, risking the spread of COVID-19.</p><p>\"At a time when Nevada is focused on getting our economy back on track and protecting public health, the president's actions this weekend are shameful, dangerous and irresponsible,\" Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak said. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USATDY-119682202</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USATDY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60V8-S3M1-JC8N-K3P7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8213</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"640\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Gannett Company, Inc.

The comment was written on April 29, 2021, and posted on May 27, 2021:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thank you for the opportunity to provide input on the implementation of climate-smart agricultural and forestry practices. The Biomass Power Association represents domestic biomass power producers who source fuels from their local communities. U.S. biomass power facilities are located primarily in rural areas with active forest and/or agricultural economies.</p><p>Our members use fuels that are residuals and byproducts of forest products and agricultural businesses, adding an additional and often much-needed revenue stream to these sectors and utilizing materials that often have very few other uses. In some areas, our members are actively involved in the reduction of catastrophic wildfires by repurposing forest debris that is very hazardous during wildfire season.</p><p>Our members are a critical component of USDA's climate-smart forestry and agricultural efforts, but many are experiencing economic challenges. Certain energy technologies, such as wind, solar and natural gas, have experienced explosive growth over the past decade, and this has led to depressed electricity prices in some areas of the country. As a result, biomass power facilities are struggling to compete in power markets.</p><p>We have enjoyed close collaboration with the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), and specifically its wood energy team. Biomass Power Association was a signer to a MOU led by USFS to promote better coordination among the various groups involved in producing domestic energy from wood.</p><p>By generating renewable electricity from materials that have no other use or that need disposal, biomass power is the ultimate \"climate-smart\" industry - and there are many ways that USDA can ensure that biomass power can be fully leveraged for its climate benefits. Below are our responses to the USDA's request for information.</p><p>Climate Smart Agriculture and Forestry</p><p>Biomass plays a crucial role in climate-smart forestry and agriculture strategies. By utilizing the otherwise unusable portions of harvested plants, biomass power helps avoid emissions from open burning and infuses capital into rural supply chains.</p><p>The Biden Administration's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Deputy Administrator, Janet McCabe, recognized the benefits of using biomass from wastes and residuals when she served as Acting Assistant Administrator of the Office of Air and Radiation at EPA in the Obama Administration. In a November 2014 memorandum about the role of biomass in the Clean Power Plan, she wrote: \"Information considered in preparing the second draft of the Framework, including the SAB [Scientific Advisory Board] peer review and stakeholder input, supports the finding that use of waste-derived feedstocks and certain forest-derived industrial byproducts are likely to have minimal or no net atmospheric contributions of biogenic C02 emissions, or even reduce such impacts, when compared with an alternate fate of disposal.\"/1</p><p>Wildfire risk reduction and utilization of low-value wood go hand-in-hand, and are critical factors in reducing massive greenhouse gas emissions from out-of-control wildfires. The Washington Post reported recently that the carbon savings from the pandemic were negated by the 2020 wildfire season./2</p><p>Some USDA programs support the biomass power industry by helping ensure that unusable materials are collected and diverted to a biomass power facility. For example, the U.S. Forest Service Stewardship Contracts in Arizona, Colorado and California fund forest restoration projects to clear out dead and dying trees to reduce the risk of wildfire. The contract recipients then bring the materials to biomass power facilities to use as fuel. While it's not practical or necessary to expand the program to every state, it may be possible to identify additional biomass power facilities in areas with at-risk forests that are able to take on fuel cleared out from Stewardship contracts.</p><p>The Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) is another tool available to USDA, although it currently lacks funding. When funded by Congress, the program offers matching payments to forest landowners who produce and deliver biomass feedstocks to qualified biomass conversion facilities. This program had some challenges with implementation in the past, likely related to an overly broad definition of biomass feedstocks, and funds were depleted too quickly.</p><p>However, it may be possible to rewrite the rules or create a similar program with a narrower definition of biomass feedstocks that better accomplishes the goals of the program.</p><p>The USDA might consider a new program altogether to incentivize alternatives to open burning, including the use of biomass power. Many farmers and foresters resort to open burning the unusable parts of their crops as a cost-effective way to dispose of them. Open burning results in a much higher release of carbon and greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere than would happen if those materials were used as fuel at a biomass power facility./3</p><p>Providing some incentive to farmers and foresters to divert the unusable portions of their crops to biomass power facilities where feasible may help reduce atmospheric carbon from open burning.</p><p>Reducing emissions from biomass power facilities</p><p>Below are two ways to further reduce biomass power emissions while potentially adding revenue potential and increased financial stability:</p><p>1. Biochar markets. Biochar can be a byproduct of biomass power production, and can reduce smokestack emissions at a biomass power facility. It is a substance that can serve as a soil health amendment, a wastewater treatment tool, or as an additive to livestock feed to aid in digestion. While there is anecdotal evidence of biochar's benefits and uses and growing scientific evidence of its helpfulness in sequestering carbon in soil, a long-term study may help crystallize those benefits and identify policy tools that would encourage increased utilization of biochar and increased production of biochar from biomass power facilities.</p><p>2. BECCS with utilization. Bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS) is one of the only truly carbon-negative technologies that is currently available. A report by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory last year projected that California would not be able to meet its goal of zero emissions by 2045 without the robust deployment of bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS)./4</p><p>However, the technology is costly, and the 45Q tax credit does not yet make BECCS accessible to biomass power producers. We urge USDA to consider working with U.S. Department of Energy and EPA to conduct more BECCS pilot projects with biomass power facilities, supporting policies that value carbon captured from biogenic sources more highly than carbon from geologic sources, and supporting more R&amp;D on carbon utilization and distribution.</p><p>Biofuels, Wood, Renewable Energy and Wildfire Reduction</p><p>Domestic biomass power is perhaps the least understood renewable energy resource. In general, the public, lawmakers and their staffers and environmental groups understand the value of forests in combating climate change, but the role of biomass as part of the forestry sector is less well-known. The Climate 21 proposal that the Biden transition team released, which outlined climate goals across the federal agencies, made clear that bioenergy would be an essential element of forest management, wildfire reduction and wood utilization. We look forward to working with the USDA and the USFS to help encourage a better public understanding of the role of biomass in mitigating the effects of climate change.</p><p>One of the best ways that USDA can encourage greater use of low-value wood material is to urge the EPA to implement the electricity portion of the Renewable Fuel Standard, and activate its biomass pathways, as soon as possible. Despite electricity's inclusion in the RFS2 law passed by Congress in 2007, not one electricity producer has been able to participate in the program as of 2021. Biomass power producers, along with biogas and waste-to-energy electricity producers, have been supplying low-carbon fuel for transportation use without receiving the credit to which they are entitled.</p><p>Biomass power represents an important method for managing resources. It is the most efficient way to dispose of low-value organic material from the forest and agricultural sectors, including forest and mill residue, rice and oat hulls, and nut shells. Participation in the RFS, beyond EPA honoring a mandate from Congress, represents stability for a small but important industry and the many rural jobs it supports.</p><p>Biomass power also is critical to forest management and wildfire risk reduction, particularly in the Western United States. Fuels collected from the wildland-urban interface (WUI) should be eligible to qualify for RFS credits. In addition, many states, such as Maine and states in the Northwest, have been stymied by EPA staff's narrow interpretation of \"slash\" and \"pre-commercial thinnings\" under the RFS, which flies in the face of forestry science and creates an unequal playing field as states attempt to grow their bioeconomies.</p><p>We also urge the USDA to weigh in on the EPA's forthcoming Renewable Volume Obligation for the years 2021 and 2022 and make clear that it is beyond time to implement the RFS electricity program and activate its biomass pathways. Additionally, the USDA should look at the definition of biomass used by the EPA and urge re-interpretation to ensure that biomass removed from lands for wildfire management can qualify under the RFS.</p><p>Environmental Justice</p><p>Biomass power is a vital part of rural forestry and agricultural economies. The presence of a biomass power facility represents an additional revenue stream for landowners and farmers who produce organic waste as a byproduct to their primary harvest. The well-paying jobs offered by biomass power facilities support the local economy and residents.</p><p>Utilizing byproducts and waste products at a biomass facility means they are subject to environmental controls, substantially reducing emissions when compared to open burning./5</p><p>Using these materials as fuel at a biomass power facility also means that they will not remain on a forest floor decomposing and releasing the harmful methane gas,/6 or causing additional forest fire risk.</p><p>Incentivizing biomass power in areas with considerable organic waste, where farms and forests are prevalent, supports the economic and environmental health of that community. Some of our members work with underserved communities, partnering to safely dispose materials that pose a fire hazard on their lands. For instance, a facility in Arizona sources fuel from the nearby Apache tribe that is cleared off their lands to reduce forest fire risk.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments on USDA's climate strategy. The domestic biomass power industry is an important part of any climate change mitigation plan, and we look forward to working with USDA and USFS to implement the vision of the Biden Administration.

Joseph Neguse, D-Colorado, issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Congressman Joe Neguse has submitted several requests to the House Appropriations Committee and House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to include funding for specific Boulder County community projects in the FY2022 funding bill and Surface Transportation Reauthorization legislation . Among his requests, he has asked for funds to support the Boulder Strong Resource Center to support an expansion of mental health services, while reducing future costs and saving taxpayer funds in the long-term. Congressman Neguse has also requested $5 million for improvements on State Highway 119, funds to support the Big Springs Emergency Egress in Nederland and funding to support the University of Colorado's Rural Outreach Partnership program.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"As Congress works to pass comprehensive infrastructure legislation and finalize this year's budget, we are working to ensure that Boulder County is allocated direct funding to support local community projects and support our residents,\" said Congressman Joe Neguse. \"In the wake of the March 22nd shooting at King Soopers, it's critical that mental health resources remain available for everyone in our community and we are working to ensure the Boulder Strong Resource Center is supported and can remain a consistent resource for our community.\"</p><p>\"The State Highway 119 corridor is an essential transportation link for our region,\" said Boulder County Commissioner Claire Levy. \"The funding that Congressman Neguse is advocating for is the final piece of the puzzle for making badly-needed improvements to the most congested intersection on that corridor. Importantly, this investment would not only improve vehicle traffic flows, it would also include construction of regional transit connections, as well as improved bicycle and pedestrian connections. We appreciate Congressman Neguse's advocacy for this project which will contribute to the creation of sustainable, affordable, and equitable transportation choices throughout Boulder County and the broader region.\"</p><p>\"The Northwest Mayors &amp; Commissioners Coalition and Commuting Solutions greatly appreciate the support of Rep. Neguse of the SH 119/SH 52 multimodal project as one of his Member Designated Projects,\" said Audrey DeBarros, Executive Director of Commuting Solutions. \"SH 119 located between Boulder and Longmont is the top priority for our coalition to address the safety and mobility needs of this growing part of Boulder County. The potential federal funding will be added to CDOT and RTD funding which have already been designated for this intersection, bring full funding for the project to completion. We sincerely thank Rep. Neguse for his support of this important regional investment.\"</p><p>Congressman Neguse helped secure $63 million in direct COVID-19 stabilization funds for Boulder County, and $20.5 million for the City of Boulder in the American Rescue Plan. Neguse has been advocating for direct stabilization funds for smaller cities and counties since April 2020 when he introduced the Coronavirus Community Relief Act.</p><p>Boulder County Requests:</p><p>Project name: Boulder Strong Resource Center</p><p>Amount: $271,740</p><p>Recipient: Mental Health Partners, located at 1455 Dixon Avenue, Suite 300, Lafayette, Colorado 80026</p><p>Project Name: State Highway 119 and State Highway 52 Multimodal Intersection Improvements</p><p>Recipient: Boulder County</p><p>Requested Amount: $5 million</p><p>Project name: Big Springs Emergency Egress</p><p>Amount: $600,000</p><p>Recipient: Town of Nederland, located at 45 W. 1st Street, Nederland, Colorado 80466</p><p>Explanation: The request supports an emergency egress that would increase resident safety in the Big Springs subdivision in Nederland in the event of a forest fire. There are currently limited exit routes from the neighborhood, which could potentially be deadly and pose a risk to residents within the subdivision if a wildfire blocked the existing exit routes.</p><p>Project name: University of Colorado Boulder Rural Outreach Partnership Program</p><p>Amount: $266,180</p><p>Recipient: University of ColoradoBoulder, located at CASE W220, 200 UCB, Boulder, Colorado 80309</p><p>Explanation: The Rural Partnership Outreach Department of the Office of Pre-College Outreach and Engagement was created to provide more pre-college programming and outreach to low-income and first-generation students in rural communities across Colorado, including Fort Morgan and the San Luis Valley. The goal of this program is to strengthen and formalize pathways from middle school to high school, and from high school to post-secondary studies by implementing grade appropriate programming to support academic success, persistence, and retention of first generation and low-income students in Fort Morgan and the San Luis Valley. This programming includes college and career exploration from seventh through twelfth grade. Moreover, the program provides access to technology through the purchase of lender laptops, connectivity through hotspots, academic student evaluation and intervention, and the opportunity to engage with local businesses for earned income through the creation of internship/apprenticeship programs. Furthermore, student participants will be provided an opportunity to attend a 2-week academic summer residential program at the University of ColoradoBoulder to help familiarize themselves with the physical environment of a college campus during the summer between their Junior and Senior years in high school. This project is a good use of taxpayer funds because it would provide essential resources for first generation and low-income students.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7475698 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7475698</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62M6-HJD1-JC11-1412-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"944\"/><timeReceived>7:00 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 7, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

They offer botanical heritage, watershed protection, natural resources and indescribable scenery across hundreds of thousands of acres in the Garden State,\" said Assemblyman Eric Houghtaling (D-Monmouth), chair of the Agriculture Committee and prime sponsor of all four bills. \"Without proper maintenance and nurture, we could potentially lose our forests to wildfires and other effects of climate change. Promoting responsible stewardship of our forests will help protect and preserve this vital natural resource for generations to come.\"</p><p>The first bill in the package (A-4843 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2020/Bills/A5000/4843_I1.PDF\">https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2020/Bills/A5000/4843_I1.PDF</url>)), sponsored by Assemblywoman Carol Murphy and Assemblyman Houghtaling, requires the development of forest stewardship plans for certain lands acquired for recreation and conservation purposes by the State, local government units, or qualifying tax-exempt nonprofit organizations with funding provided through New Jersey's \"Green Acres Program.\" The goal of this legislation is to ensure that these entities have plans in place to manage the property and promote the long-term health and vigor of the forests.</p><p>\"Our forests are home to native plants, threatened and endangered species and a vast array of wildlife,\" said Murphy (D-Burlington). \"By requiring organizations to have forest stewardship plans, we will ensure these environments are well-managed and protected from harm.\"</p><p>About 42 percent (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.state.nj.us/dep/parksandforests/forest/iyof_facts.html\">https://www.state.nj.us/dep/parksandforests/forest/iyof_facts.html</url>) of New Jersey's land is forested, with two thirds privately owned. Forest stewardship plans developed by landowners must undergo a multi-tiered review process, often resulting in added costs or time delays to projects without any clear environmental benefits.</p><p>The second bill (A-4844 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2020/Bills/A5000/4844_I1.PDF\">https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2020/Bills/A5000/4844_I1.PDF</url>)) would streamline the review process by providing that forest stewardship plans do not need approval from municipal governments. Plans would still need approval from the New Jersey Department of Environment Protection (DEP) and, if applicable, the Pinelands Commission.</p><p>\"Most municipal governments do not have the time, resources or expertise to review and approve forest stewardship plans. If a plan has already been approved by the DEP, we can trust that it is in full compliance with appropriate forestry standards,\" said Assemblyman John Armato (D-Atlantic), co-prime sponsor of the legislation. \"Streamlining the review process will relieve some of the burden on landowners so that they may implement management plans in a timely manner.\"</p><p>One of the most effective ways to prevent a destructive forest fire is to purposely start a controlled blaze. Known as prescribed burns, fires prepared in advance - with expectations set for the size, environmental conditions and suppression of the burn - may be designed to create a mosaic of diverse habitats for plants and animals, help endangered species or reduce fuels to prevent a destructive fire.</p><p>Assemblymen Vince Mazzeo, Armato and Houghtaling sponsor the third bill (A-4845 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2020/Bills/A5000/4845_I1.PDF\">https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2020/Bills/A5000/4845_I1.PDF</url>)) to set a statewide goal of conducting prescribed burns on a minimum of 50,000 acres in the Pinelands and an additional 10,000 acres elsewhere in New Jersey every year between November and March.</p><p>The Pinelands is the biggest surviving forest on the eastern seaboard south of Maine's North Woods. The Pinelands has over 800,000 acres of forest, of which only about half is permanently preserved. The final bill in package (A-4846 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2020/Bills/A5000/4846_I1.PDF\">https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2020/Bills/A5000/4846_I1.PDF</url>)) establishes a working group to evaluate coordination and cooperation between various government entities and private landowners regarding forest stewardship in the Pinelands.</p><p>\"The Pinelands provide water for millions of people, boast thousands of acres of farmland and serve as a habitat for diverse wildlife and plants,\" said Mazzeo (D-Atlantic). \"Preserving our forests - particularly the vast Pinelands - and protecting them from unplanned, devastating fires is essential to safeguarding these environments and the ecological benefits every New Jerseyan gains from them.\"</p><p>The bill package now goes to the Assembly Speaker for further review.

A mother and her child are out for a walk, on the first warm day after a bitter winter. Beguiled by the changing weather, we do not see the danger coming. In fact, we never see it at all, because the man with the gun remains offscreen. We see only the mother's sudden alarm; her panicked attempt to get her child to safety; their separation in the chaos of the moment; and then the child, outside in the cold as snow once again begins to fall, alone and crying for his mother.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The film in question is, of course, the 1942 Walt Disney classic \"Bambi.\" Perhaps more than any other movie made for children, it is remembered chiefly for its moments of terror: not only the killing of the hero's mother but the forest fire that threatens all the main characters with annihilation. Stephen King called \"Bambi\" the first horror movie he ever saw, and Pauline Kael, the longtime film critic for this magazine, claimed that she had never known children to be as frightened by supposedly scary grownup movies as they were by \"Bambi.\"</p><p>Unlike many other Disney classics, from \"Cinderella\" to \"Frozen,\" this fright fest is not based on a fairy tale. It was adapted from \"Bambi: A Life in the Woods,\" a 1922 novel by the Austro-Hungarian writer and critic Felix Salten. The book rendered Salten famous; the movie, which altered and overshadowed its source material, rendered him virtually unknown. And it rendered the original \"Bambi\" obscure, too, even though it had previously been both widely acclaimed and passionately reviled. The English-language version, as translated in 1928 by the soon to be Soviet spy Whittaker Chambers, was enormously popular, earning rave reviews and selling six hundred and fifty thousand copies in the dozen-plus years before the film came out. The original version, meanwhile, was banned and burned in Nazi Germany, where it was regarded as a parable about the treatment of Jews in Europe.</p><p>As that suggests, \"Bambi\" the book is even darker than \"Bambi\" the movie. Until now, English-language readers had to rely on the Chambers translation-which, thanks to a controversial copyright ruling, has been the only one available for almost a century. This year, however, \"Bambi: A Life in the Woods\" has entered the public domain, and the Chambers version has been joined by a new one: \"The Original Bambi: The Story of a Life in the Forest\" (Princeton), translated by Jack Zipes, with wonderful black-and-white illustrations by Alenka Sottler. Zipes, a professor emeritus of German and comparative literature at the University of Minnesota, who has also translated the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm, maintains in his introduction that Chambers got \"Bambi\" almost as wrong as Disney did. Which raises two questions: How exactly did a tale about the life of a fawn become so contentious, and what is it really about?</p><p>Felix Salten was an unlikely figure to write \"Bambi,\" since he was an ardent hunter who, by his own estimate, shot and killed more than two hundred deer. He was also an unlikely figure to write a parable about Jewish persecution, since, even after the book burnings, he promoted a policy of appeasement toward Nazi Germany. And he was an unlikely figure to write one of the most famous children's stories of the twentieth century, since he wrote one of its most infamous works of child pornography.</p><p>These contradictions are nicely encapsulated by Beverley Driver Eddy in her biography \"Felix Salten: Man of Many Faces.\" Born Siegmund Salzmann, in Hungary in 1869, Salten was just three weeks old when his family moved to Vienna-a newly desirable destination for Jews, because Austria had lately granted them full citizenship. His father was a descendant of generations of rabbis who shook off his religious roots in favor of a broadminded humanism; he was also a hopelessly inept businessman who soon plunged the family into poverty. To help pay the bills, Salten started working for an insurance company in his teens, around the same time that he began submitting poetry and literary criticism to local newspapers and journals. Eventually, he began meeting other writers and creative types at a caf\u00e9 called the Griensteidl, across the street from the national theatre. These were the fin-de-si\u00e8cle artists collectively known as Young Vienna, whose members included Arthur Schnitzler, Arnold Schoenberg, Stefan Zweig, and a writer who later repudiated the group, Karl Kraus.</p><p>Salten was, in his youth, both literally and literarily promiscuous. He openly conducted many affairs-with chambermaids, operetta singers, actresses, a prominent socialist activist, and, serially or simultaneously, several women with whom other members of Young Vienna were having dalliances as well. In time, he married and settled down, but all his life he wrote anything he could get paid to write: book reviews, theatre reviews, art criticism, essays, plays, poems, novels, a book-length advertisement for a carpet company disguised as reportage, travel guides, librettos, forewords, afterwords, film scripts. His detractors regarded this torrent as evidence of hackery, but it was more straightforwardly evidence of necessity; almost alone among the members of Young Vienna, he was driven by the need to make a living.</p><p>Yet, like his father, Salten could be reckless with money. Anxious to seem like an insider, he insisted on eating, drinking, dressing, and travelling in the manner of his wealthier peers, with the result that he was constantly accruing debts, some of which he dispatched in dodgy ways-for instance, by \"borrowing\" and then selling a friend's expensive books. And he could be reckless in other respects, too. Inclined to be touchy, either by temperament or because he felt the need to prove himself, he spent much of his young life fomenting disputes (he once walked into the Griensteidl and slapped Kraus in the face after the latter criticized him in print), then resolving them via lawsuits or duels. Both his personal judgment and his critical judgment could be impulsive and errant; in his thirties, he borrowed prodigiously to produce a modernist cabaret, of the kind that was all the rage in Berlin, only to see it become a critical and financial catastrophe.</p><p>The production that brought Salten the most infamy, however, did not bear his name: \"Josefine Mutzenbacher; or, The Story of a Viennese Whore, as Told by Herself.\" Published anonymously in Vienna in 1906, it has been continuously in print since then, in both German and English, and has sold some three million copies. Despite the subtitle, no one ever seems to have entertained the possibility that it was written by a prostitute, or even by a woman. In Salten's lifetime, nearly everyone thought he wrote it, except for those who liked him too much to believe he could produce something so filthy and those who hated him too much to believe he could produce something so well written. Salten himself twice claimed not to have been responsible for it but otherwise was silent or coy on the subject. These days, everyone from academics to the Austrian government regards him as the undisputed author of the book.</p><p>Written in the tradition of the ribald female memoir, \u00e0 la \"Fanny Hill,\" \"Josefine Mutzenbacher\" recounts the sexual adventures of the title character beginning when she is five years old, and continuing after her turn to prostitution in her early teens, following the death of her mother. Today, what is most shocking about the book is Josefine's youth. At the time, however, most of the scandal concerned her unapologetic embrace of her career, which she both enjoyed and credited with lifting her out of poverty, educating her, and introducing her to a world far wider than the impoverished Vienna suburbs where she (like Salten) grew up.</p><p>Perhaps inevitably, scholars have tried to draw parallels between \"Josefine Mutzenbacher\" and \"Bambi.\" Both title characters lose their mothers while still in their youth; both books introduce readers in detail to urban borderlands-the poor suburbs, the flophouses, the forests-about which most proper Viennese were largely ignorant. Still, for the most part, such comparisons seem strained. \"Josefine Mutzenbacher\" occupies much the same place in the Salten oeuvre as his homage to carpets: the one that lies at the intersection of ambition, graphomania, and penury.</p><p>But the place of \"Bambi\" is different. If there is a through line to Salten's scattershot career, it is his interest in writing about animals, which was evident from his first published work of fiction: \"The Vagabond,\" a short story about the adventures of a dachshund, written when he was twenty-one. Many other nonhuman protagonists followed, most of them ill-fated: a sparrow that dies in battle, a fly that hurls itself to death against a windowpane. Salten's novel \"The Hound of Florence\" concerns a young Austrian man destined to spend every other day of his life as the archduke's dog; in the end, he is stabbed to death, in his dog form, while trying to protect a courtesan he loves from assault. (In an even more drastic transformation than the one \"Bambi\" underwent, this story became, in Disney's hands, \"The Shaggy Dog.\") \"Fifteen Rabbits\" features, at first, fifteen rabbits, who debate the nature of God and the reason for their own persecution while their numbers gradually dwindle. \"Renni the Rescuer,\" about a German shepherd trained as a combat animal, features a carrier pigeon traumatized by its wartime service. And then, of course, there is \"Bambi\"-which, like these other stories, was not particularly suitable for children, until Disney bowdlerized it to fit the bill.</p><p>If you haven't seen the Disney version of \"Bambi\" since you were eight, here is a quick refresher: The title character is born one spring to an unnamed mother and a distant but magnificently antlered father. He befriends an enthusiastic young rabbit, Thumper; a sweet-tempered skunk, Flower; and a female fawn named Faline. After the death of his mother the following spring, he and Faline fall in love, but their relationship is tested by a rival deer, by a pack of hunting dogs, and, finally, by the forest fire. Having triumphed over all three, Bambi sires a pair of fawns; as the film concludes, the hero, like his father before him, is watching over his family from a faraway crag.</p><p>\"Bambi\" was not particularly successful when it was first released. It was hampered partly by audience turnout, which was down because of the Second World War, and partly by audience expectations, since, unlike earlier Disney productions, it featured no magic and no Mickey. In time, though, \"Bambi,\" which was Walt's favorite among his films, became one of the most popular movies in the history of the industry. In the four decades following its release, it earned forty-seven million dollars-more than ten times the haul of \"Casablanca,\" which came out the same year. Perhaps more notably, it also earned a dominant position in the canon of American nature tales. In the words of the environmental historian Ralph Lutts, \"It is difficult to identify a film, story, or animal character that has had a greater influence on our vision of wildlife.\"</p><p>That vision is of an Eden marred only by the incursion of humankind. There is no native danger in Bambi's forest; with the exception of his brief clash with another male deer in mating season, and maybe that hardscrabble winter, the wilderness he inhabits is all natural beauty and interspecies amity. The truly grave threats he faces are always from hunters, who cause both the forest fire and the death of his mother, yet the movie seems less anti-hunting than simply anti-human. The implicit moral is not so much that killing animals is wicked as that people are wicked and wild animals are innocent. Some years ago, when the American Film Institute compiled a list of the fifty greatest movie villains of all time, it chose for slot No. 20-between Captain Bligh, of \"Mutiny on the Bounty,\" and Mrs. John Iselin, of \"The Manchurian Candidate\"-the antagonist of \"Bambi\": \"Man.\"</p><p>Unsurprisingly, \"Bambi\" has long been unpopular among hunters, one of whom sent a telegram to Walt Disney on the eve of the film's release to inform him that it is illegal to shoot deer in the spring. Nor is the film a favorite among professional wilderness managers, who now routinely contend with what they call \"the Bambi complex\": a dangerous desire to regard nature as benign and wild animals as adorable and tame, coupled with a corresponding resistance to crucial forest-management tools such as culling and controlled burns. Even some environmentalists object to its narrowness of vision-its failure to offer audiences a model of a healthy relationship between people and the rest of the natural world.</p><p>But perhaps the most vociferous if also the smallest group of critics consists of devotees of Salten, who recognize how drastically Disney distorted his source material. Although the animals in the novel do converse and in some cases befriend one another across species, their over-all relations are far from benign. In the course of just two pages, a fox tears apart a widely beloved pheasant, a ferret fatally wounds a squirrel, and a flock of crows attacks the young son of Friend Hare-the gentle, anxious figure who becomes Thumper in the movie-leaving him to die in excruciating pain. Later, Bambi himself nearly batters to death a rival who is begging for mercy, while Faline looks on, laughing. Far from being gratuitous, such scenes are, in the author's telling, the whole point of the novel. Salten insisted that he wrote \"Bambi\" to educate na\u00efve readers about nature as it really is: a place where life is always contingent on death, where starvation, competition, and predation are the norm.</p><p>That motive did not make Salten go easy on human beings. On the contrary: his depiction of our impact on nature is considerably more specific and violent than the one in the film, not to mention sadder. Consider the moment when Bambi, fleeing the hunting party that kills his mother and countless other creatures, comes across the wife of Friend Hare, in a scene that reads like something out of \"Regeneration,\" Pat Barker's novel about the First World War:</p><p>\"Can you help me a little?\" she said. Bambi looked at her and shuddered. Her hind leg dangled lifelessly in the snow, dyeing it red and melting it with warm, oozing blood. \"Can you help me a little?\" she repeated. She spoke as if she were well and whole, almost as if she were happy. \"I don't know what can have happened to me,\" she went on. \"There's really no sense to it, but I just can't seem to walk.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\"In the middle of her words she rolled over on her side and died.</p><p>What purpose are scenes like that one serving in this book? Salten maintained that, despite his own affinity for hunting, he was trying to dissuade others from killing animals except when it was necessary for the health of a species or an ecosystem. (That was less hypocritical than it seems; Salten despised poachers and was horrified by the likes of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, who boasted of killing five thousand deer and was known to shoot them by the score as underlings drove them into his path.) But authors do not necessarily get the last word on the meaning of their work, and plenty of other people believe that \"Bambi\" is no more about animals than \"Animal Farm\" is. Instead, they see in it what the Nazis did: a reflection of the anti-Semitism that was on the rise all across Europe when Salten wrote it.</p><p>As a textual matter, the best evidence for this proposition comes from two parts of \"Bambi\" that never made it onto the screen. The first concerns Faline's twin brother, Gobo, who was written out of the movie. A fragile and sickly fawn, Gobo cannot flee during the hunting rampage that kills Bambi's mother and Friend Hare's wife. For several months, he is presumed dead. Then one day Bambi and Faline spot a deer making its way across an open meadow with reckless nonchalance, as if oblivious to any possible peril.</p><p>This newcomer turns out to be the grownup Gobo, who, we learn, was rescued by a member of the hunting party, taken into his home, and nursed back to health. When Gobo returns, the other forest animals gather to hear him describe the kindness of the hunter and his family, the warmth of the dwelling, and the meals that were brought to him every day. Most of them think that Gobo's time among humans has made him dangerously na\u00efve, but he is convinced that it has made him wiser and more worldly. \"You all think He's wicked,\" he tells them. (In Salten's books, humans are typographically styled the way God is: singular and capitalized.) \"But He isn't wicked. If He loves anybody, or if anybody serves Him, He's good to him. Wonderfully good!\"</p><p>Every subjugated minority is familiar with figures like Gobo-individuals who have assimilated into and become defenders of the culture of their subjugators, whether out of craven self-interest or because, like Gobo, they are sincerely enamored of it and convinced that their affection is reciprocated. Such figures often elicit the disdain or the wrath of their peers, and Salten leaves little doubt about how he feels: Bambi \"was ashamed of Gobo without knowing why,\" and the half-tame deer soon pays the price for his beliefs. One day, ignoring the advice of other animals, Gobo strolls into the meadow even though the scent of humans fills the air. He is confident that they won't harm him, but he is shot in the flank while his love interest looks on. As she turns to flee, she sees the hunter bent over Gobo and hears his \"wailing death shriek.\"</p><p>One understands why Disney left that part out. So, too, a scene in Salten's book where a dog kills a fox, which unfolds at a horrifyingly leisurely pace. The fox's paw is shattered and bleeding, and he knows he will die soon, but he pleads with the dog: \"Let me die with my family at least. We're brothers almost, you and I.\" When that fails, he accuses the dog of being a turncoat and a spy. The dog works himself into a frenzy defending the virtue and the power of his master, then itemizes all the other animals who serve humankind:</p><p>\"The horse, the cow, the sheep, the chickens, many, many of you and your kind are on His side and worship Him and serve Him.\"\"They're rabble!\" snarled the fox, full of a boundless contempt.</p><p>It is easy, in light of these scenes, to see why some people interpret \"Bambi\" as a covert account of the crisis facing European Jews in the nineteen-twenties-a story about innocent creatures forced to remain constantly vigilant against danger, from would-be betrayers within and proto-Brown Shirts without. Some of Salten's biography supports that reading, starting with the fact that he knew a thing or two about assimilation. \"I was not a Jew when I was a boy,\" he once wrote; raised in a household that prized European liberalism, and educated in part by pious Catholic teachers who praised him for his knowledge of the catechism, Salten only really began to identify as Jewish in his late twenties, when he grew close to Theodor Herzl, a fellow Austro-Hungarian writer and the father of the Zionist movement. He claimed that it was Herzl's pamphlet \"The Jewish State\" that made Salten, as he wrote, \"willing to love my Jewishness.\"</p><p>If so, that love was, to say the least, complicated. On the one hand, Salten began writing a weekly column for Herzl's Jewish newspaper, in which he grew more and more critical of the assimilationist impulse that had shaped his childhood; on the other hand, he wrote it anonymously and refused to set foot in the newspaper's offices. In later years, his increasing willingness to embrace his Judaism corresponded, not coincidentally, with the increasing anti-Semitism in Vienna, which made it impossible for Jews to forget or deny their religious background.</p><p>In 1925, three years after \"Bambi,\" Salten published \"New People on Ancient Soil,\" the product of a visit to Palestine and a book-length tribute to his friend's dream of a Jewish state. A decade later, his books, together with countless others by Jewish authors, were burned by the Nazis, and two years after that, following Germany's annexation of Austria, he moved to Switzerland. Salten died in Zurich, at the age of seventy-six, four months after Hitler killed himself.</p><p>Does all this make \"Bambi\" a parable about Jewish persecution? The fact that the Nazis thought so is hardly dispositive-fascist regimes are not known for their sophisticated literary criticism-and, for every passage that supports such a reading, numerous others complicate or contradict it. Many critics see in \"Bambi\" different or more diffuse political sentiments, from a generalized opposition to totalitarianism to a post-First World War commentary on the brutality of modern combat. All these readings are plausible, including the specifically Jewish one and Salten's own interpretation of his work as a plea for greater understanding of and greater care for the natural world. Yet the most striking and consistent message of the book is neither obliquely political nor urgently ecological; it is simply, grimly existential.</p><p>Whatever else \"Bambi\" may be, it is, at heart, a coming-of-age story, cervine kin to \"Oliver Twist,\" \"Little Women,\" and \"Giovanni's Room.\" In the language in which it was written, however, it is often described not as a bildungsroman-a general novel of maturation-but more specifically as an Erziehungsroman: a novel of education and training.</p><p>The agent of that education is a character known as the old Prince, the oldest surviving stag in the forest, and the lessons he imparts are not subtle. When he first encounters Bambi, the latter is still a fawn, dismayed because his mother has lately grown distant-pushing him away when he tries to nurse, and walking off without caring whether he is following. Thus rebuffed, he is by himself in the middle of the forest bleating for her when the old Prince appears and scolds him. \"Your mother has no time for you now,\" the old Prince says. \"Can't you stay by yourself? Shame on you!\"</p><p>That, in two sentences, is the ultimate message of \"Bambi\": anything short of extreme self-reliance is shameful; interdependence is unseemly, restrictive, and dangerous. \"Of all his teachings,\" Salten writes, \"this had been the most important: you must live alone. If you wanted to preserve yourself, if you understood existence, if you wanted to attain wisdom, you had to live alone.\" This is not \"The Lorax\" or \"Maus.\" This is \"The Fountainhead,\" with fawns.</p><p>Most panegyrics to the solitary life written by men have an element of misogyny in them, and \"Bambi\" is no exception. Seemingly brave and vivacious in her youth, Faline grows up to be timid and lachrymose; she \"shrieked and shrieked,\" she \"bleated,\" she is \"the hysterical Faline.\" When she and Bambi are (for lack of a better word) dating, the old Prince teaches Bambi to ignore her calls, lest they come from a hunter imitating the sound. Like Gobo, the romance between the childhood friends is doomed by the logic of the book. \"Do you love me still?\" Faline asks one day, to which Bambi replies, \"I don't know.\" She walks away, and \"all at once, his spirit felt freer than for a long time.\" All other relationships with the female of the species have a similarly short life span; fatherly love is enduring and ennobling, motherly love juvenile and embarrassing. \"Bambi\" ends with its hero importuning two fawns, just as the old Prince had importuned him, to learn to live alone.</p><p>The curious thing about this insistence on solitude is that nothing in the book makes it seem appealing. The chief trajectory of Bambi's life is not from innocence to wisdom; it is from contentment and companionship-in his youth, he cavorts with Gobo and Faline, with magpies and Friend Hare, with screech owls and squirrels-to isolation and bare-bones survival. Stranger still, this valorization of loneliness seems unrelated to the book's second explicit moral, which concerns the relationship between human beings and other animals. In the final pages, the old Prince takes Bambi, himself now old and beginning to gray, to see something in the woods: a dead man, shot and killed by another hunter. (Amazingly, Walt Disney planned to include this scene in his film, excising it only after the sight of the corpse made an entire test audience leap out of their seats.) With the old Prince's prompting, Bambi concludes from this experience not that we humans are a danger even unto one another but, rather, that other animals are foolish for imagining that we are gods merely because we are powerful. \"There is Another who is over us all,\" he realizes while contemplating the dead man, \"over us and over Him.\" The old Prince, satisfied that his work is done, goes off to die.</p><p>This vague gesture in the direction of deism has no antecedent in the book, no moral or theological trajectory to make Bambi's insight meaningful or satisfying. On the contrary, the book is at its best when it revels in rather than pretends to resolve the mystery of existence. At one point, Bambi passes by some midges who are discussing a June bug. \"How long will he live?\" the young ones ask. \"Forever, almost,\" their elders answer. \"They see the sun thirty or forty times.\" Elsewhere, a brief chapter records the final conversation of a pair of oak leaves clinging to a branch at the end of autumn. They gripe about the wind and the cold, mourn their fallen peers, and try to understand what is about to happen to them. \"Why must we fall?\" one asks. The other doesn't know, but has questions of its own: \"Do we feel anything, do we know anything about ourselves when we're down there?\" The conversation tacks back and forth from the intimate to the existential. The two leaves worry about which of them will fall first; one of them, gone \"yellow and ugly,\" reassures the other that it has barely changed at all. The response, just before the inevitable end, is startlingly moving: \"You've always been so kind to me. I'm just beginning to understand how kind you are.\" That is the opposite of a paean to individualism: a belated but tender recognition of how much we mean to one another.</p><p>What are we to make of this muddy, many-minded story? Zipes, in his introduction, blames some of the confusion on Chambers, contending that he mistranslated Salten, flattening both the political and the metaphysical dimensions of the work and paving the way for Disney to turn it into a children's story. But that claim is borne out neither by examples in the introduction nor by a comparison of the two English versions, which differ mainly on aesthetic grounds. Zipes is knowledgeable about his subject matter, but he is not a lucid thinker or a gifted writer (a representative sentence from the introduction: \"Salten was able to capture this existential quandary through a compassionate yet objective lens, using an innovative writing technique that few writers have ever been able to achieve\"), and the Chambers translation, from which I have quoted here, is much the better one.</p><p>In both versions, the \"Bambi\" that emerges is a complex work, part nature writing, part allegory, part autobiography. What makes it such a startling source for a beloved children's classic is ultimately not its violence or its sadness but its bleakness. Perhaps the most telling exchange in the book occurs, during that difficult winter, between Bambi's mother and his aunt. \"It's hard to believe that it will ever be better,\" his mother says. His aunt responds, \"It's hard to believe that it was ever any better.\"</p><p>It's tempting to read those lines, too, as a commentary on the Jewish condition, if only because-to this Jew's ears, at least-they have the feel of classic Jewish dark humor: realistic, linguistically dexterous, and grim. Yet no one alive today can regard such a sentiment as exclusive to any subgroup. It is simply a way of seeing the world, one that can be produced by circumstance, temperament, or, as in Salten's case, both. Reading him, one suspects that the conventional interpretation of his most famous work is backward. \"Bambi\" is not a parable about the plight of the Jews, but Salten sometimes regards the plight of the Jews as a parable about the human condition. The omnipresence and inevitability of danger, the need to act for oneself and seize control of one's fate, the threat posed by intimates and strangers alike: this is Salten's assessment of our existence.</p><p>One of the forgotten novelist's most forgotten novels, \"Friends from All Over the World,\" is set in a zoo that is maintained by an enlightened and humane zookeeper yet remains, intrinsically, a place of suffering and cruelty. The animals within it, Salten writes, \"are all sentenced to life imprisonment and are all innocent.\" That is a lovely line, and one that seems to apply, in his moral universe, to all of us. In the forest-that is, in a state of nature-we are in constant danger; in society, tended and cared for but fundamentally compromised, we are still not out of the woods.\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWYRK-0028792X_0122_[ID]</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWYRK2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64N3-9Y21-DYWH-93TD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">237442</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-03-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4844\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Conde Nast Publications, Inc.

Joseph Neguse (D-CO) News Release</nitf:hl2></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Boulder, CO-- Congressman Joe Neguse has submitted several requests to the House Appropriations Committee and House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to include funding for specific Boulder County community projects in the FY2022 funding bill and Surface Transportation Reauthorization legislation . Among his requests, he has asked for funds to support the Boulder Strong Resource Center to support an expansion of mental health services, while reducing future costs and saving taxpayer funds in the long-term. Congressman Neguse has also requested $5 million for improvements on State Highway 119, funds to support the Big Springs Emergency Egress in Nederland and funding to support the University of Colorado's Rural Outreach Partnership program.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"As Congress works to pass comprehensive infrastructure legislation and finalize this year's budget, we are working to ensure that Boulder County is allocated direct funding to support local community projects and support our residents,\" said Congressman Joe Neguse. \"In the wake of the March 22nd shooting at King Soopers, it's critical that mental health resources remain available for everyone in our community and we are working to ensure the Boulder Strong Resource Center is supported and can remain a consistent resource for our community.\"</p><p>\"The State Highway 119 corridor is an essential transportation link for our region,\" said Boulder County Commissioner Claire Levy. \"The funding that Congressman Neguse is advocating for is the final piece of the puzzle for making badly-needed improvements to the most congested intersection on that corridor. Importantly, this investment would not only improve vehicle traffic flows, it would also include construction of regional transit connections, as well as improved bicycle and pedestrian connections. We appreciate Congressman Neguse's advocacy for this project which will contribute to the creation of sustainable, affordable, and equitable transportation choices throughout Boulder County and the broader region.\"</p><p>\"The Northwest Mayors and Commissioners Coalition and Commuting Solutions greatly appreciate the support of Rep. Neguse of the SH 119/SH 52 multimodal project as one of his Member Designated Projects,\" said Audrey DeBarros, Executive Director of Commuting Solutions. \"SH 119 located between Boulder and Longmont is the top priority for our coalition to address the safety and mobility needs of this growing part of Boulder County. The potential federal funding will be added to CDOT and RTD funding which have already been designated for this intersection, bring full funding for the project to completion. We sincerely thank Rep. Neguse for his support of this important regional investment.\"</p><p>Congressman Neguse helped secure $63 million in direct COVID-19 stabilization funds for Boulder County, and $20.5 million for the City of Boulder in the American Rescue Plan. Neguse has been advocating for direct stabilization funds for smaller cities and counties since April 2020 when he introduced the Coronavirus Community Relief Act.</p><p>Boulder County Requests:</p><p>Project name: Boulder Strong Resource Center</p><p>Amount: $271,740</p><p>Recipient: Mental Health Partners, located at 1455 Dixon Avenue, Suite 300, Lafayette, Colorado 80026</p><p>Project Name: State Highway 119 and State Highway 52 Multimodal Intersection Improvements</p><p>Recipient: Boulder County</p><p>Requested Amount: $5 million</p><p>Project name: Big Springs Emergency Egress</p><p>Amount: $600,000</p><p>Recipient: Town of Nederland, located at 45 W. 1st Street, Nederland, Colorado 80466</p><p>Explanation: The request supports an emergency egress that would increase resident safety in the Big Springs subdivision in Nederland in the event of a forest fire. There are currently limited exit routes from the neighborhood, which could potentially be deadly and pose a risk to residents within the subdivision if a wildfire blocked the existing exit routes.</p><p>Project name: University of Colorado Boulder Rural Outreach Partnership Program</p><p>Amount: $266,180</p><p>Recipient: University of Colorado Boulder, located at CASE W220, 200 UCB, Boulder, Colorado 80309</p><p>Explanation: The Rural Partnership Outreach Department of the Office of Pre-College Outreach and Engagement was created to provide more pre-college programming and outreach to low-income and first-generation students in rural communities across Colorado, including Fort Morgan and the San Luis Valley. The goal of this program is to strengthen and formalize pathways from middle school to high school, and from high school to post-secondary studies by implementing grade appropriate programming to support academic success, persistence, and retention of first generation and low-income students in Fort Morgan and the San Luis Valley. This programming includes college and career exploration from seventh through twelfth grade. Moreover, the program provides access to technology through the purchase of lender laptops, connectivity through hotspots, academic student evaluation and intervention, and the opportunity to engage with local businesses for earned income through the creation of internship/apprenticeship programs. Furthermore, student participants will be provided an opportunity to attend a 2-week academic summer residential program at the University of Colorado Boulder to help familiarize themselves with the physical environment of a college campus during the summer between their Junior and Senior years in high school. This project is a good use of taxpayer funds because it would provide essential resources for first generation and low-income students.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://neguse.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-neguse-submits-request-for-federal-funds-to-support-boulder-strong-resource-center-state-highway-119\">https://neguse.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-neguse-submits-request-for-federal-funds-to-support-boulder-strong-resource-center-state-highway-119</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CODUPB-COSHM5061A9G5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62M7-0Y31-JCCP-02N6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"958\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 6, 2021</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Joe Neguse:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Boulder, CO Congressman Joe Neguse has submitted several requests to the House Appropriations Committee and House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to include funding for specific Boulder County community projects in the FY2022 funding bill and Surface Transportation Reauthorization legislation . Among his requests, he has asked for funds to support the Boulder Strong Resource Center to support an expansion of mental health services, while reducing future costs and saving taxpayer funds in the long-term. Congressman Neguse has also requested $5 million for improvements on State Highway 119, funds to support the Big Springs Emergency Egress in Nederland and funding to support the University of Colorados Rural Outreach Partnership program.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As Congress works to pass comprehensive infrastructure legislation and finalize this years budget, we are working to ensure that Boulder County is allocated direct funding to support local community projects and support our residents, said Congressman Joe Neguse. In the wake of the March 22nd shooting at King Soopers, its critical that mental health resources remain available for everyone in our community and we are working to ensure the Boulder Strong Resource Center is supported and can remain a consistent resource for our community.</p><p>The State Highway 119 corridor is an essential transportation link for our region, said Boulder County Commissioner Claire Levy. The funding that Congressman Neguse is advocating for is the final piece of the puzzle for making badly-needed improvements to the most congested intersection on that corridor. Importantly, this investment would not only improve vehicle traffic flows, it would also include construction of regional transit connections, as well as improved bicycle and pedestrian connections. We appreciate Congressman Neguses advocacy for this project which will contribute to the creation of sustainable, affordable, and equitable transportation choices throughout Boulder County and the broader region.</p><p>The Northwest Mayors and Commissioners Coalition and Commuting Solutions greatly appreciate the support of Rep. Neguse of the SH 119/SH 52 multimodal project as one of his Member Designated Projects, said Audrey DeBarros, Executive Director of Commuting Solutions. SH 119 located between Boulder and Longmont is the top priority for our coalition to address the safety and mobility needs of this growing part of Boulder County. The potential federal funding will be added to CDOT and RTD funding which have already been designated for this intersection, bring full funding for the project to completion. We sincerely thank Rep. Neguse for his support of this important regional investment.</p><p>Congressman Neguse helped secure $63 million in direct COVID-19 stabilization funds for Boulder County, and $20.5 million for the City of Boulder in the American Rescue Plan. Neguse has been advocating for direct stabilization funds for smaller cities and counties since April 2020 when he introduced the Coronavirus Community Relief Act.</p><p>Boulder County Requests:</p><p>Project name: Boulder Strong Resource Center</p><p>Amount: $271,740</p><p>Recipient: Mental Health Partners, located at 1455 Dixon Avenue, Suite 300, Lafayette, Colorado 80026</p><p>Project Name: State Highway 119 and State Highway 52 Multimodal Intersection Improvements</p><p>Recipient: Boulder County</p><p>Requested Amount: $5 million</p><p>Project name: Big Springs Emergency Egress</p><p>Amount: $600,000</p><p>Recipient: Town of Nederland, located at 45 W. 1st Street, Nederland, Colorado 80466</p><p>Explanation: The request supports an emergency egress that would increase resident safety in the Big Springs subdivision in Nederland in the event of a forest fire. There are currently limited exit routes from the neighborhood, which could potentially be deadly and pose a risk to residents within the subdivision if a wildfire blocked the existing exit routes.</p><p>Project name: University of Colorado Boulder Rural Outreach Partnership Program</p><p>Amount: $266,180</p><p>Recipient: University of Colorado Boulder, located at CASE W220, 200 UCB, Boulder, Colorado 80309</p><p>Explanation: The Rural Partnership Outreach Department of the Office of Pre-College Outreach and Engagement was created to provide more pre-college programming and outreach to low-income and first-generation students in rural communities across Colorado, including Fort Morgan and the San Luis Valley. The goal of this program is to strengthen and formalize pathways from middle school to high school, and from high school to post-secondary studies by implementing grade appropriate programming to support academic success, persistence, and retention of first generation and low-income students in Fort Morgan and the San Luis Valley. This programming includes college and career exploration from seventh through twelfth grade. Moreover, the program provides access to technology through the purchase of lender laptops, connectivity through hotspots, academic student evaluation and intervention, and the opportunity to engage with local businesses for earned income through the creation of internship/apprenticeship programs. Furthermore, student participants will be provided an opportunity to attend a 2-week academic summer residential program at the University of Colorado Boulder to help familiarize themselves with the physical environment of a college campus during the summer between their Junior and Senior years in high school. This project is a good use of taxpayer funds because it would provide essential resources for first generation and low-income students.</p><p>###</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124441723</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62M5-8TK1-JCBF-S49V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"937\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 6, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Va. \u2014 The challenges were great. The obstacles seemed never ending.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet through it all there stood Deuce McBride, West Virginia's talented, confident and humble point guard.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The sophomore from Cincinnati leads the third-seeded Mountaineers (18-9) against Morehead State (23-7) at 9:50 p.m. today in the first round of the NCAA tournament.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WVU STATS MOREHEAD STATE STATS \"Growing up, it's one of my biggest dreams to play in March Madness, \" McBride said. \"It's been a little different this year, but I'm still happy to be here. Obviously, there's always been big upsets and big shots by big-time players. This is where they all come to get rolling.\"</p><p>It took him 58 games to reach this point, after last season's tournament was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>That's what the stats say, at least.</p><p>In truth, it was much more of an uphill climb for the young man.</p><p>His college career, at one time, was in jeopardy after he broke his foot playing football as a junior at Archbishop Moeller.</p><p>Interested basketball schools began to look elsewhere, but WVU head coach Bob Huggins stayed the course. Why ?</p><p>\"I've known his coach at Moeller in Cincinnati, Carl Kremer, a long time and asked him about him, \" Huggins once told the story. \"He said, 'I don't know about the basketball, but he's the second-toughest kid I've ever coached.' \"</p><p>Toughness. That goes over well with Huggins, who has always believed you can teach basketball to a kid, but not grit and perseverance.</p><p>Maybe no one on the Mountaineers roster has it in the abundance McBride has.</p><p>He proved that early in his freshman season.</p><p>McBride could've been like most others in their first season, timid and leaning back while older guys take the lead.</p><p>\"I don't think I've ever seen anyone just come in and be ready to be who they are like Deuce did, \" WVU guard Jordan McCabe said. \"For him, that was to come in and be ready to compete at the highest level.\"</p><p>McBride has been proving it ever since.</p><p>Throw him up against Oklahoma State's Cade Cunningham, possibly the No. 1 pick of the 2021 NBA Draft, and McBride thrived.</p><p>In helping WVU pull off a 19-point comeback in the first meeting this season between the two schools, McBride finished with 21 points and five assists.</p><p>Huggins gave him the ball in the final seconds against Texas Tech, and McBride found a way to get the ball to go in and then ran down to the other end of the floor and forced Texas Tech's Mac McClung to take a tough shot at the buzzer that didn't go in.</p><p>\"It's tough to put into words, \" WVU guard Sean McNeil said of McBride that night. \"He just makes plays for us. It's huge to have him on the floor. He does so much more than just score. He handles the ball and makes the right reads. He's a heck of a player. Not only is he good now, he's going to continue to get better.\"</p><p>Now the Mountaineers' leading scorer at 15.5 points per game, McBride's efforts are catching on. He was named an honorable mention All-American this season.</p><p>And, as McBride concluded his Zoom interview with the media on Wednesday, he came across North Carolina head coach Roy Williams.</p><p>\"Deuce just said he ran into Roy Williams and (Williams) said, 'Hi, ' \" Huggins relayed the story.</p><p>Roy Williams tells you hello, that's a pretty good sign of where you stand.</p><p>How much more has this WVU team gone through ?</p><p>It lost it's only McDonald's All-American on the roster at mid-season when Oscar Tshiebwe transferred to Kentucky.</p><p>It lost two weeks of the regular season to the pandemic.</p><p>The defense never quite clicked. Promising freshman Isaiah Cottrell went down to a season-ending injury.</p><p>More than enough to derail any team, just not one with Deuce McBride on its roster.</p><p>Toughness, maybe it rubs off McBride and onto his teammates some.</p><p>At least that's the theory Huggins is sticking with.</p><p>\"I think if you lit any more of a fire under Deuce, you'd have a forest fire, \" Huggins said. \"Deuce doesn't need lit up. He's a guy who comes in every day and works. He's a guy who spends countless hours on his own working on his game.\"</p><p>TWEET @bigjax3211 (3) WVU vs. (14) MOREHEAD STATE WHEN: 9:50 p.m. Friday WHERE: Lucas Oil Stadium, Indianapolis TV: truTV (Comcast 259, 841HD ; DirecTV 246 ; DISH 242)</p><p>RADIO: 100.9 WZST-FM POSTGAME: dominionpost.com</p><p>___ (c)2021 The Dominion Post (Morgantown, W.Va.)

Last weekend, a fire burning in California's Sierra National Forest exploded in size, trapping hundreds of Labor Day holiday campers who could only be rescued by helicopters that made a series of white-knuckle flights into the smoke. Fire officials said they'd never seen a fire move so fast in forestland \u2014 15 miles in a day. </p><p>On Wednesday, a wildfire in Plumas National Forest northeast of San Francisco spread 25 miles in a day and devoured an estimated 400 square miles. In between those events, a massive fire in Monterey County doubled in size overnight, trapping 14 firefighters who had to deploy their emergency shelters; one was critically injured. They are only the latest examples of what a half-dozen fire experts agreed is more extreme fire behavior driven by drought and warming temperatures they attribute to climate change. Among the most concerning developments is that fast-moving wildfires leave less time for warnings or evacuations. Recently \"we have seen multiple fires expand by tens of thousands of acres in a matter of hours, and 30 years or more ago that just wasn't fire behavior that we saw,\" said Jacob Bendix, a professor of geography and the environment at Syracuse University who studies wildfires. Hotter temperatures, longer fire seasons and an estimated 140 million dead trees from a five-year drought mean that \"fires in California are moving faster and growing larger,\" said University of Utah fire expert Philip Dennison. Mike Flannigan, who directs the Western Partnership for Wildland Fire Science at Canada's University of Alberta, remembers the first report of a fire-created thunderstorm in 1986. \"They were rare events, and now they've become commonplace,\" he said. \"It's because these fires are higher intensity.\" It's not restricted to California. Doug Grafe, chief of Fire Protection at the Oregon Department of Forestry, said it was unprecedented in his state for fires this week to spread from the crest of the Cascade Mountains into the valleys below, and so quickly, \"carrying tens of miles in one period of an afternoon and not slowing down in the evening \u2014 (there is) absolutely no context for that in this environment.\" University of Colorado-Boulder professor Jennifer Balch said measurements of how quickly the hot, dry air is sucking moisture out of fuels are \"the highest seen in at least four decades\" across major parts of the West. The abundant dry tinder produces more heat energy, which in turn superheats the air so it becomes more buoyant and creates a strong updraft that condenses with the smoke plume, \"creating its own wind to feed that thunderstorm,\" Flannigan said. The cloud itself is called a pyro-cumulonimbus, which may produce lightning, and strong winds that can pick up burning embers and ignite new fires far in front of the initial blaze. An extreme example in July 2018 spun off what was then only the second documented \"firenado,\" killing a firefighter as he helped evacuate residents from a fire in the Northern California city of Redding. Yet just this month a fire north of Lake Tahoe spun off at least two and as many as four firenadoes, while the Plumas National Forest fire appears to have produced \"a handful\" overnight Tuesday, said Neil Lareau, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Nevada, Reno. \"It's really kind of a testament to the remarkable extremes that we're seeing right now,\" Lareau said. \"It really is kind of this vicious cycle that it gets into, and that's when the fire really takes off and becomes these unstoppable infernos.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHDLY-0001204202</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60TG-XXD1-DY6F-J02G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163823</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"618\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Paddock Publications, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Daily Herald</publicationName><edition>WEB EditionNC1 EditionNC2 EditionMF12 EditionNC3 EditionNM1 EditionNC EditionNC14 EditionMC1 EditionMC3 EditionMD1 EditionML2 EditionNL1 EditionNC14C EditionNC4 EditionCLFM EditioneBlast Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 11, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>Forest Lands</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTkzOTc4NEQ2MTQwNDg0Q0E0NDNFRkRDRDU1QUE0OEU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

It's great to welcome Sysco back to the CAGNY conference, a company that last year generated nearly $69 billion in sales with a market cap of nearly $40 billion. We're joined here by Kevin Hourican, President and CEO; Neil Russell, Interim CFO; and Kevin Kim, VP of Investor Relations. Three years ago, Kevin Hourican, joined Sysco and was kind enough to present here just weeks into his tenure. At that time, he shared a platform for growth for Sysco. Since then, Kevin and the team have proven just that. That platform now recognized as the Recipe for Growth has enabled Sysco to gain share and perhaps, most importantly, do so profitably. Please join me in welcoming Sysco. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kevin Hourican:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Great. Thank you, Andrew. Appreciate Andrew and the CAGNY Board having us here. It's an honor and privilege for our opportunity to be here with you again. It's nice to be back in person three years since the last time we were together, our two virtual years in a row. It just does not replace or match the opportunity for us to be able to be in a room, and we look forward to the breakout that we have directly after this. And as Andrew just said, we're really looking forward to dinner. Our culinary experts will be in that room. We've got cuisine stations from across our portfolio of products, and we look forward to having the opportunity to talk with you one-on-one this evening, if you are able to make it. So without further ado, let's go ahead and jump in.</p><p>Many of you know a lot about Sysco. But as I talk about Sysco and communicate who we are to our employees, to our investors, I start with this, which is we are a 50% a supply chain organization, and we are 50% a food sales and marketing company. We need to do both, and we need to do both extremely well to continue to lead the industry. And today, I'm going to talk with you about how we are doing exactly that, the transformation that is happening within our supply chain and the transformation that is happening within our food sales and marketing group. But let's start with some of the most basic facts. We are today the leader in this industry.</p><p>We have the most broad and capable supply chain with the most number of distribution nodes in the industry. What that means specifically is that we are the closest to our end customer, which means we can get there at the lowest net landed cost and an extremely high level of service. We have the largest sales organization on the planet from a food distribution, food away-from-home perspective, 7,500 sales rep-strong, best trained in the industry. And statistically, they have the highest Net Promoter Score by a wide margin in the industry. So robust, strong capabilities and the Recipe for Growth that Andrew just communicated a moment ago is how we're going to take those capabilities to the next level. So a little bit more about Sysco and who we are.</p><p>Again, where we are the global food service distributor. We call ourselves the backbone of the food-away-from-home industry. Some just fun stats on the chart from the overall size of the company. To the number of countries we compete within, to be crystal clear on this component, we operate within 10 countries, but we do business in 90-plus countries. And the difference between those two things is the food export business that we own called IFG, which is a nice little growth engine for our company, based in Florida but expanding its reach across the world. 71,000 colleagues, as I mentioned, 7,500 sales reps who are absolute experts in food. They are ex-chefs, they are ex-restaurant owners, they are culinary school grads, they have a tremendous passion for food.</p><p>And our delivery partners are the face of this company. They are who in our customers' place of business every week, and they create lasting relationships with our customers. Our total addressable market is more than $350 billion, and we are the industry leader, but yet we have only 17% market share. Highly fragmented market, a growing market, which I'm going to get to in a minute, and we have an opportunity to do really, really strong profit business growth in this space. I love this chart. The left-hand side is a 30-year span. The bottom line going upward is the food-away-from-home percent to total sales. The other line is the grocery store channel and it's been coming down over that same period of time.</p><p>That huge dislocation was three years ago, one month from today, when COVID hit, we were all told to go home, stay home, don't leave your homes. And obviously, you can see that had a tremendously negative impact on our business for a reasonably short period of time. The punchline here is the industry is back. We are back as a company. The industry is back. We are above where we were at the high watermark pre-COVID. And if you look at that January statistic, January was particularly strong with a really strong performance. And that's just not Omicron overlap target versus 2019, January was a very strong month. So a little bit about who we are as a company. I like this chart a lot. It shows the 10 segments of business that we operate within.</p><p>As I mentioned before, we are fully diversified. We are the backbone of the food away-from-home channel. We are number one in eight out of the 10 segments that are on this chart. And for the two that we're not number one, we have a strong position. More importantly than that, 66% of our business is restaurants, but our ability to grow profitably not just in the restaurant business but across the food away from home sector is robust and strong. Even in the sectors where we are number one, we still have enormous headroom still to go. And what I love about this chart is the diversification and the type of different business sectors that we serve from the government all the way to single mom-and-pop operated restaurants.</p><p>Many of you know us, Sysco, as a broad line distributor, a broad line range of products delivered on a tri-temperature truck, in a timely manner, filled in full. What you may not know as much is that we are the leader in what we call specialty foods. We own and operate the largest specialty produce business in the U.S. We own and operate the largest specialty center of plate business in the United States, and we have supplemented that over the last year through the acquisition of an Italian distributor platform called Greco, and I'm going to talk about that more in a minute. Sysco purchases more local, fresh produce than anyone in the industry, 10 million cases of local produce purchased from over 500 local farms and that matters.</p><p>It matters because the freshness that we're able to bring to our customers, and it matters because restaurants desire to be able to have produce that's been sourced locally on their menu. And we are working to expand our local and our fresh assortment. Another key component of our growth and our profitability is Sysco brand. So we really appreciate and admire the companies on the left-hand side of this page, household names, foundation brands in our country and across the globe. On the right-hand side, you can see the quadri of Sysco brands. And on the top, if you look $18 billion of sales, $18 billion of sales coming from Sysco Brand.</p><p>One brand alone, Sysco Classic, is over $5 billion per year. And it's more than 50% of the cases that get delivered to one of our local customers are from one of the Sysco brands that you see on the right-hand side. And as I mentioned, the Greco acquisition that I described earlier, we were able to bring to our family Bellissimo and its family of products as well as Greco and its family of products to significantly improve our Italian offering. And you'll see those brands meaningfully grow over time. The importance of this component is the Sysco brand case that gets put on that truck is meaningfully more profitable than a national brand case. And we have growth potential in Sysco brand even though we are already at 50-plus percent. I'd like to talk a little bit about national sales.</p><p>National sales is about 50% or CMU as we call it, contract bid business is about 50% of our business. It is a large and important component of what we do. The punchline is Sysco is winning meaningfully in national sales. The why deserves a little bit of a discussion. Number one is the national reach and scale, the ability to go coast to coast. Many of these customers don't want to work with multiple distributor partners. They want to have one partner. They want to have deep integration with your technology tools. So there's frictionless ordering for their operators. They want reliability of on time and in full of a broad assortment. We, Sysco, can check all of those needs.</p><p>They want fulfillment strength. They want to never be out of stock, and they don't want for their restaurants ever to have to food -- not have a product and do a substitution on their menu coast to coast. We're winning meaningfully. They also want dedicated sales reps who are knowledgeable about them specifically and what their needs are, and we're checking each of those boxes in a meaningful way. What is important is on the right-hand side of the page. We're meaningfully improving the profitability of national sales. How? Further penetrating Sysco brand, working on introducing specialty. So perhaps they were buying frozen and dry from us for a long time. Now we're deeply penetrating in produce and protein.</p><p>And those are higher margin, higher growth categories for us. And be working on each and every one of those contracts for margin optimization. We are pleased that year-to-date, we are ahead of both budget in volume and in margin rate from our contract bid business. Let's talk about our total business across the entire enterprise. As Andrew said, three years ago, we stood up on stage and talked about Sysco being the biggest in the industry and the, by far most profitable in the industry from an EBITDA as a percentage of sales perspective, but we wanted and needed to become a growth company. The best companies in the world are growth companies in the industries with which they compete within.</p><p>And this chart does all the talking that I needed to do. We are meaningfully outperforming the industry in total and have been doing so now for meaningful consecutive quarters. We are pulling away from the pack. And I'd like to talk with you about how and why. The how and why is what this chart shows, which we call internally the Recipe for Growth. Yes, it's a play on words. It's in our nod towards food, but it literally is, our recipe for how we will drive growth. It starts with our purpose, which is at the top of the page, connecting the world to share food and care for one another. Those words, carefully chosen, motivate our employees.</p><p>They motivated us to go the extra mile, to help a supplier, to help a customer, to do more than those we compete against to provide what our customers and our colleagues need to be successful. Importantly, it's a growth wheel. Each of the five elements, which I'm going to walk you through today feed each other. They work in concert with each other. And it's the aggregate of all of them working together that creates differentiation from those that we compete against, which is allowing us to win share. So I have a video I'd like to show that does a better job than I can have, explaining this through the eyes of what our customers see. You could roll the video, please.</p><p>[Video Playing]</p><p>Okay. Great. What I love about that video is it brings forth the ethos of who we are as people, what we are as a company and what we're doing to better serve our customers. From experts in food to experts in supply chain to going the extra mile by having a later in the evening order cutoff and doing what's necessary to earn every last case from every customer we serve, in aggregate, that's the Recipe for Growth. I'd like to take a quick turn through each of the five pillars, highlighting one or two things from each of them that can help you understand the full spectrum of the story that we are building at Sysco and why it's winning in the marketplace.</p><p>The first is digital. And the reason we started here is our digital tools, going back three years ago, did not meet our expectations for how we wanted to serve our customers. And we have made remarkable progress across the past three years. Our goal here is to improve the purchase experience, remove friction, make it easier for our customers to do business with Sysco, inspire them to buy more products from us and, most importantly, personalize their experience because our website is a 1:1, B2B website. It can be customized for each and every customer we serve. The e-mails they receive from us are customized to the type of cuisine they buy. The pricing they see on our website and in those promotional e-mails is unique to them, understanding the elasticity of that item for them.</p><p>As I said, we made substantial progress in digital over the past few years. The second is products and solutions. We're in the food business. Tonight, we'll be able to enjoy many of our best products. We wouldn't be who we are without having the broadest assortment in the industry. The improvements that we've made over the last year was we put tremendous effort, especially in the face of stiff inflation, to improve our partnership with our suppliers through what we call strategic sourcing, to create value to be able to pass that value on to our customers. No one in the industry that we compete within should be able to buy food at a better cost than Sysco. Second is advancing Sysco brands.</p><p>We're making meaningful progress in the penetration of Sysco brand cases. Why is it important? Retention of that customer is higher. Profitability is the case of the higher. And their trust in Sysco goes up, more Sysco products they make. One of the things I'm most proud of is the next sector down, which is the growth in cuisine segments. The purchase of Greco Foods and the expansion of that platform across the country, we have doubled our Italian share in the last 18 months, doubled our Italian share. So I'd like to go on to supply chain. This is a core strength of our company. As I mentioned, we have more distribution nodes than anyone we compete with across the globe.</p><p>We are closer to that end customer than anyone. But we're not satisfied with where we are. We are innovating our supply chain to allow us to efficiently have a late in the evening order cutoff deliver 6-plus days per week and to do so in a more flexible manner to meet our customers where they are. We recently launched our first what we call omnichannel pilot, which is to separate the front end from the back end of our supply chain. So let the customer be delivered from the closest distribution center to where that restaurant is but stock the inventory where we find it to be most optimal. So essentially, cross-stocking merge-in-transit is what we now have.</p><p>It will lower transportation costs. It will increase product availability to our customers and it will lower our networking inventory capital investment. It's a win-win-win. This is a relationships business. I hope you saw that in the video, Neil's got a great video that he's going to show that's going to bring to life even more. This is a relationships business. 7,500 salespeople strong. We are increasing the penetration of what we call specialists. So that's in produce. That's in center of plate, and that's in Italian. We are investing to grow each of those three sales force presences and then combining them with what we call the generalist who owns the accounts to do team-based selling.</p><p>And we have a team that sits above those professionals that essentially is the quarterback that allocates that talent to the right restaurant, at the right time, with the right skill set. Imagine a customer that's been buying from us from Broadline from years and has not brought producer specialty protein. Our ability to have a targeted visit with a targeted reason to buy from Sysco today is what we are doing better than ever at Sysco, and it's paying big dividends. Last but not least, on the five Recipe for Growth tours around the wheel is what we call future horizons. And it's a combination of three things. First and foremost, it's structural cost out. It's about being relentless, relentless, relentless at taking out cost to invest into growth.</p><p>Number two is tuck-in M&amp;A to help grow our ability to better serve our customers or expand into adjacent businesses or expand into white spaces from a geography perspective. We've done good work over the last few years in acquisitions, and there's plenty of great work still in front of us with Joel Grade, leading the charge, running business development for Sysco. And last but not least is sustainability. And Neil is going to talk a lot about sustainability when he comes up, so I'm not going to steal any of his thunder, but we are proud to be the first in our industry to make a science-based commitment goal to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and we're pleased and proud to be doing that work.</p><p>So this is my last slide. And as I go to wrap up, my key message here is it's only at Sysco can you expect all of these five things coming together, working in concert to create the differentiation because it is differentiation that creates a durable, sustainable competitive advantage, and that is what we are building at Sysco. We're already the largest and by far most profitable on an EBIT percent of sales. And when you combine growth orientation on top of that bedrock foundation of financial strength, we have the opportunity to pull away and gain even more share in a highly fragmented $350 billion business. We have the opportunity to continue to expand our assortment.</p><p>I mentioned our expansion into more local fresh. We talked about being right on price, using best-in-class technology to provide each customer item-specific pricing. We're talking about taking our supply chain already a robust strength for the company and increasing the number of distribution nodes we have, which Neil will talk about but more importantly meeting the customer where they are. What they've told us is they want a later in the evening order cutoff. Think about on how basic that is.If the evening was busier than they expected, and they run out of salmon, they want to know that Sysco has their back and that we're going to be there tomorrow morning to bring them fresh fish to keep their business running.</p><p>We're going to talk about that in detail as time goes on, but the best proof point of that project is what we call Sysco Your Way. And Sysco Your Way is a program that we rolled out this past year, and it is creating a step change level of customer service to our customers. Late in the evening order cut off, 6-plus day per week delivery, dedicated driver, dedicated sales partner. We are posting double-digit increases in top line and bottom line growth in the Sysco Your Way neighborhoods, and we have launched more than 300 of those neighborhoods since the pilot began a little over a year ago. The second example is a program that we have called Sysco Perks.</p><p>Sysco Perks is for a customer that is outside of a Sysco Your Way neighborhood but they have a profit profile that is rich to us. It's a VIP invitation-only loyalty program, loyalty club. We launched it in the fourth quarter of last year, and we have enrolled more than 10,000 customers in Sysco Your Way in less than 90 days. Why? Because it meets exactly the needs that they have, and we are extremely pleased with the lift that we are posting in top line and bottom line with the customers that we have enrolled.</p><p>And for every other customer that we serve it's about being right on price, having the broadest assortment, having a relationship with them and being there for them by delivering on time and in full. And we are pleased and proud of the progress that we're making that we have become a growth company. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Neil, our interim CFO, who is doing an outstanding job and my partner in helping run the company. So Neil, come on up.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Neil Russell:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Kevin. Appreciate that. To all of you listening to us on the webcast, either live or on a recorded basis, thanks for joining us. Glad to have you. And for those of you in the room, it sure is great to be back live at CAGNY here with you today. And I know if you're in the room, what you're thinking, wait, are those two speakers different heights? The answer to that is, yes. So I'm actually stalling for a minute here to give Mark and team sometime in the back to lower their camera. So are we good? Okay. Let's go ahead and dive into some financial information here. I'm going to do my presentation in two parts. Let me talk to you about the first half of the fiscal year for us.</p><p>For those of you that don't know us that well, we're a fiscal year company. So when I say first half, I'm talking about the six months that ended December. And then as Kevin said, I'll spend the second part of my presentation talking to you about sustainability and DEI at Sysco and why that is so important to our long-term future and growth. Starting with the financials and looking at the slide that's in front of you. We had a tremendous first half of the year. Sales growth was more than 15% for the first six months compared to the prior year, and volumes in the U.S. for us grew 6.3%, and local volume increased 4.3% for us. Very healthy top line, very healthy volume growth for us throughout the first half of the year that we're very proud of.</p><p>That led to gross profit dollar growth. That was very strong for us for the first six months of the year as well. Gross profit dollars grew nearly 17%, and gross margin as a percentage of sales gained 24 basis points despite relatively high inflation growing to nearly 18% or a little more than 18%. Inflation did moderate as we went through the first six months of the year, but it's still fairly high single digits for us. And we would expect that to continue to moderate just a little bit further as we work through the end of our fiscal year. We've done a very good job as a company, continuing to pass the inflation through both with the CMU type customers that Kevin talked about as well as those local independent customers.</p><p>Our teams have done a very nice job managing inflation throughout the process. That leads to very strong profit growth for us. So adjusted EBITDA grew nearly 15%, and earnings per share grew about 26% for the first six months of the year. The second quarter for us was the most profitable second quarter we've ever had in the company's history, and that's going back 53 years. So the company is performing very well, and we've had tremendous profit growth. Let's go ahead and talk a little bit about expenses and some of the drivers that are alluding to that strong profit growth. We've talked to you about three different key expenses we've had in the business, snap-back costs, which were generally cost related to the great resignation and the recruitment and staffing of the operation like we, and many other companies have faced.</p><p>I want you to think about sign-on bonuses, retention bonuses, recruitment fees, advertising fees, marketing fees to get jobs back into the business. That is what we call snap-back costs. We've also had productivity costs as part of the business because think about the large wave of new colleagues we have in the business and their relative productivity compared to the average tenure associate and what that means in terms of cost for our business. And we also have what we call transformation costs, purposeful investments into the long-term growth of the business. You can see on the chart here that, across the last couple of quarters, we've had more than $60 million decrease in those expenses. In fact, those snap-back costs that I mentioned, they're now eliminated in the business.</p><p>So we've worked through that process. The productivity costs, as you can see, are now about half of what they've used to be. So the productivity is increasing throughout the operation, and we feel very good about the trajectory there. You can see a small decrease in the transformation cost, and that's planned and purposeful as part of our trajectory. But we will always have some amount of those transformation costs because, as Kevin just walked you through that Recipe for Growth, we're going to continue to invest in the long-term health of our business, and these costs are coming down in the right trajectory that we'd like to see for the long-term health. So we're very pleased with what we see across these three specific costs. But while we're on the topic of cost, let's talk about what we call cost-out across the business.</p><p>So now I want to pivot to more of a structural cost conversation. And different from those three categories I just spoke to you of, structural costs that we've taken out of the business have now totaled more than $750 million across the business. So what kind of costs are structural costs that we've taken out? I want you to think of things like administrative staffing positions, back office type support functions where we've gotten better at automation using AI and other things to permanently take staff out of the operation and reduce our costs even lower. I want you to think about things like supply chain efficiencies that we've improved on, invested in, digital technologies that we've invested in that are driving costs lower on a permanent basis.</p><p>And we've also done things that we call regionalization across our U.S. business and across Canada, where we've taken groups of sites and put a group management team over instead of a singular management team. And that's been very successful for us. Not only it's helped us reduce cost, it's helped us improve the flow of decision-making and the accuracy in which we're handling the operation. Those are examples of things that we mean when we say structural cost-out. And we've delivered this goal earlier than planned, and the team has done a really nice job managing these costs for us. And what are we using this to do? We're using this to fund our future.</p><p>So when you hear us talk about the Recipe for Growth, the supply chain transformation, the digital technologies, things like Sysco Your Way that Kevin just described, we are funding all of that work through these type of structural cost-out, which is not only allowing for near term but long term profitable growth for us. So very pleased with the numbers that we have here, the pace in which we've done it and any guidance we provide to you, all of this is included within the guidance. We are funding our long-term growth. It's part of our guidance, and we're very pleased with the trajectory that we have here. So what does that mean in terms of profitability for the business? This is a chart that we're very proud of because we'd love to show EPS charts that have a trajectory up and to the right, and that's what you see here.</p><p>Now we offered guidance at our last earnings call just a few weeks ago, and that's what you see on the far right here is an annualized number and the guidance we gave. We gave a range for earnings per share for this fiscal year of $4 to $4.15 per share. And so let's call it the midpoint that you see here on the $4.07, and we're here today to tell you that we remain on track for that, and we feel good about the trajectory of the guidance for this year. And you can see how that compares to the prior year is obviously the dip related to COVID. But looking back over time and comparing to the prior year, 25% earnings per share growth, and that number will also represent 15% earnings per share growth compared to the all-time high that Sysco had in 2019.</p><p>So this is going to be a very strong year for Sysco, tremendous growth, not only compared to prior year, but compared to all-time high with the earnings per share. So what do we do with that earnings that we generate as a business? We have a very balanced approach to capital allocation and the priorities in which we speak to. And so let me talk about each of these, and I'll give you some examples of a couple of these as well. First and foremost, as you can tell based upon the comments Kevin and I are giving you today, we are investing in the business. We are investing in long-term growth. Think about our fleet, think about our facilities, think about the technology that's needed to continue to advance the business and growing over time. That is the first priority for us.</p><p>And included in investing in the business are things like what we call the smaller tuck-in acquisitions. And as commented, in our industry, we have a full pipeline of good opportunities. Kevin mentioned Joel Grade, who's running that part of the business for us. He's doing a fantastic job with different types of specialty companies, smaller Broadline companies, different geographies that make sense for us. So investing in the fleet, the facilities, the technology and the smaller tuck-in type acquisitions is the first priority to grow the business for the long term. Second is to maintain that strong balance sheet. We have a targeted leverage ratio range net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.5 to 2.75 times. And we ended in that second quarter at right at three times.</p><p>So we've taken debt down meaningfully over the last couple of years and are very much on a path and trajectory to fall within what we feel is that very appropriate and good range for our balance sheet. And speaking of debt, and on that debt side, we have a lot of confidence and feel very good about where we are because 95% of our debt is of that fixed nature. So even though we're reducing debt and reducing that risk on the balance sheet and bringing that down to this really good range, what debt we do have is of the fixed rate variety, so we feel good about that.</p><p>Third, and importantly, is our ability to return value to shareholders. And as we think about this, we think about it really in two forms, the dividend, which I'll speak of and also share repurchases, which, as you know, for this year, we committed to up to $500 million worth of share repurchases for this fiscal year, and I'm proud to announce today that we're actually active back in the market, working our way towards that goal. So we're actively buying back our shares as I speak to you right now.</p><p>Looking at that first priority of investing in the business, also glad to announce today that we actually have seven new buildings underway for us to expand Sysco. And that's across the business segments and portfolio that we have that you can see on the bottom of the slide. Those are Broadline facilities. Those are SYGMA facilities. It's Greco facilities, some of our specialty meat companies and even our business in Sweden. And then, of course, because of that, you can see it's across geographies. Across the United States, we have different locations where you see those Sysco labels. And Sweden and then Ireland, all new buildings going into place for us as we speak.</p><p>And in addition; to the seven new buildings, we also have expansion underway in several other facilities. This is growth that's concentrated really in high potential markets and cuisine segments that we feel very good about. We've analyzed specifically where to put these new buildings, and they're going to help us reduce costs. We're going to reduce our cost to serve. We're going to reduce our stretch miles, and we're going to get better at how we're operating. And so we're bringing down costs, we're bringing up the opportunity to serve our customers more with these types of expansions. But we're prioritizing these investments. This doesn't particularly mean a large increase in capital spending. We're falling within the ratios that we've set and that we've guided you towards over time.</p><p>So this is not incremental increase. It's prioritization of the choices for the right long-term growth for Sysco. As we think about that return to shareholders, and as I said, it's a balance between the dividend and the share repurchases, you can see another nice up and to the right chart here with over time, the amount of value that we've returned to shareholders. So over the last nine years, over $14 billion returned to shareholders through both of those forms of share repurchases and dividends. We remain committed to the share repurchases I've said, and the dividend is a priority not only to pay, but to increase over time with the Board. Speaking of dividends, Sysco is a member of the Dividend Aristocrats, and that's a pretty exclusive club.</p><p>To be a member of this club, you have to increase your dividend for 25 consecutive years. Now Sysco has actually more than doubled that. We've been increasing our dividend for 53 years. And to increase your dividend more than 50 years, there's only eight consumer stocks that can say that. And there's only another four that are actually here at CAGNY this week. So very proud of our commitment to return value to our shareholders through the dividend and its increase, and we're proud to be a member of the Dividend Aristocrats. The commonality across these companies is you need to have a very resilient business model, which is what we have.</p><p>And you also need to be able to generate a lot of cash in order to make that type of commitment, and we also have that. So it's a fantastic opportunity for Sysco to have such a strong, resilient business model that generates as much cash as we do and to be able to share that return with you along the way and to have the commitment to continued increases as we do that. Why is that important? I'm sure, as you know, if you were to look at the grouping of companies that are the Dividend Aristocrats and compare that to the performance of the overall market, the Dividend Aristocrats performed more than 700 basis points better than the overall market in just the last year alone.</p><p>So again, a very exclusive club to be part of and something that we're very, very proud of. Now let me pause for a minute here and change gears and talk about sustainability. And why do we spend so much time talking about sustainability at Sysco? Well simply put, and I could just stop after saying the following sentence, it's the right thing to do. But we take that further. It actually is obviously very important to all of us and important to where we go from here because we know that environmental, social and governance issues are important to the long-term health of your company and the ability to continue to grow. So not only is it the right thing to do, it's good for business. That's why we're committed to it, and that's why we spend so much time on it.</p><p>Now like Kevin did, for me, there's going to be a video that I'm going to show you that, that can do a better job describing how this plays out in our business than I can. So let me set this up for you a little bit. I want to introduce you to Marty. Marty is a sales consultant of Sysco. She works up in Oregon. And she's so good at supporting her customers that one of her customer locations, the owners wrote her a letter to thank her for their support. And I want to introduce you to Dimple and Sumesh, immigrants who had a dream to come to America, open a restaurant and live their dream of sharing their food and their passion for cooking with others. No sooner did they open their restaurants, then the next day in Oregon, a forest fire ravaged the town. All around them was destruction. You can stand on the front porch of their restaurant called Gather and see nothing but destruction.</p><p>But somehow, some way, their facility survived. And they relied on Marty to help them figure out where do they go from here, what tools does Sysco have? What product does Sysco have? How can we help them in such a time of stress that they never would have imagined would be part of their portfolio and how can they help their community? That's why that purpose that Kevin spoke of is so, so important to us. We are going to drive the business. I'll take you back to the line chart that Kevin showed you and showed Sysco growing at a certain pace and a gap to the market. We're going to continue to do that. We're going to continue to outpace the market with our growth, but we're going to do it the right way, thinking about the long-term health of the enterprise and the future generations that are going to follow us, and I think this video does a nice job showing that to you.</p><p>Mark, let's queue the video.</p><p>[Video Playing]</p><p>We never imagined a company as big as Sysco could treat us like the family we've become. That's why we do that work the way we do. So as we think about sustainability, there are three primary pillars we think about and categorize the work: People; Products; and Planet. And we have categories of work within each of those pillars, and there's a lot of details within it. This work is important to our customers, of course, as you just saw. It's important to our colleagues. There's not an interview I have with someone joining the organization that doesn't say to me, I read your sustainability report, and I have a question about this. It's important to our communities, of course, and it's important to our planet.</p><p>If we want to continue to source the produce that we're sourcing, there is no Planet B. There's no other choice. We have to do this work And at Sysco, there's one table, and everyone has a seat at Sysco's table, which is why I'm proud to announce today our new sustainability platform and our north star of how we think about our work going forward for the next generations to follow us, and that's one planet, one table. And that's a north star in which how we're going to think and make decisions going forward. Sysco sits in the middle of the supply chain. And so transitioning a bit to the importance of the business aspect of this work, we have customers who have set their own goals to make progress in this area.</p><p>They need a distributor partner, a supplier who has also signed up for those goals and can help them advance their own business. We have supplier partners that have set their own goals and want to grow. They need to grow with a customer who is also set their own goals to help them. And that's how it's going to work across the supply chain. You're either in or you're out. And the long-term growth is if you're in. And that's a tremendous opportunity. And we're happy to take that leadership position. For others that will follow in our footsteps, we're glad to have them join us on the journey to make everything better for all of us.</p><p>A few examples of some of the work that we've done. We've partnered with Cargill on some fantastic work in the Southern Grasslands in the United States and 10 ranchers who are moving their herds around and actually reducing greenhouse gas emissions with the work that they're doing relative to that. We have solar facilities going in place across our enterprise. There is one on the example screen here in the GB for us, and we have Canada and United States facilities underway. And think of the really cool future for us where our electric trucks, which we have an LOI for more than 800 of them out there right now, to be charged by solar on our roofs.</p><p>And really cool at dinner tonight in addition to the awesome food you're going to have and the fantastic chefs and the interaction you're going to have, that electric truck is here with us tonight, and it's parked outside, and you're going to get a chance to see it. And so we're excited to be able to share that with you. What I'm most proud of is what's on the far right, and that's how we set our goals. You can see it by 2030. We could have chosen 2050. We could have chosen 2040, but we chose 2030 because it's going to be this management team that's going to make it happen. It's not a hope and wish. And it's not a problem for the next management team to solve for. It's this team that's going to get it done.</p><p>DEI is also extremely important to us. We want a workplace where our differences are valued and celebrated, and we're creating that inclusive culture. Our customers need to see themselves in our products, in our colleagues and in the way in which we operate. Again, everyone has a seat at our table, and we're holding ourselves accountable to this. We're setting goals and we're publishing updates against that. We published our first ever DEI report. It's available on the website, and I encourage you to go see it. One small example is we had a gender and diversity goal set for 2025, and we've already achieved that goal. So now we're hard at work, setting what the next goal is going to be for us because, we need to make continuous progress in this area.</p><p>And speaking of diverse, I just want to spend a quick minute on our Board of Directors. This is a diverse, independent and experienced Board. The last three Directors we've added have added strong capabilities in each of these areas to us that are highlighted in blue on the chart. We have a 10-year policy for our Board, which is rare for public companies. And so our Board is relatively refreshed. Think about restaurant experience, consumer experience, retail experience, technology experience. We've got all of that on this fantastic board. It's a unique set of experiences and capabilities, and they give the management team challenges, good questions and full support, which is the way how it should be with a great Board of Directors.</p><p>So let me leave you with this. As we think about our investment thesis and going forward, we have tremendous growth opportunities across both the top and bottom line. We are a stronger company today than when we were here three years ago. Our Recipe for Growth transformation is working, as evidenced by the share gains we have relative to the rest of the industry. We are very much focused on the long-term growth opportunities across the business, and we're committed to returning that value to you with those strong shareholder returns that I mentioned. We've got a couple of minutes for questions.</p><p>So I'm going to turn it over to Kevin Kim to lead us through that.</p><h>Questions And Answers</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kevin Kim:</emphasis></p><p>Great. Let's go with the first question over here. Lauren? Let's wait for the mic.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, guys. So you've gained a lot of market share over the last couple of years in an environment that's been relatively favorable for Sysco given your size and scale. You're looking to accelerate that market share now that the supply chain is normalizing broadly. Can you just talk about your confidence in being able to accelerate that market share given a relatively less favorable environment? Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kevin Hourican:</emphasis></p><p>Great. Lauren, thank you for the question. I think I'll start with the Recipe for Growth is cumulative building platform. We stated a couple of years ago what our goals were. We said we'd grow last year at 1.2 times the industry. We posted a 1.3. We said this year, we'd grow at 1.35 times the industry. We're on track to be able to do that. And we actually said next year, in the third year of the three-year plan, we would grow at 1.5, and we're committed and confident in our ability to do that. And the why, Lauren, the Recipe for Growth is still in the very early innings. People ask me all the time in a baseball game like what inning are you in. Kind of calibrated this morning, probably the third-ish, omnichannel hasn't even been rolled out nationwide. Sysco Your Way, kicking in. We just launched it in Dublin.</p><p>We launched it in Toronto. We're about to launch it soon in Paris. We're about to launch it soon in Stockholm. Sysco Perks just rolled out in November. The good news here specifically to the future growth. Each of these initiatives has been piloted. They've been tested, and we can see the very specific empirical outcomes. So these are not hypothesis-based projects. They are specific projects with proof points backed by data. And we're in rollout mode right now. So yes, our strength of supply chain over the past 18 months has contributed to market share gains. The Recipe for Growth is what's going to create the share gains into the future years, and we're confident in our ability to hit our targets. Thank you for asking.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kevin Kim:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Let's go with one more question over there, Jeff.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>Great. Thank you very much. Just Kevin, because you were here three years ago and it was your pretty much first intro. Obviously, it's been an interesting three years. I'm just wondering if you could maybe briefly compare and contrast your outlook for the business today versus three years ago. And what do you think is the greatest hurdle you're going to face over the next 12 months to 18 months in terms of the greatest headwind? Obviously, you faced plenty of headwinds over the past three, what are you anticipating the biggest headwinds for the next 12?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kevin Hourican:</emphasis></p><p>Jeff, thanks for the question. Maybe I'll start, I'll toss to Neil to see if he has things to add. I said on stage here three years ago, why I joined the company, and that was my excitement to be in this industry. Food is a great space to be in. Supply chain is my passion and my work and in my career. And we are a growth company and a very large business with \"only 17% share\". Three years later, Jeff, I'm even more excited than the day I arrived. There is so much growth potential. We haven't talked a lot today about international. International is contributing meaningfully to us this year on a year-over-year profit growth and year-over-year sales growth perspective. Our ability to profitably grow internationally is significant bolt-on acquisitions. Growth opportunity is significant.</p><p>The work we've done with the Italian platform that we've doubled our market share in the past 18 months, and we're not even close to complete with that work yet. Largest, most profitable in our space with meaningful growth prospects and opportunities, and we're not even close to done, aka inning three. And by the way, halfway through the game, we're going to come up with additional new growth ideas for the company. So I'm even more confident than I was when I joined. It's a great company with great people, tremendous passion for our customers. Neil, I'll toss to you for additional comments.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Neil Russell:</emphasis></p><p>Yes. Thanks, Kevin. So Jeff and actually, Lauren, I'll build on your question two, three things real quick. One is that growth versus market. So when you hear us talk about that, Lauren, I heard your question about the macro. So it's relative to the market, right? So whatever you're going to see the market doing, our growth is going to exceed that. So the market's up, we'll be up even more, et cetera. So that growth versus the market is something that is important for us to measure and a key goal for us that, again, as Kevin said, we're on track for it. Point two is that cost-out program that I mentioned. We've got work to do, so there's more to come in terms of our ability to take even additional costs out, and we feel good about the work that we're doing to identify those incremental opportunities.</p><p>But as I said, that's helping to fund all of this work that we're doing. So we'll have a source of funding to be able to make those investments to advance the business going forward. And then thirdly and importantly, our international business is performing really well. And I think that's part of the equation here to think of International has had tremendous year-over-year profit growth, and we're seeing the turn there with that performance. We're very pleased with where international is going for us.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>I think we'll wrap it up there. Please join me one more time in thanking Sysco for they're sponsoring the dinner tonight and continued support in the conference.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALPANT-3dbcc7ccabd05ff4bcb55a86acf90d3e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALPANT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GTK-K4C3-RS2G-J0K3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">494744</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8102\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023AlphaStreet Inc., All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Alphastreet, Inc. - Earnings and Conference Call Transcripts</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"65767\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"02\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>February 21, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC0001ZN0</classCode><className>SYSCO CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS722310 FOOD SERVICE CONTRACTORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS424420 PACKAGED FROZEN FOOD MERCHANT WHOLESALERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS424130 INDUSTRIAL &amp;

A remote sensing software is a software solution or platform which processes the remote sensing data. These software are similar to graphics software which enables generation of geographic information from airborne, ground based, and satellite sensor data. The data provided by remote sensing software is used in different fields, including coastal applications, hazard assessment, ocean applications, and natural resource management. It can also be used to survey large &amp; inaccessible areas with an easy collection of data over a variety of resolutions and scales. These software can also make it easier to locate natural disasters such as forest fire or floods that has spread over a large region to enable rescue mission plan faster.</p><p>Increase in advancements in the remote sensing technologies, The rise in need of remote sensing data in various defense &amp; business applications, and growing adoption of geographic information system (GIS) applications for environmental risk management are the major factors that drives the growth of the remote sensing software market. Also, increasing investments in satellite communication and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) payloads across the various countries further drives market growth.</p><p>Furthermore, COVID-19 pandemic is disrupted the lives of people and leading to the use of satellite monitoring to curb the spread of the disease. This has led to rapid surge in adoption of remote sensing software to understand the spread pattern and intensity of the outbreaks to implement surveillance, preventive, and control measures. However, higher initial investment along with the lack of comprehensive government regulations or policies regarding remote sensing data may hinder the market growth to some extent. On the contrary, emergence of technologies such as cloud computing, big data analytics, and internet of things (IoT) are providing numerous opportunities for the growth of the market due to their popularity.</p><p>The remote sensing software market is segmented on the basis of component, deployment model, software type, application, end user, and region. On the basis of component, it is categorized into software and services. On the basis of deployment model, it is classified into on-premise and cloud. By type, it is bifurcated into web-based and mobile. On the basis of application, it is categorized into ground, airborne, and satellite. Depending on end user, it is divided into defense (defense organizations and homeland security agencies), and commercial (energy &amp; power, agriculture, healthcare, scientific research, weather forecasting, and other). Region wise, it is analyzed across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and LAMEA.</p><p>Key Benefits</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>This study includes the remote sensing software market analysis, trends, and future estimations to determine the imminent investment pockets.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The report presents information related to key drivers, restraints, and opportunities of the market.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The remote sensing software market size is quantitatively analyzed from 2019 to 2027 to highlight the financial competency of the industry.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Porter's five forces analysis illustrates the potency of buyers &amp;

Flames moved beyond the Government Flat and Mendocino Pass areas east of the Black Butte River.</p><p>Firefighters worked to protect many threatened homes Tuesday and winds were expected to continue through Wednesday, additional resources will be positioned to provide more structure protection across the complex.</p><p>The increased fire activity locally and statewide forced the closure of all 18 national forests in California.</p><p>Eight forests were closed Monday and on Wednesday, the service announced the closure of the other 10: Mendocino National Forest, Eldorado National Forest, Klamath National Forest, Lassen National Forest, Modoc National Forest, Six Rivers National Forest, Plumas National Forest, Shasta-Trinity National Forest, Tahoe National Forest and Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit.</p><p>\"Explosive growth of fires throughout California during the day and late evening of Sept. 8 led to this updated decision,\" the Forest Service said in a statement.</p><p>The closures will be reevaluated daily as conditions change.</p><p>North of Willits, Highway 101 remains closed from just north of State Street to the junction with Highway 162.</p><p>The Oak fire, which started Monday afternoon five miles north of Willits grew to 700 acres by nightfall. Local and Cal Fire firefighters slow its progress to 863 acres on Tuesday.</p><p>By Wednesday afternoon, it had spread to 1,125 acres and remained at 10% containment, said Mendocino County Emergency Services Coordinator Brentt Blaser.</p><p>Sheriff's Capt. Greg Van Patten said 4,345 people have been evacuated and 2,275 are under warnings to leave if the Oak fire worsens.</p><p>Most of the evacuations affect the township of Brooktrails, which appears to be in less danger than expected early in the fire's progress.</p><p>\"Brooktrails is far less than threatened than we initially anticipated it would be,\" Blaser said. \"They're not out of the woods, but we are far more confident about it and we are looking at repopulating.\"</p><p>The August Complex was initially 37 different fires in the Mendocino National Forest that started on Aug. 17. Many have been contained or have merged. The Hopkins fire, at more than 49,000 acres, was recently added and is about 25 miles northeast of Covelo.</p><p>Evacuation orders were in effect for portions of the following counties: Mendocino, Lake, Humboldt, Trinity and Glenn counties.</p><p>Residents should contact their county sheriffs' offices for more information.</p><p>Mendocino County has sheltering options in the Covelo area at Covelo High School at 76280 High School Street and the Covelo Rodeo Grounds for small/large animals/livestock, 77286 Covelo Road.</p><p>For help sheltering animals, contact 707-272-2299.</p><p>You can reach Staff Writer Lori A.

Last year was among his most profitable years ever, and this year is already shaping up to match that success.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><br/>That's despite the fact that Crockett, along with contractors and DIY home renovators nationwide, has had to contend with the price of lumber and other materials skyrocketing over the past year, as well as scarcity of many products.</p><p><br/>\"Everybody is scrambling to get what they need from this store and that supplier,\" Crockett said. \"In the past, it would take a week or two to get some supplies. Now it can take up to six weeks. And it costs twice as much. We've had some folks downsize their projects simply because the price was astronomical. It has definitely made things very different for us.\"</p><p><br/>Lumber prices specifically are through the roof. In February, prices reached an all-time high at just over $1,000 per 1,000 square board feet -- which is double the price from November 2020. Other commodities, such as sheetrock, plywood, steel and roofing are also at a premium, and can sometimes be in short supply as demand remains unusually high.</p><p><br/>The squeeze is felt by both large-scale construction and small home projects. In Maine, projects ranging from a major upgrade to a Piscataquis County ski resort to the installation of a new footbridge in downtown Bangor have all met with delays or budget increases due to rising costs and supply issues.</p><p><br/>For the average homeowner, it can mean the difference between getting what you want, and either downsizing or rethinking what you can afford. That 16-foot new back deck might end up being a 12-foot deck -- or, you might choose to forgo using lumber altogether, and go with a composite material, something that's normally much more expensive than lumber, but is now at a very competitive price, according to Crockett.</p><p><br/>Viking Lumber president David Flanagan said that the array of factors contributing to the across-the-board inflated commodity prices is something he and his colleagues have never seen before.</p><p><br/>\"It was kind of a perfect storm of factors,\" said Flanagan, who with his family runs 11 lumber and building supply yards across midcoast and eastern Maine.</p><p><br/>First, sawmills and other production facilities had to shut down temporarily when COVID-19 hit, causing a sudden dropoff in production. Then, hurricane season in August and September caused prices on the yellow pine harvested in the southern U.S. to jump, a relatively common phenomenon around that time of year, depending on hurricane severity.</p><p><br/>That was followed by one of the worst forest fire seasons on record out west, with the Pacific Northwest -- home to the country's most productive timberlands and lumber mills -- especially affected.</p><p><br/>And finally, throughout the pandemic, many people were at some point confined to their homes, with very little on which to spend their discretionary income. Inevitably, some decided that they wanted new kitchen cabinets, or a new deck or patio.</p><p><br/>\"When you're sitting at home, you start to see things you want to fix around the house,\" Flanagan said. \"Our do-it-yourself marketplace has really exploded. We are a semi-pro lumber yard, but almost overnight, we ended up becoming a retail, Home Depot-style yard. We've had many, many, many more small sales, and not so many large sales. It was a big change.\"</p><p><br/>Flanagan said the pandemic-related real estate boom in Maine has also contributed to a banner year for his company, regardless of how much more materials cost at this time.</p><p><br/>\"We've had folks that have bought houses in Maine sight unseen, and then when they get up here, they see something in the house that they don't want, and they start renovating,\" he said. \"The demand for everything is just much higher, across the board.\"</p><p><br/>Though high prices may change how big some projects are for homebuyers of varying income levels, Crockett said his company, Your Space Home Improvement, is nevertheless busier than it's ever been.</p><p><br/>\"We are already booked right straight out through most of the summer, which is weeks earlier than we'd normally be all booked,\" Crockett said. \"I hear the same sort of things from a lot of other contractors. It's a crazy time.\"</p><p><br/>While there's no immediate end to the high prices, Flanagan thinks that as the year goes on, things might change.</p><p><br/>\"I think this inflationary trend will start to even out, and we'll see a better balance between supply and demand, especially now that we're seeing the pandemic get a little better,\" Flanagan said. \"But a lot of that is going to depend upon Mother Nature, and whether or not we'll see awful fires and hurricanes like we did last year. 2020 has been a wild ride.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGRDLY-28019507</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGRDLY2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:627K-13B1-JBRS-Y102-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144564</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-03-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"791\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Bangor Daily News</copyright><publicationName>Bangor Daily News (Maine)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"03\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>March 17, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008WWM</classCode><className>CONSTRUCTION COSTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DIJW</classCode><className>PRICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A2YF</classCode><className>FREELANCE EMPLOYMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CYBY</classCode><className>HOME IMPROVEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001973</classCode><className>COMMODITIES MARKETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DEIL</classCode><className>COMMODITIES PRICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000CYBZ</classCode><className>DO IT YOURSELF HOME IMPROVEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001050</classCode><className>LUMBER &amp;

My name is Anupam Rama. I'm one of the senior analysts here at JPMorgan. I'm joined by my team, Malcolm Kono, and Priyanka Grover. Our next presenting company is Apellis. And presenting on behalf of the company, we have CEO, Cedric Francois. Cedric?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CEDRIC FRANCOIS, CO-FOUNDER, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, APELLIS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.: Thank you very much. thank you for inviting us. So good to do this in person again. So in the next 20 minutes, I'm going to take you through the story around that pennies what we have been doing in the recent past and what we have to look forward to in the next year.</p><p>These are our forward-looking statements. You can also find our SEC filings online. So we have a lot to look forward to. The next month, we have our PDUFA and geographic atrophy on February 26 and with the opportunity to deliver the first ever treatment for geographic atrophy, one of the leading causes of blindness in the world. We also have EMPAVELI that is currently in about 1.5 years of sales, has set a great launch trajectory and is turning out to be a truly game-changing solution for patients with PNH as it relates to their condition, their anemia and their quality of life.</p><p>We also continue to focus on complement factor C3 and all that it can do across a wide range of therapeutic areas with 12 clinical and preclinical programs. So 2022 was a transformational year for us. Of course, in geographic atrophy, we had our filings in the U.S. as well as in Europe. We had the commercial preparations to complete. We are ready to launch this drug in geographic atrophy in the U.S. and have also worked in Europe. And importantly, we recently announced that Dr. Caroline Baumal is going to become our Chief Medical Officer. So Caroline Baumal is a world-famous retina specialist.</p><p>And the way in which this happened is about a year ago, Dr. Federico Grossi and I, who cofounded this company with Pascal about 20 years ago. We decided that we wanted to have a retina doctor to help us launch this drug because it's such a specific field and to have the power of our presence was deemed to be very important. We decided to do it now so that we have some time until the real approval date to get all of the preparations in place. Fede is going to help us with this. And this is a great moment to thank him for the amazing job that he has done. This weekend, we're going to go to Hawaii altogether, Caroline, Fede and myself to talk about geographic atrophy and what we can do with this product in this disease.</p><p>When talking about EMPAVELI last year, we continued our launch trajectory with $65 million in U.S. net product sales. We submitted 2 supplemental NDAs and completed more than 800 patient years of system dosing. In the meanwhile, in the pipeline, we continue to progress our late-stage clinical studies with Sobi, our early-stage pipeline and completed the enrollment in the Phase II ALS study.</p><p>So now 2023. So this is going to be an amazing year for us. First of all, we are planning to deliver the first ever treatment for patients with GA in the U.S. to prepare for our ex U.S. approvals as well to continue to maximize the value of EMPAVELI and to advance our early pipeline and the beam collaboration. So what is geographic atrophy. So to understand this disease, I want you to think of the retina and of having a forest fire in the retina where in a relentless process, you lose more and more photoreceptor cells. This process has no treatment available. And once you have it, your path is towards inevitably blindness if you live long enough. This is a disease in which many, many drugs have been tried and where we finally have discovered a pathway where something is possible to control the progression of this disease.</p><p>And we did this with intravitreal pegcetacoplan. So here is pegcetacoplan positioned to be that first ever treatment, and there are 3 seminal features of this drug product that I want you to bear in mind. The first one, and I'm opinion may be the most important one, is that we have increasing treatment effect over time. The longer these patients are on treatment with intravitreal pegcetacoplan, the more the slowdown of this degenerative process becomes. We've evaluated that over 24 months in DERBY and OAKS, and it looks like an immunotherapeutic process that we will continue to evaluate in the GALE extension study.</p><p>Importantly, we saw these increasing effects across 2 dose regimens. We have a dose regimen where patients receive treatment every 2 months, but we also have the ability to treat patients monthly if the physicians choose to do so. It is hard to overemphasize the importance of every other month treatment because it provides a benefit to patients and physicians of much more convenience with a benefit in terms of treatment effects that is pretty close to what you get with monthly treatment. In the meantime also, especially towards the end of that 24-month period, the convergence between the effects on the foveal as well as the extra foveal lesions is fascinating to see from 18 to 24, the effect is more or less the same.</p><p>And these are the famous DERBY and OAKS studies. So what's extraordinary about these 2 studies is that at 24 months, they look remarkably similar. And the consistency for both dosing regimens is truly remarkable. What also stands out here again is that increased effect that we see over time. And if you quantify that, in 6 months segments, so 0 to 6, 6 to 12, 12 to 18 at 18 to 24, you can see how in every 6-month segments, the effect on slowing down the lesion progression becomes more pronounced. Importantly as well is when you then look at how is the fire.</p><p>What is the intensity of the fire in that segment from month 18 to 24 , while the slowdown there has become truly clinically meaningful. And we see that for both subfoveal as well as nonsubfoveal or extra foveal lesions. We see that for monthly as well as for every other monthly lesions. And these effect sizes in the range of approximately 30%. These 2 Phase III clinical trials are the only ones who have shown such a slowdown in the progression of GA for both extrafoveal as well as foveal lesions. And you should expect that, that treatment effect continues beyond year 2 in patients with GA who may be on treatment for 10 years, maybe 20 years or longer. We also had a favorable safety profile that we evaluated in a very large database of patients.</p><p>1,200 patients and nearly 12,000 injections were evaluated in these 2 clinical trials. And what we found is that we have a safety profile that is best and most easily understood as that associated with an intravitreal injection, something we know very well from the anti-VEGF world. We also have a slowly increased rate of or slightly increased rate of exudations in these patients. That is something that can be controlled with anti-VEGF injections and that we continue to follow closely. So we are now ready to launch in this very important disease, which because of its prevalence also represents, of course, a meaningful commercial opportunity for us. When we run a global survey with physicians with retina doctors, we found that more than 90% of retina doctors worldwide plan to use pegcetacoplan in their patients with GA.</p><p>And we have built in the past year a best-in-class team, a highly experienced in retina across all of these elements that are important in a successful launch. We currently have approximately 100 field-based employees out there doing the work. More than 90% of those come from companies that have profound retina and ophthalmology experience, and these employees joined us because of what they have seen in the data package and the faith that they have in making a real difference in this disease. In the meantime, the prelaunch activities are well underway. In med affairs, we have been working for a long time throughout 2022 on our presentations, on raising awareness on teaching physicians, retina docs as well as patients, what it means to be on treatment with a product like pegcetacoplan.</p><p>And on the commercial side, in September 2022, we really started amplifying our efforts. The one thing I want you to remember from the commercial efforts is that we have extraordinary access to the retinal practice. Retina docs want to see us and want to learn about this product. That is not very hard to understand when you imagine a patient that is on a path to blindness that they have to see multiple times per day and for which currently nothing is available. So where do we stand? So we are positioned to be the first ever treatment for geographic atrophy as early as next month with the compelling product profile to address an unmet need globally, with more than 90% of surveyed retina specialists worldwide planning to use this product in their patients and the best-in-class field-based team deployed and ready for launch.</p><p>So moving on now to EMPAVEDI, our first approved product and now on the market for approximately 1.5 years. We've had a successful EMPAVEDI launch where it has been incredibly gratifying to see how this product elevates the standard of care in PNH. Many years ago, when we were doing our development, there was always the question as to what is the role of extravascular hemolysis in this disease, is it safe to control this disease with C3? What is the difference that this is going to make? Well, the difference is absolutely extraordinary. And if there's 1 number that I would like you to pay attention to on this chart, it is the fifth bullet point -- we have 98% real-world patient compliance. Now it's hard to reach these patients.</p><p>Many of these patients, unfortunately, get a little bit forgotten. They are on C5 inhibitors. They are hard to find, they need to be made aware that this is available to them. But once these patients are on treatment and discover what it does for them, the retention rate is absolutely extraordinary. And again, a testament to how much of a difference this product can make. We then also have those 2 supplemental NDAs, what will they do? The first one has a PDUFA on February 8 next month. And this gives us the ability to promote on the basis of treatment-naive data as well, data that we have established in the so-called PRINCE study and the 48-week PEGASUS results.</p><p>We then also have the EMPAVEDI injector that is going to come on the market at the end of March, our PDUFA is March 15. This was through collaboration with enabled injections, and it allows these patients who self-administer this product twice per week at home to do this in what we call a needle less experience.</p><p>So these patients have no longer to manipulate any needles in order to self-administer this which will significantly improve the patient experience and the administration. Here, too, we have a strong safety profile. We have over 800 patient years of systemic pegcetacoplan exposure. And on this slide, the second bullet is the most surprising one. We have 0 reported cases of meningococcal infection. With C5 inhibitors at this point in time, you should have expected to see a couple of these meningococcal infections to show up already because it's considered to be a class effect, but the way in which pegcetacoplan works, at least for now, seems to have an advantage in that regard as well.</p><p>We are then expanding on potential new indications. In the middle of this year, we are going to have the readout on our ALS trial -- we are enrolling very quickly in our Valeant Phase III clinical trial in IC-MPGN-NC3G. And our partner, Sobi, is enrolling in the cholelutini disease trial as well as in the Phase II trial in hematopoietic stem cell associated thrombotic microangiopathy. to have the readout on our ALS trial. We are enrolling very quickly in our Valeant Phase III clinical trial in ICMPGNandC3G. And our partner, Sobi, is enrolling in the cholelutini disease trial as well as in the Phase II trial in hematopoietic stem cell associated thrombotic microangiopathy, where in the second half of this year, we will have the first data. Then last but not least, our early pipeline, which in this year is going to move in meaningful ways into the clinic and, of course, our beam collaboration. First of all, our molecule APL-2006, which we also call the ranifitin molecules. This is a molecule that we developed by considering what happens with patients who are on treatment with anti-VEGF -- if you have wet macular degeneration and you are being treated with an anti-VEGF product,</p><p>Your chances of developing geographic atrophy within a 7 month -- a 7-year time frame are 98%. So it's virtually inevitable. So what we decided to do was create a molecule that would both control VEGF, could be injected what we believe is going to be an every 3-month procedure and, at the same time, control C3 so that we can hopefully avoid the development of geographic atrophy and have a next-generation anti-VEGF molecule available to us. Then we have our next-generation C3 SiRNA program.</p><p>This is a program to lower the levels of C3 in the body, so that the twice a week subcutaneous administration that is currently needed with EMPAVELI can be reduced to something more convenient for patients. In preclinical settings, we silence C3 expression by more than 90%. And this drug product is planned to go into the clinic in the first half of this year. And last but not least, APL-1030. So this is a molecule that allows us via an intrathecal injection to for the first time, control C3 in the brain. This is a very exciting because we think of the of the , I should say, as a window into the brain.</p><p>When you look at the mechanisms behind complement and the reasons why we believe pegcetacoplan in the eye can slow down the progression of geographic atrophy, it shares so many commonalities with many neurodegenerative conditions and some neurological diseases as well. In the meantime, we also, as you know, in Derby and Oaks have seen this increasing effects over time, which gives us hope that there is something of an immunotherapy effect that we may be able to explore in these central nervous system conditions as well. This is another product that's moving forward very nicely and where we intend to be the first ones to explore this in the CNS space.</p><p>And then we also have our beam collaboration as far as we know, the only gene editing program in C3 or in complement, I should say, 6 research programs in total on which you will hear much more in the future. as well. And this is what our pipeline looks like. So really exciting to explore this unique target complement factor C3 across such a wide range of therapeutic areas and indications in the space of rare diseases, ophthalmology, neurology and certain others outside of that as well. So this is an extraordinary year for us -- We look forward to sharing our data with you in the months to come. Of course, next month, the PDUFA date and the launch in geographic atrophy shortly thereafter, but then also to continue to see what we do with EMPAVELI and the advancement of our early pipeline. Thank you.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>ANUPAM RAMA: Thank you, Cedric. Lots of practice there. You got done 5 minutes early. (Operator Instructions) Cedric, on the PDUFA date forthcoming, just wondering how soon after approval, could you launch, you said shortly thereafter? Is there a time frame which you're targeting?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Yes, we're not going to be more specific than that, but we are -- we will be ready to ship. We will -- Adam has done a crazy good job of getting everybody ready. So it will not be very long after the approval we would be able to launch this product.</p><p>ANUPAM RAMA: One of the controversies that we talked about in the back half of the year was the 24-month data being included in the product label and having that major amendment. Can you walk us through what the 24-month data do if they are fully included in the label versus the 18-month data?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Yes. So I hope, of course, the reason why we did it we hope that it will be available in the label, and that's the label that we submitted to the FDA. The 1 feature of the 24-month data that is not very obvious at 18 months is the consistency between these 2 clinical trials. So even at 18 months, Derby does not look as good as Oaks and for our sales force to go out and talk about that with retina docs, we felt that it would take too much time explaining as to why these 2 trials are not exactly the same. And as you've all seen at 24 months, that is clearly there.</p><p>The second aspect that is really important to us, again, are these increasing effects over time. And from month 18 to 24, that is where it really starts showing up, right? I mean these effect sizes that are close to 30% when we did our research with retina doctors. That is a number that virtually every retina doc becomes really excited about. So these are elements that -- those are the 2 most important elements that factored into our decision.</p><p>ANUPAM RAMA: Question from the audience? question is around an ADCOM in the CMO leaving.</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Yes. So the ADCOM, so when we -- the way in which this major amendment came about is we gave a call to the FDA, we said we would like to do this, Will you accept it, right? That was the first question. And in those conversations, we also talked about the ADCOM, and we were told again that no AdCom was planned this program. And then with the Chief Medical Officer change. This is something that got planned well in advance, right? I mean, Federico was -- it was always the plan that he would leave the company and that we would turn it over to a Chief Medical Officer with Retina Experience.</p><p>But when we thought about the logistics and making sure that the team is kind of fully ready to operationalize this, right? We said we're going to do it before the PDUFA. That gives us time to really hit the ground running when we're there, -- that's why we did it. So from an investor perspective, this is, of course, not what you want to do because it creates uncertainty. But operationally, it's 100% the right thing to do for us.</p><p>And again, Federico, feel free to -- welcome to talk to him. You'll see him this weekend if you go to away has been an amazing, amazing project and Dr. Caroline Baumal, I think is hit the ground running member there, and that's why we did it. So from an investor perspective, this is, of course, not what you want to do because it creates uncertainty. But operationally, it's 100% the right thing to do for us. And again, Federico, sure you're welcome to talk to him, you'll see him this week and if you go to Hawa has been an amazing, amazing project. And Dr. Caroline Baumal, I think, is going to be the perfect person to launch this book for us.</p><p>ANUPAM RAMA: And I guess while I have the mic, the other thing investors are really focused on is when you start labeling discussions? Is that being a positive indication that things are moving forward as you expected? So when do you expect to start labeling discussions?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Well, so it's typically about a month before the PDUFA date, right? That's the timing. We're not going to announce it when we are in labeling discussions. For in by value, it was 3.5 weeks before our approval. So I think it varies a little bit.</p><p>ANUPAM RAMA: We do have a question in the question portal, which is, Cedric, does the new CMO have a different view on the value of having both monthly and every month dosing in the label?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: No. I think you should all know that Dr. Baumal did not join us on -- in the spur of the moment, right? So she went through all of the documentation. She went through the data, and it is her belief in the product and the difference that it can make in this disease that led her to join us, right. So this is something where every other amount is incredibly important to the vast majority of these retina docs. We do want to have the monthly dosing regimen in the label so that physicians have the flexibility. So that's the best way to think about it is every other month is very attractive, but for certain patients, you may want to resource to multi-injections as well.</p><p>ANUPAM RAMA: Other questions from the audience? You talked about every other month dosing. The other thing that could be differentiated in the label is having a broad label such as with fovea patients. How do you think about that inclusion of that in the label as well as one other controversy around fovea patients, is what the uptick would look like in that segment?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Yes. So I think, look, first of all, on a prevalent basis, approximately 60% of patients have foveal lesions. That's because there was no treatment available so far. At the time of diagnosis, as many as 85% of patients have extrafoveal lesions that then ultimately involve the fovea -- when we enrolled our patients in our Phase III clinical trials, and if you want to use that as a surrogate for the interest that patients have of enrolling in this trial, we had approximately the prevalent distribution. So meaning that at least from a physician patient interaction perspective, there was no preference for extrafoveal patients to come into this study. Now we expect both to be present in the label, again, especially with the 24-month data, really, the difference between the foveal and the extra foveal lesions becomes quite minimal.</p><p>ANUPAM RAMA: Question from the audience... Can you remind -- go ahead... Brian...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Intermediate AMD and whether or not this would be an opportunity you would pursue? And what would be the pathway to get a label in that indication?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Yes. So intermediate MD is not an indication, and intermediate AMD is not an endpoint. That is very bad in feedback that we received from the regulators. So I think, quite frankly, that the FDA doesn't think about intermediate AMD as a different disease. And therefore, I think we should not expect to have that language in the label either.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: A couple of quick ones. One, I don't know if you've talked about the peak sales and also, what kind of a sales force in a sort of steady state would you require to support that?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Yes. So we have, in August, we hired the full sales force, as I presented to you, right? So we have approximately 100 field-based representatives across these various functions that are out there doing the work. We are not guiding on peak sales. So all of our analysts, including Anupam, have their views on that. And again, for us, the main focus is to get access to as many patients as possible as quickly as possible.</p><p>ANUPAM RAMA: Questions from the audience...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I was going to ask on the exudation part. One thing that comes up when I talk to the doctors is they don't think it will be very -- an issue to give anti-VEGF, but they are not really sure what the protocol will look like in terms of can we inject the anti-VEGF on the same day on the GA treatment? Or should we stop the GA treatment for 6 months, and wait how the execution recover. So anything -- I guess, internally, you have looked at the data and can you comment anything on that? And would that be in the label? And would be helpful for physician practices, essentially.</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Thank you for that question. So that's a very important question, (inaudible). In the clinical trials, it was done on the same day in the real world, we for now, we plan on providing the flexibility to do it any way they want. So they could do it on the same day. Typically, with about an hour apart between the 2 injections or they could do it on subsequent days or even 2 weeks between them. So -- but we do not plan on providing kind of very clear instructions on how to do that.</p><p>ANUPAM RAMA: Additional questions?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Monthly versus every other monthly dosing. Would you expect any sort of switching between?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: So I think look, as the data matures, right, and I think also a little bit based on what we see with anti-VEGF, some physicians may be tempted to start with monthly and then after a certain period of time, switch to every other month dosing. And certainly, based on the data that we have, and we'll present much more this year on that as we continue to evaluate it. That is a reasonable thing to do probably. So -- but again, we need to gather more data and switching I think absolutely will be part of the standard of care.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: But it can also go every other month?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: It could go the other way as well. Yes.</p><p>ANUPAM RAMA: Questions from the audience?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I'm sorry if I missed this in the presentation, Cedric, but will there be any updated sort of Derby Oaks GALE extension data in 2023? And if so, when should -- what time frame?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Yes. So we present on the DERBY trial. So some of the work that we presented in September at the American Academy of Ophthalmology that was really exciting is when you look at the retina and don't just simply talk about lesion size growth, but start dissecting out what happens at the photoreceptor cell layer compared to the retinal pigmented epithelial cell, that continues to progress how these 2 cell areas may be impacted differentially.</p><p>We will talk more about that in this year at meetings and publications. And then, of course, we have the GALE extension study, where in approximately 800 subjects, we continue to evaluate what happens these lesions over time.</p><p>ANUPAM RAMA: Maybe just switching gears a little bit. You talked about the EMPAVELI PDUFA is coming up here in February. PRINCE data, the 48-week PEGASUS data. How do you anticipate label expansion could change the ramp of the uptake of the drug?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Yes. I think, look, it's just a matter -- when you look at kind of the evolution of how the product came to the market, as we expected in the beginning, the patients that came on product with EMPAVELI patients that suffered from transfusion dependency anemia and with a very important component also for Ultomiris treated patients, right? So approximately 75% of patients didn't come from Soliris, which is what we tested in our Phase III but came from Ultomiris because they suffer from the same shortcomings that C5 inhibitors have. We then also after that, started treating patients that did better that may even have normal hemoglobin levels, but do so at the expense of very high reticulocyte levels, right, and high bilirubin levels. So those patients to benefit greatly from treatment with EMPAVELI, which completely controls this disease. The last beast then is the treatment-naive patients. So the first ones that come on treatment with this drug. That is currently approximately 10% of our new enrolled patients and kind of an example of how that evolution is taking place over time.</p><p>ANUPAM RAMA: We've got another e-mail on the question in the portal, which is, do you believe that the monthly dosing of pegcetacoplan in GA would have the same cost as every other month dosing to a patient or would it be twice as much?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Yes. So the way -- without talking about pricing, but the way in which we intend to commercialize, it is on a per vial basis. So that would answer that question.</p><p>ANUPAM RAMA: Questions from the audience? In what segments in PNH has the product outperformed based on your expectations? And where has it lagged a little bit in this -- from your initial expectations? And how can you improve that?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Yes. I think generally speaking, it has followed the trajectory that we expected. The important segment is now to capture as well as possible are these patients that I mentioned that have more normal hemoglobin levels as well as the treatment-naive patient segments...</p><p>ANUPAM RAMA: So I think one of the trials that you guys are directly responsible for is the Meridian trial in ALS, right? That's part of the Sobey collaboration. What are the key points that provide some mechanistic rationale for C5 in ALS? Whereas other complement approaches have had sort of mixed build updates?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Yes. So C5 does not seem to work in ALS, right? I mean that was established. -- as well as survival. Should we hit the CAPscore on the primary endpoints, that would be, of course, an extraordinary finding, right, kind of a whole new light through which we then have to look at the commercialization of EMPAVELI. But I think the more reasonable expectation is that we're going to get a mixed picture, hopefully, find responder populations. -- hopefully find something exciting and then see what we do with that program moving forward, potentially with another Phase III or a discussion with the regulators if the data are good enough.</p><p>ANUPAM RAMA: Questions from the audience? What are the key -- going back to pegcetacoplan and GA, what are the key sort of European time lines that we should be considering?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: So we filed. It takes approximately 1 year. So the approval in Europe is going to be at the beginning of 2024, and the CHMP opinion typically comes 67 days before the full approval.</p><p>ANUPAM RAMA: Questions from the audience? On the U.S. Pegcetacoplan launch. Can you walk us through the process of how we should be thinking about a permanent J-code and time lines there?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Yes. So we -- with the PDUFA on February 26, we would apply for a J-Code somewhere in March. In the beginning, we would work with miscellaneous J codes and then we would get a permanent J code sometime in October. That's the schedule on which we will be. While we are working with miscellaneous J codes. Of course, that means that the retina doctors have to be comfortable that they will be reimbursed. They will typically try that a couple of times and then become more accustomed to it. But certainly, in the beginning, that will be something that will make the ramp less strong than it could otherwise be until the permanent J code kicks in, in October.</p><p>ANUPAM RAMA: Any final questions for Cedric? Okay.

Welcome, everyone, to the 41st Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. My name is Anupam Rama. I'm one of the senior analysts here at J.P. Morgan. I'm joined by my team, Malcolm Kuno and Priyanka Grover. Our next presenting company is Apellis. And presenting on behalf of the company, we have CEO, Cedric Francois. Cedric?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cedric Francois:</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thank you very much, Anupam, and thank you for inviting us. So good to do this in person again. So, in the next 20 minutes, I'm going to take you through the story around Apellis, what we have been doing in the recent past and what we have to look forward to in the next year. These are our forward-looking statements. You can also find our SEC filings online.</p><p>So, we have a lot to look forward to the next month. We have our PDUFA in geographic atrophy on February 26 with the opportunity to deliver the first ever treatment for geographic atrophy, one of the leading causes of blindness in the world. We also have EMPAVELI that is currently in about a year and a half of sales, has set a great launch trajectory and is turning out to be a truly game-changing solution for patients with PNH as it relates to their condition, their anemia and their quality of life. We also continue to focus on complement factor C3 and all that it can do across a wide range of therapeutic areas with 12 clinical and preclinical programs.</p><p>So, 2022 was a transformational year for us. Of course, in geographic atrophy, we had our filings in the U.S. as well as in Europe. We had the commercial preparations to complete. We are ready to launch this drug in geographic atrophy in the U.S. and have also worked in Europe. And importantly, we recently announced that Dr. Caroline Baumal is going to become our Chief Medical Officer. So, Caroline Baumal is a world-famous retina specialist. And the way in which this happened is about a year ago, Dr. Federico Grossi and I, who co-founded this company with Pascal about 20 years ago, we decided that we wanted to have a retina doctor to help us launch this drug, because it's such a specific field and to have the power of her presence was deemed to be very important. We decided to do it now so that we have some time until the real approval date to get all of the preparations in place. Fede is going to help us with this, and this is a great moment to thank him for the amazing job that he has done. This weekend, we're going to go to Hawaii all together, Caroline, Fede, and myself, to talk about geographic atrophy and what we can do with this product in this disease.</p><p>When talking about EMPAVELI, last year, we continued our launch trajectory with $65 million in U.S. net product sales. We submitted two supplemental NDAs and completed more than 800 patient years of systemic dosing. In the meanwhile, in the pipeline, we continued to progress our late-stage clinical studies with Sobi, our early-stage pipeline, and completed the enrollment in the Phase II ALS study.</p><p>So, now 2023. So, this is going to be an amazing year for us. First of all, we are planning to deliver the first-ever treatment for patients with GA in the U.S. to prepare for our ex-U.S. approvals as well to continue to maximize the value of EMPAVELI and to advance our early pipeline and the beam collaboration.</p><p>So, what is geographic atrophy? So, to understand this disease, I want you to think of the retina and of having a forest fire in the retina where in a relentless process, you lose more and more photoreceptor cells. This process has no treatment available, and once you have it, your path is towards inevitably blindness, if you live long enough. This is a disease in which many, many drugs have been tried and where we finally have discovered a pathway where something is possible to control the progression of this disease. And we did this with intravitreal pegcetacoplan. So, here is pegcetacoplan, positioned to be that first-ever treatment. And there are three seminal features of this drug product that I want you to bear in mind.</p><p>The first one, and in my opinion, maybe the most important one, is that we have increasing treatment effect over time. The longer these patients are on treatments with intravitreal pegcetacoplan, the more of the slowdown of this degenerative process becomes. We've evaluated that over 24 months in DERBY and OAKS and it looks like an immunotherapeutic process that we will continue to evaluate in the GALE extension study. Importantly, we saw these increasing effects across two dose regimens. We have a dose regimen for patients who receive treatment every two months, but we also have the ability to treat patients monthly, if physicians choose to do so. It is hard to overemphasize the importance of every other month's treatment because it provides a benefit to patients and physicians of much more convenience with benefits in terms of treatment effects that is pretty close to what you get with monthly treatment. In the meantime, also, especially, towards the end of the 24-month period, the convergence between the effect size on the foveal as well as the extrafoveal lesions is fascinating to see, where from month 18 to 24, the effect size is more or less the same. And these are the same as DERBY and OAKS studies.</p><p>So, what's extraordinary about these two studies is that at 24 months, they look remarkably similar, and the consistency for both dosing regimens is truly remarkable. What also stands out here, again, is that increased effect that we see over time. And if you quantify that, in six months segments, so 0 to 6, 6 to 12, 12 to 18, and 18 to 24, you can see how in every six months segments, the effect on slowing down the lesion progression becomes more pronounced. Importantly, as well is when you then look at how is the fire, what is the intensity of the fire in that segment for a month 18 to 24, well, the slowdown there has become truly clinically meaningful. And we see that for both sub-foveal as well as non-sub-foveal or extrafoveal lesions. We see that for monthly as well as for every other month lesions. And these effect sizes in the range of approximately 30%. These two Phase-III clinical trials are the only ones to have shown such a slowdown in the progression of GA for both extrafoveal as well as foveal lesions. And you should expect that that treatment effect continues beyond the year two in patients with GA who may be on treatment for 10 years, maybe 20 years or longer.</p><p>We also had a favorable safety profile that we evaluated in a very large database of patients. 1,200 patients and nearly 12,000 injections were evaluated in these two clinical trials. And what we found is that we have a safety profile that is best and most easily understood as that associated with an intravitreal injection, something we know very well from the anti-VEGF world. We also have a slowly increased rate of -- or slightly increased rate of exudations in these patients. That is something that can be controlled with anti-VEGF injections and that we continue to follow closely.</p><p>So, we are now ready to launch in this very important disease, which because of its prevalence, also represents, of course, a meaningful commercial opportunity for us. When we ran a global survey with physicians, with retina doctors, we found that more than 90% of retina doctors worldwide plan to use pegcetacoplan in their patients with GA. And we have built-in the past year a best-in-class team highly experienced in the retina across all of these elements that are important in a successful launch. We currently have approximately 100 field-based employees out there doing the work. More than 90% of those come from companies that have profound retina and ophthalmology experience, and these employees joined us because of what they have seen in the data package and the faith that they have in making a real difference in this disease.</p><p>In the meantime, the pre-launch activities are well underway. In med affairs, we have been working for a long time throughout 2022 on our presentations on raising awareness, on teaching physicians and retina docs, as well as patients what it means to be on treatment with the product like pegcetacoplan. And on the commercial side, in September 2022, we really started amplifying our efforts. The one thing I want you to remember from the commercial efforts is that we have extraordinary access to the retinal practice. Retina docs, want to see us and want to learn about this product. And that is not very hard to understand when you imagine a patient that is on a path to blindness that they have to see multiple times per day and for which currently nothing is available.</p><p>So, where do we stand? So, we are positioned to be the first ever treatment for geographic atrophy as early as next month with a compelling product profile to address an unmet need globally, with more than 90% of surveyed retina specialists worldwide planning to use this product in their patients and a best-in-class field-based team deployed and ready for launch.</p><p>So, moving on now to EMPAVELI, our first approved product and now on the market for approximately a year and a half. We've had a successful EMPAVELI launch where it has been incredibly gratifying to see how this product elevates the standard of care in PNH. Many years ago, when we were doing our development, there was always a question as to what is the role of extravascular hemolysis in this disease. Is it safe to control this disease with C3? What is the difference that this is going to make? Well, the difference is absolutely extraordinary. And if there's one number that I would like you to pay attention to on this chart, it is the fifth bullet point. We have 98% real-world patient compliance. Now, it's hard to reach these patients. Many of these patients, unfortunately, get a little bit forgotten they're on C5 inhibitors. They're hard to find. They need to be made aware that this is available to them. But once these patients are on treatment and discover what it does for them, the retention rate is absolutely extraordinary, and again, a testament to how much of a difference this product can make. We then also have those two supplemental NDAs. What will they do? The first one has a PDUFA on February 8, next month, and this gives us the ability to promote on the basis of treatment-naive data as well, data that we have established in the so-called PRINCE study and the 48-week PEGASUS results. We then also have the EMPAVELI injector that is going to come on the market at the end of March. Our PDUFA is March 15. This was through a collaboration with Enable Injections and it allows these patients, who self-administered this product twice per week at home, to do this in a, what we call, a needleless experience. So, these patients have no longer to manipulate any needles in order to self-administer this product, which will significantly improve the patient experience and the administration.</p><p>Here too, we have a strong safety profile. We have over 800 patient years of systemic pegcetacoplan exposure. And on this slide, the second bullet is the most surprising one. We have zero reported cases of meningococcal infection. With C5 inhibitors at this point in time, you should expect it to see a couple of these meningococcal infections show up already, because it's considered to be a class effect, but the way in which pegcetacoplan works at least for now seems to have an advantage in that regard as well.</p><p>We are then expanding on potential new indications. In the middle of this year, we are going to have the readout on our ALS trial. We are enrolling very quickly in our VALIANT Phase-III clinical trial in IC-MPGN and C3G. And our partner, Sobi, is enrolling in the cold agglutinin disease trial as well as in a Phase II trial in hematopoietic stem-cell associated thrombotic microangiopathy, where in the second half of this year, we will have the first data. Now last but not least, our early pipeline, which in this year is going to move in meaningful ways into the clinic, and of course, our beam collaboration. First of all, our molecule, APL-2006, which we also call the ranitidine molecules, this is a molecule that we developed by considering what happens with patients who are on treatment with anti-VEGF. If you have wet macular degeneration and you are being treated with an anti-VEGF product, your chances of developing geographic atrophy within a seven-month -- seven-year time frame are 98%. So, it's virtually inevitable. So, what we decided to do was create a molecule that would both control VEGF, could be injected, what we believe is going to be in every three-month procedure, and at the same time control C3 so that we can hopefully avoid the development of geographic atrophy and have a next-generation anti-VEGF molecule available to us.</p><p>Then we have our next-generation C3 siRNA program. This is a program to lower the levels of C3 in the body so that the twice-a-week subcutaneous administration that is currently needed with EMPAVELI can be reduced to something more convenient for patients. In preclinical settings, we silenced C3 expression by more than 90%. And this drug product is planned to go into the clinic in the first half of this year.</p><p>And last but not least, APL-1030. So, this is a molecule that allows us via an intrathecal injection to -- for the first time, control C3 in the brain. This is a very exciting new frontier for us because we think of the brain -- or, of the eye, I should say, as a window into the brain. When you look at the mechanisms behind complement -- and the reasons why we believe pegcetacoplan in the eye can slow down the progression of geographic atrophy, it shares so many commonalities with many neurodegenerative conditions and some neurological diseases as well. In the meantime, we also, as you know, in DERBY and OAKS have seen these increasing effects over time, which gives us hope that there is something of an immunotherapeutic effect that we may be able to explore in these central nervous system conditions as well. This is another product that's moving forward very nicely and where we intend to be the first ones to explore this in the CNS space. And then we also have our beam collaboration, as far as we know, the only gene editing program in C3 or in complement, I should say, six research programs in total on which you will hear much more in the future as well.</p><p>And this is what our pipeline looks like. So, really exciting to explore this unique target complement factor C3 across such a wide range of therapeutic areas and indications in the space of rare diseases, ophthalmology, neurology, and certain others outside of that as well.</p><p>So, this is an extraordinary year for us. We look forward to sharing our data with you in the months to come. Of course, next month, the PDUFA date and the launch in geographic atrophy shortly thereafter, but then also to continue to see what we do with EMPAVELI and the advancement of our early pipeline. Thank you.</p><h>Questions And Answers</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anupam Rama:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Cedric. That's a practice there. You got done five minutes early. Just want to remind folks that -- a couple of things. Number one, there is an ask a question feature through the digital portal book and you can send that over and I'll ask on your behalf based on this iPad. And then if you want to get bold, there are microphone runners in the room and raise your hand and we will make sure we get your question answered.</p><p>Cedric, on the PDUFA date forthcoming, just wondering how soon after approval could you launch? You said shortly thereafter. Is there a time frame which you're targeting?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cedric Francois:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. We're not going to be more specific than that, but we are -- we will be ready to ship. We will -- Adam has done crazy good job of getting everybody ready. So, it will not be very long after the approval that we will be able to launch this product.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anupam Rama:</emphasis></p><p>One of the controversies that we talked about in the back half of the year was the 24-month data being included in the product label and having that major amendment. Can you walk us through what the 24-month data do if they are fully included in the label versus the 18-month data?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cedric Francois:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. So, our hope, of course -- the reason why we did it is that we hope that it will be available in the label. And that's the label that we submitted to the FDA. The one feature of the 24-month data that is not very obvious at 18 months is the consistency between these two clinical trials. So, even at 18 months, DERBY does not look as good as OAKS. And for our sales force to go out and talk about that with retina docs, we felt that it would take too much time and too much explaining as to why these two trials are not exactly the same. And as you've all seen at 24 months, that is clearly there.</p><p>The second aspect that is really important to us, again, are these increasing effects over time. And from month 18 to 24, that is where it really starts showing up, right? I mean, these effect sizes that there are close to 30%, when we did our research with retina doctors, that is a number that virtually every retina doc becomes really excited about. So, these are elements that -- those are the two most important elements that's factored into our decision.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anupam Rama:</emphasis></p><p>Question from the audience. Go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>People have been worried about whether or not [Indecipherable]. So, can you just address whether or not do you still don't expect an ADCOM and if there have been any assurances that, that will not be required?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anupam Rama:</emphasis></p><p>Questions around an ADCOM and the CMO leaving.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cedric Francois:</emphasis></p><p>Yes. So, the ADCOM -- so when we -- the way in which this major amendment came about is we gave a call to the FDA, we said we would like to do this, will you accept it, right? That was the first question. And in those conversations, we also talked about the ADCOM, and we were told, again, that no ADCOM was planned for this program. And then with the Chief Medical Officer change, this is something that got planned well in advance, right? I mean, Federico was -- it was always the plan that he would leave the company and that we will turn it over to Chief Medical Officer with retina experience. But when we thought about the logistics and making sure that the team is kind of fully ready to operationalize this, right, we said we're going to do it before the PDUFA. That gives us time to really hit the ground running when we're there. That's why we did it. So, from an investor perspective, this is, of course, not what you want to do because it creates uncertainty. But operationally, it's a 100% right thing to do for us. And again, Federico, feel free to -- welcome to talk to him. You'll see him this weekend if you go to Hawaii. Has been an amazing project, and Dr. Caroline Baumal, I think is going to be the perfect person to launch this drug for us.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>And I guess, well, I have the mic, the other thing investors are really focused on is when you start labeling discussions. That being a positive indication that things are moving forward as you expected. So, when do you expect to start labeling discussions?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cedric Francois:</emphasis></p><p>Well, so it's typically about a month before the PDUFA dates, right? That's the timing. We're not going to announce it when we are in labeling discussions. For EMPAVELI, it was 3.5 weeks before our approval. So, I think it varies a little bit.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anupam Rama:</emphasis></p><p>We do have a question in the question portal, which is, Cedric, does the new CMO have a different view on the value of having both monthly and every month dosing in the label?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cedric Francois:</emphasis></p><p>No. And I think you should all know that Dr. Baumal did not join us on the -- in the spur of the moment, right? So, she went through all of the documentation. She went through the data. And it is her belief in the products and the difference that it can make in this disease that let her to join us, right? So, this is something where every other month is incredibly important to the vast majority of these retina docs. We do want to have the monthly dosing regimen in the label so that physicians have the flexibility. So, that's the best way to think about it, is every other month is very attractive, but for certain patients, you may want to resource to monthly injections as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anupam Rama:</emphasis></p><p>Other questions from the audience?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>You talked about every other month dosing. The other thing that could be differentiated in the label is having a broad label such as with foveal patients. How do you think about that inclusion of that in the label as well as one other controversy around foveal patients is, is what the uptick would look like in that segment?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cedric Francois:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. So, I think, look, first of all, on a prevalent basis, approximately 60% of patients have foveal lesions. That's because there was no treatment available so far. At the time of diagnosis, as many as 85% of patients have extrafoveal lesions that then ultimately involved the fovea. When we enrolled our patients in our Phase III clinical trials -- and if you want to use that as a surrogate for the interest that patients have of enrolling in this trial, we had approximately the prevalent distribution. So, meaning that at least from a physician-patient interaction perspective, there was no preference for extrafoveal patients to come into this study. Now, we expect both to be present in the label, again, especially with the 24-month data, really the difference between the foveal and extrafoveal lesions becomes quite minimal.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anupam Rama:</emphasis></p><p>Questions from the audience?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>Can you remind...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anupam Rama:</emphasis></p><p>Go ahead, Brian [Phonetic]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>[Indecipherable] and whether or not this will be an opportunity -- intermediate AMD and whether or not this would be an opportunity that you would pursue and what would be the pathway to get a label in that indication?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cedric Francois:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. So, intermediate AMD is It's not an indication and intermediate AMD is not an endpoint. That is very bad in feedback that we received from the regulators. So, I think quite frankly that the FDA doesn't think about intermediate AMD as a different disease. And therefore, I think we should not expect to have that language in the label letter.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>Hi. Just couple of quick ones. One, I don't know if you've talked about the peak sales and also what kind of a sales force in a sort of steady state would you require to support that?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cedric Francois:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. So, we have in August, we hired the full sales force is I presented to you, right? So, it would be approximately a hundred field-based representatives across these various functions that are out there doing the work. We are not guiding on peak sales. So, all of our analysts, including Anupam, have their views on that. And again, for us the main focus is to get access to as many patients as possible, as quickly as possible.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anupam Rama:</emphasis></p><p>Questions from the audience?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Speaker:</emphasis></p><p>[Indecipherable] Would you mind placing that down?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks. Hey, Cedric. Thanks. I was going to ask on the exudation part. One thing that comes up when I talk to the doctors is they don't think it's a -- will be very -- an issue to give anti-VEGFs, but they're not really sure what the protocol will look like in terms of can we inject the anti-VEGF on the same day on the GA treatment, or should we stop the GA treatment for six months and wait -- have the exudation recover. So, anything, I guess, internally, you have looked at the data, and can you comment anything on that? And would that be in the label and would be helpful for physician practices essentially?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cedric Francois:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. No, thank you for that question. So, it's a very important question, right? In the clinical trials, it was done on the same day. In the real world, we're -- for now, we plan on providing the flexibility to physicians to do it any way they want. So, they could do it on the same day typically with about an hour apart between the two injections or they could do it on subsequent days or even two weeks between them. So -- but we do not plan on providing kind of very clear instructions on how to do that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anupam Rama:</emphasis></p><p>Additional questions?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. On a monthly dosing -- every other monthly dosing, would you expect any sort of switching between?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cedric Francois:</emphasis></p><p>So, I think, look, as the data matures, right, and I think also a little bit based on what we see with anti-VEGFs, some physicians may be tempted to start with monthly, and then after a certain period of time switch to every other month dosing. And certainly, based on the data that we have and we'll present much more this year on that as we continue to evaluate it, that is a reasonable thing to do probably. So -- but again, we need to gather more data and switching, I think, absolutely will be part of the standard of care.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>But it can also go the other way every other month, two months?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cedric Francois:</emphasis></p><p>It could go the other way as well, yes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anupam Rama:</emphasis></p><p>Questions from the audience? I'm sorry if I missed this in the presentation, Cedric, but will there be any updated sort of DERBY, OAKS, GALE extension data in 2023? And if so, when should -- what time frame?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cedric Francois:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. So, we're going to continue to present on the DERBY trials. So, some of the work that we presented in September at the American Academy of Ophthalmology, that was really exciting, is when you look at the retina and don't just simply talk about lesion size growth but start dissecting out what happens at the photoreceptor cell there compared to the retinal pigmented epithelial cell, how that continues to progress, how these two cell areas may be impacted differentially, we will talk more about that in this year at meetings and publications. And then, of course, we have the GALE extension study, where in approximately 800 subjects, we continue to evaluate what happens to these lesions over time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anupam Rama:</emphasis></p><p>Maybe just switching gears a little bit. You talked about the EMPAVELI PDUFA is coming up here in February, PRINCE data, the 48-week PEGASUS data. How do you anticipate label expansion could change the ramp of the uptake of the drug?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cedric Francois:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. I think, look, it's just a matter -- when you look at kind of the evolution of how the product came to the market, as we expected in the beginning, the patients that came on products with EMPAVELI were patients that suffered from transfusion dependency anemia and was a very important component also for Ultomiris-treated patients, right? So, approximately 75% of patients didn't come Soliris, which is what we just did in our Phase III, but came from Ultomiris because they suffer from the same shortcomings that C5 inhibitors have. We then also after that started treating patients that did better, that may even have normal hemoglobin levels, but do so at the expense of very high reticulocyte levels, right, and high bilirubin levels. So, those patients too benefit greatly from treatment with EMPAVELI, which completely controls this disease. The last piece then is the treatment-naive patients, so the first ones that come on treatment with this drug. That is currently approximately 10% of our new enrolled patients and kind of an example of how that evolution is taking place over time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anupam Rama:</emphasis></p><p>We've got another e-mail question in the portal, which is, do you believe that the monthly dosing of pegcetacoplan in GA would have the same cost as every other month dosing to a patient, or would it be twice as much?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cedric Francois:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. So, the way without talking about pricing, but the way in which we intend to commercialize it is on a per vial basis. So, that would answer that question.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anupam Rama:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Questions from the audience? In what segments in PNH has the product outperformed based on your expectations? And where has it lagged a little bit from your initial expectations and how can you improve that?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cedric Francois:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. I think, generally speaking, it has followed the trajectory that we expected. The important segments now to capture as well as possible are these patients that I mentioned that have more normal hemoglobin levels as well as the treatment-naive patient segment.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anupam Rama:</emphasis></p><p>So, I think one of the trials that you guys are directly responsible for is the MERIDIAN trial in ALS, right? That's part of the Sobi collaboration. What are the key points that provide some mechanistic rationale for C3 in ALS, whereas other complement approaches have had sort of mixed failed updates?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cedric Francois:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. So, C5 does not seem to work in ALS, right? I mean, that was established by Alexion, but then also, by UCB with their collaboration with the Ra product. There is a very important difference between C3 and C5 as we know from PNH, and specifically, the effect on neurodegeneration also is quite different. Now this is a high-risk, high-reward project for us. Our internal probability of success is approximately 10%. But it's a project that we believe is very important, and again, kind of reaching the motor end plate, which is where ALS specifically starts before it goes to the CNS. That is a phenotype where we believe we have a chance at getting something, so...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anupam Rama:</emphasis></p><p>Do you think the endpoint that you're using, which is the CASF, is heightened your probability of success versus using the more traditional ALSFRS score?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cedric Francois:</emphasis></p><p>Well, this is an endpoint that we got to in collaboration with the regulatory authorities, right, which combines function as well as survival. Should we hit the gas core on the primary endpoints, that would be of course an extraordinary finding, right, and kind of a whole new light through which we then have to look at the commercialization of EMPAVELI. But I think the more reasonable expectation is that we're going to get a mixed picture, hopefully find responder populations, hopefully find something exciting, and then see what we do with that program moving forward potentially with another Phase III or a discussion with the regulators if the data are good enough.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anupam Rama:</emphasis></p><p>Questions from the audience? What are the key -- to going back to pegcetacoplan in GA, what are the key sort of European timelines that we should be considering?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cedric Francois:</emphasis></p><p>So, we filed. It takes approximately one year. So, the approval in Europe is going to be in the beginning of 2024. And the CHMP opinion typically comes 67 days before the full approval.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anupam Rama:</emphasis></p><p>Question from the audience? On the U.S. pegcetacoplan launch, can you walk us through the process of how we should be thinking about a permanent J-code and timelines there?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cedric Francois:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. So, we -- with the PDUFA on February 26, we would apply for a J-code somewhere in March. In the beginning, we would work with miscellaneous J-codes and then we would get a permanent J-code sometime in October. That's the schedule on which we will be. While we are working with miscellaneous J-codes, of course, that means that the retina doctors have to be comfortable that they will be reimbursed. They will typically try at a couple of times and then become more accustomed to it. But certainly, in the beginning, that will be something that's -- will make the ramp less strong than it could otherwise be until the permanent J-code kicks in, in October.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anupam Rama:</emphasis></p><p>Any final questions for Cedric?

A 10-foot pole tower was constructed in 1941, then replaced in 1983 by the current two-story concrete tower. For emergencies, the lookout can still be staffed and is also available as a rental throughout the summer by the Stillwater State Forest.</p><p>The 6,960-foot high summit of Werner Peak towers over the valleys in all directions and offers a surround-view of the seemingly endless peaks. The structure itself has a supply room on the ground floor and up a narrow staircase, a wraparound deck surrounds a room enclosed from the elements but with windows that hardly interrupt the view.</p><p>For those involved in the NMLA, preserving the lookouts across northwest Montana is important because the structures are of great historical significance. According to Davis, who along with his wife Marli has been traveling to lookouts since the 1970s, each time they travel to a place such as Werner Peak they are reminded of the stories that came before them.</p><p>\"There's just so much history tied to them... people came here back in the 30s and 40s to picnic and such,\" Marli said.</p><p>In addition to the physical restoration projects, the NMLA is also doing an oral history preservation project which is dialoguing the memories of former lookout personnel and their family members. Those stories tell a rich history of the importance the structures had historically, but Rick Davis says he can see the story of the actual structure unfold just by physically replacing boards or windows on a lookout.</p><p>\"I think working on these, you see the wood itself has a memory to it,\" he said. \"In other words, there will be 20 years ago one of the corners shifted and the lookout dropped on that side a little bit, then all the boards are like that.\"</p><p>Rick and Marli Davis estimate they have helped restore over 20 lookouts in the nine years since NMLA formed as a nonprofit organization. In the years leading up to the organization forming, the Forest Service was getting volunteer groups together to work on the lookouts and the NMLA formed naturally out of those first efforts.</p><p>Now the NMLA works in partnerships with agencies like the DNRC, Kootenai National Forest, Glacier National Park and Flathead National Forest. Each year the nonprofit works with the agencies to determine which lookouts require restoration work and what is doable for that year.</p><p>\"We have a really good relationship in that manner,\" Rick said. \"When you deal with agencies it can be frustrating, but this has not been that way at all. I think it's because we're not taking away anyone's job, these are things that wouldn't get done necessarily until maybe it's too far gone.\"</p><p>At the Werner Peak project, this year Rick and Marli Davis were joined by two volunteers that are new to the organization. Barbara Boorman and Barb Hvizdak both said they wanted to get involved because of their love for the outdoors and a chance to preserve the history of an important structure.</p><p>For Boorman, she's been traveling to Werner Peak since she was a little girl and her father was the head of a forest fire protection agency.</p><p>\"I'm fascinated with lookouts, I love to hike to them... I just have a long history with lookouts,\" she said.</p><p>Marli Davis says she keeps coming back year after year to volunteer for the association because preserving the history of the lookouts is so important. Rick Davis likes seeing the project through knowing he contributed to keeping a legacy alive.</p><p>\"This has got a start, a middle and an ending \u2014 then you're done and it looks good,\" he expressed. \"You've contributed, there's closure and I'm doing something for a legacy that's important to me.\"</p><p>In addition to Werner Peak, the NMLA is also working on or assessing seven other lookouts this summer. Without the work the nonprofit does each year, Rick and Marli Davis believe many of the lookouts would eventually break down and become unusable.</p><p>\"We care about them and we respect what these lookouts go through,\" Rick Davis said.</p><p>___ (c)2021 The Whitefish Pilot (Whitefish, Mont.)

The prices of hot water and heating increased by 80-90% y/y. <br/>[66] <br/><br/>Hungarian Inflation Surges to 13.7% y/y in July[67] <br/>Hungarian consumer price growth accelerated growth to 13.7% in July from 11.7% in June, a new 25-year high, figures from the Central Statistics Office (KSH) show (chart). <br/>The July reading came in at 0.6pp above market consensus, weakening the Hungarian forint. The HUF was already struggling earlier in the day due to worries about oil supply after Ukraine suspended Russian oil flows to southern Europe because it did not receive transit fees. <br/>[66] <br/><br/>Moody's Downgrades Turkey to Six Notches Below Investment Grade[68] <br/>Moody's Investors Service has downgraded Turkey's sovereign rating by one notch to B3 with a stable outlook, taking it to six notches below investment grade, the rating agency said on August 12 (Chart: Turkey's rating history by Moody's). <br/>Pressure on the balance of payments has risen and the increasingly unorthodox policies from the Erdogan administration are unlikely to restore macroeconomic stability, Moody's said. <br/>[66] <br/><br/>North Macedonia's Annual Inflation Accelerates to 16% in July[69] <br/>North Macedonia's average annual inflation accelerated by 1.5 percentage points (pp) from the previous month to 16% in July (chart), statistics office data showed on August 8. <br/>Inflation started to increase rapidly since April 2021. The central bank said in July that the inflation was mainly driven by import prices of food and energy, which are growing at a much stronger pace than expected. However, the pressures quickly spilled over to the prices of other products and services, and added to fuel inflationary expectations. <br/>Month-on-month, the consumer price index (CPI) in North Macedonia slowed down by 0.9 pp from the previous month to 1.9% in July. <br/>[66] <br/><br/>Poland: Average Annual Inflation High Next Year, Central Bank Head Says[70] <br/>Next year's average annual inflation will remain high, Poland's central bank governor wrote in a Friday article for the Super Express tabloid's website. <br/>Adam Glapinski wrote that inflation was expected to fall next year, but would still remain at a high level, with a bigger drop expected in 2024. <br/>He added that the inflation increase recorded in many economies had global sources, mainly rising energy and natural gas costs, therefore bringing it down would not be possible without global-scale undertakings by central banks. <br/>The tightening monetary policy introduced by central banks will slow economic growth and as a result bring down inflation, Glapinski wrote. <br/>[66] <br/><br/>Poland's CPI Hits 15.6 pct y/y in July \u2014 Stats Office[71] <br/>Prices of consumer goods and services (Consumer Price Index, CPI) increased by 15.6 percent year on year and by 0.5 percent month on month in July 2022, the Central Statistical Office (GUS) reported in a flash estimate on Friday. <br/>In an earlier flash estimate GUS reported CPI had increased by 15.5 percent year on year and by 0.4 percent month on month in July 2022. <br/>Economists polled by PAP Business estimated that July's CPI would reach 15.4 percent year on year and 0.4 percent month on month. <br/>In June, the prices of consumer goods and services increased by 15.5 percent year on year and by 1.5 percent month on month. <br/>[66] <br/><br/>The State of Unemployment in Europe[72] <br/>As Statista's Anna Fleck shows in the infographic below, based on new data from Eurostat, in June 2022 the EU countries (plus the UK) where unemployment was most widespread were Spain (12.6 percent), Greece (12.3 percent) and Italy (8.1 percent). <br/>In contrast, Switzerland (2.0 percent), the Czech Republic (2.4 percent), Poland (2.7 percent) and Germany (2.8 percent) had the lowest rates. <br/>This compares to the average rate for the European Union of 6.0 percent, which is an improvement on the 7.2 percent average of the year before. <br/>[66] <br/><br/>Unemployment Slightly Rose in Czechia in July[73] <br/>At the end of July, 240,706 Czechs were seeking employment through Czech authorities, the Czech Labour Office's latest data show. This figure is 9,397 more people than the previous month, translating into a rise of 0.2% and a 3.3% unemployment rate. (chart) <br/>When compared to last year this is 31,472 less unemployed Czechs, translating to 0.4% decrease of unemployment in a year-on-year comparison. <br/>Development in the upcoming months will also be dependent on the war in Ukraine, particularly on the 'number of newly registered applicants for employment from Ukraine, impact of the energy crisis on the employers or persisting high inflation', Director of the Labour Office Viktor Najmon told Czech TV. <br/>By the end of July 73,908 Ukrainians worked in Czechia under the temporary asylum scheme. <br/>[66] <br/><br/>'I'd Vote for You, If You Had a Penis': Senator Who Lied About Heritage Claims Random People Made Sexist Comments[74] <br/>Elizabeth Warren, whose career was built on a lie about her heritage, allegedly claimed that people would 'come up to her' and tell her that she'd have their vote if only she was equipped with a penis. <br/>'Everyone comes up to me and says, 'I would vote for you, if you had a penis',' Warren reportedly told NBC Capitol Hill correspondent Ali Vitali, who wrote about the comment in her new book 'Electable: Why America Hasn't Put a Woman in the White House Yet,' Politico reports. <br/>The story was greeted with widespread derision on social media. '[Warren] should name a single person that has ever said this to her,' said Washington Free Beacon Executive Editor Brent Scher. <br/>The popular account NumbersMuncher, meanwhile, jokingly pointed out: 'So people took the time to go to Warren's events and spent hours there only to take the time to tell her they would vote for her 'if you had a penis'?' \u2014Just the News <br/>[66] <br/><br/>Amazon Deploys Palm Recognition to More Whole Foods Stores[75] <br/>65 Whole Food Stores in California will soon have Amazon One, the tech giant's palm print payment technology. The expansion was announced despite the privacy concerns the technology raises. <br/>Amazon One allows customers to pay for groceries using their palms, instead of their phone or card. The technology was first announced in 2020 and was trialed at Whole Food stores in New York, Los Angeles, Austin, and Seattle. According to the company, customers have said that the payment system is more convenient. <br/>[66] <br/><br/>Amazon Plots to Turn Surveillance Network Into Reality TV Series[76] <br/>Comedian Wanda Sykes will host a new show, called 'Ring Nation,' that will feature videos captured by Amazon Ring cameras, according to a report on Deadline.

This is in addition to the 3 million spent per day housing other migrants in hotels, including those who cross the English Channel illegally. <br/>The British broadsheet reported that, despite many Afghans being unhappy with remaining in hotels for such a long time, there is a reluctance to move to Scotland or Wales because they believe the British Home Nations are too cold. <br/>[66] <br/><br/>Atlantic Op-Ed Claims Catholic Rosary Has Become 'An Extremist Symbol'[127] <br/>Atlantic contributor Daniel Panneton declared that the Catholic rosary has become a 'symbol' of religious radicalism. <br/>The rosary is a string of beads or knots used by Catholics as they pray a sequence of prayers, but one writer warned they have taken on a far darker meaning in modern times. 'Just as the AR-15 rifle has become a sacred object for Christian nationalists in general, the rosary has acquired a militaristic meaning for radical-traditional (or 'rad trad') Catholics,' Panneton claimed in the Sunday piece titled, 'How the Rosary Became an Extremist Symbol.' <br/>He added, 'On this extremist fringe, rosary beads have been woven into a conspiratorial politics and absolutist gun culture. These armed radical traditionalists have taken up a spiritual notion that the rosary can be a weapon in the fight against evil and turned it into something dangerously literal.' <br/>[66] <br/><br/>Twitter Locks Accounts of Users Who Complained About Transgender Players in Women's Sports[128] <br/>During the Gaelic soccer women's cup final earlier this month, a 30-year-old transgender woman was allowed to play and the team, Na Gaeil Aeracha, won. Social media companies have been censoring content criticizing the fact a transgender woman was allowed to play on the women's team. <br/>Giulia Valentino, originally from Italy, moved to Dublin, Ireland, in 2019 and started playing rugby. Valentino has previously advocated for allowing transgender women to play on women's teams and criticized World Rugby for not allowing trans women at higher levels. While playing rugby, Valentino also complained about not being allowed to use the same changing room as biological women. <br/>[66] <br/><br/>Wokepox: The WHO is Asking for the Public's Help in Re-Naming Monkeypox[129] <br/>Further proving that the World Health Organization is misguided at best, useless at worst, the agency is out asking 'for the public's help' innot combating monkeypoxbut re-naming it. <br/>At least we know the agency has its priorities in order <br/>The WHO was out this past week asking for new names for monkeypox 'part of an ongoing effort to discourage harmful misconceptions associated with the current name,' according to Bloomberg. <br/>'WHO is holding an open consultation for a new disease name for monkeypox. Anyone wishing to propose new names can do so,' the agency said in an actual statement that was drafted up by someone who could have been allocating their energy to actually fighting the virus.

Evacuations and property losses have been minimal compared with much smaller blazes in densely populated areas of California. But eyeing how the Bootleg Fire \u2014 fueled by extreme weather \u2014 keeps growing by miles each day, officials with the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest in southwest Oregon are asking for more outside crews to be ready should there be a surge in fire activity there. 'Although the lightning activity predicted for early this week is expected to occur east of us, we are prepared for the worst, and hoping for the best,' Mike McCann, an assistant fire staff, said Monday in a statement released by the national forest. The worry is that dry conditions, a drought and the recent record-breaking heat wave in the region have created tinderbox conditions, so resources like fire engines are being recruited from places like Arkansas, Nevada and Alaska. Meanwhile, to the east, the Bootleg Fire's jaw-dropping size contrasted with its relatively small impact on people underscores the vastness of the American West and offers a reminder that Oregon, which is larger than Britain, is still a largely rural state, despite being known mostly for its largest city, Portland. In this photo provided by the Bootleg Fire Incident Command, the Bootleg Fire is seen smoldering in southern Oregon, Saturday, July 17, 2021. The destructive Bootleg Fire, one of the largest in modern Oregon history, has already burned more than 476 square miles (1,210 square kilometers), an area about the size of Los Angeles. Meteorologists predicted critically dangerous fire weather through at least Monday with lightning possible in both California and southern Oregon.

Michael Johnson/Bootleg Fire Incident Command via AP) If the fire were in densely populated parts of California, 'it would have destroyed thousands of homes by now,' said James Johnston, a researcher with Oregon State University's College of Forestry who studies historical wildfires. 'But it is burning in one of the more remote areas of the lower 48 states. It's not the Bay Area out there.' At least 2,000 homes have been evacuated at some point during the fire and another 5,000 threatened. At least 70 homes and more than 100 outbuildings have gone up in flames. Thick smoke chokes the area where residents and wildlife alike have already been dealing with months of drought and extreme heat. No one has died. Pushed by strong winds from the southwest, the fire is spreading rapidly to the north and east, advancing toward an area that's increasingly remote. Evacuation orders on the fire's southern edge, closer to more populous areas like Klamath Falls and Bly, have been lifted or relaxed as crews gain control. Now it's small, unincorporated communities like Paisley and Long Creek \u2014 both with fewer than 250 people \u2014 and scattered homesteads that are in the crosshairs. But as big as the Bootleg Fire is, it's not the biggest Oregon has seen. The fire's size so far puts it fourth on the list of the state's largest blazes in modern times, including rangeland fires, and second on the list of infernos specifically burning in forest. These megafires usually burn until the late fall or even early winter, when rain finally puts them out. The largest forest fire in modern history was the Biscuit Fire, which torched nearly 780 square miles in 2002 in the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest in southern Oregon and northern California. The Bootleg Fire is now about 25% contained. On Monday, flames forced the evacuation of a wildlife research station as firefighters had to retreat for the ninth consecutive day due to erratic and dangerous fire behavior. Sycan Marsh hosts thousands of migrating and nesting birds and is a key research station on wetland restoration in the upper reaches of the Klamath Basin. The Bootleg Fire was one of many fires burning in a dozen states, most of them in the U.S. West. Sixteen large uncontained fires burned in Oregon and Washington state alone on Monday. Extremely dry conditions and heat waves tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight. Climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive. And in Northern California, authorities expanded evacuations on the Tamarack Fire in Alpine County in the Sierra Nevada to include the mountain town of Mesa Vista. That fire, which exploded over the weekend and forced the cancellation of an extreme bike ride, was 36 square miles with no containment. Thunderstorms expected to roll through Monday night could bring winds to fan the flames and lightning that could spark new ones, the National Weather Service said.

With a recent increase in visitation to the San Bernardino National Forest, firefighting personnel and land managers are growing increasingly concerned about the uptick in illegal campfires that have sprung up all over the forest. Year to date, forest officers have documented an over 150% increase, from 33 in 2019 to 87 in 2020.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Campfires built on the ground, or ground fires, are always prohibited on the San Bernardino National Forest because it can escape or reignite after a visitor extinguishes it and leaves. It's what one cannot see underground and control that begs a different story than one might intend. Often thinking it's been extinguished, fires can and have smoldered underground and reignited dead leaf matter or even tree roots. All it takes is a gust of wind to get it going again, where it can quickly grow into a full-blown wildfire threatening not only the forest's resources and private properties, but the people who live, work and play in the forest as well.</p><p>Under current fire restrictions (<url normalizedValue=\"https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fs.usda.gov%2Fdetail%2Fsbnf%2Fhome%2F%3Fcid%3Dfseprd745330&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7C7698be24daf847d0cc5b08d80f085ad6%7Ced5b36e701ee4ebc867ee03cfa0d4697%7C0%7C0%7C637275875854753421&amp;sdata=nTjIgahPsMBfXfRhkhcT1o6E6rVTRld0hvWh8y%2FoyiE%3D&amp;reserved=0\">https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fs.usda.gov%2Fdetail%2Fsbnf%2Fhome%2F%3Fcid%3Dfseprd745330&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7C7698be24daf847d0cc5b08d80f085ad6%7Ced5b36e701ee4ebc867ee03cfa0d4697%7C0%7C0%7C637275875854753421&amp;sdata=nTjIgahPsMBfXfRhkhcT1o6E6rVTRld0hvWh8y%2FoyiE%3D&amp;reserved=0</url>), building, maintaining, attending or using a campfire is only allowed in fire rings provided by the Forest Service at open developed recreation sites, such as campgrounds and yellow post sites (Yellow post sites are dispersed individual campsites with a fire ring and picnic table; they are not attached to a campground).</p><p>The same goes for wood or charcoal barbecues, the prohibited use which has also increased, most notably in Lytle Creek and Mill Creek.

It has helped fighting forest fires and evacuating EU nationals - including more than 75.000 EU citizens during the current COVID-19 crisis - by coordinating and assisting in civil protection efforts. Medical equipment such as ventilators, personal protective equipment, vaccines and therapeutics and laboratory supplies have also been procured through rescEU to support national health services during the pandemic.</p><p>However, MEPs believe that while the EU Civil Protection Mechanismwas used successfully during the COVID-19 crisis, it also exposed limitations in the current crisis management set-up. When many member states are hit by the same emergency simultaneously they cannot rely on own assets and voluntary support. RescEU must therefore be strengthened to enable the EU to help quickly to fill these critical gaps so no one is left alone to deal with such emergencies.</p><p>To take these concerns into consideration, the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee today with 72 votes to 6 and 1 abstention, updated its position adopted on 5 March 2020.</p><p>Preparing for large-scale emergencies</p><p>The committee repeated its call from 5 March that a significantly larger amount should be allocated to preparedness, including for the purchase of necessary new rescEU equipment, materials and resources to be better able to assist member states when national capacities are overstretched. This would make it possible to respond swiftly and effectively to large-scale emergencies or to low probability events with a high impact including medical emergencies such as the COVID-19.</p><p>To be more transparent about the use of EU funding, MEPs also believe that it is necessary to specify how money is allocated across the three pillars of the mechanism \"prevention, preparedness and response\".</p><p>Quote</p><p>After the vote the rapporteur, Nikos ANDROULAKIS (SD, Greece) said: \"There is a need for more EU solidarity. With our proposals we better protect and assist European citizens, no matter in which member state they reside as we increase the co-financing rate to 100%, improve prevention actions and give the Commission the possibility to acquire, rent or lease the necessary capacities. Parliament is ready to start the negotiations. We want the Mechanism ready to address not only a possible second wave of the pandemic or forest fires but any other natural or man-made disaster in the future.\"</p><p>Next steps</p><p>The full House will vote during the14-17 September session after which Parliament is ready to start negotiations with member states to allow for entry into force of the revamped mechanism by January 2021.</p><p>Background</p><p>The Civil Protection Mechanism was set-up in 2013 to help member states deal with increasingly frequent natural disasters. Until 2019, it was only based on a voluntary system. In 2017 alone, the Mechanism was used 18 times for forest fire emergencies in Europe. Portugal, Italy, Montenegro, France, and Albania all received assistance via the Mechanism to respond to forest fires.</p><p>Since 2019, when rescEU was created, the EU can now also directly assist member states hit by disasters when national capacities are overstretched.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123932029</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60SV-PVH1-JCBF-S0V4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"636\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 3, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Although Indigneous Peoples continue to do remarkable work adapting to and protecting Mother Earth from climate change, the atrocities disproportionately impact American Indians, Alaska Natives, and their tribal and frontline communities impacted by climate and environmental justice. The unequal distribution of climate change impacts is caused by the systemic and historical injustices brought on by fossil fuel and polluting corporations, including but not limited to political and economic marginalization. The impacts include: loss of land and waters, discrimination and displacement, human rights violations, culture and knowledge erasure, sovereignty infringement, and countless other violations. Indigenous Peoples around the world hold the key to combating the interlinked crises of climate change and biodiversity loss. In this way, Indigneous Peoples' knowledge is critical to addressing deforestation, cultural burns and the impacts of wildfires.</p><p>In the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Working Group 1 established \"human-induced greenhouse gas emissions have led to an increased frequency and/or intensity of some weather and climate extremes since pre-industrial time, in particular for temperature extremes.\"1 Some of the extreme weather events include heavy precipitation, pluvial floods, river floods, droughts, fire weather, powerful storms (including tropical cyclones), etc. These extreme weather events can also compound upon a changing climate and increase societal and environmental risks.</p><p>A stand-out example is fire weather. Fire weather refers to the weather condition that is conducive to triggering and sustaining wildfires. This happens when climate change makes heat waves and droughts more frequent, creating an environment with higher-than-usual</p><p>temperatures, low soil moisture, low humidity/dry air, and strong winds. As climate change continues to intensify, the probability of fire weather becoming more pronounced in various regions increases.</p><p>Between 1979 and 2013, the mean length of the fire weather season increased by 19%, resulting in the doubling of land affected by long fire weather seasons globally.2 In the US, roughly 20 to 70 percent of land area experience conditions that were at least abnormally dry at any given time from 2000 to 2020 (see Figure 1).3 In the state of California, a fire-prone region, the area burned by wildfires has been increasing each year since 1950./4 In 2020, nearly 9,900 wildfires burned 4.3 million acres of California forests and land.5 At the same time, the extent of burnt area in California6 and other forests in the western US are linked to anthropogenic climate change via a significant increase in vapor pressure deficit, one of the primary drivers of forest and wildfires.7</p><p>How did we get here?</p><p>Human-induced greenhouse gas emissions can come from various sources, such as land-use changes like deforestation and wildfires. However, the IPCC identified fossil fuels as the dominant cause of global warming and climate change.8 The data shows that in 2018, 89% of global CO2 emissions came from fossil fuels and industry.9 It is unequivocal that climate change induced by global warming is intrinsically tied to fossil fuels and the industry that exploits it.</p><p>However, for more than 30 years the fossil fuel industry has known and lied about the risks and reality of climate change caused by greenhouse gasses emitted from fossil fuels. Even when a scientific consensus emerged that human-caused climate change is underway in the late 80s and early 90s,10 the industry and its political allies attacked the consensus and exaggerated uncertainties to disarm the public. Instead of stopping the destructive and exploitative practice of extracting fossil fuel, the industry actively orchestrates and funds denial and disinformation so as to stifle action and protect its profits.</p><p>The fundamentals of global warming caused by heat-trapping emissions dates back to the 1800s.</p><p>In the 1950s, scientists started to see significant risks to people and places posed by climate change.11 However, this time also marked the earlier beginnings of climate denialism. In 1959, physicist Edward Teller warned the industry about the dangers of increased carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere at the Energy and Man symposium, an event organized by the American Petroleum Institute in concert with the Columbia School of Business.12 After his testimony, Teller became ostracized by the scientific community. Soon after, Exxon (then called Humble oil and refine company) started to spin the truth about the impact of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel combustion by disseminating advertisements touting \"Each day Humble supplies enough energy to melt 7 million tons of glacier!\" (see Figure 2).</p><p>The Oil, Gas and Coal Majors including: BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Peabody Energy, and Shell, went on to deploy various tactics and campaigns to spread lies, misinformation, and conspiracy theories about the dangers of fossil fuel extraction and combustion.13 Their purpose was to confuse the public and decision-makers about the facts and violent reality of fossil fuel extraction and combustion in order to delay climate action, thereby protecting the industry's business interests and bottom line. While fossil fuel giants attacked the science and lobbied their way to manipulate policy to their liking, climate change worsened, bringing about the age of the climate crisis that is linked to other crises in biodiversity, food, water, deforestation and social stability. The impacts of climate change, however, will burden the lives of Indigenous Peoples and frontline communities the most, with intensifying threats of storms, droughts, forest damage, and wildfires.</p><p>Wildfires and Indigenous Peoples</p><p>These wildfires have devastating impacts on biodiversity and communities, especially on Indigenous Peoples' (IP) lands and communities. IPs live in places that are highly exposed to natural hazards, making them among the first to face the effects of climate change-induced wildfires. Although fire remains an important and sacred element of Indigenous culture, Indigneous cultural burns and US federal fire and forestry policies are starkly different. When wildfires have been as intense and uncontrollable as they have in recent years, they can destroy the foundation that plants and animals count on, along with creating post-fire water runoff, soil erosion and fish kills.14</p><p>A study in 2021 examined the impacts of wildfires in California and found that there is a higher percentage of Indigenous Peoples experiencing more frequent and severe fires.15 When such a climate disaster happens to IP, it exposes and intensifies pre-existing social inequalities and lack of equity left behind through generations of colonialism and injustices. At the same time, Indigenous communities in these areas often have inadequate funding, limited access to resources, and a lack of support from governments and other external sources. A study published by Columbia University found that air pollution in Native American communities is worse than in non-Native areas, despite overall improvements in air quality across the nation in the past 20 years.16 After the Slater and Devil Fire in 2020, the Karuk Tribe in northern California has experienced AQI readings of nearly 1600, setting concerning air quality records.17 Another study in 2018 found that American Indians and Alaska Natives were 20 percent more likely to have asthma compared to non-Hispanic whites.18 As IPs continue to face difficulties accessing resources to combat the impacts of wildfires that include acquiring air filters and upgrading homes to mitigate air pollutants resulting from wildfires, the disparities in health, economic, environmental, and justice will continue to grow.</p><p>US Fire Management Policy</p><p>As settler colonialism expanded across the western US, a destructive relationship between land and fire began. The establishment of the Forest Service in 1905 and the National Parks Service in 1916 dictated the role of fire management in the US as one of passive protection over active management. As a result, most Indigenous practices of cultural burning were prohibited. New initiatives like the 1935 10 A.M. Policy (which mandated all fires must be thoroughly controlled by 10 A.M. the following morning), the application of fire suppression practices via the Civilian Conservation Corps, and the advertising campaign of Smokey Bear were among the leading features of a new federal movement to actively suppress fires.19 However, during this period, \"prescribed burning\" began to generate the interest of some for fire's potential to regenerate ecosystems. In 1978, the Forest Service began to drift from practices of total suppression (such as eliminating its 10 A.M. Policy) to ones that experimented with starting fires on federal lands.</p><p>A decade later a number of states began implementing prescribed burns, under a variety of criteria, standards, and safety requirements, which were later consolidated under the 2009 Federal Land Assistance, Management, and Enhancement (FLAME) Act.20 However, cultural burns and Indigenous fire practices are in stark contrast to federal government prescribed burns.</p><p>In recent decades, a greater understanding of climate change has linked bad forest management policy with worsening wildfires and unleashing many consequences. Increasingly dry conditions and water-deficient vegetation are heightening opportunities for wildfires to ignite and spread.</p><p>The result of decades of passive fire suppression in the US has seen a buildup of forest biomass leading to hotter fires that produce more energy and therefore become increasingly unpredictable and difficult to control. For example, a 2000 prescribed burn by the US Forest Service escaped its intended boundary of 9,000 acres, and spread to over 48,000 acres, leading to the tragic Cerro Grande Fire, in which the loss of homes and livelihoods totaled over $1 billion.21 Bad fire policy and practice threatens the health of wildlife, humans, and their habitats and is only expected to increase as climate change worsens.</p><p>Some policymakers and fire experts are beginning to recognize the importance of what Indigenous Peoples have been doing for thousands of years -- actively setting and managing fires is essential for the long-term sustainability of ecosystems. In the last decade, several nations, including the US, have promoted robust and active fire management with better risk-reduction strategies in consultation with Indigenous Peoples. The United Nations Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, outlines that \"Indigenous peoples, through their experience and traditional knowledge, provide an important contribution to the development and implementation of plans and mechanisms for disaster risk reduction.\"22 Programs to combat wildfire using integrative approaches between Western science and Traditional Indigenous Knowledge have begun on select projects in Australia, Canada, the US, Brazil, and Botswana. However, collaboration between state and Tribal governments regarding fire management is not a sustainable solution for long-term health if such policies and frameworks are dictated by the same federal agenda. In an age of worsening wildfires linked to climate change, policies must center and uphold Indigenous-led approaches to cultural burns, fire management and forestry that follows the autonomy of Tribes to practice cultural burns the ways they have done for centuries.</p><p>Looking Ahead</p><p>Indigenous Peoples have been practicing cultural burning as a key part of successful land practices for millennia. The regular burning of forests, woodlands, grasslands, and other areas has led to multiple benefits such as decreasing detritus, recycling nutrients, controlling insects and pathogens, managing wildlife, modifying the structure of vegetation, and maintaining habitat for shade-intolerant species.23 24 Additionally, attentive, sustained management of lands through fire have been shown to decrease both the likelihood and severity of natural wildfires, which is especially significant given the growing and ever more extreme wildfires, particularly in California and the overarching context of our current climate crisis.25</p><p>Moving forward, it is imperative that policy foreground and prioritize Traditional Indigenous Knowledge regarding fire management without co-opting or instrumentalizing it. This means ensuring Indigenous-led approaches to fire use uphold Tribal autonomy and decision-making power over when, where, and how cultural fires are burned instead of the 'integration' of Traditional Indigenous Knowledge within dominant approaches (such as fire suppression) or the mere 'consultation' of Indigenous Peoples. Moreover, prescribed fires or policies that limit how IP conduct cultural burns must cease.</p><p>In order to address and reverse climate change, fossil fuel extraction must stop at the source. This means no new fossil fuel projects and halting or scaling back existing fossil fuel projects. To do this, fossil fuel corporations that have led climate misinformation campaigns must be held accountable. Although much of the climate denialism has begun to stop, corporations have now shifted to climate misinformation in the form of backing false climate solutions like carbon offsets, carbon capture and storage, \"net-zero\" emissions targets and hydrogen production.26 These emissions cannot be 'offset' through carbon credits. Fossil fuels must stay in the ground and Indigenous Peoples' traditional knowledge must be followed.</p><p>* * *</p><p>My name is Thomas Joseph. I am a Hoopa Valley Tribal Member, a descendant of the Lone Pine Paiute Shoshone Tribe and the Climate Change Education Organizer of the Indigenous Environmental Network. It's an honor to be invited to speak in today's hearing.</p><p>Since time immemorial my people have called California home. I come from the villages of the Tsewenaldin and Me'dil ding of the Hupa People along the Trinity River in what can be identified today as the Six Rivers National Forest, and my father's place, Payahuundau of the Paiute Shoshone which is often miscalled Owens Valley.</p><p>The Hupa People reside on their ancestral territories which is the largest federally recognized reservation in California with those lands mostly being forested. Our relationship with our lands has always been and will always be a reciprocal relationship. I have witnessed firsthand the effects of climate change. These past few weeks our community has been inundated with forest fire smoke from multiple wildfires across our ancestral lands. This heavy smoke, increasing year after year, is a health risk and economic strain on our Tribal government and people.</p><p>We only prosper and thrive when our lands and rivers are healthy and the vital importance of treating our lands with compassion and respect lays the foundation on how we treat each other.</p><p>Our cultural and ways of being are directly tied to our relationship with our Mother Earth. Our ceremonies which teach us our ways of being, which teach us fundamental practices of carrying for our Mother Earth come from a knowledge base structure that outdates any university ro Western science-based system. I don't say this to undermine or belittle but to demonstrate the vast amount of knowledge our educational system holds when it comes to management of lands, which we would characterize as not management of lands but relationship with lands.</p><p>Our ceremonies are directly tied to the lands and waters without this connection to place this vast knowledge structure would be a great loss. Not just for our tribe but all humans. As these teachings can help humans rebalance the imbalance the earth is currently experiencing and give segue towards real climate solutions.</p><p>As Forest Dwelling Indigenous People, we understand the vital importance of the traditional knowledge our people have practiced for thousands of years. We've acknowledged when our rivers and forests are sick and ill, so are the people. I believe the current pandemic of COVID 19 is a perfect example of just that. Our planet is sick, and humanity is reflecting that.</p><p>We are currently witnessing the extinction of numerous lives on earth from our winged, four legged and finned relations. Salmon are under great threat from warming rivers, wildfires, and mudslides. Salmon is a staple part of our diet and plays a vital role in our ecosystems and ceremonies. Earlier this summer a mudslide was caused by ongoing drought and a wildfire.</p><p>This mudslide caused a huge amount of debris and dirt to flow into the Klamath River which choked out the oxygen in the river causing a massive salmon kill. The drought and high temperature in California have caused our forest to become extremely vulnerable to raging wildfires.</p><p>These wildfires threaten wildlife, waterways, even human life. Our tribal community has spent numerous dollars on fighting these fires, on evacuations, humanitarian aid, safety zones, air quality locations, sending the elders to the coast, and this list goes on and on, this includes the government as well as the citizens. Our forests are becoming so dry that our old growth trees can't even handle a significant amount of snowfall. This last winter our old growth trees were snapping during snowfall, which puts our forest at further risk of dangerous wildfires.</p><p>The threat of our tribal nation being burnt out by a wildfire is extremely high. This loss, this break of a reciprocal relationship with our Mother Earth is something our people have never faced.</p><p>Just to name a few: Surviving settler invasion, surviving the 49ner gold rush, surviving forced assimilation including boarding schools, the Hupa people are still here and still carrying on the traditional indigenous and ecological knowledge of our ancestors through ceremony, through our ways of being, through our reciprocal relationship with our Mother Earth and relationship to place.</p><p>This threat is a threat of genocide and climate change is to blame, as well as the culprits of climate change. We know man has caused climate change, we know greenhouse gasses have caused our climate to warm, we know fossil fuels are the cause of greenhouse gasses. We know fossil fuel corporations have lied and continue to lie about climate change.</p><p>Our people have never been at war with this government, we are not in opposition of you, we are with you as our people have laid their lives to defend and protect this country at greater percentage than any other. It is our duty to protect these lands and we side with you in this endeavor, but...</p><p>We must be clear in our task at hand. There is no time to waver. A great genocide is upon our tribe and your people and families are next. I am not here to ask but to demand that we do all we can to protect and defend our lands, our people, our ways of being for our very existence depends upon it. We must hold the fossil fuel industry accountable for the atrocities they have caused. We must move forward by ending the fossil fuel industry and keep fossil fuels in the ground. We must reject the loopholes and payoffs that continue business as usual for the fossil fuel industry like carbon markets, carbon capture and storage and Net-Zero pledges.

Now Penn State researchers have added a small amount of background noise to enhance very weak signals in a light source too dim to sense.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In contrast to most sensors, for which noise is a problem that should be suppressed, they found that adding just the right amount of background noise can actually increase a signal too weak for sensing by normal sensors, to a level that can reach detectability.</p><p>Although their sensor, based on a two-dimensional material called molybdenum disulfide, detects light, the same principle can be used to detect other signals, and because it requires very little energy and space compared to conventional sensors, could find wide adaptation in the coming Internet of Things (IoT). IoT will deploy tens of millions of sensors to monitor conditions in the home and factories, and low energy requirements would be a strong bonus.</p><p>\"This phenomenon is something that is frequently seen in nature,\" says Saptarshi Das, an assistant professor of engineering science and mechanics. \"For example, a paddlefish that lives in muddy waters cannot actually find its food, which is a phytoplankton called Daphnia, by sight. The paddlefish has electroreceptors that can pick up very weak electric signal from the Daphnia at up to 50 meters. If you add a little bit of noise, it can find the Daphnia at 75 meters or even 100 meters. This ability adds to the evolutionary success of this animal.\"</p><p>Another interesting example is the jewel beetle, which can detect a forest fire at 50 miles distance. The most advanced infrared detector can only detect at 10 to 20 miles. This is due to a phenomenon these animals use called stochastic resonance.</p><p>\"Stochastic resonance is a phenomenon where a weak signal which is below the detection threshold of a sensor can be detected in the presence of a finite and appropriate amount of noise,\" according to Akhil Dodda, a graduate student in engineering science and mechanics and co-first author on a new paper appearing this week in Nature Communications.</p><p>In their paper, the researchers demonstrate the first use of this technique to detect a subthreshold photonic signal.</p><p>One possible use being considered is for troops in combat. Army personnel in the field already carry very bulky equipment. It is unfeasible to add the heavy, power-hungry equipment required to enhance a subthreshold signal. Their technique is also applicable in resource-constrained environments or beneath the ocean where people want to monitor very weak signals. It could also be used in volcanic locations or to monitor earthquakes in time to give an alarm.</p><p>\"Who would have thought that noise could play a constructive role in signal detection? We have challenged tradition to detect otherwise undetectable signals with miniscule energy consumption. This can open doors to a totally unexplored and ignored field of noise enhanced signal detection,\" said Aaryan Oberoi, a graduate student from the Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics and co-first author on the paper.</p><p>Their next step is to demonstrate this technique on a silicon photodiode, which would make the device very scalable. Any state-of-the art sensor can be enhanced by this concept, Das says.</p><p>The team has filed a provisional patent application with a full patent to follow.</p><p>Other authors on the paper, titled \"Stochastic Resonance in MoS2 Photodetector,\" are graduate student Tanushree H Choudhury, materials science and engineering, and Joan Redwing, professor of materials science and engineering and electrical engineering, all of Penn State.</p><p>The work was partially funded by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research.

They're the state's official marine mammal and the state even has a hotline for people to call if they see a manatee in distress, which sometimes just means the playful animal has found itself caught in a crab trap, according to Andy Garrettthe state's manatee rescue coordinator at the Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute. </p><p><br/>'They're very curious. I've heard them compared to the intelligence of a dog. There are some manatees that are going to a brain laboratory that they train to identify shapes and colors,' Garrett said. <br/>A manatee investigates a GPS tag. Image via FWC. <br/>But Florida's beloved manatees are now facing what Garrett described as a 'sad reality.' <br/> Marine biologists first started to log an uptick in manatee deaths in December 2020. This year manatee deaths are on track to double last year's dead manatee county. Just halfway through 2021, Florida Fish &amp;#38; Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) logged 832 manatee deaths out of an estimated 6,300 manatees in Florida. <br/> 'It's kind of a total collapse and now everyone's scrambling because, what do we do?' Garret said. <url normalizedValue=\"https://circulate.it/r/yfPazCXkV_sxrSQ2XQTOeBNIxIdPJ3aRwS-GUrFLrbF9yjZHQ-pzBVX1OPiVPOHCAkMZ3WylBMsP2nTVwfGhKrms46c/floridaeducationchampions.com/sign\">https://circulate.it/r/yfPazCXkV_sxrSQ2XQTOeBNIxIdPJ3aRwS-GUrFLrbF9yjZHQ-pzBVX1OPiVPOHCAkMZ3WylBMsP2nTVwfGhKrms46c/floridaeducationchampions.com/sign</url><br/>Over his 22 years working with manatees, Garrett said he has seen other peaks in manatee deaths before, but this year the state is logging a record-breaking number of manatee deaths, often because of starvation. <br/> 'When we were doing our investigations and doing necropsies, we saw that they were in really bad condition. They had depleted fat stores, nothing in their GI systems. They were starving,' Garrett explained. <br/>A rescued manatee calf. Image via FWC. <br/>The number of starving manatees was enough to earn the label 'Unusual Mortality Event' (UME) from U.S. Fish and Wildlife in February. The UME label, a designation declared 71 times since 1991, involves a significant die-off of any marine mammal population and 'demands immediate response,' according to federal law. <br/> But how to respond is still up in the air. <br/> 'We're having meetings all over the place,' Garrett said of the biologists, veterinarians and federal managers working to save the manatees. <br/> The cause of the manatee die-off is known. Seagrass, which manatees eat, is dying due to the eutrophication of Florida's waters. Eutrophication happens when nutrients are in excess. Fertilizer runoff from agriculture and residential sources pollutes waterways. Eutrophication can cause blue-green algal blooms, which sit on the top of the water blocking sunlight seagrass and other parts of the ecosystem need to thrive. <br/>This is what algal blooms can look like. These were found floating on top of the St. John's River in 2010. Image via FWC. <br/>Algal blooms have been particularly bad in Indian River Lagoon, an area experiencing the highest number of manatee deaths. Garrett described what happened under the water in Indian River Lagoon as a 'forest fire.' <br/> 'It's a desert. The grass is gone. So, all of the animals that use that seagrass to live \u2014 fish, the crabs, the smaller shrimps and all of that \u2014 they're all gone. I mean there's nothing. There's nowhere for them to live,' Garrett said. <br/> Garrett said scientists have known about the issue for years, but the recent infiltration of algal blooms in Mosquito Lagoon, the last holdout for Indian River Lagoon manatees to eat seagrass during the winter, started filling up with algal blooms last year, contributing to the UME. <br/> 'The manatees are the ones that are last ones left, and when they're dying off, then you know the ecosystem has totally collapsed,' Garrett explained. <br/> Fixing an entire ecosystem is a 'longterm' solution that could take years and requires human cooperation and re-cultivating seagrass beds, Garret said. <br/> With another round of extreme manatee die-offs expected next winter scientists don't have time to wait. <br/> When the water gets colder during the winter, manatees like to hang out around power plants, which create warm water. Once there, manatees don't like to venture back into cold water for food. That's why the winter season is much worse for manatees if food sources near power plants are down, which is the case in many parts of Florida. <br/>Manatees gather in warm water near a power plant in Port St. John as FWC researchers measure water quality. Image via FWC. <br/>The seemingly obvious interim solution is to feed the manatees, but scientists don't like feeding wild animals who can then become dependent on an artificial food source. <br/> 'It's like feeding a squirrel or a duck in the park. Now they're really relying on you to keep providing it, and is that a good plan? You can imagine the back-and-forth discussions. It's like 'Well if we don't do this there might not be any manatees at the end of this to even have to deal with the issue later on,'' Garrett said. <br/> Garrett said if they do decide to feed the manatees it would be a 'directed and well thought out and controlled situation' with no assistance needed from citizens eager to help the manatees. <br/> Other solutions bandied about, Garrett said, include planting other types of vegetation for the manatees to eat and asking a group that sprays errant vegetation in canals to stop doing that in case the manatees want to eat it. <br/> In the meantime, Garrett's team is fielding calls from citizens to the manatee distress hotline reporting sick manatees. If the manatees are determined to be sick or starving, teams of about 11 manatee rescuers are dispatched to capture and transport the animal, which sometimes weighs upwards of 1,200 pounds, to any of the four manatee hospitals in the state, which are fast filling up. <br/> 'People think of them as gentle giants, but they don't want to be caught. They are a wild animal, so it's really dangerous,' Garrett said. <br/>Biologists at FWRI release a rescued manatee into Pinellas County waters. Image via FWC. <br/>Manatee calves are becoming frequent hospital visitors as their moms starve trying to feed both themselves and their baby, Garrett said. <br/> Once in the rehabilitation facility the goal is to get manatees back on their feet, so to speak, so they can be released into the wild. But even that is only a temporary fix as long as the ecosystem doesn't have the food manatees need to survive. <br/> 'Obviously, we're in our world. We're worried about the manatees and trying to figure out something for them, but really the solution is a longterm one. They have got to figure out a way to clean up the water quality,' Garrett said. <br/><br/> Post Views: 44 <br/></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-FLPO10009352162945152977125979100189</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FLPO-10009352</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63DK-M771-F03R-N4R0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484303</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1111\"/><timeReceived>9:25 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Florida Politics</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 20, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Florida</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Manatee</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>manatee deaths</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>APolitical</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Headlines</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>manatee rescue</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST000A38F</classCode><className>MARINE MAMMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001839</classCode><className>WILDLIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009OG7</classCode><className>MAMMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D76Q</classCode><className>MARINE BIOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008Z8M</classCode><className>BIOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1EZ</classCode><className>STARVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CFER</classCode><className>ANIMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009REC</classCode><className>BLOGS &amp;

The goal is to deter arsonists, educate the public about fire safety, and spot blazes before they swirl out of control, says Tony Pointer, who manages the\u00a0network\u00a0for the Irvine Ranch Conservancy, which oversees nearly 30,000 acres of open space.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"What a great way to give back. I get to stand and look at beautiful country,\" says Noma Bates, another volunteer. \u00a0</p><p>Mr. Pointer adds, \"We sell Orange County Fire Watch as the easiest volunteer activity with the most impact on the land.\"</p><p>But being a wildfire watchdog is no walk in the park. Well, actually, it often\u00a0is a walk in the park, but under dicey circumstances.</p><p>\"If the wind is high, it's awful,\" says Lynda Armbruster, citing dust-bowl conditions that require goggles and a mask. Nevertheless, she regularly signs up for six- or eight-hour shifts. \"You protect what you love,\" explains Ms. Armbruster, a retired college professor who's been with OCFW since its inception in 2006. \"It's like people who rescue animals. You have a thing that captures your heart.\"</p><p>In California's unending battle against wildfires, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of insurance payouts and charred countryside. The fire watch was formed with that in mind, and its members feel passionate about \"helping the land stay safe,\" Ms. Bates says.</p><p>On average, Mr. Pointer says OCFW patrols 18 to 20 days a year, mostly in the fall and winter, with up to 70 volunteers in the field at a time.</p><p>Invariably, the trigger is a weather phenomenon that inspired this 1938 passage from novelist Raymond Chandler's \"Red Wind\": \"There was a desert wind blowing that night. It was one of those hot dry Santa Anas that come down through the mountain passes and curl your hair and make your nerves jump and your skin itch. On nights like that every booze party ends in a fight. Meek little wives feel the edge of the carving knife and study their husbands' necks. Anything can happen.\"</p><p>It's that \"anything\" factor volunteers are urged to zero in on: suspicious activity (\"hikers\" wearing street clothes or taking photos), people operating weed wackers (which can throw off sparks), cars pulling onto grassy shoulders (hot catalytic converters can ignite vegetation). In 2017, a road flare that skittered off a freeway started the Canyon Fire, which burned 2,600 acres and sparked a second, larger inferno.</p><p>\"Thank you for saving us\"</p><p>Everything gets reported to OCFW's command center via cellphone or ham radio. After Ms. Armbruster called in the Canyon Fire 2, she was besieged by \"panicked residents asking me what to do. I told them to pack their cars and be ready to go.\" One family later drove up and rolled down a window, and a 3-year-old boy chirped, \"Thank you for saving us.\"\u00a0</p><p>OCFW is a vast improvement over fire reconnaissance in the 1800s and early 20th century, when lookout towers were the chief detection method in the United States - and bells, flags, lanterns, and heliographs (Morse code via mirrors and sunlight) were the only ways to communicate.\u00a0</p><p>Orange County's first lookout station debuted in 1912 atop Santiago Peak in Cleveland National Forest and had an Osborne fire finder (a sighting device to pinpoint smoke locations) and a direct phone line to the fire warden's house, according to old newspaper articles unearthed by Ron Kemnow of the Forest Fire Lookout Association. \u00a0</p><p>One of the tower's earliest employees, Winifred Hunter, moved in \"with her gun and two dogs\" after a string of male lookouts buckled under the solitude.\u00a0</p><p>By 1946, three more observation towers had sprung up in the county, but gradually fell into disuse, rendered obsolete by spotter planes, budget cuts, and poor visibility caused by smog. Today, the county's only lookout stations are replicas at Disney's California Adventure theme park.\u00a0</p><p>The concept behind modern flame scouting originated in the mid-1970s. A fire prevention officer in San Bernardino, California, hatched the idea of adding volunteer CB radio operators to the \"Red Flag Fire Patrols\" conducted by forest rangers, according to a 1974 San Bernardino Sun story. Like their 2021 counterparts, the CB crews worked in pairs and drove around with magnetic \"Fire Patrol\" signs affixed to their cars.</p><p>Actor Buddy Ebsen of \"Beverly Hillbillies\" fame organized a similar program - Arson Watch - in the Malibu area after a 1982 wildfire nearly torched his ranch.</p><p>Cellphones fueled the latest crop of patrol groups. OCFW is the largest in Southern California, Mr. Pointer says, but there are dozens of others.\u00a0</p><p>Most of OCFW's members are retirees and nature lovers who joined the program after volunteering with the county parks system or the Irvine Ranch Conservancy. Both agencies mandate multiple hours of training, including CPR and first-aid classes.\u00a0</p><p>Fire watch recruits get an additional four hours of instruction, along with a manual that covers everything from how to park your car while on duty (always facing out, for quick escape) to where to find restrooms at the 35 locations that members monitor when the National Weather Service declares \"red flag\" fire danger.\u00a0</p><p>Most of the watch sites are near park entrances or along canyon roads. Less extroverted volunteers can sign up for a dam that overlooks a Christmas tree farm, an oil field, and one of Southern California's biggest redwood groves. Or they can lurk at the back of a Catholic graveyard with panoramic views of high-risk mountainsides.</p><p>Watching via camera during pandemic\u00a0</p><p>The group also keeps tabs on 34 wilderness cameras set up by utility companies, a popular option during the pandemic. During 2020's Blue Ridge Fire, remote observers spotted a small, secondary blaze even before nearby residents noticed it, Mr. Pointer says.</p><p>How effective is OCFW's program? The best measure would be the number of blazes that never start, but that's impossible to quantify, says Sean Doran, an Orange County Fire Authority captain. \"We appreciate partnerships of any kind, and having volunteers out there is a deterrent,\" he adds, noting that the majority of wildfires are caused by people, although usually inadvertently.</p><p>In a typical year, OCFW reports four smoke or flame sightings, Mr. Pointer says. \"We handle more medical emergencies,\" he adds, because volunteers posted at trailheads routinely encounter injured hikers.\u00a0</p><p>\"There's not a lot of glory,\" says Mr. Hutchinson, the retired fire captain. \"But there's lots of appreciation.\"\u00a0</p><p>People drop off cookies, deliver hot chocolate, and honk their horns, volunteers say. And there are less conventional rewards. \"One guy asked if I wanted free gun training,\" Ms. Armbruster recalls.\u00a0</p><p>Interacting with the public and explaining fire safety is \"a big part of our success,\" says Mr. Pointer, who hopes to expand to 500 volunteers covering 50 sites.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0Although video feeds and artificial intelligence are gaining ground in fire detection, he says, they're no substitute for a human touch. AI sometimes mistakes clouds - or dust kicked up by a truck - for smoke, he notes. Ultimately, he says, \"I don't see how you can replace a person.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CSM-94a5cb543a869751e38f255644ebb3d1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CSM2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:647N-MVV1-DYRK-B3TV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7945</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-12-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1251\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Christian Science Publishing Society All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Christian Science Monitor</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"12\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>December 6, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CEAJ</classCode><className>HIKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DROP</classCode><className>PROTECTIVE CLOTHING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

The comment was written on Nov. 29, 2021, and posted on Dec. 1, 2021:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p>BlueRibbon Coalition/ShareTrails (BRC) is writing to provide feedback for The Penasco least chipmunk (Neotamias minimus atristriatus) listing as an endangered species. BRC is a national non-profit organization that champions responsible recreation and encourages a strong conservation ethic and individual stewardship. We champion responsible use of public lands and waters for the benefit of all recreationists by educating and empowering our members to secure, protect, and expand shared outdoor recreation access and use by working collaboratively with natural resource managers and other recreationists. Our members use motorized and non-motorized means of recreation, including OHVs, horses, mountain bikes, and hiking to enjoy federally managed lands throughout the United States, including those of the Forest Service. Many of our members and supporters live in New Mexico or travel across the country to visit New Mexico and use motorized vehicles to access federally managed lands throughout New Mexico. BRC members visit this land for motorized recreation, snowmobiling, sightseeing, photography, rockhounding, hunting, wildlife and nature study, camping, observing cultural resources, and other similar pursuits. BRC members and supporters have concrete, definite, and immediate plans to continue such activities in the future.</p><p>Anthropogenic Disturbances</p><p>When Wildearth Guardians petitioned to have the Penasco Least Chipmunk listed as an Endangered Species they claimed,\" that listing of the subspecies was warranted due to the present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range and the fragmentation and isolation of small populations.\"/1</p><p>The most current information provided in the White Mountains is from 2018. We would like to see more current data regarding the species.</p><p>It is suggested through best available science that anthropogenic disturbances may actually be beneficial to the species. For example, the Penasco chipmunk feeds off seeds from sunflowers. \"Penasco least chipmunks in the White Mountains likely forage primarily on the seeds and flowers of forbs, particularly species of Asteraceae (Frey and Hays 2017, p. 34). Bailey (1931, p. 91) observed the subspecies foraging on sunflower (Helianthus spp.) seeds along fencelines and on wheat (Triticum sp.) and oats (Avena sativa) at the edges of agricultural fields in the Sacramento Mountains.\"</p><p>According to the USDA Sunflower (Helianthus annuus) fact sheet, the plant is a common roadside weed./2</p><p>Suggesting the best possible habitat for sunflowers to grow and thrive is along roads. Creating wilderness or designated habitat areas without roads would be detrimental to the sunflower species but also to the Penasco least chipmunk as they feed and survive off sunflower seeds. The weed grows best in \"disturbed areas\"./3</p><p>At the very least, FWS should explore ways that anthropogenic disturbances can benefit the species.</p><p>\"There have been no detections of Penasco least chipmunk in the Sacramento Mountains since 1966, despite extensive survey effort, indicating that this population is likely extirpated.\" Because there have been no known chipmunks habitating this area since 1966 there is no scientific evidence that this area can support the Penasco least chipmunk. The species has left this area long ago when anthropogenic disturbances were rare, leading us to believe that not only do anthropogenic disturbances help aid in the vitality of the species but they were not the cause of the species leaving the area in the first place.</p><p>Wildfire</p><p>A few of the potential stressors that were identified were recreation development, land use and wildfire. One wildfire could cause the entire species to go extinct. We support the Forest Service in properly managing the forests to prevent wildfires that could cause harm to the species. However, many conservation groups actively litigate forest projects that help mitigate fires. These same conservation groups are the ones who want to list the Penasco least chipmunk as endangered and create critical habitat. One of the best things that can be done to protect this species and prevent extinction is to actively manage forests to prevent wildfires.</p><p>Also according to the New Mexico Game &amp; Fish, the Penasco chipmunk only has regular occurrence within Otero County. The White Mountain Wilderness sits north of the area of occurrences leading us to believe that Wilderness and areas with restrictive management without many anthropogenic disturbances are not conducive to the Penasco Chipmunks vitality. Wilderness already makes up 57% of the area. BRC strongly encourages any plan revisions to strongly consider removing any wilderness characteristic areas and pursue forest fire projects.</p><p>According to the Endangered Species Act a species may be listed as endangered or threatened if \"The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range; \" It is apparent the destruction, modification and curtailment of the Penasco least Chipmunks habitat have come through restrictions and wilderness.</p><p>Mountain Bike Races</p><p>BRC believes that allegations of the chipmunks being injured and fatally hurt were overly exaggerated and not based on best available science. A controlled study should be conducted to show the actual effects of mountain bikes on the species. It is important to note that hikers could also potentially feed and harm the Penasco least chipmunk but hiking is not listed as a potential threat. BRC supports both forms of recreation and best available science must be used and cited in making these recommendations.</p><p>Ski Resort</p><p>BRC supports recognizing that winter skiing has little to no impact and we don't believe winter recreation needs to be curtailed. The recommendations are no summer maintenance which is very vague. Summer maintenance could be viewed and implemented in a variety of different ways. The fact that this is the one area where the chipmunk is still surviving suggests that this area may actually be helping in the vitality of the species.</p><p>BRC recommends that in order to maintain the special use permit for the ski resort, the tribe must become an interested partner on this subject. Collecting adequate data on population levels and trends should be required and given to the public as a condition for maintaining the special use permit for the ski area. This will help to recognize stressors that could be negatively impacting the species.</p><p>We would like to close by saying we support \"shared use\". As long as overall visitation numbers are appropriate for the affected resources, motorized and non-motorized users can be compatible with one another so long as individual users understand designations and plan their activities accordingly. Indeed, motorized and nonmotorized recreation use often overlap as OHV's often increase accessibility to non-motorized recreational activities such as hiking, camping, equestrian use, etc. We also hold that responsible recreational use of public lands can exist in harmony with ecosystem needs.</p><p>BRC would like to be considered an interested public for this project.

As you may have guessed from the fact that meese* tend to confront their problems by head-butting them, meese are neither subtle nor circumspect. As a result, they name their children using easily identifiable characteristics; Loudmouth acquired her name because her bellow was so deafening that it could shake boulders loose from mountaintops and topple passing birds from the sky. For context, Loudmouth's parents were named Big Round Snout and Often Wiggles Tail, and her siblings were Slightly Tilted Left Antler and Intimidating Stare. Anyway, I digress. Loudmouth lived happily with her family in the woods of southeast Pennsylvania,** roaming through the trees and munching roots and twigs. Occasionally, life became a bit boring, but when this happened she played chase with her siblings or explored new paths in the forest.</p><p>One day, however, as Loudmouth wandered alone through the woods, she caught a glimpse of a billowing, dark gray cloud rising in the distance. Curious, she galloped towards the apparition and, as she approached, an acrid scent attacked her nostrils. Almost every instinct told her to turn back -she'd never seen a fire, but her parents had warned her of the utter destruction it could wreak. Every instinct, that is, except for a tiny voice that whispered, \"This is so cool! When else might you be able to witness a fire in person? You can just take a quick peek and then get out of there.\" As so often happens in these situations, Loudmouth decided that majority rule was rubbish and followed the tyrannical advice of the one small voice.</p><p>As Loudmouth approached the smoke, she heard shouting. Human voices. She'd never seen a human in person, but she'd heard about them. Strange creatures with strange habits who raced around in smelly contraptions and cut down forests (because they were too lazy to walk around the tree trunks, apparently). Peering through the branches warily, Loudmouth gazed upon an amazing scene. Humans were running to and fro around a burning structure as tall as a fifty-year-old oak tree - and yet, not all of them were running away from the coiling, devouring flames that leapt in merry delight as they climbed up the structure's walls. Instead, some of them ran directly towards the conflagration, wielding long tubes that shot streams of water in great arcs. When the water hit the flames, a great sizzling sound rent the air and a hazy screen of smoke and steam undulated upwards. It was a beautiful, terrifying dance, a war of water and fire, control and chaos. Loudmouth couldn't take her eyes away.</p><p>After the last flames had flickered out, leaving only a smoldering pile of dull black coals, the crowd gathered around the scene let out a huge cheer. \"Hooray! Hooray for the firemen!\" they shouted.</p><p>\"Huh,\" Loudmouth thought. \"So that's what they call the people with the water tubes.\"</p><p>That night, when Loudmouth returned home, she announced to her entire family, \"Guess what? I know what I want to be when I grow up! I want to be a fireman.\"</p><p>Her family greeted her with stunned silence. Slightly Tilted Left Antler and Intimidating Stare looked at her quizzically, while Big Round Snout and Often Wiggles Tail frowned with furrowed brows.</p><p>\"Um...Loudmouth, honey...you don't really need to have a profession,\" her mother explained in the patient tone Loudmouth hated. \"Your job is to be a moose. And unfortunately, meese can't be firemen. That's a people kind of job.\"</p><p>\"Don't be speciesist!\" Loudmouth bellowed. Her family jumped - it was a loud bellow, even for her. \"I can be whatever I want. I don't care if you think I can only be a moose. And I'm tired of just being the loud moose, too! Don't you ever want to be more than a moose with a big round snout, or a moose with an intimidating stare?\"</p><p>Her family's confused expressions indicated that no, they had never felt a desire to be something other than meese with big round snouts or intimidating stares. Some meese - and people - just aren't born with that much ambition. That's okay.</p><p>Loudmouth huffed. \"Hmph. Well, I'm going to be a fireMOOSE, like it or not!\" She wasn't exactly sure how this would work, but she stomped off with the full intention of finding out.</p><p>Before long, Loudmouth realized that darkness was falling. She was slightly lost and quite tired, and beginning to feel like figuring out how to be a firemoose could wait for a bit. Spying a light ahead, she raced towards it - perhaps it was the light of the moon, ready to guide her home. But as she approached, she noticed that the light had a strange flickering quality that seemed familiar. As the same acrid scent from that afternoon spiraled into her nostrils, she stopped short in shock. She could see the flames now, dancing through the underbrush and gleefully rushing towards her. The crackling heat teased her with its glowing fingers, promising to envelope her in its deadly embrace. She looked around, but no heroic firemen were present to douse the flames.</p><p>\"Fire!\" she bellowed fearfully. \"FIRE! FIRE! FIRE!\" These last three exclamations were uttered with the utmost strength of her vocal chords, and they resounded through the night. The animals in the forest all startled awake. The humans in the nearby town also jumped out of bed and peered out their windows - and saw golden flames reaching up through the treetops.</p><p>The firefighters raced out of their homes and, in a jiffy, were assembled around the fire, hoses in hand. Loudmouth, who had raced some distance away from the flames, turned back to watch them as they battled the fire with their watery swords.</p><p>\"I did that. I warned them! I helped!\" she told herself proudly. \"I'm a real firemoose!\"</p><p>That night, she regaled her family with her exploits, and they were quite proud of her for saving them all from being burnt to a crisp. By the next day, the story had spread throughout the forest, and wherever Loudmouth went, the animals called cheerily to her, \"Hey, it's the firemoose!\" Rumor reached her ears that even the humans in the town were swapping tales about the strange, moose-like bellow that had alerted them to the forest fire.</p><p>From that day forth, Loudmouth the Firemoose kept a watchful eye out for fires - such a watchful eye that she often caught them before the human firemen, in which case she would let out three resounding bellows of \"FIRE!\" - sometimes multiple sets of three if the situation seemed particularly urgent. Over time, the humans in the town - which happened to be called Swarthmore, if you were wondering - began to refer to this mysterious warning signal as the \"fire moose,\" given its resemblance to a moose's bellow. Don't ask me how they knew what a moose's bellow sounded like in the first place.</p><p>Today, although Loudmouth the Fire Moose has passed on, the \"fire moose\" warnings continue. No one knows if they come from her ghost, or if some other moose has taken on the role, passing down the responsibility from generation to generation. I prefer to believe that Loudmouth's spirit lingers here, ready to alert us should any flames threaten our peaceful homes and forests. Some towns have historic monuments or grand avenues; we have a fire moose.</p><p>*Technically, the correct plural of \"moose\" is \"moose.\" I disagree, and so do all the meese.</p><p>**You didn't think there were meese in Pennsylvania? Well, you thought wrong.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5166100</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6471-9F71-DY7P-T2Y0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-12-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1233\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Swarthmore Phoenix: Swarthmore College</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"12\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>December 2, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Swarthmore</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>PA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GS154</classCode><className>PENNSYLVANIA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

NIFA awarded $6.3 million for 14 Soil Health grants and $5.4 million for seven Signals in the Soil grants through its Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI). NIFA also is investing at least $10 million this year in a new AFRI program area priority called, \"Extension, Education, and USDA Climate Hub Partnerships,\" to train the next generation of agriculturalists and foresters to incorporate climate change research into their management practices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is the first in a series of announcements by USDA this week to underscore the Department's renewed commitment to addressing climate change through adaptation and mitigation with climate-smart tools for farmers, ranchers, producers and foresters.</p><p>\"USDA is committed to working alongside American producers, rural businesses and landowners to help them lead the way on addressing climate change, using the best USDA data and science to help improve their practices and spur new market opportunities,\" said Vilsack.</p><p>Some projects funded from the Soil Health AFRI priority area include: Northern Arizona University's project, \"Pelletized Fire Mosses to Enhance Soil Health After High Severity Forest Fire,\" for a new and effective way to boost soil health and promote the recovery of burned ecosystems. South Dakota State University's project, \"Flower Fields and Soils: The Impacts of Native Perennial Monoculture Plots on Soil Health,\" aimed at improving the sustainability of agricultural production and evaluating new agricultural practices to improve soil health.</p><p>Some projects funded from the AFRI Signals in the Soil interagency program with the National Science Foundation include: University of New Hampshire's project, \"Novel Soil Frost Sensing Systems for Tracking Freeze-Thaw Cycles,\" to develop, test and deploy wireless sensors and a ground-penetrating radar system for continuous measurements of soil frost. This is important because seasonal soil freeze and thaw impacts half the southern region and can affect permafrost, agroecosystems, urban ecosystems, and the interface between humans and the environment. Georgia State University's project, \"A Novel Large-Scale Radon Measurement Wireless Testbed for Spatio-Temporal Study of Radon in Surficial Soil,\" will develop a real-time radon measurement test with a wireless sensor network to be deployed around the north-eastern suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia - a metro area of 6 million residents with known high-potential for radon exposure. This is important because exposure to radon gas is the second leading cause of lung cancer, according to the World Health Organization.</p><p>\"By combining NIFA and National Science Foundation resources, the Signals in the Soil program fosters collaboration among a broad set of researchers to fund the most innovative and high-impact projects where multiple disciplines converge to produce novel soil sensing systems,\" said NIFA director Dr. Carrie Castille.</p><p>More on USDA Climate Hubs</p><p>The projects funded in this priority area within the AFRI Foundational and Applied Science RFA will strengthen and broaden the impacts of USDA's Climate Hubs through the Cooperative Extension Service. The partnerships between Cooperative Extension and the Climate Hubs Program that are built through this investment will help to ensure producers have information needed to plan for changing climate conditions and to consider climate-friendly farming practices.</p><p>USDA's Climate Hubs are a unique collaboration across the Department's agencies. They are led by Agricultural Research Service and Forest Service directors located at 10 regional locations, with contributions from other USDA agencies including the Natural Resources Conservation Service, Farm Service Agency, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, and the Risk Management Agency. The Climate Hubs link USDA research and program agencies in their region with the delivery of timely and authoritative tools and information to agricultural producers and professionals.</p><p>\"USDA seeks to improve our understanding of the physical connections, biogeochemical interactions, and processes between the soil, the environment and climate change,\" Dr. Castille said. \"These efforts will lead to new tools, practices, techniques and innovations for improving soil health and demonstrate USDA's commitment to address climate change.\"</p><p>To learn more about NIFA, visit our website <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nifa.usda.gov\">www.nifa.usda.gov</url>.</p><p>USDA touches the lives of all Americans each day in so many positive ways. In the Biden-Harris Administration, USDA is transforming America's food system with a greater focus on more resilient local and regional food production, fairer markets for all producers, ensuring access to safe, healthy and nutritious food in all communities, building new markets and streams of income for farmers and producers using climate smart food and forestry practices, making historic investments in infrastructure and clean energy capabilities in rural America, and committing to equity across the Department by removing systemic barriers and building a workforce more representative of America.

These projects have been in the planning stages for many years. I personally had wondered if it would actually happen in my lifetime. It seemed as though every time the projects started to gain momentum a new obstacle would stall them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><br/>For years, the Maine Forest Service took down or toppled old fire towers as they became unsafe and turned into a liability for the state of Maine. Maine had a total of 144 known mountains with fire lookout observers assigned to them. By the 1960s, many of the towers were abandoned in favor of fire detection flights. The last fire towers to be abandoned by the Maine Forest Service were the result of a budget crisis in 1991. Allagash and Deboullie mountains were among the last towers to be closed.</p><p><br/>Observers would be in the towers scanning the horizon looking for smoke on high fire danger days. When smoke was spotted a sighting device called an alidade, would be aimed at the smoke, the bearing would be read and called in over the telephone in the early days and over the radio in later years. At one time, there were thousands of miles of telephone lines strung throughout the Maine woods. Ideally, two or more towers could sight on the smoke. Forest rangers on the ground would plot the bearings on a map, where the lines crossed on the map was the fire's location.</p><p><br/>An old retired forest ranger friend of mine named Oscar Gagne (now deceased) once told me that it might take two or three days to reach some fires. This was before the road network that we have today in the Maine woods was developed.</p><p><br/>The new fire tower cabs were designed by Kleinschmidt Associates. They were modeled after the cab that was on Deboullie Mountain. Bureau of Parks and Lands staff built the first replacement cab; the other two were built by a local contractor.</p><p><br/>Bureau staff and volunteers stabilized the steel tower structures and Helicopter Applicators Inc. out of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, were contracted to fly the new cabs onto the towers.</p><p><br/>One of the biggest hurdles to overcome with the projects was to line up funding. The cost was considerably more than originally anticipated, which led to much of the work being done in-house. Finding a way to lift the cabs while working through the state of Maine contracting process was a challenge. As you can imagine, risk management and workers comp issues were a huge obstacle to overcome.</p><p><br/>Jacob Guimond, northern region manager for public lands said, \"BPL is pleased to see this project nearing completion. Almost all members of the Northern Region staff worked together to move this project forward since its inception in 2001. We hope the recreating public can enjoy the fire towers for many years to come as they are part of Maine's history and northern forest landscape.\"</p><p><br/>The cost of replacing all three cabs was more than $150,000. Money for the project came from the Public Lands Management Fund, which is primarily funded from timber sales on public lands, and a grant from the Recreational Trail Program.</p><p><br/>Copies of the original maps in these fire towers have been made and will soon be displayed as they once were when observers were on duty keeping a watchful eye on Maine's woodlands. We are seeking at least two alidades to install in the cabs so that visitors can visualize how a watchperson sighted and called in the bearings on a forest fire in days gone by. These fire towers were restored for recreational purposes only and will not be staffed by lookout observers.</p><p><br/>Allagash Wilderness Waterway Notes: If you have or know where we might get an alidade to install in one of these towers, please contact me.</p><p><br/>Matt LaRoche is superintendent of the Allagash Wilderness Waterway, a Registered Maine Guide and an avid outdoorsman.

Designed to operate unmanned in the stratosphere, above the weather and conventional air traffic, PHASA-35 offers a persistent and affordable alternative to satellites combined with the flexibility of an aircraft, which could be used for a range of valuable applications including forest fire detection and maritime surveillance.</p><p>Sponsored by the UK's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) and Australian Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG), the successful flight trials took place at the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Woomera Test Range in South Australia.</p><p>The trials marked the first fully integrated flight test of the PHASA-35 system, delivering rapid proof of capability from design to flight in just 20 months. They are the culmination of efforts from a collaborative team of British experts from Prismatic in Hampshire - where two full-sized concept aircraft were built last year - working alongside our engineers in Lancashire, where the aircraft underwent further integration testing prior to flight trials.</p><p>Going the distance</p><p>As a High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) vehicle, PHASA-35 is powered by the Sun during the day and by batteries overnight. The long-life battery and highly efficient solar technology could allow the aircraft to maintain flight for up to a year operating in the stratosphere, the upper regions of the Earth's atmosphere.</p><p>PHASA-35 is designed to provide a persistent, stable platform for monitoring, surveillance, communications and security applications. When connected to other technologies and assets, it will provide both military and commercial customers with capabilities that are not currently available from existing air and space platforms.</p><p>The Unmanned Air Vehicle also has the potential to be used in the delivery of communications networks including 5G, as well as provide other services, such as disaster relief and border protection, at a fraction of the cost of satellites.</p><p>Ian Muldowney, Engineering Director here at BAE Systems, said: \"This is an outstanding early result that demonstrates the pace that can be achieved when we bring the best of British capability together. To go from design to flight in less than two years shows that we can rise to the challenge the UK Government has set industry to deliver a Future Combat Air System within the next decade.\"</p><p>Our acquisition of Prismatic forms part of the Company's strategy to develop breakthrough technologies, making bolt-on acquisitions where they complement existing capabilities and provide an opportunity to accelerate technology development in key areas.</p><p>Further flight trials are scheduled for later this year, with the possibility that the aircraft could enter initial operations with customers within 12 months of the flight trials programme completion.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPCDLY-202002210109115261</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPCDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y84-K4M1-JC3D-Y11Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">288597</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"493\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Space Daily, Distributed by United Press International</copyright><publicationName>Space Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 21, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000290O</classCode><className>BAE SYSTEMS PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS336414 GUIDED MISSILE &amp;

Millions of acres were burnt or burning by then, wildfires consuming homes and lives and wildlife.</p><p>\"After the briefing and after talking, we were hitting the fireline shortly thereafter. January 10th was our first shift, so we were there for 33 days and we got utilized pretty heavily,\" he said.</p><p>Navarro said that he and his fellow firefighters worked hard to contain the fires.</p><p>\"It was pretty active, a lot of bushfires throughout the state of Victoria. We worked with the Australian government and our assignment was pretty simple, it was to assist the Australian government, forest fire management and suppress forest fires,\" he said.</p><p>The experience was gratifying, Navarro said.</p><p>\"All of my colleagues and all of the firefighters were just soaking everything in. For most of us it was our first time going to the country of Australia,\" he said. \"It was just humbling, and we're honored to help the Australian government.\"</p><p>Navarro said he didn't expect the recognition he received Thursday evening.</p><p>\"I kind of just stay quiet and to myself, but this is very humbling and [I'm] honored, and I'm grateful for this opportunity, representing my agency and the city of Mission and the Department of the Interior, so I'm very happy,\" he said. \"It's a great feeling.\"</p><p>___ (c)2020 The Monitor (McAllen, Texas) Visit The Monitor (McAllen, Texas) at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.themonitor.com\">www.themonitor.com</url> Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCTBUS-20200221-MC-Mission-firefighter-who-battled-Australian-fires-honored-0221-20200221MC</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">The Monitor KR</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y85-6RR1-JC6P-C0HY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">474159</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"452\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Monitor</copyright><bodyText><p>Distributed by Tribune Content Agency</p></bodyText><publicationName>The Monitor (McAllen, Texas)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 21, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.industry\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX001839</classCode><className>WILDLIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Most commonly known as drones, they have been used since the 1900s, initially by the US military for target practice.</p><p>Military applications still dominate the global UAV market, but the achievements of UAVs in military operations have boosted demand for drones in North America, Middle East and the Asia-Pacific. UAVs are becoming a key element in the intelligence and surveillance operations of military and fast expanding in other combative areas as well.</p><p>The fast development of the UAV global market is having a big impact on a range of mainstream industries. Apart from defense, applications also include environmental management, crisis management, agriculture, policing and crowd monitoring, civil engineering, fisheries protection, disaster management, telecommunications maintenance, oil and gas exploration, mineral exploration, mine safety, geophysical surveys and mapping.</p><p>The UAV market has traditionally been narrowly focused but it is rapidly diversifying. Given the pace at which technology and the effectiveness of aircraft are improving, and as sensor and automation technologies mature, commercial applications will rapidly grow over the next ten years.</p><p>1.2 Market Scope</p><p>The UAV sector is set to be the sector with the most dynamic growth in the aerospace industry globally in this decade. According to the Teal Group, global spending on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) programs is expected to more than triple over the next decade in military, commercial, and consumer markets.</p><p>In light of solid growth rates, the Teal Group forecasts global spending is expected to touch $20.3 billion by 2025. The civil UAS market is expected to grow faster than the military market over the next decade. The worldwide military UAS spending over the next decade is estimated to be US$216.5 billion. Of which, procurement spending will amount to US$162.2 billion and research spending will amount to US$72.5 billion. The US is expected to account for about 81% of the total military R&amp;D spending and about 48% of military procurement through to 2030.</p><p>The high level of military R&amp;D spending is forecast to be due to the bigger and higher-value systems procured by the US. The military UAS market growth will be led by unmanned combat aerial vehicles and high-altitude long endurance UAVs. The largest market segment over the next decade will be High Altitude Long Endurance UAVs, which will account for a third of the period's sales.</p><p>The civil UAS will be the most attractive market this decade as commercial applications take off and governments adopt UAVs for new roles in border security and public safety. The worldwide civil UAS market is expected to reach US$19.8 billion by 2031, from US$7.2 billion in 2022, according to the Teal Group. Over the coming decade, the civil market will grow at a CAGR of 9.1% and will generate US$139 billion in revenues. Civil UAS promises to be the most dynamic growth sector with commercial segment expected to lead the growth.</p><p>The worldwide commercial UAS market is projected to reach $9.5 billion by 2028. Delivery is likely to emerge as the leading sector for commercial UAS market in the US by 2030. Teal Group predicts that Teal growth opportunities will be in middle-mile (e.g., factory to warehouse) transportation, rather than in the last-mile deliveries. This is primarily due to complexities involved in regulating the last-mile deliveries, while the regulatory framework for middle-mile transportation is already in place. Globally, Agriculture will be the largest sector by 2030 led by more affordable UAS and heavy Chinese investments. This is also supported by UN projections which suggests world's population to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, causing significant growth in agricultural consumption. Another key sector that will drive growth of the commercial UAS market is Industrial Inspection. Construction will be the largest portion of the Industrial Inspection market. All ten of the largest worldwide construction firms are deploying or experimenting with UAS fleets.</p><p>China has a clear leadership in the consumer UAS manufacturing and is now seeking to expand its capabilities to commercial UAS manufacturing. The aggressive growth of the UAV industry in China is attributable to the policy and regulatory support as well as significant investments from the Chinese government.</p><p>Currently, Sichuan, Hunan, Hainan and Jiangxi provinces in China are pushing forward the reform of low-altitude airspace management, giving support to the commercialization of drone application. China's civil drone market is estimated at $6.6 billion in 2022, according to Shenzhen-based research firm AskCI Consulting. The industrial drone market is also witnessing rapid growth. According to data from Shenzhen-based Qianzhan Industry Research Institute, the industrial drone sales is projected to increase from 27.3 billion yuan in 2020 to 265.8 billion yuan in 2026. Shenzhen has more than 1,500 drone companies with civilian UAV business licenses.</p><p>Data from the Civil Aviation Administration of China showed that by the end of 2021, there are 781,000 registered drone users, and the number of registered drones totaled 832,000 in China. The Civil Aviation Administration of China released a plan that outlined several targets for the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) business in China by the years 2025, 2030, and 2035. These goals included the enhancement of rules and the expansion of airspace capacity for civilian UAVs.</p><p>Europe has fallen behind in the civil UAS market. It is now trying to catch up by enacting standardized airspace rules that will create a single market. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has established rules for small UAS across the European Union.</p><p>The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has become the first air transport safety regulator in the world to offer technical design guidance to urban planners and eVTOL manufacturers looking to build drone taxi vertiports across Europe. Europe also adopted 'European Drone Strategy 2.0' late last year aimed for the further development of the European drone market. Further, the implementation of the 'U-space' in January 2023, a European system to manage drone traffic safely, will lay the ground for increased operations. According to European Commission, the drone services market in Europe could be worth \u20ac14.5 billion, and create 145,000 jobs, by 2030.</p><p>The increase in defense spending by various countries to strengthen their defense forces is leading to growth in the number of military UAV systems. These UAV systems are being used for applications such as surveying, mapping, transportation, combat operations and monitoring. The US and European governments have already begun new programs using UAVs for protecting land and sea borders. Many other international agencies including the UN and other peacekeeping agencies are also deploying unmanned aerial protection systems.</p><p>According to the US Presidential budget, the US Department of Defense plans to invest more than $2.6 billion in unmanned systems in 2023, with at least 29 programs fully dedicated to the procurement of UAS. The United States is not the only nation that is increasing defense spending on unmanned aerial vehicles. Earlier this year, Germany approved major uptick in defense spending on armed drones. German military will purchase ammunitions worth EUR152 million to arm German drones. This will be the first deployment of weaponized UAVs in German military.</p><p>In January 2023, Ukraine announced plans to double down on its deployment of drones in its efforts to counter Russian forces, pledging nearly $540 million of spending for the production and procurement of UAVs.</p><p>Japan has announced a record $40.7 billion defense budget for fiscal 2023, which will include significant spending on armed drones. It intends to raise defense spending to 2 percent of GDP by 2027. The Japanese defense ministry aims to introduce unmanned vehicles that can be used directly in combat, rather than just for surveillance and intelligence gathering.</p><p>According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), military expenditures are on the rise around the globe. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has led to increase in defense funding especially for drones. Over the next decade, growth in military market will increasingly shift towards international markets as more militaries incorporate UAVs into their forces.</p><p>Major drone providers from China and Israel have increased the manufacture and export of defense drones for foreign militaries. Many counties from Saudi Arabia to Myanmar and Iraq to Ethiopia, are stockpiling Chinese combat drones and deploying them on the battlefield.</p><p>The introduction of specially built unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) also promises to drive growth over the next decade. The emergence of the commercial UAS market, growing demand from governments to better patrol borders, and continued consumer drone growth all promise to drive more than a quadrupling of the non-military market over the next decade.</p><p>With increasing UAV installations across the globe, there is rising need to defend against such systems as well. In May 2022, South Korea approved a project to install uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) defense systems at 45 bases across the nation to neutralize hostile drones. South Korean government will spend NT$4.3 billion (US$144.45 million) to purchase the UAV defense systems.</p><p>Market Share</p><p>The world UAV sector is highly concentrated with a small number of companies holding most of the market share compared to other industries. Our estimates show there are more than 500 companies globally, with more than 200 commercial UAV companies, while the other 300 develop UAV for the military industry. AeroVironment, BAE Systems, Elbit Systems, Finmeccanica, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Navmar Applied Sciences, Northrop Grumman, Safran, Textron, Thales, Boeing, Tital Aerospace, TAI, AIA and Aviation Industry Corporation of China are among the biggest players in the UAV market.</p><p>A number of start-ups have made their mark on the market in recent years, however, and are challenging the dominance of the incumbent players. Technology companies like Intel, Qualcomm, Microsoft, Apple as well as venture capitalists have poured more millions of dollars into startup investments.</p><p>Impact of COVID-19 on the UAV Sector</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every industry, although not in an equal way. Some industries have felt the impact very differently to others. The effect on the UAV market especially commercial drones have been on the positive side. According to Drone Industry Insights, drone companies are on a path towards steady growth over the next many years. Global drone market size is forecast to reach US$55.8 billion by 2030, from US$30.6 billion in 2022, implying a CAGR of 7.8%. The services sector will remain the biggest segment, while hardware segment will be the fastest growing.</p><p>As the global economies were forced to shut down and implement strict shelter-in-place restrictions, the demand for unmanned aerial systems became higher. Further, the use of drones for transporting medical supplies proved a boon for the sector. Cargo, courier and warehousing are the sectors with the fastest adoption of drones. Many drone companies including Wingcopter, Zipline and Wing have been able to deliver and scale their solutions quicker than previously expected.</p><p>England's National Health Service (NHS) is among those trailing the vehicles to deliver fragile medicines to cancer patients living on the Isle of Wight. Chemotherapy drugs can have short shelf lives and thus quick delivery by drones is a boon for patients.</p><p>Walmart said that it completed 6,000 drone deliveries in 2022 from 36 US stores in seven states. These deliveries were done from drone delivery hubs operated by DroneUp, Flytrex and Zipline. Walmart has 4,700 stores located within 90% of the US population making it uniquely positioned to offer drone delivery at scale.</p><p>In June 2022, Zipline launched drone medical deliveries in Nigeria. Zipline will initially deliver over 200 different medical products, including medicines and vaccines, with plans to expand in the near future. This will enable Nigeria to create a strong and smart health system. In May 2022, Wingcopter announced a partnership with Continental Drones to develop a massive delivery network spanning 49 countries across Sub-Saharan Africa. The deal aims to deploy 12,000 of Wingcopter's 198 drone systems over the course of the next 5 years. In February 2022, Zipline announced launching operations in another African Nation with on-demand drone deliveries of medical supplies in Kenya. The company is already operating in Ghana, Nigeria, and Ivory Coast.</p><p>US-based Walgreens in partnership with Alphabet's Wing is targeting the drone delivery market. In April 2022, Walgreens announced that it will begin flying packages by drone to residents of Texas cities in partnership with Google's drone subsidiary, Wing.</p><p>US-based Matternet is another player targeting the medical delivery market. In September 2021, it launched the world's first city-wide drone delivery network for the rapid transport of medical goods in Abu Dhabi. The company will use drones to transport urgent, high-value goods such as COVID-19 vaccines, blood, and lab samples across the Abu Dhabi's health system.</p><p>LEK Consulting notes that drones could account for a large portion of package delivery market by 2040. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a rapid and more expansive testing of drone delivery systems. The technology has been able to accelerate its growth and development over the past 12 months or so.</p><p>To further assist the sector, the UK government announced new funding program for drone companies developing methods to deliver COVID-19 tests and personal protective equipment (PPE) to hospitals and rural communities. The government has announced ~\u00a37 million funding package for the sector.</p><p>According to research published in journal Patterns, drone deliveries could help reduce greenhouse emissions significantly. The paper states that greenhouse-gas emissions per parcel were 84% lower for drones than for diesel trucks. Companies such as Amazon have been testing the use of drones to deliver packages with an eye to reducing their environmental impact.</p><p>1.3 Market Trends</p><p>Start-ups Threaten Larger Incumbents</p><p>Over the past 20 years, the UAV sector has expanded and opened up to a whole new level of competition and innovation that had not been seen in the market. While large incumbents, especially the Big Three - Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman - have won a big slice of the available UAV deals, new and smaller entrants are increasingly winning against the big companies for UAV contracts, thus challenging their respective market positions.</p><p>A number of smaller start-up companies have burst onto the scene in recent years, threatening the market positions of the larger incumbents. Non-defense companies eager to diversify and get a slice of the fast-growing market have funded some start-ups.</p><p>The funding from Drone startups have started on a strong footing in 2023 after a robust 2022. In March 2023, French advanced air mobility (AAM) startup Ascendance Flight Technology says it is aggressively pushing to finalize the prototype of its ATEA hybrid vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) plane, and has raised new investment of \u20ac21 million ($22.6 million). In February 2023, US-based drone manufacturer, Skydio raised $230 million in Series E funding at a valuation of $2.2 billion. The funding will be used to setup a new manufacturing facility in America. In January 2023, Japan-based Terra Drone raised $14 million from oil giant Saudi Aramco. The company says it will utilize the funding to set up a new subsidiary for inspection services in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>In November 2022, India-based drone delivery platform Skye Air Mobility raised $1.7 million. Skye Air Mobility is currently operating in eight cities across India and plans to expand to 16 cities in the next 24 months. In October 2022, Australian drone logistics service provider Swoop Aero landed a new investment round for its first and last mile airborne delivery network, bringing its total backing to $26 million to date. Swoop Aero plans to use the funds to enter new markets, scale its integrated logistics networks, and expand its manufacturing capabilities.</p><p>Regulatory Uncertainties Overshadow the Segment</p><p>UAV vehicles have evolved swiftly in recent years, particularly since making the leap from military technology to consumer gadgetry. The technology they use could be useful for myriad business opportunities. For example, UAVs are being used in many sectors, like the agriculture, construction, energy, mining and entertainment, as well as geological surveys and, utility safety and maintenance, thanks to their ability to shoot aerial photos and video, as well as collect other data cheaply.</p><p>The growth of the UAV market, however, has drawn considerable attention from regulators and legislators eager to mitigate the complexities involved in the growth of the number of aeronautical vehicles in the skies. For instance, in the US there has been delays and confusion regarding the rules set by FAA. With the courts and Congress getting involved in regulation, clarity around the regulatory landscape is yet to emerge.</p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued new rules for the commercial drone industry. Under the new rules, the FAA will allow small drones to operate at night and over people and will require remote identification of the drones. The new rules went into effect on 21 April 2021. Remote ID will be required for all drones weighing 0.55 lb (0.25 kg) or more. Remote ID requires identification of drones in flight as well as the location of their control stations or takeoff point.</p><p>Further, in 2022, the FAA will require every new produced drone weighing over 0.55 pounds to broadcast its location. In 2023, it will be illegal to fly drone without this broadcasting capability.</p><p>For fiscal FY 2022, FAA is requesting a total of over $100 million in funding for unmanned aircraft system (UAS) research, development, and integration. This includes $31.3 million for UAS implementation which incorporates FAA Drone Zone. The FAA Drone Zone is a cloud-based information technology platform that includes a UAS registration system, Part 107 authorizations and optional waivers, and UAS accident reporting.</p><p>FAA budget request also includes $24 million for UAS concept validation and requirements development, UAS flight information management, and urban air mobility.</p><p>The FAA plans to launch field tests of unmanned aircraft traffic management capabilities. The Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management (UTM) field test, which is set to launch in the spring 2022 and continue into 2023, is expected to lead to new policies and the development of updated industry standards for drones operating beyond visual line-of-sight (BVLOS).</p><p>The commercial potential of UAV continues to attract big investors and venture capital. For example, Amazon's is investing in its Amazon Prime Air program to create a delivery system utilizing UAVs.</p><p>Alphabet's drone-delivery subsidiary Wing launched a new mobile and web app, OpenSky, which is free to use and informs drone pilots about airspace restrictions, pre-plan flights, and get airspace approvals. Drone flyers can also use the app to check information on areas where they can and cannot fly.</p><p>This is just one of the many proposed uses for UAVs, however. Within the next ten years, it is expected that more than 32,000 drones will be flying for commercial operations worldwide. FAA projects that remote pilot certificates could grow almost 3x to 350,000 over the next five years.</p><p>For the US, the potential economic impact of UAVs, according to the Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, could reach approximately US$13.7 billion within the next three years and create more than 100,000 employment opportunities once the FAA drafts comprehensive drone regulations.</p><p>Despite some progress by FAA on establishing rules, it remains unclear. The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) delivered a report in January 2023 stating on the need for FAA to more clearly communicate a strategy to integrate drones into the airspace. GAO notes that the commercial drone use is likely to expand to 858,000 in 2026 from 622,000 in 2021.</p><p>The main conclusions of the report are that FAA needs to do better in both establishing and communicating a comprehensive strategy for broader UAV use, and in defining a uniform procedure for issuing waiver.</p><p>Wing's CEO Adam Woodwort in March 2023 reiterated the need to make drone regulations more pragmatic and predictable. He emphasized the need for drone regulations that support commercial operations. He noted that many of the current regulations make sense for passenger-carrying airplanes, but not for small aircraft with no people onboard.</p><p>The Buzz from Parcel-Toting Drones</p><p>In a few decades from now, we may look back and remember a time before flying robots delivered consumer orders. At least this might be the case if delivery drones turn out the way most retailers \u2014 as well as service providers - envision them. A delivery drone, or also known as a parcelcopter, is an UAV utilized to transport goods, packages, and foodstuffs, and recently, the delivery systems have been a hot future state plans among vendors.</p><p>By 2023, Statista projects global drone delivery market to touch $1.6 billion. Asia-Pacific will be the largest market accounting for nearly 39% of the total, followed by North America (31%) and Europe (22%).</p><p>McKinsey notes that as of early 2022, more than 2,000 drone deliveries are occurring each day worldwide. The growth rate is accelerating, and it projects that there will be close to 1.5 million deliveries in 2022 in total, up from just under half a million in 2021.</p><p>Drone Industry Insights noted that services such as cargo, courier, intralogistics and warehousing were the fastest-growing drone market in 2021 and are likely to continue to remain so till 2026 with a CAGR of 24.3%. This is due to the increased popularity and demand of drone deliveries for both internal (intralogistics and warehousing) as well as external services.</p><p>Drone deliveries can cut emissions and reduce congestion on roads. According to Virginia Tech University, drone delivery could save the average consumer up to 56 hours per year, reduce vehicle traffic by 294 million miles per year and displace up to 113,900 tons of CO2 per year.</p><p>China-based ecommerce platform Meituan announced that it has completed more than 100,000 drone deliveries by 2022, an increase of more than 400% year-on-year. The company expects greater number of drone deliveries going forward.</p><p>Alphabet's drone delivery service Wing is adding complex route management and self-loading capability for its drone delivery fleet that will make it capable of handling tens of millions of deliveries for millions of consumers by mid 2024.</p><p>Given the large opportunity in the drone delivery market, the space is witnessing new entrants. The latest is Mesa Air Group, which in October 2021, announced partnership with aerospace technology company, Flirtey to launch last-mile food delivery business using drones in the US. Mesa will first order four delivery drones from Flirtey, with an option to order an additional 500 drones.</p><p>Singapore's civil aviation authority and transport ministry has chosen a private consortium of 13 members to develop the drone program. Under this program, the aim is to use drones for tasks that include delivering parcels, inspecting buildings and providing security. The companies involved in the project have carried our various pilots. These include drone parcel delivery as well as using drones to transport blood samples and specimens between hospitals and central laboratory. Drones are being tested for delivering parts and other materials to factories as well.</p><p>China is not too far behind in this race. DHL in partnership with China-based drone company EHang has launched drone delivery service in China. JD.com and Alibaba have tested the drone delivery system as well.</p><p>Putting the parcelcopter concept into service will take some time because of the many setbacks. The major setback for this concept in the US is that there is no specific flight system where there needs to be a specific path for the drone to travel and deliver in a populated area - and this needs to be solved. Once resolved, the big benefit should be that these delivery-by-drone systems could be commonplace within the next decade. Open season on the open skies could arrive sooner than expected.</p><p>The Obsession with Armed Flying Robots</p><p>The use of a UAV as a weapon first became known in World War II. After the war, little development occurred in drone technology and most remotely piloted vehicles were used for target practice. The US military's first major spending on UAVs began after the Vietnam War, and over the past two decades, the country has become the world's pre-eminent user and supplier.</p><p>Military UAVs in the US have gone through meteoric growth over the past decade. Development has taken a quantum leap \u2014 from lab concept to battle-tested proven technology. Today, America's comparative advantage in UAVs, however, is being battered as technological know-how disseminates throughout the international system. While existing technology has started to lag, global competitors are playing catch up in research and development for drone technology.</p><p>As such, the Pentagon is expected to ramp up its investment in unmanned aerial vehicles in the coming years. The US Defense Department budget request for fiscal year 2023 mentions that unmanned weapons systems, such as drone ships, planes, and ground vehicles, will play an increasing role in future US military planning. The president's fiscal year 2023 defense budget requests new spending on unmanned/autonomous systems technology.</p><p>The Air Force request includes $187 million for enhancements to the MQ-9 Reaper combat drone and $111 million for work on the MQ-4C Triton high-altitude surveillance drone. The Navy and Marine Corps have also requested additional funding for UAVs. The Navy requested $1.2 billion for the MQ-25 Stingray drone, which is to be deployed on carriers and perform aerial refueling and surveillance functions.</p><p>No country has ramped up its UAV research in recent years faster than China, where every major company for the Chinese military has a research and development center and funding allocations dedicated to drones. In recent years, the country has pumped considerable amounts of funds and engineering brainpower into the technology, a field previously dominated by the US and Israel.</p><p>Much of the work done, however, remains secret, but the large number of drones created underlines not only the country's willpower to catch up in the sector by building comparable combat and surveillance models like the Predator and the Global Hawk but also the desire to trade the technologies globally. Its armed UAV CH-4, Wing Loong I and Wing Loong II have been rapidly gaining market share especially in developing countries such as Nigeria, Jordan, Algeria and Middle Eastern countries.</p><p>Israel, second after the US in drone technology, has flown armed UAV models but few details are available. India has also revealed its intention to develop drones that will fire missiles and fly at 30,000 feet, followed by Russia, which has revealed models of UAVs with weapons (although there is little evidence that they are currently operational).</p><p>The Lucrative UAV Micro Segment</p><p>The new generation of UAVs is being developed to improve monitoring of many kinds of systems. From tracking bush fires in Australia to observing traffic in the US, infrared cameras to track missing people at night, and laser spectroscopy used to monitor air pollutions, UAVs are using a lot of the new up-to-date miniature sensor technology.</p><p>All of this requires more focus on the integration of sensor systems in an airborne device that is severely constrained in power and weight. Changing the sensor architecture or even take the control sensors out entirely, allowing the size of the UAV to reduce dramatically. This has created a new class of ultra-small UAV sensors.</p><p>Lockheed Martin's Lockheed Sanders MicroSTAR series of prototypes is one of the many examples of a mini UAV. The battery-operated MicroSTAR designs resembled kid's toys. The device has winglets instead of the single vertical plane tail, and a nose mounted propeller. MicroSTAR featured a five-gram navigation system that could give directions by the ground station but could also automatically keep on a heading or orbit a target.</p><p>The US army has been using mini UAVs for mission in Afghanistan and other areas. These mini UAVs provide near-real time video that allows soldiers to better survey their surroundings and detect enemies in combat. FLIR System's Black Hornet is one such mini UAV which weighs less than two ounces, can be deployed in less than one minute and has a range of over a mile. It is intended to eliminate battlefield blind spots thereby saving lives.</p><p>French drone maker Parrot is also an established player in micro UAV space. It has been selected by Swiss army to develop and supply micro-drones as part of the Swiss Mini UAV Program.</p><p>Despite the advancements, the current micro UAV market remains constrained, largely due to regulatory frameworks on unmanned operations in airspace. But once regulatory restraints are loosened and clarified, the potential of this technology will be unlocked. Mini UAVs are set to become one of the major contributors to both the economy and technology. Market growth, however, still very much depends on the pace of UAV development in different countries, thanks to the wide range of applications and the added value related to these unmanned machines.</p><p>1.4 Applications</p><p>Defense</p><p>Defense will continue to the largest market for UAVs for the foreseeable future. UAVs can play an important role in counter terrorism and counter insurgency activities. They can be deployed in highly dangerous missions thereby saving personnel lives. The UAVs are also being used in difficult terrains for intelligence gathering and surveillance. They provide high resolution images and videos which can significantly help ground troops. Drones have been used by militaries of many countries to conduct strikes against terrorists.</p><p>Transport</p><p>UAVs are increasingly used in transport activities such as e-commerce parcel delivery, food delivery and medicine delivery. Of these, e-commerce delivery is getting the maximum attention with large companies such as Amazon already doing pilot tests.</p><p>Another promising area for UAVs is the delivery of food. It could be used in heavily populated urban areas for food delivery by restaurants and also could be used to deliver foods to difficult terrains including oil rigs and remote islands. Medical logistics is another area where UAVs can be used to transport medicines and can also be used as flying defibrillators.</p><p>Infrastructure</p><p>UAVs can assist in the management of various kinds of infrastructure, specifically construction sites. In the pre- construction phase, drones can survey the land and provide accurate field data and images. They are able to capture high-resolution videos and images, which can significantly improve the speed and quality of the design process. In the construction phase, drones can inspect the sites and provide accurate information regarding the progress of the construction.</p><p>The data received could be used by investors and property owners to monitor if the project is progressing as per original schedule or not. Abu Dhabi has launched the trial stage of implementing drones as aerial monitoring and inspection tools for the city's engineering projects and construction sites.</p><p>US state of Arizona is mulling the use drones to inspect roads, bridges and other infrastructure. The state has introduced Drone Infrastructure Inspection Grant Act, that would dispense about $200 million to purchase drones and the other half to train pilots to fly them.</p><p>The FAA's rollout of the Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC) has helped standardize and expand the use of drones in construction. LAANC automates the application and approval process for airspace authorizations and is currently available at near 500 airports across the country. LAANC is currently in beta and will be tested further before nationwide rollout.</p><p>An increasing number of construction firms and real estate developers in the Middle East are turning to drones amid the COVID-19 crisis. Drones are being used for progress monitoring and site mapping as companies try to speed up delivery of projects. In November 2020, New York's Department of Finance's property division said that it is looking into the use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems for tasks such as surveying tax lots, geographic information system (GIS) mapping and aerial photography.</p><p>Agriculture</p><p>One of the largest projected applications of UAVs in in agriculture. Drones can be used by farmers to monitor their crops. UAVs can survey a farmland faster and at a lower cost than airplanes/satellites and also provide better data and images to farmers. The current altitude restrictions for UAVs limit the area that it can survey, but if the altitude restrictions ease a little, the area could expand and provide greater benefits to farmers.</p><p>Japan has been using UAVs for crop dusting for more than 20 years now and drones account for more than 90% of crop dusters. In the US as well, the adoption of drones in agriculture is increasing due to exemption from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) under the part 107 rule.</p><p>China's largest agriculture drone maker XAG is trying to automate rice farming in China with the launch of its drone-based direct seeding system called JetSeed. It could replace manual seed planting and raise efficiency amid a labor shortage due to COVID-19.</p><p>In January 2023, the United Kingdom's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has given operational authorization to China-based XAG's agricultural spraying aircraft P40 and V40. This is the first time drone spraying and spreading has been legalized for use on UK farms.</p><p>Public Safety</p><p>This area again presents huge opportunities for UAVs. Drones can be used for law enforcement, search and rescue missions, firefighting and medical services. Civil governments are deploying an increasing number of unmanned systems.</p><p>The US and European governments have launched many new pilot programs to deploy UAV systems to protect borders. The United Nations and other peacekeepers are also deploying unmanned aerial systems to provide protection.</p><p>In the US, many agencies have acquired drones. Most of these agencies are police/sheriff departments followed by fire departments. In October 2022, the sheriff department of Las Vegas announced plans to deploy 400 drones as responders to rising gun violence. In Indiana and Maryland, police have successfully used drones to catch suspects and thieves. In Oakland, the fire department used drones to hot spots, which were not extinguished during a firefighting mission. The Los Angeles Fire Department has been using drones to make hot-spot identification and aerial mapping for wildfire response, as well as incident response for other search and rescue missions.</p><p>Further, drones can collect information, data and images on natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes and wildfires. UAVs have great potential for surveying storm damage and locating people after natural disasters. The US National Guard is using AI-powered drones to track wildfires in real time. The AI-backed drones can predict the area where fire is most likely to spread based on previous fires.</p><p>The US is using drones for border security as well. The drones support the border patrol team by providing enhanced intelligence, surveillance capabilities and reducing the risk to human operators on the ground.</p><p>Inspections</p><p>UAVs can be used for inspections in areas such as wind turbines, oil pipelines, power lines, railroads and more. Oil and gas companies can use a drone to conduct the required monthly inspection of their pipelines. Instead of hiring a helicopter, which is costly, companies can use drones to do the same at lower cost. Drone inspections can survey hundreds of miles of pipeline and pinpoint the location of the leaks, thereby reducing traditional surveilling costs by nearly 90%.</p><p>In November 2021, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines announced plans to use of drones for passenger aircraft inspection. The drones can inspect the aircraft for minor damage inflicted by events like hailstorms and lightning strikes.</p><p>Similarly, UAVs can inspect wind turbines, several hundred feet in the air, removing the need for an individual to physically reach the place. Netherlands-based wind energy company Vestas is using drones to conduct inspection of its 1,250 wind turbines. Archaeologists can use UAVs to inspect the sites and also patrol for looters. The city of London is using drones for surveys which are used for repairing and maintaining assets across the underground rail network.</p><p>1.5 Regulatory Environment</p><p>Drones are taking off in a big way. Once the preserve of the military, UAVs are now widely popular in the commercial sector, thanks to consumer-grade UAVs that become increasingly sophisticated and cheaper. Though regulatory obstacles could hinder growth prospects.</p><p>Currently, there are different sets of rules governing the uses of commercial UAVs around the world. In December 2020, the US FAA approved a new set of regulations governing commercial UAVs. The FAA will allow small drones to operate at night and over people and will require remote identification of the drones. This new regulation will bring a step closer to commercial drone use for agriculture, infrastructure repair, and eventually, even deliveries from companies such as Amazon.</p><p>Canada has had safety regulations in place that govern the use of UAVs. A recreational pilot operating a drone weighing less than 35kgs does not currently require either a license or a special flying permit. It, however, must follow a list of Transport Canada safety guidelines, such as staying nine kilometers from an airport, flying under 90 meters and always keeping the craft within eyesight.</p><p>Australia requires no registration of recreational drones. Recreational drone operators must comply with Civil Aviation and Safety Authority (CASA) rules that allow drones to be flown only within a visual line of sight. There are other restrictions on the maximum altitude, vicinity near airports and flying over crowded places.</p><p>The regulations allow commercial operators to fly drones weighing less than 2kg without a license. Operators must still adhere to all the existing rules for recreational drone use such as not to fly within 5.5km of an airport, above 400 feet or within 30m of buildings, railways or vehicles, and always to have line of sight of the drone.</p><p>Drones that weigh less than 20kgs in the UK can fly in normal airspace for private use as long as the operator is not planning to use data or images from the flight acquired by flying close to people or objects. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) requires all UAVs to remain 150 meters from crowded events or large assemblies, 50m from an individual or building, and stay within line of sight, which is 500m horizontally and 122m vertically. Drones that weigh more than 20kgs are currently banned from flying in civilian airspace.</p><p>The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has established new rules on drones. Under the rules, drone operators will have to be registered with their national authority and the drones will need to have a direct remote identification system in place. The regulatory framework will ensure the protection of citizens' privacy rights while addressing security issues as well.</p><p>China is moving rapidly to establish regulatory framework for drones. In October 2020, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) announced the first Unmanned Civil Aviation Experimental Zones (UCAEZs) to help accelerate the drone industry in China. The new experimental zones are designed to not only offer the airspace for testing innovative drone applications, but to ease the process of developing drone businesses.</p><p>1.6 Challenges and Opportunities</p><p>Opportunities</p><p>UAV industry presents tremendous opportunities for investors, companies as well as government. UAV technology has reached a maturity point that has placed it at the forefront of aerospace manufacturing. As UAV companies around the world make drones more accessible, the UAV sector despite the undeveloped regulatory framework, is set to develop into one of the most dynamic growth industries this decade. There are some 450 UAV companies worldwide behind this growing multibillion-dollar industry, with the number growing.</p><p>Both the military and commercial markets are set to grow rapidly in the next few years, as the US economy continues to recover, technology continues to diffuse around the world, as designs become more streamlined and efficient and as more industries adopt existing business processes for UAV use.</p><p>The non-military, especially the commercial drone segment, is set to grow the fastest with projections of mid to high teens growth over the next the next decade. The latest developments in computer vision, machine learning, cloud and data analytics are expected to push drone deployment in the mainstream commercial sector. In the US and many other places around the world, the regulations either remain too restrictive or are yet to be given a final shape, which has been a deterrent in the pace of UAV adoption.</p><p>With the explosion of interest in building and operating unmanned aircraft systems, the use of UAV technology is set to generate more high-tech jobs, with millions in tax revenues and tens of billions in economic impact.</p><p>UAV technology is moving ever faster forward as the market continues to flourish. Industry will need to consider how to best to integrate UAVs into their businesses.</p><p>Challenges</p><p>Safety, privacy and regulatory barriers remain key challenges for the rapid adoption of UAVs. The most urgent challenge for the governments is to ensure that the drone operations remain safe.</p><p>Privacy is another key concern that needs to be addressed. UAVs collect massive amounts of data including video and images, which sometimes could result in the invasion of personal privacy. A livestream or a recording of individuals or buildings can easily be captured without consent. Also, even if the data collected is with consent, the transmission of data itself remains vulnerable to hack. The growth and evolution of the UAV industry has outpaced the development of rules and systems to govern their use. This uncertainty weighs on innovation and commercial adoption, unless there is more clarity on the rules.</p><p>Illegal use of UAVs for criminal activities is another big challenge. For instance, drug cartels have used drones to transfer illegal drugs in the US. These vehicles tend to fly for short periods at very low altitudes. This makes it very difficult to detect using conventional sensor systems. Also, UASs or drones in particular could be a source of public nuisance. If a drone flying over a public place loses control and falls, it could cause substantial damage to the property as well as endanger lives.</p><p>In conclusion, the UAVs have raised a lot of concerns and it is up to policymakers to design and create laws that facilitate the good use of the technology while discouraging its harmful use.</p><p>2.

NIFA awarded $6.3 million for 14 Soil Health grants and $5.4 million for seven Signals in the Soil grants through its Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI). NIFA also is investing at least $10 million this year in a new program area priority called, \"Extension, Education, and USDA Climate Hub Partnerships,\" also funded through AFRI, to train the next generation of agriculturalists and foresters to incorporate climate change research into their management practices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is the first in a series of announcements by USDA this week to underscore the Department's renewed commitment to addressing and mitigating climate change with climate-smart tools for farmers, ranchers, producers and foresters. Secretary Vilsack will further detail USDA's commitment tomorrow at President Biden's Leaders Summit on Climate.</p><p>\"USDA is committed to working alongside American producers, rural businesses and landowners to help them lead the way on addressing climate change, using the best USDA data and science to help improve their practices and spur new market opportunities,\" said Vilsack.</p><p>Some projects funded from the Soil Health AFRI priority area include: Northern Arizona University's project, \"Pelletized Fire Mosses to Enhance Soil Health After High Severity Forest Fire,\" for a new and effective way to boost soil health and promote the recovery of burned ecosystems. South Dakota State University's project, \"Flower Fields and Soils: The Impacts of Native Perennial Monoculture Plots on Soil Health,\" aimed at improving the sustainability of agricultural production and evaluating new agricultural practices to improve soil health.</p><p>Some projects funded from the AFRI Signals in the Soil interagency program with the National Science Foundation include: University of New Hampshire's project, \"Novel Soil Frost Sensing Systems for Tracking Freeze-Thaw Cycles,\" to develop, test and deploy wireless sensors and a ground-penetrating radar system for continuous measurements of soil frost. This is important because seasonal soil freeze and thaw impacts half the southern region and can affect permafrost, agroecosystems, urban ecosystems, and the interface between humans and the environment. Georgia State University's project, \"A Novel Large-Scale Radon Measurement Wireless Testbed for Spatio-Temporal Study of Radon in Surficial Soil,\" will develop a real-time radon measurement test with a wireless sensor network to be deployed around the north-eastern suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia a metro area of 6 million residents with known high-potential for radon exposure. This is important because exposure to radon gas is the second leading cause of lung cancer, according to the World Health Organization.</p><p>\"By combining NIFA and National Science Foundation resources, the Signals in the Soil program fosters collaboration among a broad set of researchers to fund the most innovative and high-impact projects where multiple disciplines converge to produce novel soil sensing systems,\" said NIFA director Dr. Carrie Castille.</p><p>More on USDA Climate Hubs</p><p>The projects funded in this priority area within the AFRI Foundational and Applied Science RFA will strengthen and broaden the impacts of Climate Hubs through the Cooperative Extension Service. The partnerships between Cooperative Extension and the Regional Hubs Program that are built through this investment will help to ensure producers have information needed to plan for changing climate conditions and to consider climate-friendly farming practices.</p><p>USDA's Climate Hubs are a unique collaboration across the Department's agencies. They are led by Agricultural Research Service and Forest Service senior directors located at 10 regional locations, with contributions from many other programs including the Natural Resources Conservation Service, Farm Service Agency, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, and the Risk Management Agency.

Table and desks, workstations, seatings, overhead bins and storage unit and files are the different office furniture product types. On the basis of material, the market is spilt into wood, fiberglass, plastic and metal. On the basis of end users, the market is divided into enterprise, schools and hospitals.</p><p>The global office furniture market is forecasted to grow at a healthy rate over the years (2020-2024). Growth in a number of start-up companies, boom in e-commerce, rapidly developing economy and spike in spending on furniture are the growth drivers of the market. Rising costs of raw material and increasing incidence of forest fire are the challenges faced by the market.</p><p>Adoption of sustainable production processes, nearshore manufacturing, a spike in demand for standing desks, growing prominence of ergonomic furniture, smart furniture and office pods are some of the latest trends existing in the market.</p><p>The essential catalyst of demand for office furniture, consisting of business sentiment and commercial construction has dried up. Furthermore, businesses are releasing workers off duty due to COVID-19. This sudden spike in unemployment has lowered demand for industry products, as many businesses have ceased expansion into new workspaces at least for 2020.</p><p>Key Topics Covered:</p><p>1.

Yet as flames charred mile after mile of rangeland and forest, fire crews could do little to protect cattle pastures that are crucial to economic survival for some families on the remote reservation.</p><p>As the fire raced across the hilly reservation, tribal member Darlene Small helped her grandson move about 100 head of cattle to a new pasture, only to have to relocate them twice more as the flames from the Richard Spring fire bore down, she said Thursday. An extreme drought that's blanketing the West has made matters worse for ranchers by stunting vegetation untouched by fire.</p><p>\"They've got to have pasture where there's water. If there's no water, there's no good pasture,\" Small said. Particularly hard hit were some ranchers already depending on surplus grass after a fire burned them off their normal pasture last year, she said.</p><p>Meanwhile, California's Dixie Fire - which started July 13 and is the largest wildfire burning in the nation - threatened a dozen small communities in the northern Sierra Nevada even though its southern end was mostly corralled by fire lines.</p><p>The fire has burned 790 square miles, destroyed some 550 homes and nearly obliterated the town of Greenville last week. It was 30% contained.</p><p>The Montana blaze began Sunday and winds gusting up to 56 mph caused it to explode across more than 260 square miles by Thursday. Primed by heavy, swirling winds and hot temperatures, it was spreading in multiple directions, torching trees and sending off embers that propelled the flames across the dry landscape.</p><p>It's crept within about a mile of the eastern edge of the evacuated town of Lame Deer, Northern Cheyenne Tribe spokesperson Angel Becker said. The fire passed over a highway where officials had hoped to stop it, putting the southern portion of the reservation at increased risk, officials said.</p><p>Lame Deer, a town of about 2,000 people, is home to the tribal headquarters and several subdivisions and surrounded by steep, rugged, forest.</p><p>As it closed in on the east side of town and a second fire ignited to the west, tribal officials late Wednesday urged residents who did not heed the initial evacuation order to flee. Buses moved people to a school in Busby, about 15 miles away, and to the shelter set up on the nearby Crow Indian Reservation.</p><p>\"We had some people who refused, but the majority of our elders and women and children had definitely left with that last push,\" Becker said.</p><p>Firefighters worked into early Thursday morning around Lame Deer to keep the blaze from destroying houses. No houses were reported destroyed but fire officials continued assessing the damage. More than dozen sheds and other outbuildings were lost, they said.</p><p>As flames rose from both sides of a narrow valley and smoke choked the air, rancher Jimmy Peppers sat on his horse east of town, watching an orange glow intensify over the site of his house as the night wore on.</p><p>\"I didn't think it would cross the highway so I didn't even move my farm equipment,\" said Peppers, who spent the afternoon herding his cattle onto a neighbor's pasture closer to town.</p><p>Also ordered to leave were about 600 people in and around Ashland, a small town just outside the reservation. It remained under an evacuation order but officials said the danger appeared to have eased for now.</p><p>Around the perimeter of Lame Deer, crews were building fire breaks and conducting intentional burns - or \"burnouts\" - in hopes of lessening the amount of fuel available on the ground, said fire spokesperson Jeni Garcin. Officials were cognizant of the need to protect pastureland, she said.</p><p>\"We fully recognize the value of grass around here,\" Garcin said. \"There's enough lost in this fire that we will be very strategic about how we do any of these burnouts.\"</p><p>Extreme drought conditions have left trees, grass and brush bone-dry throughout many Western states, making them ripe for ignition.</p><p>At the same time, California and some other states face flows of monsoonal moisture that were too high to bring real rain but could create thunderstorms that bring the risk of dry lightning and erratic winds.</p><p>In Northern California, a number of wildfires and the threat of more prompted three national forests to close down the Trinity Alps Wilderness Area, a 780-square mile area of granite peaks, lakes and trails, into November.</p><p>Shasta-Trinity National Forest officials said they wanted to prevent more human-caused fires, while keeping tabs on hikers in unsafe areas threatened to divert firefighting aircraft.</p><p>Climate change has made the region warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make the weather more extreme and wildfires more destructive, according to scientists. The more than 100 large wildfires in the American West come as parts of Europe are also burning.</p><p>A new study finds that wildfire smoke may be part of a vicious cycle making clouds rain less, which makes it hotter and plants drier and easier to catch fire.</p><p>Scientists flew a research plane into smoky skies six times in the U.S. West in 2018 and found the smoke-filled skies had five times the water droplets but they were half the size, according to a study in Wednesday's Geophysical Research Letters. The smaller water droplets aren't big enough to fall as rain, said study lead author Cynthia Twohy, a cloud physicist at NorthWest Research Associates.</p><p>This is not the main cause for the lack of rain, but \"it could be a factor,\" Twohy said. \"The clouds are being affected. We saw that pretty clearly.\"</p><p>The study has worrisome implications that drought and fire can cause more drought and fire. The main cause of the drought, which is a huge factor in worsening wildfires, is natural weather changes with some possible climate change, said Park Williams a hydrology and fire scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who wasn't part of the research.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELHLD-4717609</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELHLD2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63C8-90M1-JCDM-J112-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">156396</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1076\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Woodward Communications, Inc.

But the impact for one species has been immediate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last fall an abnormally large number of birds began showing up dead in people's backyards, on hiking trails and in agricultural fields across Wyoming and the West. Lack of food, habitat and toxic gases released by wildfires led to the high numbers of bird deaths across the Western states and may lead to more this fall, according to University of Wyoming-led research.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That research, published in the April issue of the journal GeoHealth, sought answers to an \"unprecedented\" migratory bird die-off in Western states during and after the 2020 summer fire season.</p><p>Citizens and wildlife officials reported thousands of mysterious bird deaths in backyards, parks and wild spaces across 12 Western states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming.</p><p>The bird die-off was devastating, said Andrea Orabona, a non-game bird biologist at the Wyoming Game and Fish Department.</p><p>\"None of us had seen anything like this ever before,\" Orabona said.</p><p>The die-off extended into Wyoming, where lead researcher Di Yang, a geospatial data scientist and assistant professor at UW, noticed bird mortalities in Laramie after an unseasonably early winter storm last September.</p><p>\"Within one week of the snowstorm happening I started to see the dead birds on the street,\" Yang said.</p><p>Yang quickly found that others had been reporting similar mysterious bird deaths in other Western states on iNaturalist, an online citizen science platform where the public can report sightings and upload pictures and locations of birds and other wildlife species in their area.</p><p>\"That kind of motivated me to do some geospatial model-level research to try to build the connections and try to find the drivers,\" Yang said.</p><p>Yang and other research contributors from Colorado State University, the University of Georgia, Oregon State University and the University of Wisconsin-Madison began investigating the effects of environmental and climatic factors on migrating birds. Those factors included wildfires, air quality, drought and winter storms.</p><p>Over the summer and fall of 2020 citizen scientists documented their observations with photos and observations. A gallery of photos shows birds from warblers to owls lying dead on porches, in yards and other outdoor spaces. In some of the pictures more than 30 dead birds could be seen in one location, Yang said.</p><p>American robins, barn swallows, flycatchers, mountain bluebirds and Wilson's warblers were the bird species most frequently observed based on the death numbers reported, Yang said.</p><p>The sheer volume of observations collected by citizen scientists provided Yang with plenty of data for her study.</p><p>\"It is impossible for all the ecologists or biologists to collect this data in a short period of time,\" Yang said. \"The project was open for, like, three months and collected more than 1,500 observations.\"</p><p>Citizen scientists also reported another nearly 10,000 dead birds on a similar website, Wildlife Mortality Database.</p><p>Yang used the observations recorded under the Southwest Avian Mortality Project on iNaturalist, along with data on air quality, snowfall and other factors, to create her geospatial model and assess which variables might have had the most significant impact on avian mortality.</p><p>Yang's findings suggested that air quality, proximity to wildfires and an early winter storm were major drivers of the bird deaths.</p><p>Yang also found that migratory bird species were among the most affected groups, including warblers, American robins, flycatchers, hummingbirds and even some water birds.</p><p>In Wyoming in particular, the casualties reported were primarily migratory birds that likely came from the Pacific Northwest, according to Orabona. Both Yang and Orabona agree that severe droughts in Western states and the devastating forest fires that resulted, directly contributed to higher mortality levels in migratory birds by drastically reducing food resources.</p><p>\"Fires just remove berries and insects and things that these birds need to pack on fat before they migrate,\" Orabona said. \"Then combined with ... forest fire smoke and then drought conditions elsewhere and climatic issues ... It was overwhelming for so many of them.\"</p><p>During the summer and early fall of 2020, wildfire smoke was prevalent throughout the western United States, including Wyoming.</p><p>Between May and October 2020, wildfire smoke caused Wyoming to exceed national ambient air quality standards 26 times, according to the state Department of Environmental Quality's annual report.</p><p>Yang suggests that the increased levels of particulates and toxic gases in the air from the summer fires may have damaged the respiratory systems of some of the unlucky birds, contributing to the mass casualty event.</p><p>\"The toxic gasses that are released by the smoke are really important drivers,\" Yang said.</p><p>A concerning detail the study revealed was the possible long-term effects of climate change: increased droughts and summer fires, and more wildlife deaths.</p><p>\"We're seeing more extreme events like this due to climate change,\" Yang said. \"There might be a large possibility that we're going to continue seeing this pattern.\"</p><p>This year, parts of all Western states are considered to be experiencing extreme or exceptional drought, according to the National Interagency Fire Center's Drought Monitor, and the West is again seeing large numbers of wildfires and intense smoke.</p><p>Orabona worries this summer could result in more mass bird die-offs.</p><p>\"Birds have not started migrating yet, so everybody's kind of anxious that when migration does start in earnest we're going to see a similar effect,\" Orabona said. \"Given the similarities so far ... the intense heat and fires that are ongoing, I wouldn't be surprised.\"</p><p>Despite the ominous outlook and rampant climatic disasters experienced in 2021, Orabona remains optimistic that there is still a chance to prevent future climate destruction.</p><p>\"It's not too late, so we should try to embrace whatever we can do to help reduce the effects of climate change before it's too late,\" Orabona said. \"We have to accept the fact that climate change is real and humans are part of the problem. But we can also be part of the solution.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>An American robin.

Researchers can directly link a single event to climate change only through intensive data analysis, but they say such calamities are expected to happen more frequently.</p><p>In Greece, the worst blaze still burning Tuesday was in the northern section of Evia, the country's second-largest island, which is linked by a bridge to the mainland north of Athens and is a favorite holiday destination for the Greek capital's residents.</p><p>Nearly 900 firefighters, 50 ground teams and more than 200 vehicles were fighting the blaze that broke out Aug. 3, the fire service said. They included crews from Ukraine, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Cyprus and Poland \u2014 part of a huge international response to Greece's plea for assistance.</p><p>Fourteen helicopters provided air support Tuesday on Evia, including three from Serbia, two from Switzerland and two from Egypt. The wildfire on Evia, unlike many in the United States, was burning in an area in which villages and forests are entwined.</p><p>Hardalias said all the fire fronts on Evia were waning, but firefighters were guarding the perimeter of the blaze, particularly around a cluster of villages that were among the dozens evacuated on the island in recent days. However, heavy smoke from the fires has often reduced visibility to zero, making it too dangerous for water-dropping aircraft to assist ground forces.</p><p>According to EU wildfire data and satellite imagery, more than 49,000 hectares (121,000 acres) have burned up on Evia \u2014 by far the worst damage from any of the recent fires in Greece.</p><p>Several other wildfires were burning in the country, with the most significant in the southern Peloponnese region, where new evacuations were ordered Tuesday afternoon. About 400 firefighters, including teams from the Czech Republic and Britain, battled that blaze, assisted by five helicopters and 23 water-dropping planes from several countries.</p><p>A judicial investigation is under way into the causes of the fires, including any links to criminal activity. Several arson suspects have been arrested.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know whether there is any organized arson plan, that\u2019s not my job,\u201d Hardalias told the news conference. But it was his \u201cfeeling\u201d that at least with the flames near ancient Olympia, the seven or eight fires that broke out in close succession could be due to arson.</p><p>Also on Tuesday, a woman convicted of intentionally starting a fire in an Athens park last week was sentenced to five years in prison.</p><p>Residents and local officials on Evia have complained about a lack of water-dropping planes in the early stages that they say left the fire to grow to such proportions that flying became too hazardous.</p><p>Hardalias argued that when the Evia blaze broke out, authorities were already facing other enormous challenges. A major forest fire was burning through the northern outskirts of Athens, forcing the evacuation of thousands, and another was coursing through villages towards ancient Olympia \u2014 a hugely important archaeological site in the Peloponnese where the ancient Olympic Games were held for more than 1,000 years.</p><p>\u201cEvery house lost is a tragedy for all of us. It\u2019s a knife in our heart,\u201d he said.</p><p>Asked whether he was satisfied with the country's firefighting response, Hardalias said: \u201cObviously, there can be no satisfaction after such a catastrophe. But all our available forces, ground and airborne, were sent immediately to the fires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether we could have done something different remains to be seen,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in any case, we fought a great battle, and the losses were among those fighting it, not among civilians.\u201d</p><p>Greek authorities have emphasized saving lives, issuing evacuation alerts for dozens of villages and neighborhoods this summer. In 2018, a deadly fire that engulfed a seaside settlement near Athens killed more than 100 people, including some who drowned trying to escape the flames and smoke by sea.</p><p>Critics say the government\u2019s focus on evacuating villages prevented villagers with local knowledge from helping firefighters and led to more property destruction.</p><p>Greece's center-right government has pledged to provide compensation to everyone who suffered loss from the wildfires and to undertake a massive reforestation effort to replace the trees that have burned.</p><p>Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told a special cabinet meeting Tuesday that owners of destroyed or damaged homes would receive up to 150,000 euros ($176,000) in state compensation, with initial payments to begin next week, while businesses and farmers will also get support and tax breaks.</p><p>In southwest Turkey, crews battled two fires Tuesday in the coastal province of Mugla, including a brush fire near Bodrum\u2019s Gumusluk resort neighborhood. Bodrum\u2019s mayor said the fire was close to being extinguished and no residential areas were threatened.</p><p>Meanwhile, firefighters quickly put out a new blaze in a forest in Istanbul\u2019s Sariyer district.</p><p>___</p><p>Paphitis reported from Kontias, Greece.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow all AP stories about climate change issues at <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/climate\">https://apnews.com/hub/climate.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-c5cde2c3b83799fb09d50683b31929fe20210810</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63BF-KVY1-DYMD-6415-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1056\"/><timeReceived>7:15 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 10, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Spurred by a quest for profits and viewers, Newsmax\u2014a competitor to media giant Fox\u2014engaged in a race to the bottom with Fox and other outlets such as One America News Network (OAN) to spread false and manufactured stories about election fraud. Dominion quickly became the focus of this downward spiral of lies, as each broadcaster attempted to outdo the others by making the lies more outrageous, spreading them further, and endorsing them as strongly as possible,' the lawsuit against Newsmax states. <br/> A nearly identical passage also appears in the OAN complaint. Dominion already filed a defamation suit against Fox News[1] in March. <br/> The suits claim that in the months following the election, both Newsmax and OAN 'manufactured, endorsed, repeated, and broadcast a series of verifiably false yet devastating lies about Dominion.' Those alleged lies include claims that Dominion committed election fraud; its algorithms manipulated vote tallies; the company was founded in Venezuela 'to rig elections for the dictator Hugo Chavez,' and Dominion contributed to voting irregularities in states where its machines weren't used. <br/> According to Dominion, both networks also promoted and broadcasted interviews with 'discredited figures' such as Sidney Powell, Rudy Giuliani, Mike Lindell, and former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, all of whom Dominion has sued in their individual capacity. <br/> Both suits also assert that the conservative networks' broadcasts have adversely affected the country, repeatedly invoking the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. <br/> 'One such insurrectionist, David Blair, who was charged with swinging a 'lacrosse stick attached to a Confederate flag' at Capitol officers and striking one in the chest, stated through his attorney that he stormed the Capitol on January 6 because he had been 'sold a bill of goods' after 'watching Fox and Newsmax and OANN,'' the complaint against OAN stated. <br/> The suit against Newsmax was filed in Delaware Superior Court. The suit against OAN was filed in the U.S. District Court in Washington D.C. and also names owners Robert Herring and Charles Herring as well as OAN anchors Chanel Rion and Christina Bobb as defendants. <br/> 'To capitalize on the interest its target audience had in the false Dominion narrative, OAN effectively deputized its Chief White House Correspondent, Chanel Rion, as an in-house spokesperson for all Dominion-related content,' the suit states. 'After priming its viewers with a steady diet of post-election programming falsely claiming Dominion rigged the 2020 election, OAN and Rion began producing an entire line of programming exclusively devoted to defaming Dominion, descriptively named 'Dominion-izing the Vote,' which branded OAN's disinformation and defamation campaign against Dominion into a single catchy phrase that is now synonymous with fraudulently flipping votes.' <br/> Rion made national headlines last year when she pushed a since-debunked story claiming that former FBI lawyer Lisa Page had an affair with former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. <br/> 'Lisa Page carried on an affair with both Deputy Director McCabe and [Peter] Strzok, and as lovers-three, their text messages paint a now-infamous portrait of elitist intervention and collusion to derail a U.S. presidential candidate,' Rion said[2]. <br/> OAN later retracted the story. <br/> Other questions about Rion pre-dated her tenure at OAN, which began in May 2019. <br/> 'Rion claims to have produced a series of mystery books called 'Mystery by Design,' meant for 'traditional girls,' that have been 'offered as language trainers in grim and dedicated rote English-learning venues including China and South Korea,'' according to a report[3] from The Daily Beast. But a 2019 investigation[4] by Wonkette revealed that, outside of Rion's own references to the books, they do not appear to exist. <br/>Dominion CEO John Poulos released a statement saying the company had to take action against the networks. <br/> 'The defendants in today's filings recklessly disregarded the truth when they spread lies in November and continue to do so today,' Poulos said. 'We are filing these three cases today because the defendants named show no remorse, nor any sign they intend to stop spreading disinformation. This barrage of lies by the Defendants and others have caused\u2014and continue to cause\u2014severe damage to our company, customers, and employees. We have no choice but to seek to hold those responsible to account.' <br/> In an email to Law&amp;#38;Crime, a spokesperson for Newsmax insisted the network did nothing wrong. <br/> 'While Newsmax has not reviewed the Dominion filing, in its coverage of the 2020 Presidential elections, Newsmax simply reported on allegations made by well-known public figures, including the President, his advisors and members of Congress \u2014 Dominion's action today is a clear attempt to squelch such reporting and undermine a free press.' <br/> Charles Herring did not immediately respond to emails from Law&amp;#38;Crime concerning the Dominion lawsuit. <br/> Read both suits below. <br/> Newsmax Complaint (1) (Hosted by DocumentCloud)[5]Dominion OANN Lawsuit (Hosted by DocumentCloud)[6] <br/> [image

(Rocky Mountain Incident Management Team/BLM) I just wrapped up my senior year at Colorado State University. It was one defined by many challenges like the COVID-19 crisis, devastating wildfires[1] and adjusting to a new, virtual normal. In the past year and a half, the intersections of our environment and health have been exposed more than ever. </p><p><br/> In Fort Collins, we breathe some of the most polluted air in the country, exacerbated this year by smoke from the most intense, uncharacteristic fires in state history. We also saw continuous virus outbreaks devastate our people, schools, and businesses. And in places with diminished air quality, COVID-19 caused higher rates of infection, hospitalization and death[2]. <br/><br/> THE MORNING NEWSLETTER  <br/><br/> Subscribe now.  <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/newsletter\">https://coloradonewsline.com/newsletter</url><br/>Yet in the midst of the pandemic, the 2020 presidential election offered a sign of hope. For the first time, Coloradans are under a federal and state government that promised plans to address the public health and climate crisis. My generation knows that the threat of more pandemics and climate disruption are too high, and we are determined to hold our leaders accountable in delivering on their campaign commitments. <br/> Right now, Colorado is at a turning point: We can choose to robustly transition to clean energy, diversify our economy and prevent more climate warming, or we can fall back into our dirty fossil fuel past. There are two clear, immediate ways to take action today. First, Gov. Jared Polis must sign Senate Bill 21-200 into law, despite his threat to veto the bill[3]. The legislation would hold Colorado's biggest polluters accountable in meeting the state's climate goals and ensure the most impacted communities are centered in the process. And, secondly, the Biden administration should make its pause on fossil fuel leasing on public lands permanent. Both of these moves will significantly reduce greenhouse gas output and help us reverse the trend of damaged air, depleted water and climate disruption. <br/> At this moment, our lack of climate progress is met with the reality that our region is facing increasingly intensified drought, lingering vulnerability to COVID-19 outbreaks, and a projected devastating fire season. With climate change, wildfires are growing more frequent and dangerous. In recent years, forest fire smoke accounted for up to half of air pollution[4] in the West. <br/><br/><br/>Along with vulnerability to our health, fossil fuel dependency puts the stability of our economy at risk. Our state's fossil fuel addiction has pigeonholed us into a boom-and-bust cycle[5]. We've suffered fleeting jobs and unpredictable revenue streams \u2014 funds that are meant for our schools, public services and health care. My generation has been saddled with the opportunity to help rebuild our state and country into one with long-term, good-paying jobs that center on community investment and sustainability. That requires transitioning off of fossil fuels in a way that provides a just transition for oil and gas workers into clean energy and environmental remediation jobs. <br/> There is no question that fossil fuel activity is contributing to both our health and climate crisis. As of 2019, leases sold on public lands in Colorado for drilling and fracking could have emitted up to 184 million metric tons[6] of greenhouse gases. Fossil fuel activities on public lands make up nearly 25% of our emissions nationwide[7]. Communities near oil and gas extraction sites are at a much heightened risk of danger from air pollution and health consequences as hundreds of drilling and fracking wells[8] sit abandoned and leaking. <br/> I urge our leaders to be bold in this moment. We do not have time to waste. Polis must sign SB-200 into law to put his own climate Roadmap[9] into action, and the Biden administration should work to expeditiously phase out oil and gas drilling on public lands. The future is brighter the sooner we transition away from fossil fuel dependence. As a young person, I hope to see a world that is rooted in health, equity and sustainability \u2014 not just for our generation, but for those who come after us. <br/><br/> HELP US GROW  <br/><br/> Make a tax-deductible donation.  <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/donate\">https://coloradonewsline.com/donate</url><br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/largest-wildfire-colorado-has-ever-seen-burning-now-near-fort-n1243494\">https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/largest-wildfire-colorado-has-ever-seen-burning-now-near-fort-n1243494</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yP3AM-SpUI0bZK7p4gjwQTGcaeQqjrvw/view\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yP3AM-SpUI0bZK7p4gjwQTGcaeQqjrvw/view</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.coloradopolitics.com/legislature/polis-readies-his-veto-pen-for-democratic-backed-climate-change-legislation/article_ab9eaaee-a7be-11eb-a2d1-1b6d9bafcee2.html\">https://www.coloradopolitics.com/legislature/polis-readies-his-veto-pen-for-democratic-backed-climate-change-legislation/article_ab9eaaee-a7be-11eb-a2d1-1b6d9bafcee2.html</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/climate-climate-change-san-diego-health-wildfires-387f17ec8658335a7da5b9fe81c65abc\">https://apnews.com/article/climate-climate-change-san-diego-health-wildfires-387f17ec8658335a7da5b9fe81c65abc</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://coloradosun.com/2020/06/01/colorado-rig-count-lowest-on-record-oil-gas/\">https://coloradosun.com/2020/06/01/colorado-rig-count-lowest-on-record-oil-gas/</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wilderness.org/sites/default/files/media/file/TWS_The%20Climate%20Report%202020_Greenhouse%20Gas%20Emissions%20from%20Public%20Lands.pdf\">https://www.wilderness.org/sites/default/files/media/file/TWS_The%20Climate%20Report%202020_Greenhouse%20Gas%20Emissions%20from%20Public%20Lands.pdf</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/interiors-haaland-revokes-trump-era-directives-that-boosted-oil-and-gas-access-on-federal-lands-01618607448\">https://www.marketwatch.com/story/interiors-haaland-revokes-trump-era-directives-that-boosted-oil-and-gas-access-on-federal-lands-01618607448</url> [ 8]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.coloradopolitics.com/energy-and-environment/colorado-oil-gas-commission-examining-industry-s-financial-obligations-to-orphan-wells/article_c56df206-559d-5f92-bb34-8e0ff617428f.html#:~:text=Often%20they've%20been%20abandoned,shut%20down%20a%20bad%20operator.&amp;#38;text=There%20are%20215%20orphaned%20wells,to%20the%20Commission's%202020%20report\">https://www.coloradopolitics.com/energy-and-environment/colorado-oil-gas-commission-examining-industry-s-financial-obligations-to-orphan-wells/article_c56df206-559d-5f92-bb34-8e0ff617428f.html#:~:text=Often%20they've%20been%20abandoned,shut%20down%20a%20bad%20operator.&amp;#38;text=There%20are%20215%20orphaned%20wells,to%20the%20Commission's%202020%20report</url>.

Two other firefighters were in intensive care with severe burns.</p><p>\u201cWe handled an operationally unique situation, with 586 fires in eight days during the worst weather conditions we\u2019ve seen in 40 years,\u201d Hardalias told a news conference. \u201cNever was there such a combination of adverse factors in the history of the fire service.\u201d</p><p>Greece had just experienced its worst heat wave since 1987, which left its forests tinder-dry. Other nearby <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/europe-middle-east-business-fires-environment-and-nature-0454f3d57d511a08051759992de4c3b0\">nations such as Turkey</url> and Italy also faced the same searing temperatures and quickly spreading fires.</p><p>Worsening drought and heat \u2013 both linked to climate change \u2013 have also fueled wildfires this summer in <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/fires-environment-and-nature-california-weather-wildfires-75a774c3a302be9a43f9d0b876b1fe74\">the U.S. West</url> and in <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-europe-russia-fires-environment-and-nature-52bb942f4ad5956d3d9a5a870f733f4a\">Siberia in northern Russia.</url></p><p>Scientists say there is little doubt that <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/asia-pacific-latin-america-middle-east-africa-europe-1d89d5183583718ad4ad311fa2ee7d83\">climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas</url> is driving extreme events. Researchers can directly link a single event to climate change only through intensive data analysis, but they say such calamities are expected to happen more frequently.</p><p>In Greece, the worst blaze still burning Tuesday was in the northern section of Evia, the country's second-largest island, which is linked by a bridge to the mainland north of Athens and is a favorite holiday destination for the Greek capital's residents.</p><p>Nearly 900 firefighters, 50 ground teams and more than 200 vehicles were fighting the blaze that broke out Aug. 3, the fire service said. They included crews from Ukraine, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Cyprus and Poland \u2014 part of a huge international response to Greece's plea for assistance.</p><p>Fourteen helicopters provided air support Tuesday on Evia, including three from Serbia, two from Switzerland and two from Egypt. The wildfire on Evia, unlike many in the United States, was burning in an area in which villages and forests are entwined.</p><p>Hardalias said all the fire fronts on Evia were waning, but firefighters were guarding the perimeter of the blaze, particularly around a cluster of villages that were among the dozens evacuated on the island in recent days. However, heavy smoke from the fires has often reduced visibility to zero, making it too dangerous for water-dropping aircraft to assist ground forces.</p><p>According to EU wildfire data and satellite imagery, more than 49,000 hectares (121,000 acres) have burned up on Evia \u2014 by far the worst damage from any of the recent fires in Greece.</p><p>Several other wildfires were burning in the country, with the most significant in the southern Peloponnese region, where new evacuations were ordered Tuesday afternoon. About 400 firefighters, including teams from the Czech Republic and Britain, battled that blaze, assisted by five helicopters and 23 water-dropping planes from several countries.</p><p>A judicial investigation is under way into the causes of the fires, including any links to criminal activity. Several arson suspects have been arrested.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know whether there is any organized arson plan, that\u2019s not my job,\u201d Hardalias told the news conference. But it was his \u201cfeeling\u201d that at least with the flames near ancient Olympia, the seven or eight fires that broke out in close succession could be due to arson.</p><p>Also on Tuesday, a woman convicted of intentionally starting a fire in an Athens park last week was sentenced to five years in prison.</p><p>Residents and local officials on Evia have complained about a lack of water-dropping planes in the early stages that they say left the fire to grow to such proportions that flying became too hazardous.</p><p>Hardalias argued that when the Evia blaze broke out, authorities were already facing other enormous challenges. A major forest fire was burning through the northern outskirts of Athens, forcing the evacuation of thousands, and another was coursing through villages towards ancient Olympia \u2014 a hugely important archaeological site in the Peloponnese where the ancient Olympic Games were held for more than 1,000 years.</p><p>\u201cEvery house lost is a tragedy for all of us.

The fire, which has been raging on since Aug. 1, has reportedly wiped out more than 70% of the farm's vegetation,and the well-being of the birds is now in doubt.\"It is an unprecedented disaster,\" Ana Maria Barreto, the owner of the ranch, told CNN. </p><p>[1]\"It is very sad to see decades of my family work, years taking care and preserving nature, for this to happen.\"A study published in 2018 in Birdlife International, [2]a global partnership of conservation organizations that aim to conserve bird species around the world, revealed the blue macaws lost their fight for survival and had gone extinct[3]in the wild. A few, however, survived through breeding programs.According to Arara Azul Institute, [4]which advocates for environmental conservation, the total world tally of blue macaws now stands at 6,500 birds. Neiva Guedes, president of the institute, told CNN most of the birds may have winged their way to a safer location, but will possibly face food scarcity upon returning.\"They can manage to escape fires because they fly, but soon they will run out of food, and that is what we think will affect them most,\" Guedes said. Blue macaws survive on fruits and nuts, which would have burned due to the forest fire, Guedes said.Fire officials said although they managed to contain the fire near the macaws' nesting areas, there still looms a fear of re-ignition amid the existing high temperature and parched conditions. \"Every day is a surprise,\" Mato Grosso do Sul Fire Department Sergeant Rogrio Perdigo told CNN. \"We cannot say that we won, because that is not how it works, but we will continue the battle.\"The sanctuary is located in Pantanal, between Brazil's two states --Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul. Consisting of more than 37 million acres, the conservation facility is recognized by UNESCO for its rich biodiversity. The surrounding area, however, has repeatedly been the target of fires intending to clear trees and create pasture land.Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro signed a decree banning fires in Pantanal for 120 days following pressures from international investors calling for a crackdown on the destruction, threatening to divest from Brazilian companies otherwise, according to an August report by CNN.

But the acts she knew about and the powerful man behind them put not just her but her husband and their two toddlers in harm's way.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So she disappeared from their Florida home and re-created herself in Maine as wilderness guide Leah Trenton. She's haunted by her loss, but she has constructed a new life, even found a new love. She stays in secret touch with her husband, Doug, and their kids, now 13 and 11, think they have an eccentric Aunt Leah out in the woods somewhere.</p><p>Then Leah gets a panicked call from her daughter, Hailey. Doug had taught Hailey that she must contact Leah immediately if anything ever happened to him, and now he has died.</p><p>Can Leah reclaim her children without triggering the attention of the man who wants her dead? That's the question that sets in motion <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Never Far Away</emphasis>, the latest hard-charging thriller from Michael Koryta.</p><p>A former St. Petersburg resident and a veteran of Eckerd College's Writers in Paradise program, Koryta has published 16 novels. He's also worked as a journalist and a private investigator.</p><p>His 2014 thriller, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Those Who Wish Me Dead</emphasis>, has been made into a film starring Angelina Jolie, Tyler Perry and Nicholas Hoult; it will be released in May. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">So Cold the River</emphasis>, his 2010 supernatural thriller, is coming to the screen also, with production just wrapped but no release date yet.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Never Far Away</emphasis> is a stand-alone novel, but it has threads that connect it to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Those Who Wish Me Dead, If She Wakes</emphasis> and other Koryta books.</p><p>Like many crime fiction authors, Koryta has written a couple of series with main characters - Lincoln Perry and Markus Novak - who are private investigators. But with his last several novels, and this one, he's latched onto a different kind of recurring character: a hired killer.</p><p>Or rather a family of them.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Those Who Wish Me Dead</emphasis> featured Jack Blackwell and his brother Patrick, a terrifyingly skilled pair of assassins. The brothers make a harrowing cameo in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Never Far Away</emphasis>, but Jack's son, Dax, plays a major and complex role. He's taken up the family business, living by his father's advice: \"You must have a curious mind and an empty heart.\"</p><p>J. Corson Lowery is the man of \"rare and terrible power and reach\" who wants Nina dead, the founder of a private security company that one senator called \"Blackwater on steroids.\" Lowery is not the type to get his own hands dirty, of course, so he's set a couple of his employees on Leah's trail.</p><p>Even before she's sure that she's being hunted, Leah is coping with her children's fear and anger. They don't know her real identity; all they know is that, hard on the heels of their father's sudden death, weird Aunt Leah has spirited them away from their comfortable home in Kentucky and taken them to a small town in Maine where they know no one and even the Wi-Fi is iffy.</p><p>Leah's sweet-natured son, Nick, starts to come around, but Hailey bears more than a physical resemblance to her mother: She's as independent and strong-willed as Leah is. That will seriously complicate Leah's efforts to keep her kids safe.</p><p>Dax Blackwell is not working for Lowery; he has motives of his own when he tracks down Leah and her children. Boyishly handsome and mordantly funny, he's an ace at everything from hacking into the family's electronic devices to surviving in the wilderness.</p><p>That last skill comes in handy as Leah flees her pursuers, relying on her boyfriend, a pilot and hunting guide, to take her and the kids to Maine's remote Allagash Wilderness, the sort of place where nature is stunningly beautiful and utterly indifferent to human beings.</p><p>Koryta is adept at bringing such harshly lovely places to life, then pitting his characters against their perils - in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Those Who Wish Me Dead</emphasis>, a massive forest fire dominates the latter part of the book.</p><p>In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Never Far Away</emphasis>, the wild world's threats combine with the human ones in a layered, twisting plot that Koryta steers skillfully. It's an electric, fast-paced thriller, maybe Koryta's best one yet. But it's also an effective novel about families - how they shape us, how they can sometimes save us, or destroy us.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Never Far Away</emphasis></p><p>By Michael Koryta</p><p>Little, Brown, 384 pages, $28</p><p>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.tampabay.com/resizer/A8UjUjteaEbIz4oSVn8f037Qeko=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tbt/JCINJA3JCFDEHNLFEM3R5DBA6M.jpg\">See image link</url><br/>Michael Koryta's latest thriller is \"Never Far Away.\"<br/></p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.tampabay.com/resizer/szPAfZPYG_Jtg75G2-bdMHoKES4=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tbt/DZJ6DXJ72NCTJK45POF4D7FKOY.jpg\">See image link</url><br/></p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STPETE-IU4NOA2OVBGOVL2WPQ27R63UYI</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STPETE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:624K-C1X1-JCBJ-Y04W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-03-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"708\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Times Publishing Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Tampa Bay Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"02\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>February 26, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp;
