If you need to report or discuss a sexual assault, you can call the Rape &amp; Sexual Assault Crisis Line at 888-421-1100.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Samantha Hansen has openly shared her sexual assault story for years, posting about it on her blog and as part of her platform when she competed for MissMontana in 2016.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But until recently, there was one part of the story the 29-year-old new mom from Herriman kept to herself \"that I got pregnant when I was raped, that I went to Planned Parenthood to find out my options.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hansen's experience isn't uncommon, but her proximity to Utah's abortion policy is.</p><p>After her sister, Republican state Rep. Kera Birkeland, announced in August that she is proposing a bill that would keep clinics from offering abortions to rape victims who can't provide a law enforcement-generated case number, Hansen publicly shared that the sexual assault led to her becoming pregnant at 21.</p><p>Birkeland's bill is currently labeled \"Felony Reporting Requirements\" on the Utah Legislature's website. It's one of four abortion-related bills already opened for the upcoming legislative session.</p><p>Although its text isn't yet available, if the legislation is passed as described in a Facebook post made by Birkeland, people impregnated during a sexual assault would have to first go to the police before obtaining an abortion- something Hansen didn't feel comfortable doing until months had passed after her attack.</p><p>\"It took me well over a year before I was able to file a police report; re-living the smallest details of what happened to me as the police took their report (knowing full well any DNA was long gone, all I could do was hope to create a stronger case for the next girl should she find the strength to come forward sooner than I did) was one of the hardest things I have ever done,\" Hansen wrote in a Facebook post about the bill.</p><p>In an October email, Birkeland said she is still working on the bill, and that she plans to build in support for sexual assault survivors.</p><p>Hansen said she hadn't even told her mom that she had been pregnant and sought information about an abortion until this year, when the right to one, previously protected under Roe v. Wade, was called into question. In making that post, Hansen told The Salt Lake Tribune, she was again hoping to help the next girl.</p><p>\"I wanted to keep one piece of me for me, but I can't, because there's too many people that will suffer if I don't once again use this platform I have built and stand up for what I believe in and say ... had I not had that choice, I would have been successful taking my life,\" Hansen said. \"I know I would have been.\"</p><p>Samantha's story</p><p>Hansen, then-Samantha Yates, was a student at Brigham Young University in late August 2014, living off-campus in an Orem condo owned by her parents.</p><p>At the time, Hansen wrote in a 2015 blog post, she was living alone. Then-21 years old, most of her friends had either graduated the previous year or not yet returned to school from summer break.</p><p>While waiting tables, she met a new friend - a man who called her Lana Del Rey's doppelg\u00e4nger and had an interest in lunch dates and texting about Hansen's love life. Hansen, she said, was under the impression that their relationship was friendly and not romantic.</p><p>One night, Hansen invited him over to watch Netflix. He brought the snacks and drinks.</p><p>This friend, who may have given Hansen a false name, slipped a drug into the Coke she was drinking, Hansen alleged in an incident report made to the Orem Police Department in January 2016 and obtained by The Tribune. She told police that she thought her friend did it when she stood up to make popcorn.</p><p>After that, Hansen's memory is fuzzy, but she remembers her friend kissing her as she tried to push him away.</p><p>\"It's mostly a bunch of flashes,\" Hansen wrote in her blog post, titled \"The R Word.\" \"Occasionally, when I dream about that night, I'll remember something new. Those are the nights that I wake up shaking and wanting to cry, feeling like I'm about to lose my mind because I can't be certain if I'm truly remembering something that my subconscious is finally allowing me to see, or if it's something my mind just fabricated.\"</p><p>Hansen didn't report the assault to BYU because her friend wasn't a student there, she said in an interview The Tribune, and because her housing situation didn't fully meet the school's requirements.</p><p>Up until this year, all BYU students were required to live in on-campus housing, off-campus school-contracted housing, or with a family member. That rule now only applies to students in their first two semesters. Although her parents owned the condo, living there alone didn't meet BYU's standards.</p><p>The sexual assault took place at a time when students at the school run by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints were often investigated and disciplined under the university's Honor Code after reporting that they had experienced abuse.</p><p>Hansen decided to report her rape to the police in 2016, hoping to keep her attacker from hurting other women and to \"close that book\" in her life.</p><p>The Orem Police Department report says that a detective would compile a photo lineup of possible suspects from a driver's license database using the name Hansen's friend used when interacting with her prior to the assault. According to the report, Hansen was out of town at the time and had said she would call the detective when she was back in Utah.</p><p>The Tribune generally does not identify alleged victims of sexual assault, but Hansen, whose name was redacted in the report, agreed to be identified by her name in this story.</p><p>Hansen said she was never made aware of the photo lineup. An email chain between Hansen and the detective on the case that was shared with The Tribune does not mention the photo lineup and did not include a response to Hansen's most recent email.</p><p>It's also unclear if the detective attempted to share that information over the phone. A follow-up report from the detective includes a log of his attempts to contact Hansen. The last call he documented making to her was on Jan. 21, the day before she sent the last email.</p><p>According to the incident report, the case was closed in March 2016, two months after it was opened.</p><p>\"Whatever that detective wrote in that report, that's what has happened with that case,\" a spokesperson for the Orem Police Department said in a phone call. \"Standard procedure would be to keep in contact with them. ... Our detectives are going to continue to try and contact them, and then at some point, if they stopped contacting, I guess they can be seen as someone who was not wanting to cooperate.\"</p><p>The Orem Police Department incident report notes that Hansen was physically injured in the assault, and continued to be impacted for months.</p><p>A few weeks after her sexual assault, after she missed her period and took a pregnancy test, which turned up a positive result, Hansen said she drove to the Orem Planned Parenthood, just a few blocks away from her condo, to \"find out my options.\"</p><p>\"I was at BYU, I was obviously active LDS at the time, and I'd always been taught that if you're raped, or if there's incest, it's OK. You just go,\" Hansen told The Tribune.</p><p>After her appointment, Hansen knew she had a hard choice ahead of her.</p><p>\"I came home that night and pretty much split my soul in half trying to figure out what I was going to do,\" she said.</p><p>Ultimately, Hansen decided she couldn't go through with the abortion. She said she hadn't made up her mind as to whether she would keep the child or give it up for adoption, but soon after, it didn't matter. Hansen miscarried.</p><p>The trauma from being raped, she said, led Hansen to try several times to take her own life. In the winter after she was assaulted, her church bishop referred her to a therapist to help her deal with the intense depression and anxiety she was feeling.(Samantha Hansen) While competing for the title of Miss Montana in 2016, Samantha Hansen - then Samantha Yates - organized a walk for awareness of sexual violence.</p><p>What kept Hansen from following through with her suicide attempt the second time, she said, was a statistic that made her feel less alone - one in three women experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime, according to the World Health Organization.</p><p>\"That meant I knew women who had experienced exactly what I was going through,\" Hansen wrote in a 2020 blog post.</p><p>With that knowledge, Hansen decided she wanted other women who went through what she did to know they were not alone. She competed in the Miss MontanaAmerica pageant in 2016 with a platform centered on sexual assault awareness.</p><p>\"I was the person that broke the silence, that got to have a lot of difficult conversations with people that were still in the headspace of, 'We shouldn't talk about these things,'\" Hansen said of her platform, which preceded the viral #MeToo Movement by a year. \"And I'm going, 'Why shouldn't we? It affects one out of three. Why shouldn't we talk about it?'\"</p><p>Changes to abortion law in Utah</p><p>Two weeks before the Fourth of July, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case Dobbs v. Jackson that abortion is not a constitutional right. Hansen and her husband, Josh Hansen, didn't feel like celebrating Independence Day as they usually do - by hosting a party and lighting off fireworks.</p><p>Instead, they took their new daughter, who was 10 weeks old, to the steps of the Utah Capitol to protest the state's abortion trigger law that took effect with the Dobbs decision. The law, which is currently on hold under a court order, bans abortion except in limited circumstances, including rape.</p><p>With her daughter strapped across her chest in a lavender carrier, Hansen held up a sign that read, \"She deserves a better future than this,\" with an arrow pointing down at her baby.(Samantha Hansen) Samantha Hansen attends a rally in support of reproductive rights in Salt Lake City.</p><p>Months earlier, on the 49th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, Hansen's older sister by 9 \u00bd years stood on the same steps as protesters called for the undoing of the precedent that protects abortion.</p><p>Pro-LifeUtah President Mary Taylor spoke at the event, promoting a bill Birkeland introduced during the 2022 legislative session to increase regulations on abortion clinics and further limit access to abortion procedures. It didn't pass.</p><p>Birkeland joined the Legislature in April 2020, not long after then-Gov. Gary Herbert signed the Abortion Prohibition Amendments - more commonly known as Utah's abortion trigger law. The lawmaker is running for reelection, and included in her platform is that she \"will fight\" for \"the unborn.\"</p><p>In August social media posts announcing her upcoming bill to require survivors to report their rape to police before seeking an abortion, Birkeland wrote, \"When a brave survivor comes forward to report, the full weight of the law should be behind them. We can't afford to play games with this process, especially in an attempt to undermine abortion laws. Attempts to do such only hurts and re-victimizers rape survivors.\"</p><p>Hansen has long known that her sister opposes abortion, but having both grown up in the LDS Church, which officially \"allows for possible exceptions for its members (to seek an abortion) when ... pregnancy results from rape or incest,\" Hansen said she was shocked that Birkeland is taking this approach.</p><p>She agrees that more needs to be done to thoroughly investigate sexual assault allegations, but said putting that responsibility on survivors isn't the way to do it.</p><p>\"Let's get the victim support first, instead of punishing them when they already had a choice stripped from them. Let's not strip more choices,\" Hansen said.</p><p>In an August interview following Birkeland's announcement, BYU nursing professor Julie Valentine, whose research focuses on violence against women, said, \"coercing anyone into an act, especially after they have gone through this substantial trauma, will be very damaging.\"</p><p>Reporting a sexual assault to law enforcement can present safety risks, she pointed out. Women living in a domestic violence situation may be further endangered if the assailant is contacted by police, and people assaulted by someone they know could be threatened with retaliation if they disclose what happened.</p><p>\"We need legislation that is trauma-informed, victim-centered and evidence-based. And this proposed legislation is the opposite of every single one of those concepts,\" Valentine said.(Leah Hogsten | The Salt Lake Tribune) Rep. Birkeland, far left, attending a March for Life at the Capitol in January. (Leah Hogsten/)</p><p>Birkeland declined an interview about her sister's Facebook post, but said in an email, \"It's unfortunate that my sister has felt the need to misrepresent facts regarding me, our relationship, and my own experience with sexual assault. However, my relationship with her is between she and I and I will not be airing our family's laundry in the court of public opinion. Nor do I wish to publicly disclose my own personal experiences to gain political favor.</p><p>\"I believe in legislating with logic over emotion. I am continually working with professional victims' advocates to ensure that all victims are heard and considered while working to (strengthen) state law regarding offenders,\" Birkeland continued.</p><p>In a later email prior to the publication of this story, Birkeland emphasized that she has not finished drafting the bill and that it is still in the research phase. The bill, she added, will be complex and involve multiple agencies. It will \"include ways to provide support to the women who come forward that isn't currently offered.\"</p><p>\"I want to hold the rapists and violent sexual offenders accountable, which is why I'm hoping that more and more women will come forward about their abuse,\" Birkeland wrote in the email. \"And we need it done in a time frame where the offenders can still be caught and prosecuted.\"</p><p>\"She is trying to wrap this bill up and package it with a pretty bow and label it as being for survivors. And as a survivor, I'm calling bull----,\" Hansen said. \"That is not a survivor bill, that is an anti-abortion bill. Let's call a spade a spade.\"</p><p>In her more than half a decade advocating for survivors of sexual assault, Hansen said her cause has never felt more important than it does now that she has a daughter.</p><p>When she found out last year that she was pregnant with a girl, Hansen cried, terrified that the child, like her mother, would be among the one-in-three women who experience violence. Her daughter's birth has driven her to be louder than before.</p><p>\"I already had a fire,\" Hansen said. \"We went from a pretty good bonfire to a forest fire when she came into this world.\"</p><p>Editor's note \u00b7 This story is available to Salt Lake Tribune subscribers only.

There were forestry crews from across the state.\"</p><p>Bob Kurilla, assistant district forester for the Weiser Forest District, said the fire started in the park and traveled to State Gamelands No. 141.</p><p>\"We're trying to get better mapping on that ... \" Kurilla said Thursday afternoon, later adding the fire was \"100% contained.\"</p><p>Kurilla said Bureau of Forestry crews had been using natural barriers in an effort to stop the spread.</p><p>\"We're trying to remove the fuel from the fire,\" he explained, citing methods like cutting fire lines, using bulldozers to clear away brush and debris, and adding rock outcroppings. \"We are in the phase where we are burning up some of the unburnt leaves from the forest floor.\"</p><p>The area about six miles from the Glen Onoko access point in Jim Thorpe is steep, rocky and covered in brush, making it difficult to navigate. Wednesday's winds helped fuel the fire as did Wednesday and Thursday's relative low humidity.</p><p>Kurilla said another crew would work Thursday into today.</p><p>\"Hopefully it will be under control by the morning,\" he said.</p><p>In addition to Lehigh and Lausanne, Rossman said almost every Carbon County fire company responded to the scene. On hand were the Pennsylvania Game Commission and fire companies from Jim Thorpe, Lehighton, Mahoning Twp., Lansford, Summit Hill, Nesquehoning, Parryville, Franklin Twp., White Haven and Foster Twp.

Depending on your choices in a game called <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Survive the Century</emphasis>, the Earth could see a temperature increase of 2 degrees Celsius, or even 3 degrees; top headlines might read \"Versace premieres 'cooling suits' at Paris Fashion Week allowing fashionistas to go outside in the tropics,\" or \"Last chance to see: Five cities expected to sink within the next decade.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's a bleak picture, and one that may seem at odds with the idea of video games as a form of escapism or fun. Each day we're confronted with more and more realities of climate change, so why would we also want to deal with climate change in our games?</p><p>[Image: Survive the Century]<br/><br/>Games offer a unique format for teaching, persuading, or raising awareness about important topics, says <url normalizedValue=\"https://drjoeylee.com/\">Joey J. Lee</url>, a lecturer of technology and design at Columbia University's Teachers College, and director of the school's Games Research Lab, in an email. Lee (who was not involved with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Survive the Century</emphasis>, but has developed other games that tackle climate change and social issues) says it's about \"using game designs to foster eudaimonia (human flourishing) rather than only hedonia (addiction and temporary pleasure).\"</p><p>There are a few things games can do particularly well, like fostering empathy by allowing people to experience different situations impacted by climate change; making climate change relevant for players, so they understand why they should care; and adding in some practicality, showing concrete steps people can take to make an impact. The format of a game can break down people's guards, reaching someone who might otherwise get defensive in the face of political or emotional topics. And games are crucial for encouraging understanding in a way that's very different from textbooks, Lee says.</p><p>\"Rather than content to be 'absorbed,' they provide a model of reality-or a system of interconnected parts that a student can interact with and play with,\" he says. \"Variables can be reduced to allow players to focus on specific aspects of a problem and to see the consequences and what happens as they interact with that system. Abstract concepts can be made much more tangible, [for example] the ability to see invisible aspects of nature, to visualize how sea level rise affects coastlines over time via time travel mechanics, to manipulate magnetic fields with your hands in VR.\"</p><p>[Image: Jakob Kudsk Steensen]<br/><br/>Digital games are also easy to share online, helping get a message out to the masses. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Survive the Century</emphasis>, for example, was created by a group of scientists, economists, and writers to help people see what kinds of futures might lie ahead depending on our actions, and to show that there are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-global-tech/futuristic-computer-game-hopes-to-be-tonic-for-climate-change-anxiety-idUSKBN2CR1ZC\">a lot of choices</url> we can make about our climate, and those choices have real impacts. Virtual reality experiences-like <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Tree</emphasis>, a VR experience that turns you into a rainforest tree, during which you can experience everything from the small act of a bird landing on your branch to the devastation of a forest fire-can be \"emotionally impactful and eye opening, which can spark important conversations that can lead to change,\" Lee adds. Games can let people experience things in a different way than just watching a video; <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Beyond Blue,</emphasis>which lets players explore the ocean, was inspired by the BBC's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Blue Planet II</emphasis> documentary series.</p><p>[Image: Xin Liu/Yedan Qian]<br/><br/>Lee has been studying and even developing these sorts of games for years, publishing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2566#:~:text=Games%20are%20natural%20tools%20for%20climate%20change%20education%20and%20engagement.&amp;text=In%20this%20way%2C%20games%20provide,and%20traditional%20lecture%20formats10.\">journal articles</url> about climate change games as tools for education, and cocreating games like <url normalizedValue=\"https://ecochainsgame.com/\">EcoChains Arctic Life</url>, a card game in which players try to keep Arctic species alive as sea ice melts. It's a field that he's seen rapidly grow in the last decade. \"Climate change games have become a crowded space, with all sorts of games, which is a good thing,\" he says.</p><p>[Image: E-Line Media]<br/><br/>Conferences like the Games for Change Festival feature game projects on social issues such as climate change, and the United Nations (UN) this year launched a mobile game called <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/un-ozone-secretariat-launches-reset-earth-animation-film-mobile-game\">Reset Earth</url>, in which three teenagers try to save the planet in an ozone-depleted future. In 2019, the UN launched a <url normalizedValue=\"https://playing4theplanet.org/\">Playing for the Planet Alliance</url> that now has big names in gaming on board like Ubisoft, the production company behind <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Assassin's Creed</emphasis>, and Sony Interactive Entertainment. (Plenty of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21135321/video-games-climate-change-beyond-blue-bee-simulator-temtem-endling\">small creators</url> have been making games that explore climate change, too.) In joining the alliance, these companies committed to both make their operations more environmentally friendly with carbon footprint reductions and efforts to address waste, and to insert \"green activations\" into their games.</p><p>Lee hopes to see more collaborations between game developers, climate scientists, and academics. The field of climate change games will likely keep growing, because there are so many ways to address the topic, and each type of game can serve a different purpose. \"It's probably a mistake for one game design to try to do it all,\" he says, adding that a game shouldn't resemble a textbook, because that doesn't play into the strengths of game design. \"Some games might try to change behaviors, others to raise awareness about an injustice or some phenomenon happening, others to impact identity and to make an issue more personally relevant, still others to spark new discussions or provide some learning.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_1280,q_auto,f_jpg,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2021/09/p-1-90671510-why-so-many-games-are-tackling-climate-change.gif\">Link to image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FASCOM-90671510</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FASCOM2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63JF-NT01-JC1K-F2F1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">475434</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"885\"/><timeReceived>7:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Mansueto Ventures, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Fastcompany.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 7, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Impact</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>Business &amp;

These projects will help build more resilient communities, and protect both people and existing infrastructure.</p><p>Among these projects, the Village of Lions Bay will construct a 2-storey addition to the emergency building. The addition will expand the apparatus bays and retrofit the Emergency Operations Centre, BC Ambulance, and Search and Rescue Services. Once completed, multiple emergency services will have additional space to store equipment and hold meetings.</p><p>The Resort Municipality of Whistler will create fuel breaks as barriers to slow or stop the spread of wildfires in the Nesters Hill area. This will help manage the impacts and extent of wildfires and associated risks to residences and critical infrastructure in the community.</p><p>The Government of Canada and the Province of British Columbia are investing nearly $1 million in these projects through the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program's new COVID-19 Resilience Infrastructure Stream. Canada is contributing over $760,000, and B.C. is contributing over $190,000.</p><p>Quotes</p><p>\"Municipalities are on the frontlines in responding to the effects of climate change. As extreme weather events increase in frequency and severity, municipalities need the resources and funding to manage emergency situations to protect both people and properties. This funding will upgrade Lions Bay's emergency building and support forest fire mitigation efforts in Whistler. Through investments like these, the federal government is working with all orders of government to build infrastructure that will ensure communities are resilient to climate variability and change.\"</p><p>Patrick Weiler, Member of Parliament for West Vancouver--Sunshine Coast--Sea-to-Sky Country, on behalf of the Honourable Catherine McKenna, Minister of Infrastructure and Communities</p><p>\"When people need urgent help, it's important to know that support is available. Expanding the emergency building in Lions Bay is a way to give community members that peace of mind and ensure that the people doing this incredible work have the space, resources, and training they need to save lives.\"</p><p>Bowinn Ma, Member of British Columbia's Legislative Assembly for North Vancouver-Lonsdale, on behalf of the Honourable Josie Osborne, Minister of Municipal Affairs</p><p>\"Emergency services based in Lions Bay include the Lions Bay Fire Rescue Department, BC Ambulance, our local Emergency Operations Centre and Emergency Support Services, as well as Search and Rescue. The Lions Bay Emergency Building Upgrade Project will provide much needed additional training, equipment and apparatus space for our emergency services, enabling them to increase their levels of service to our community and adjacent communities up and down the Sea to Sky Corridor. This project will also address building, electrical and mechanical deficiencies to meet current safety codes and protect for years to come the health and safety of our first responders. \"</p><p>Ron McLaughlin, Mayor of Lions Bay</p><p>\"We are grateful for this investment from the Federal Government and the Province of BC into the Resort Municipality of Whistler's fuel thinning program for Nesters Hill. As climate change creates warmer and drier conditions, our vulnerability to wildfires increases significantly. It's critical that we are able to invest in forest management programs to reduce the risk of wildfire to our communities, wildlife and sensitive ecosystems.\"</p><p>Jack Crompton, Mayor of the Resort Municipality of Whistler</p><p>Quick facts</p><p>* To support Canadians and communities during the COVID-19 pandemic, a COVID-19 Resilience Infrastructure Stream has been added to the over $33-billion Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program to help fund pandemic-resilient infrastructure. Existing program streams have also been adapted to include more eligible project categories.</p><p>* Under the COVID-19 Resilience Infrastructure Stream, the federal cost share for public infrastructure projects is up to 80% in the provinces, and up to 100% in the territories and for projects intended for Indigenous communities. For projects that are federally funded at 80%, British Columbia contributed 20% to provide a total cost share of 100%.</p><p>* Across B.C., the federal funding of COVID-19 resilience projects is in addition to more than $4.4 billion that has already been invested in over 580 infrastructure projects under the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7553491 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7553491</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:637P-FVB1-DYG2-R37V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"876\"/><timeReceived>8:30 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 28, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The huge ship, Of Course I Still Love You, is known as one of the firm's two vehicles to catch landing rockets and return them to land.</p><p>Less than a minute after stage separation, the two halves of the rocket's nose cone fairing, both veterans of two earlier missions, fell away for parachute descents to capture netting aboard waiting recovery ships. To do this, SpaceX wants to compel at least 1,440 satellites.</p><p>There are also plans for a large fleet of 30,000 additional Starlink satellites, but a network of that size has not been authorized by the FCC.</p><p>Sasse says Trump kowtows to dictators, \"spends like a drunken sailor\"</p><p>Sasse's office confirmed the authenticity of a recording, first reported by the Washington Examiner . He also accuses Trump of having 'treated the presidency like a business opportunity'.</p><p>The Starlink system is created to provide low-priced internet access in traditionally underserved areas around the world. The service is already being tested by some SpaceX employees, with public beta testing anticipated to begin later this year.</p><p>On September 28, the Washington Military Department announced that it was using the Starlink Internet service as emergency responders and residents of Malden, Washington, recovered from a forest fire that destroyed much of the town.</p><p>Musk tweeted earlier this month that Starlink would be \"revolutionary\" for remote regions and in emergency services situations where landlines are damaged. Tele-health will no longer be an issue, as will tele-mental health.</p><p>To address space debris concerns, Starlink said on its website that its satellites have an on-board propulsion system that would allow it to eventually deorbit at the end of life and should that method not work, the satellites would burn within one to five years in the Earth's atmosphere. Thus, the company's orbit satellite network has expanded a little more.</p><p>SpaceX is set to launch more than 120 satellites in October. A Falcon 9 rocket with another batch of Stalink satellites landed Wednesday at 12:36 p.m. (1636 GMT) from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on a pad 40 to the elevator.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4790838</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:613V-8SJ1-JBSN-33SY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"489\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Stillman Advance: Stillman College</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 20, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Tuscaloosa</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>AL</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Communications Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxMkU0NzE2OEE2NDIxNEE3QzU0NjU2MDRERUNGNDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Fixed Satellite Services</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkE2NjYyOUIzRTJFNDcwNjhCMDE1RkM3MDU1RTg1NUY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDAxNTAwQTRFOTc5NDVFQTlBNTdBOUNGMTdENDNBMjk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DPJR</classCode><className>PRIVATE SPACEFLIGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008WTA</classCode><className>SPACE EXPLORATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DN68</classCode><className>SPACE PROGRAMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp;

There were forestry crews from across the state.\"</p><p>Bob Kurilla, assistant district forester for the Weiser Forest District, said the fire started in the park and traveled to State Gamelands No. 141.</p><p>\"We're trying to get better mapping on that but we say it's about 60% contained,\" Kurilla said Thursday afternoon.</p><p>Kurilla said Bureau of Forestry crews had been using natural barriers in an effort to stop the spread.</p><p>\"We're trying to remove the fuel from the fire,\" he explained, citing methods like cutting fire lines, using bulldozers to clear away brush and debris, and adding rock outcroppings. \"We are in the phase where we are burning up some of the unburnt leaves from the forest floor.\"</p><p>The area about six miles from the Glen Onoko access point in Jim Thorpe is steep, rocky and covered in brush, making it difficult to navigate. Wednesday's winds helped fuel the fire as did Wednesday and Thursday's relative low humidity.</p><p>Kurilla said another crew would work Thursday into Friday.</p><p>\"Hopefully it will be under control by the morning,\" he said.</p><p>In addition to Lehigh and Lausanne, Rossman said almost every Carbon County fire company responded to the scene.On hand were the Pennsylvania Game Commission and fire companies from Jim Thorpe, Lehighton, Mahoning Twp., Lansford, Summit Hill, Nesquehoning, Parryville, Franklin Twp., White Haven and Foster Twp.

This liberated Elwha was freed to erode the footings of the antique bridge that had never quite reached bedrock.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A March 2018 Forks Forum article described Department of Transportation plans to rebuild the bridge in 2020 before something bad happened like, say, a log jam like the one currently piled up against the Sol Duc bridge on Mora Road.</p><p>Potential for cutoff</p><p>Out and out failure of the Elwha Bridge would have left state Highway 112 the only route to the west end of the Peninsula. Until last winter's mudslides destroyed what amounted to the paved elk trail we knew as Highway 112.</p><p>The other not-for-the-faint-hearted detour would have been the paved goat path along the eastern shore of Lake Crescent, which formerly connected highways 101 and 112. Until a forest fire showered the road with rock slides so it's been closed with no clear date of reopening.</p><p>Forest labyrinth</p><p>Leaving the labyrinth of logging roads through the uplands between the Twin Rivers and Bear Creek as a last possible link to the West End of the Peninsula in the case of emergency.</p><p>But you made it across the Elwha Bridge, arriving at the shores of beautiful Lake Crescent. Completed in 1922, the road around the lake is in the best shape of its 100-year history. A recent rebuild finds the road around Lake Crescent a dreamy drive on a fresh carpet of smooth asphalt. People still crash their cars here anyway. They've watched too many car commercials of people stump-jumping through the wilderness and splashing through creeks and \u2026 bam.</p><p>Many bridges of Sol Duc</p><p>West of Lake Crescent, get ready for another driving adventure. One of the more popular tourist questions is, \"How many bridges are there over the Sol Duc River?\" Visitors can think they're trapped in a Groundhog Day vacation loop. No matter how many Sol Duc bridges there are, each of these antique structures can provide all the thrills any driver could want.</p><p>Driving across a Sol Duc bridge behind a line of tourist traffic feels like you're a hog in a chute. Then you meet a log truck, monster RV and Lowboy tractor trailer while trying to miss the platter-sized chuckholes. After which, our visitor will want to stop in Forks, kiss the ground, get an apple fritter and move on.</p><p>South of Forks, one encounters an eroded landscape of Pleistocene clay deposits. These remains of the continental ice sheet are worthless for anything but ruining your day. Unstable at any temperature or moisture content, the clay oozes downhill, taking the road with it when you least expect it.</p><p>Bogachiel</p><p>Eventually, the persevering driver is rewarded with a new bridge crossing the Bogachiel River. The old one fell in the river. Confirming the locals' belief that it's the only way we can get a new bridge out here in the West End. Remember to always check to see if a bridge is still there before you cross it.</p><p>South of the Bogachiel, we are treated with stunning views of Mount Olympus and the Hoh River Valley, which means crossing the Hoh River Bridge. This was voted by me to be the scariest bridge on the Olympic Peninsula.</p><p>Built in 1931, the Hoh River Bridge was the final link in the Olympic Loop highway that we now call 101. Traffic has gotten heavier and faster since 1931. The Hoh River Bridge, like the glaciers on Mount Olympus, seems to be shrinking.

Keller to defend against a $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit filed by voting technology company Dominion[1]. The civil lawsuit, originally filed in late March, accused Fox News of fueling lies about the outcome of the 2020 presidential election by defaming the maker of electronic voting machines. From the lawsuit's opening salvo: Fox, one of the most powerful media companies in the United States, gave life to a manufactured storyline about election fraud that cast a then-little- known voting machine company called Dominion as the villain. After the November 3, 2020 Presidential Election, viewers began fleeing Fox in favor of media outlets endorsing the lie that massive fraud caused President Trump to lose the election. </p><p>They saw Fox as insufficiently supportive of President Trump, including because Fox was the first network to declare that President Trump lost Arizona. So Fox set out to lure viewers back \u2014 including President Trump himself \u2014 by intentionally and falsely blaming Dominion for President Trump's loss by rigging the election. Babcock, of the Texas law firm Jackson Walker, 'has tried over 100 cases to a jury and argued over 50 appeals,' his online biography states[2]. 'He handles all types of commercial trial work and has particular experience in media and First Amendment litigation.' He has 'represented individuals such as Warren Buffet, Oprah Winfrey, Dr. Phil McGraw, George W. Bush, and Reggie Love (aide to President Obama). His corporate clients have included ORIX USA, Celanese Corp, Fox News Network, CNN, Google, CBS Television Studios, Vantage Drilling International, Warner Brothers Pictures, New Line Cinema, 3M Corporation and OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network.' Elsewhere, Babcock indicated[3] that he has represented former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly, Warner Brothers, Inc., and Google Inc. Keller, of the Texas law firm Lehotsky Keller LLP, 'has argued 11 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court and 12 cases before the Texas Supreme Court,' his biography states. 'He is the only practicing lawyer to have argued at least 10 cases in both courts.' 'Before founding Lehotsky Keller LLP, Mr. Keller headed Baker Botts LLP's Supreme Court Practice,' the bio continues. 'He also has significant experience at the highest levels in all three branches of government. Mr. Keller served as the Solicitor General of Texas, the State's chief appellate litigator. He was U.S. Senator Ted Cruz's chief counsel on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Mr. Keller was a law clerk for Justice Anthony Kennedy of the Supreme Court of the United States and Chief Judge Alex Kozinski of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.' The bio also indicates Keller is unafraid to defend his clients in the court of public opinion: he 'frequently represents clients in cases where public communications strategy is crucial, and he has made numerous media appearances in major outlets such as the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, BBC, Fox News, NPR, and Politico.' He is also an adjunct professor at the University of Texas School of Law. Keller is a member[4] of the conservative Federalist Society. Valerie A. Caras, Blake Rorbacher, and Katharine L. Mowery are currently listed on the docket as Wilmington, Delaware-based attorneys for Fox News Networks. The case is being litigated in Delaware's state superior court system.

Keller is entirely unrelated to the author of this report.] [Image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images]The post Fox News Taps Two Texas Attorneys to Lead Fight Against Dominion Voting Systems Defamation Lawsuit[5] first appeared on Law &amp;#38; Crime[6].

The comment was written on Nov. 8, 2021, and posted on Nov. 12, 2021:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) on September 8th 2021 regarding potential future regulation addressing pyrolysis and gasification units in the Federal Register. The EPA is soliciting information and requesting comments to assist in the development of regulations specific to pyrolysis and gasification units transforming different types of wastes. GECA Environnement (\"GECA\"), a consulting company specialized in pyrolysis and its products, would like to thank the EPA for the opportunity to comment.</p><p>GECA has highlighted several points which it believes must be considered when developing regulations specific to pyrolysis and gasification.</p><p>1. Nomenclature: GECA agrees with the EPA that pyrolysis and gasification processes are different than that of incineration. Indeed, the primary objective of most proponents of pyrolysis and gasification is to recover value within wastes. Products coming from pyrolysis and gasification have markets, and these markets will grow at a faster rate once process-specific regulations are implemented.</p><p>2. Feedstock: Most \"new\" transformers, i.e. those applying for permits today, use waste material, notably, some types of biomasses, including bark, biosolids, digestate and agricultural residues, contaminated plastics, and tires. These residues currently have little value if any.</p><p>Forestry wastes, such as tree tops, branches and bark, are generally left in the woods if not piled up and left to decay on the side of the road, without much use. Wood does not degrade as rapidly as other types of organic wastes, which makes it more difficult to compost in large quantities. Additionally, such biomass is considered forest fire fuel in high-risk areas such as California and Oregon. Agricultural waste with little value is also generally left on site to decay if not burnt in open air fires. Nut shells (almond shells, walnut shells, pistachio shells, pecan shells), which pile on nut transformer sites in the order of hundreds of thousands of tons per year, are an example of waste agricultural biomass.</p><p>Mixed plastics and tire wastes are also difficult to transform into usable products by other means than pyrolysis or gasification. For tires, mulch and rubber crumbs can be produced, but little is done aside from incineration or landfilling after these products hit their end-of-life. In the case of mixed plastics and MSW, there is a need to manage these wastes as to re-integrate them in other processes and industries rather than landfill them. Pyrolysis offers an interesting solution to recycle hydrocarbons while displacing fossil products and less sustainable waste management strategies.</p><p>3. Process: GECA encourages the EPA to consider the recycling of the syngas as an eligibility criterion in the upcoming process-specific regulations. In most cases, a pyrolysis unit that does not recycle its gases, at least in part, is not self-sufficient on an energy basis. To promote the adoption of safe and environmental pyrolysis and gasification, commercial/industrial units should be required to recycle gases/energy based on a throughput category, as an example. Most commercial-scale technologies already implement this kind of energy recycling system. In the case of air curtain burners producing biochar, GECA encourages the EPA to consider these units separately than pyrolysis and gasification in their regulations. Pyrolysis and gasification units should be held to the same standards as incineration when it comes to emissions, since most systems use thermal oxidizers to combust remaining gases before their release.</p><p>4. Products: The products resulting from pyrolysis and gasification are destined to several different markets.</p><p>These products, particularly energy and industrial inputs, have the potential to replace several types of fossil products and therefore contribute to reaching the US' targets in the biofuels and bioenergy sector for solid, liquid and gaseous energy products. Additionally, energy generated from pyrolysis and gasification units have the potential to supply local communities in remote areas or areas with low access to renewable energy. However, it would be a mistake to consider pyrolysis and gasification as processes able to generate energy products only. Several markets for the liquid products, including bio-oil and pyroligneous acid, and solid products, including biochar and biocoal, exist in industries such as cosmetics, agriculture, metallurgy, composites, building materials, filtration, and more.</p><p>5. Other waste management systems: Pyrolysis and gasification are often thought as competitors to recycling, landfilling, composting and anaerobic digestion systems. GECA encourages the EPA to consider pyrolysis and gasification as complementary technologies to the previous waste management methods. Pyrolysis and gasification can take in problematic wastes that cannot be recycled, cannot be composted fast enough, such as waste wood, cannot be digested, such as solid digestate itself, or could be kept out of the landfill, such as mixed plastics and tires. Pyrolysis and gasification are complementary to traditional recycling which is highly dependent on contamination rates. Contaminated materials such as plastic films may be sorted out, as they currently are, and pyrolyzed instead of exported or sent to the landfill. Additionally, pyrolysis and gasification should be seen as a method to extend the life expectancy of landfills that are filling up rather quickly, while providing local markets for wastes.</p><p>To conclude, GECA supports the EPA's approach to consider specific regulations targeting pyrolysis and gasification units. GECA would like to thank the EPA for showcasing leadership regarding pyrolysis and gasification technologies as well as for providing this opportunity to comment.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Suzanne Allaire, PhD</p><p>CEO</p><p>GECA Environnement</p><p>* * *</p><p>The proposed rule can be viewed at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.regulations.gov/document/EPA-HQ-OAR-2021-0382-0001\">https://www.regulations.gov/document/EPA-HQ-OAR-2021-0382-0001</url></p><p>TARGETED NEWS SERVICE (founded 2004) features non-partisan 'edited journalism' news briefs and information for news organizations, public policy groups and individuals; as well as 'gathered' public policy information, including news releases, reports, speeches.

The original piece alleged that police in Chicago told ShotSpotter to alter evidence and that prosecutors were 'forced to withdraw' evidence generated by ShotSpotter's technology. <br/> Motherboard, Vice's tech-focused publication, reviewed defense filings in a Chicago murder case and concluded that although ShotSpotter's algorithms initially classified a sound as fireworks, a ShotSpotter analyst 'manually overrode the algorithms and 'reclassified' the sound as a gunshot.' Another analyst subsequently changed the location of the sound to have occurred near where a suspect's car was seen on camera, the article said. <br/> 'Rather than defend ShotSpotter's technology and its employees' actions in [an evidentiary] hearing, the prosecutors withdrew all ShotSpotter evidence against [the suspect],' the story continued. <br/> The article said that the Chicago case 'isn't an anomaly' and that a review of court documents in cases from Chicago and in New York State 'suggests that the company's analysts frequently modify alerts at the request of police departments \u2014 some of which appear to be grasping for evidence that supports their narrative of events.' <br/>ShotSpotter, in its lawsuit, said that if anyone is pushing a narrative, its Motherboard and Vice. <br/> According to the complaint, Vice reporters 'recklessly disregarded or intentionally concealed facts that rebutted their smear campaign, for example: that ShotSpotter is led by a Black CEO and overseen by a board that includes the president of the largest civil rights organization in the United States, that ShotSpotter has saved the lives of Black gunshot victims, and that ShotSpotter's expert witnesses have exonerated Black men of crimes they did not commit.' <br/> The complaint says that Vice's efforts to brand itself 'subversive' and 'edgy' provide a 'powerful financial motive to misrepresent court records and conceal facts that undermined its false preconceived narrative' \u2014 a narrative that, according to ShotSpotter, repeatedly reveals bias and misconduct within police departments. <br/>ShotSpotter, meanwhile, has said[3] that forensic evidence generated by its technology is '100% reliable,' and the company insists that it 'has never altered the information in a court-admissible detailed forensic report based on fitting a police narrative.' <br/>ShotSpotter provided Vice with information refuting the story, the complaint says, but Vice published the story anyway. <br/> 'As ShotSpotter informed [writer Todd] Feathers before publication, evidence collected by the ShotSpotter system has been used by both prosecutors and defendants in 190 court cases in 20 states over the years,' the complaint says. 'As court records reflect, no court has ever found that ShotSpotter altered or fabricated evidence. Instead, court records reflect that ShotSpotter has repeatedly withstood [evidentiary] challenges[.]' <br/> 'In this multimedia defamatory campaign, Vice deliberately misrepresented court records and other facts' about ShotSpotter, attorney Tom Clare said in a press conference Tuesday. <br/> The complaint claims that Vice's 'deliberate misrepresentations' about ShotSpotter stretched across Vice's podcast and social media. <br/> Vice's actions included some of the 'most damaging accusations that someone can make against a company like ShotSpotter,' said Clare, who is no stranger[4] to high-profile[5] defamation litigation[6]. 'This is some of the most egregious defamation that we've seen in our practice.' <br/> Clare also represents Dominion Voting Systems in lawsuits against Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, MyPillow CEOMike Lindell, and more[7]. <br/> 'Vice crossed a serious line,' ShotSpotter CEO Ralph Clark said at the press conference.

They were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.</p><p>The planned Sept. 18 rally at the Capitol comes as a jittery Washington has seen a series of troubling one-off incidents \u2014 including, most recently, a man who parked a pickup truck near the Library of Congress and said he had a bomb and detonator.</p><p>WASHINGTON, D.C.</p><p>Democrats promote Cheney to vice chair of Jan. 6 committee</p><p>House Democrats have promoted Republican Rep.

Rochelle Walensky, an HMS professor of medicine and chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Mass General, is senior author on the study.</p><p>Billions of dollars have been spent on developing COVID-19 vaccines, and preliminary evidence suggests that several candidates appear to be extraordinarily effective.</p><p>\"But there are lots of ways to think about the effectiveness of a vaccine,\" said Walensky.</p><p>She teamed with A. David Paltiel, professor of public health at the Yale School of Public Health, and several other colleagues to create a mathematical model that assessed how factors beyond efficacy might influence how well a COVID-19 vaccine will thwart the disease. Those factors included:</p><p>- How fast and broadly can the vaccine be produced and administered. Some candidate vaccines pose logistical challenges, such as needing to be stored in ultra-cold freezers or requiring two doses, spaced weeks apart.</p><p>- The portion of the population is willing to be vaccinated. National surveys suggest that as few as 50 percent of Americans say they will receive a COVID-19 vaccine.</p><p>- The severity of the pandemic when a vaccine is rolled out. The proportion of infections a vaccine is able to avert is directly related to the public's willingness to engage in mitigation behaviors, such as wearing masks and social distancing.</p><p>The mathematical model they employed considered how these factors would influence the impact of vaccines of varying levels of efficacy.</p><p>\"We found that infrastructure will contribute at least as much to the success of the vaccination program as will the vaccine itself,\" said Paltiel. \"The population benefits of vaccination will decline rapidly in the face of manufacturing or deployment delays, significant vaccine hesitancy or greater epidemic severity,\" he added.</p><p>To help ensure a vaccination program's success, Walensky said that a significantly greater investment in infrastructure to deliver COVID-19 vaccines is needed.</p><p>Moreover, powerful public messages and on-the-ground implementation strategies at the local level are also necessary to help overcome skepticism about vaccines, especially in underserved populations.</p><p>The Health Affairs study showed that even a highly effective vaccine will struggle to control COVID-19 if infection rates continue to rise.</p><p>\"If I have a cup of water, I can put out a stove fire. But I can't put out a forest fire, even if that water is 100 percent potent,\" said Walensky, emphasizing the public's role in keeping the infection rate low by wearing masks and practicing social distancing.</p><p>\"We'll get out of this faster if you give the vaccine less work to do,\" she said.</p><p>* * *</p><p>JOURNAL: Health Affairs - <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.02054\">https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.02054</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7304347 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7304347</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61C8-0001-DYG2-R44T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-11-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"574\"/><timeReceived>9:00 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"11\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>November 24, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

I am with those two lovely people.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And be sure to watch ONE NATION on and follow us on social media and my own thing on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Rumble.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNFILTERED with Dan Bongino is next.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You want to drink us out?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Where is the champagne of beers?</p><p>DAN BONGINO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, \"UNFILTERED\": So Biden's new classified documents problem. Well, wouldn't you know, it is a perfect example of what I've told you about before Democrats doing exactly what they accuse Republicans of doing. But guess what? This is not the first time Dems have pulled this dipsy do flipperoo. Don't miss my monologue, it is just seconds away.</p><p>And the White House loves to hate Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, you know that. Tonight, one of his picks to shake up a liberal university in the State is here to respond to accusations of a hostile takeover -- hyperbole much.</p><p>Also comedy with an agenda, late night host, the Jimmy Fallon's latest comedian -- and I mean that term loosely -- to let their agenda show and surprise, it's just not funny, and neither is he.</p><p>You know who is funny? Comedian, Jamie Lissow, he has a bit that pulls back the curtain on these liberal comics. And Pete Hegseth, he is fired up with Hot Takes. Everything from Gen Z losing their patriotism and the push to tear down history at his alma mater.</p><p>So Joey B. Joe Biden got some classified documents from his time as VP, not only in his office at the UPenn think tank, which is hilarious in and of itself. I can't bring that up enough. Joe Biden had a think tank guy. Digest that for a moment.</p><p>But he also had some documents at one of his Wilmington homes, in the garage. Should we be surprised? Of course, we shouldn't be surprised because the left has become pathetically predictable. Whenever they accuse conservatives of doing something, it's likely there's probably a 99.962 percent chance they're doing it themselves because they're frauds.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: By the way, my Corvette is in a locked garage. Okay, so it's not like they are sitting on the street.</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: The material is in a locked garage.</p><p>BIDEN: Yes, as well as my Corvette.</p><p>KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: This is all part of the Justice Department process.</p><p>We're going to respect the process.</p><p>We're just not going to get ahead of the process.</p><p>We will let the process continue. It's an ongoing process.</p><p>And remember, there is an ongoing process and we have spoken when it is appropriate.</p><p>BIDEN: People know I take classified documents and classified information seriously.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BONGINO: Sure, you do, Joe. Remember the raid at Mar-a-Lago? The liberal/media narrative was Trump is guilty, illegally handling and storing classified documents and our National Security was at risk. It was the nuclear codes. He's about to be criminally charged. They've got him this time. This was version 5,324 of the walls are closing in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This classic picture of the walls closing in.</p><p>JOY REID, MSNBC: Why in the world would he need to have these kinds of sensitive documents in Florida or really anywhere?</p><p>REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA): So you're not above the law. You're not in the elite. You're not untouchable, and so it's nice to see that the rule of law has returned.</p><p>ELIE MYSTAL, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: My top level expert legal analysis of the affidavit is, why ain't this dude in jail?</p><p>MSNBC HOST: In many ways, it feels like the walls are closing in on Donald Trump.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BONGINO: That's hilarious, that clip now, because even CNN is reporting that Joe Biden's classified documents included Intelligence related to Ukraine. Ukraine? What? Iran and the UK.</p><p>Don't worry, folks, there is absolutely nothing to see here. I'm sure of it. And just in case you know, the liberal clowns out there don't believe the left's reaction is orchestrated, here is Joy Behar on \"The View,\" saying out loud why they think Joe Biden's classified documents are really no big deal, but Donald Trump committed a crime. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOY BEHAR, COHOST, \"THE VIEW\": Well, we all know that Trump is a liar and a thief. So it's not that big a jump to say that he obstructed and he lied. We don't think that Biden is a liar and a thief, so we give him the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BONGINO: Okay, none of this is about principles at all. Matter of fact, it's about the Dan Bongino theory. What's the Dan Bongino theory? Republicans think Democrats are people with bad ideas, but liberals specifically think Republicans are bad people with ideas.</p><p>Joy just showed you what it looks like in action right there. And of course, let's not forget the greatest of all time when it comes to classified docs, you know, Hillary Clinton, BleachBit lady. She stored classified documents at her private home server when she was Secretary of State.</p><p>Once again, Democrats are already doing exactly what they accuse Republicans are doing because they're just frauds, folks. They're just phonies.</p><p>I got more receipts. Remember when Democrats accused Trump of a quid pro quo after his phone call with Zelenskyy, the liberal media insist that he has to be impeached over those accusations.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAUREN FOX, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The quid pro quo has been at the center of this Democratic Impeachment Inquiry.</p><p>CHRIS HAYES, MSNBC: And yes, there was a quid pro quo. It has been clear for a while, it is clear as day in the call notes the White House itself released.</p><p>CBS NEWS REPORTER: After rejecting the notion of a quid pro quo for weeks, the White House appeared to suddenly switch gears.</p><p>MIKA BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC: We begin with what appears to be another instance of quid pro quo by President Trump.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BONGINO: Of course, we've known for years that Hunter Biden's alleged shady business deals in China and Ukraine have directly implicated the big guy, Joey Biden, but if you don't believe me, here is the Big Guy himself talking about the quid pro quo he made with Ukraine when the prosecutor he once fired in this clip was looking into his son, Hunter.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, THEN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Now, I was supposed to announce that there is another billion dollar loan guarantee, and I had gotten a commitment from Poroshenko and from Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the State Prosecutor and they didn't.</p><p>Guys, I am leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money. Well, son of a [bleep]. He got fired.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BONGINO: You believe this guy? He puts it out there on video for the world to see. And of course, even after Putin's invasion of Ukraine, business of the Hunter Biden linked firms apparently booming. Again, nothing to see here at all, folks, don't worry about it.</p><p>And don't forget about China. Even after Biden got elected President in 2020, Hunter still had ties to a Chinese investment firm, showing there is nothing to be concerned about there either, because the Democrats have frauds. They don't care.</p><p>They almost always are doing exactly what they accuse conservatives of doing. And of course, since conservatives are accused of wanting to destroy democracy and President Trump allegedly held classified documents that he is a criminal, of course and had quid pro quo with Ukraine, he must be friendly with dictators, too. Remember this one.</p><p>Trump was constantly accused of being cozy with the world's worst leaders praising strong men, caving to Kim Jong-un and siding with Putin. These are real headlines. Look at them right there. But let's just forget how cozy the Democrats have been with the dictators? No, no. Not here. Even terrorist regimes?</p><p>Remember when Obama traded five Gitmo detainees for deserter American soldier, Beau Bergdahl? Yes, how did that end up? Oh, yes, those terrorists are working for the Taliban again. It feels a little cozy to me.</p><p>But here is what cozy actually looks like. Remember when Obama went to the baseball game with dictator, Raul Castro? They even did the wave together. The wave.</p><p>There is more. Just months ago, Joe Biden traded the Russian arms dealer known as the Merchant of Death -- the Merchant of Death -- that's his nickname for WNBA player Brittney Griner. Sure, that'll end well for Russia. But if you listen to Joe Biden, he says he's going to stand up to dictators all the time.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BIDEN: I have taken on the very people that in fact we are worried about. I've taken on the Castro's of the world. I've taken on the Putin's of the world. I've taken on all these dictators. I haven't cozied up to them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BONGINO: Yes, sure you have. But that's kind of weird because here is Joe Biden's climate czar, John Kerry just weeks ago, with his lips surgically attached to the rump of Venezuelan dictator Maduro.</p><p>And the biggest dipsy-doo flipperoo of them all, remember when Democrats -- when they accuse Republicans of exactly what they're doing. Remember the whole pee-pee tape thing? Donald Trump in these sexual escapades and it's all on tape. Weird how we've never seen it? Well, again, there was a bizarre sexual tape out there, but it wasn't Donald Trump.</p><p>Folks, you can't unsee this stuff once you see it. I'm just going to leave that right there. Oh, leave that one right there.</p><p>You can see now why I'm not surprised when they found classified documents in Joe Biden's possession. Right? They telegraphed it, because the Democrats are frauds, and if you ever want to predict what the next Democratic crisis is going to be, just keep an eye on what they're doing today and accusing Republicans of. It is the easiest trick in the world.</p><p>The success record is like a hundred percent. There's a really good chance the Democrats, as I said, are already doing the exact same thing.</p><p>Joining me now is FOX News contributor and former Wisconsin Congressman, Sean Duffy.</p><p>Sean, thanks for joining the show. Congrats on the new show on FOX. We'll get to that in a second. But I don't trust, Sean, this Special Counsel. We have now a unique situation where two leading candidates for President Biden and Trump both have Special Counsel investigations. I think this Special Counsel for Biden is a way to make this whole thing go away, say oh, the process, never answer a question and into potentially selectively leak going forward to impact his presidential campaign. Your thoughts on that.</p><p>SEAN DUFFY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Dan, first off, a brilliant monologue. It was spot on. And you're absolutely right. I have no faith in the Department of Justice that they're going to run down Joe Biden and eventually prosecute Joe Biden for crimes that he has committed.</p><p>We have a two-tier justice system in America and it goes against Republicans. So listen, it favors Democrats, but what you said was really important in the monologue in that whatever Democrats say about Republicans, Democrats are doing themselves and so that's true.</p><p>But Dan, if you look at it this way, they go, but they also talk about what the penalty should be for Republicans that commit the Democratic crime. So if you go back to Mar-a-Lago. Yes, Democrats said, Donald Trump was guilty. That's true. But they also said that Donald Trump was treasonous. He was a traitor, right?</p><p>BONGINO: Right.</p><p>DUFFY: And the penalty for that is death. So, let's apply that same Democrat standard that they had for Donald Trump to Joe Biden. We can't have a traitor in the White House. So let's forget about the Department of Justice and the Special Counsel. We have a Republican House.</p><p>You can't have a traitor in the White House, Dan. We need to impeach Joe Biden, not by my standard, not by your standard, but by the Democrats' standard.</p><p>BONGINO: Right. By their standards.</p><p>DUFFY: By their standards.</p><p>BONGINO: Right.</p><p>DUFFY: And we should equally apply their standard.</p><p>BONGINO: Exactly. Bingo.</p><p>DUFFY: And Kevin McCarthy --</p><p>BONGINO: And you know what's funny, Sean, you apply their standard you'll have these lunatic media outlets going crazy conspiracy theorist, Sean Duffy. I'm just repeating your nonsense logic, you imbeciles.</p><p>But I want to ask you this, too, Sean. You're a lawyer. You're a super smart guy. You've got a lot of experience with the legal system. I think there's something bigger going on here, Sean.</p><p>These things were not just found like, oh, look, a -- no one pays a thousand dollar an hour White shoe lawyer to go move documents. And here's another clue that there's something bigger going on. Think about this, who was the second tranche of documents story leaked to? Ken Dilanian, fusion Ken Dilanian from NBC, a mouthpiece for like the Deep Staters out there.</p><p>There is something else going on here we don't know about. There is no way this isn't classified documents.</p><p>DUFFY: When it takes two months to let the story come out and the White House has been really cagey when they're asked questions. Listen, if this was a simple mistake with he had classified documents, but not that secret a document, they are going to put it all out there. Let it breathe, get the story behind them.</p><p>They haven't done that, Dan. This is a forest fire on their doorstep.</p><p>And then you might wonder, well, why hasn't the White House been willing to release the logs of visitors to Joe Biden's Delaware house where these documents were kept? That might be embarrassing. What Chinese figures, what Chinese Intel figures might have come through the Delaware home? There were also in the Penn Biden Center. What contacts do they have with China that had access or at least proximity to these documents?</p><p>This is going to be really embarrassing, which is why they're acting so shady, Dan. I had that in my notes, Dan. This is just the start. It's going to be a forest fire that they can't put out.</p><p>BONGINO: I agree. Listen, you can catch Sean and Dagen on their new show. I'm stoked. I've already told you producers I am going to make it on week one over there, \"The Bottom Line\" starting January 23rd, weeknights at 6:00 PM on FOX Business, support this patriot. He's a great host and a great guy.</p><p>Sean, thanks for your time. I look forward to the show.</p><p>DUFFY: Thanks, Dan. Appreciate it.</p><p>BONGINO: You got it.</p><p>Our next guest says Attorney General Garland tried to cover up Biden's handling of classified documents because of Hunter Biden. This is interesting.</p><p>Former Kansas Attorney General Phillip Kline joins us.</p><p>Phil, thanks for your time. I had you on the radio show this week. The phones blew up after you got off, because you have an interesting theory about why the Assistant United States Attorneys assigned to the Hunter Biden case and the classified documents case are not only separate, but from separate regions, if you could expound on that.</p><p>PHILLIP KLINE, FORMER KANSAS ATTORNEY GENERAL: Yes, sure. What you see in the assignment of a Special Counsel, it's not -- the substance is not that a Special Counsel has been picked, it is what authority that they have to investigate.</p><p>And when you look at the Special Counsel as it relates to President Biden, they have a very narrow authority according to the appointment letter, only to look at the documents.</p><p>Now let's take a look at it for a second, Dan. What Attorney General Garland knew when he made this decision? He knew that the documents were found at the Penn Biden Center. He knew that the Penn Biden Center when they located it at the University of Pennsylvania, that the University of Pennsylvania received $47 million while that center was there, that the University of Pennsylvania pushed that money to Biden, and 10 of his Cabinet members received salary up to 10, at the Penn Biden Center, including Mr. Biden.</p><p>Additionally, at the same time, Hunter is on the Burisma Board. The documents pertain to Ukraine, and that would be of interest to those who are concerned about Hunter Biden and who he's dealing with and those who are paying his salary.</p><p>So you have some evidence of intent as to why the documents should be there and that evidence of intent relates to the flow of money. There is something else that Attorney General Garland knew. He knew that he had received a letter from the University of Pennsylvania, asking that he end the China initiative of the Department of Justice, which is looking at economic espionage by China.</p><p>Now, you have to understand that 50 percent of the most wanted list on the FBI's fugitive list relate to espionage by China. He ended it at the request of the University of Pennsylvania. That is a conflict of interest.</p><p>Yet, he only gave the Special Prosecutor a very narrow focus while President Trump's special prosecutor can look at everything.</p><p>BONGINO: Phil, again. That's why the phones blew up. People are really, really upset about this. I think we're all being scammed.</p><p>Phillip Kline, thanks for your time. We appreciate it.</p><p>KLINE: Thank you.</p><p>BONGINO: You got it.</p><p>Coming up on UNFILTERED. What is Eric Swalwell -- remember the Congressman tied to Fang Fang -- still doing on the Intel Committee? You know with access to government secrets and stuff like that? Congresswoman Lauren Boebert reacts, coming up next.</p><p>BONGINO: Welcome back to UNFILTERED.</p><p>Listen, three Democrats may finally get the much deserved boot off some of these top House Committees. One of them is Rep. Eric Swalwell who is alleged to have kind of shacked up with suspected Chinese spy named Fang Fang.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ABC NEWS HOST: It is a story straight out of a spy novel.</p><p>KPIX REPORTER: Suspected Chinese spy targeted California politicians, and one of her biggest targets was representative have Eric Swalwell.</p><p>AXIOS REPORTER: That is espionage gold.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): If you got the briefing I got from the FBI, you wouldn't have Swalwell on any Committee.</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): Well, I don't have any concern about Mr. Swalwell.</p><p>REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA): This is only about vengeance and there is no substantive reason, you know, to remove us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BONGINO: You heard what Speaker McCarthy said that at the FBI briefing, they wouldn't have this guy, Swalwell on any Committee.</p><p>Joining me now is Colorado Congresswoman Lauren Boebert.</p><p>Congresswoman, first, I want to thank you and the 20 patriots who stood up in the Speaker's fight and got some conservative liberty oriented concessions for the Congress. That was fantastic.</p><p>REP. LAUREN BOEBERT (R-CO): Yes.</p><p>BONGINO: But seriously, Swalwell is a disaster. We know about the scandal with Fang Fang. How is this guy still on the Intel Committee getting briefings?</p><p>BOEBERT: Well, first of all, Dan, thanks so much for providing cover for us 20 that we are fighting for these legislative wins that we have received, these fundamental changes in DC.</p><p>But as far as Swalwell, I mean, look at last Congress. Congressman Gosar was removed from his Committee because he made an anime video. So do I think that Swalwell being compromised by a Chinese spy is reason to be removed from the Intel Committee? Heck, yes, I do.</p><p>He is obviously sold out to China. In the House, I just voted to stop selling our strategic oil reserves to China. So did most Democrats. But little Eric took a walk and refused to take the vote. He is compromised, and he should be nowhere near top secret classified information.</p><p>BONGINO: Congresswoman, Adam Schiff as well. This guy wasted six years of our life fantasizing about some Trump pee-pee tape that didn't exist. And now he got busted in the last Twitter files thing, trying to push another hoax about Russians and released the Devin Nunes memo thing. I mean, isn't this another guy who should just be nowhere near classified information?</p><p>BOEBERT: Absolutely. You know, they're really showing their colors. They are a bunch of Blue-Anons conspiracy theorists that have these witch hunts and hoax that they chase after.</p><p>The Democrats' double standard is out of control. They wanted Trump in jail over classified documents and with Biden, it is let's wait and see. They attacked Don, Jr. and praised the crackhead gun criminal, Hunter Biden.</p><p>And now you can even imagine, if it was a Republican caught with a Chinese spy, what would they do? They would be all over that. But the fake news, they would be running 24/7 If this was a Republican, and instead they are running from it because it's a Democrat and most Americans haven't even heard about everything that's going on.</p><p>And not only has -- going back to Swalwell -- is he not only been a member of the Intel Committee, but he was a Subcommittee Chair. And in one hand, he is holding a gavel and Dan, in the other hand, he's holding a hammer and sickle.</p><p>BONGINO: Yes, he is Pelosi's buddy right there. Congresswoman Lauren Boebert, thanks again for everything you guys did up there. You did great. Thanks for your time.</p><p>BOEBERT: It was a great week. Thanks so much, Dan.</p><p>BONGINO: You got it.</p><p>Here's a question for you to ponder, isn't comedy, you know, like supposed to be funny?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIMMY FALLON, \"THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON\" HOST: There was Alpha then, Delta, then Omicron Next, but this latest variant might be the best. It is XBB.1.1.5 Another brand of COVID-19 has arrived.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BONGINO: Was there a joke in there or something? A comedian who actually makes people laugh is here to pull back the curtain on comedy's new political agenda, coming up next.</p><p>ASHLEY STROHMIER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Welcome to \"FOX News Live,\" I'm Ashley Strohmier in New York.</p><p>No relief in sight for storm-weary people across California. The Golden State continues to get battered by wind, rain, and snow. At least 19 deaths are blamed on the storms.</p><p>And as flood dangers grow, so do the numbers of power outages and life- threatening road conditions. One tiny community in Santa Cruz County has been ordered to evacuate. There are also fears of an avalanche in the Lake Tahoe region and forecasters tell us more storms are unfortunately on the way.</p><p>Our nation's South also feeling nature's wrath. A swarm of tornadoes and powerful winds has left a trail of death and destruction across nine States. At least nine people are confirmed dead, that number could also climb. Rescuers are still searching through miles of rubble that was once homes.</p><p>I'm Ashley Strohmier, now back to UNFILTERED with Dan Bongino. For all of your headlines, log on to FOXNews.com.</p><p>BONGINO: Welcome back.</p><p>You know 20 years ago, late night comedy was actually funny. \"SNL\" had it right with some bits like this.</p><p>(BEGIN \"SNL\" VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'll be honest fellas, it sounded great, but I could have used a little more cowbell.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BONGINO: So what happened? Now while we get is pandemic propaganda.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FALLON: There was Alpha then, Delta, then Omicron Next, but this latest variant might be the best. It is XBB.1.1.5 Another brand of COVID-19 has arrived. It's a new strain, but it isn't the same. Put on your mask when you're inside a facility. It could be a robot from a \"Star Wars\" trilogy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BONGINO: Here to break down the sad demise of true comedy, comedian Jamie Lissow.</p><p>Jamie, thanks for your time. So that's really cringe, obviously. Really, I needed a bucket to throw up in after watching it. But it's weird with comedy now, Jamie, because everybody has got an agenda and it is hard to laugh when you know it's a political attack and it's not really an effort to be funny.</p><p>JAMIE LISSOW, COMEDIAN: Yes, exactly. And in Fallon's defense, if you look really closely, you can see the puppet strings, you know what I mean? Well, that's not really his fault.</p><p>And I will tell you something, I do think -- I hear good things about him. I hear he's like a nice guy and everything. And I know people have to do it again for their families.</p><p>I saw a wider view of this segment. And you know how the guy normally holds cue cards, he was just holding Jimmy's paycheck.</p><p>BONGINO: In a veiled threat, I am sure. But think about it, remember shows like \"The Office,\" which wasn't even that long ago, you know, \"Blazing Saddles,\" \"Breaking Bad.\" Jamie, these shows could never be made today.</p><p>Every single person, if they were made today would be canceled and never be seen in polite company again.</p><p>LISSOW: Yes. No, you're exactly right. And how lucky are we, by the way, because if you look at it on the major networks, you can't do anything anymore. So, I think we're very lucky first of all, to have streaming services. I'm going to throw podcasts in there. I mean, at least we have podcasts, some places where we can still, like, say some stuff.</p><p>But I think the audience is finally being heard and getting sick of the woke, right? Like, did you see like that movie \"Bros\"? You know, like, I think eventually, they're going to realize that they have to, you know, be funny and do what the audience wants. You can't just do what seems politically correct.</p><p>By the way, that \"Bros\" movie. I don't know if you saw on Rotten Tomatoes, it got like two tomatoes rubbing against two other tomatoes. It just wasn't great --</p><p>BONGINO: No, I didn't see the movie.</p><p>LISSOW: Yes, it was not very good, but understand, they got from --</p><p>BONGINO: See, this is not a PC segment, which is funny, Jamie because that's what comedy used to be, like, comedy was the safe zone where guys like me who love comedy go to hear guys like you. And we get out of the perimeter fence of safety and it's funny.</p><p>But if comedy is going to be PC, isn't a kind of dead like, where there is nothing really funny about you giving us like some kind of stupid woke agenda and never be able to get that on safe zone?</p><p>LISSOW: Yes, I couldn't agree more. And like comedy is hard enough, let alone when you give someone ridiculous parameters. Like you're saying, we would have never gotten these beautiful shows like \"The Office.\" Like this is what, I don't know about you, but that's what got me through the pandemic was comedies and a lot of older ones that you could never do now.</p><p>Like, during the pandemic, by the way I was home, you know, we were home for that 14-day curve thing that lasted for three years. I actually got to the end of Netflix, just the end.</p><p>BONGINO: There was nothing left.</p><p>LISSOW: I knew there was a problem. I was just on my coach.</p><p>BONGINO: Did it log you out automatically? Like you're done here. You've accomplished everything you need.</p><p>LISSOW: Here's how you know at the end of Netflix when you're watching season two of just that fireplace.</p><p>BONGINO: The Yuletide Log. I remember that.</p><p>LISSOW: The Yule Log thing.</p><p>BONGINO: No, no. No, Jamie you and I rolled there. Remember when TV used to go off at night and the National Anthem used to play? That's what happens. The Yuletide Log followed by a waving American flag and that is it, a big \"See you later.\"</p><p>Jamie, I've got to run. Very funny guy. Appreciate you taking the time.</p><p>Catch him on \"Gutfeld,\" folks, weeknights at 11:00 PM. Thanks for your time, Jamie.</p><p>LISSOW: Nice to talk to you.</p><p>BONGINO: You got it. You too.</p><p>Coming up on UNFILTERED, what happens when conservatives play the left's own games? Liberals lose their marbles about it.</p><p>One of Governor DeSantis' picks to shake up a woke Florida college responds to the media's deranged attacks against him, and he gets into the bias in these chatbots, too. Don't miss it, coming up next.</p><p>BONGINO: Welcome back to UNFILTERED.</p><p>Listen, it is no secret that the left is weaponizing the education system for decades. They push their radical junk at all costs, and they indoctrinate our kids basically screwing over the next generation.</p><p>So now that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is putting a group of anti-CRT conservatives on the Board of a woke Florida college, liberals are losing their marbles all of a sudden, calling it -- get a load of this -- a coup. The thought police, a hostile takeover. Little dramatic, no?</p><p>Joining me now is one of those members of the coup with the dreaded air quotes, fellow at the Manhattan Institute, our friend, Christopher Rufo.</p><p>Chris, congratulations on being a member of a coup. I didn't know you were so inclined. But like I just mentioned you've been placed on The board and the left is losing their marbles because you're a big believer in things like radical ideas, Chris, like educational freedom and stuff. I want you to see the reaction of the left first and then respond. Check this out.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MEHDI HASAN, MSNBC HOST; Let's call this what this is, an attack on democracy and on academic freedom. And to do it, they are willing to destroy higher education.</p><p>WMNF NEWS: We don't have anybody saying, you know, Rufo could make some good changes in the school, because he has made it clear that he doesn't understand higher education.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BONGINO: Your thoughts, Chris, on that?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER RUFO, SENIOR FELLOW, MANHATTAN INSTITUTE: Well, their position is self-refuting. They say it is the end of democracy. But in fact, the position of trustee is in the Florida State Constitution. The people elected Ron DeSantis, Ron DeSantis appointed me, I actually reflect the democratic will of the people of Florida.</p><p>And here is the bottom line, the university does not exist to serve the existing small group of student radicals that want to protest and make a big deal on campus. The university exists to do two things: It is to discover and disseminate true knowledge; and it is also to reflect the values and the will of the voters in the State of Florida.</p><p>And so it's going to be a rumble and it's going to be a tussle, but after the end of this conflict, we're going to see a great university. We're going to restore it to American principles and we're going to see a kind of re-flowering or a reinvigoration of education led by the bold leadership of Ron DeSantis and enacted by those of us on this new Board.</p><p>BONGINO: Chris, I was going to ask you about that because the left doesn't seem to learn from their mistakes. You would think with the Youngkin election in Virginia and the absolute route by Ron DeSantis in Florida that they would see kind of a clue like, hey, maybe pushing kids to be racist and judge each other by their skin color and getting into LGBTQIA+ activism in school like kindergarten isn't a good idea. But they don't seem to learn. They're doubling down. You just saw that video.</p><p>RUFO: Yes, and I'll tell you what. One of my first priorities that I'm going to bring to the board on the first meeting is to abolish the diversity, equity, and inclusion programs at New College of Florida, because what they do is they say something very simple: We should treat children and students and adults differently on the basis of their skin color, and I'm going to be proposing a new Department of Equality, Merit, and Colorblindness.</p><p>We're going to protect your individual rights. We're going to treat you equally under the law, and we're not going to play favorites either way on the basis of race or gender. And so this is going to drive them insane, we're going to see a massive reaction from the left.</p><p>But when the public hears what we're doing, they're saying, wait a minute, we love colorblind equality, that is the heart of America, we're going to see a 70/30 support in our favor. That's the DeSantis way. We're really following his playbook and we're just trying to do what we do to support and reinvigorate those beautiful American principles.</p><p>BONGINO: Chris, just your quick thoughts on this, another topic here, wokeness has infected AI -- Artificial Intelligence -- you see this chatbot story? This chatbot, apparently, if you ask it a question promoting a woke narrative, like hey, are drag queen story hours a good thing? Write a story, you know, write a beautiful story about it. But then if you ask him if drag queen story hour is a bad thing, it'll come back and tell you, you know, warning we're not going to write a story.</p><p>This is AI. Here are some examples on the screen. This is kind of like pre- censorship almost, isn't it?</p><p>RUFO: Yes, that's exactly what it is. This is pre censorship, what they want to do is they want to create strict boundaries of what is an acceptable thought and a non-acceptable thought and they are going to use artificial intelligence there. They are going to use social media algorithms to vigorously suppress kind of what they think of as bad ideas, which in truth are conservative ideas, and mostly true ideas, frankly.</p><p>And so, we have to be very careful with this. We're moving into an era of technological domination over discourse. We need to see the algorithms. We need to have some public oversight and accountability. Because, look, the essence of this country is freedom of speech, freedom of thought, and we should reject it, whether it comes from the government or whether it comes from these large corporations. This is a great example.</p><p>And we have to keep using the means of persuasion that we have like your show to tell the American people the truth and try to smash these kind of restrictive algorithms before they achieve dominance.</p><p>BONGINO: That's right. Chris, thanks a lot for your time. Congrats on the appointment. Well deserved. We appreciate it.</p><p>RUFO: Thank you.</p><p>BONGINO: You got it.</p><p>Next on UNFILTERED, Hot Takes you don't want to miss. Proof of how bad Gen Z's patriotism problem really is. And big surprise, an Ivy League university wants to tear down history. Haven't we heard this story before? It's Pete Hegseth's alma mater. His Hot Take is minutes away.</p><p>BONGINO: Welcome back to UNFILTERED.</p><p>It's time for Hot Takes. Some outrageous stories you may have missed this week, but we've got to tell you about anyway.</p><p>Joining me now is \"FOX and Friends\" Weekend cohost, Pete Hegseth. Pete --</p><p>PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, \"FOX AND FRIENDS\" WEEKEND: What's up, Dan?</p><p>BONGINO: Tearing down history, nothing much, buddy.</p><p>This story is right up your alley. Princeton University, you know a little bit about that place. They're demanding the Ivy League school remove a statue honoring Princeton's former President. Pete, with no past, we've got no future, buddy. The left, they really hate statues.</p><p>HEGSETH: Oh, they sure do. By the way, I have inside info that this may be a done deal. They may cave to the students on this by the way.</p><p>I was an undergraduate when they put the statute up in 2001, because there is no Princeton without John Witherspoon. There is no country without John Witherspoon. He was the only clergy to sign the Declaration of Independence. He was the teacher of James Madison, who was mentee of his. Yes, he owned two slaves, unlike every other rich White guy in that time and that was wrong.</p><p>But he was also adamantly anti-slavery. He fought to try to end slavery in the future and released his own slaves at the age of 28. So this is again, pure presentism. You can't acknowledge any of the goodness of this lover of liberty, who basically was part of fomenting the revolution back when it began. Got to rip it down. Got to erase history. It's not enough to understand it, got to get rid of it.</p><p>BONGINO: Yes, context doesn't matter to the left. It's black and white. There is no gray. I mean, it's really gotten really sad.</p><p>Pete, speaking of that, the phrase \"Do you speak English\" is reportedly being labeled a micro aggression and bias training at a Texas hospital. I guess the ask to the question has to be, Pete, do you speak woke? I mean, this is really like we've reached a new level of stupid with this.</p><p>HEGSETH: What you -- yes, so you want to communicate with someone. So you attempt to identify the language in which they speak, so that you can help them with medical issues, otherwise, it won't work? Of course, the explanation of this is full of diversity, equity, and inclusion, and then they say if you commit the sin of asking, \"Do you speak English\" in America, one of the six steps is to repent. You must repent for your sins, and then ask and grovel for forgiveness. It's right there in the slide, right there in the PowerPoint presentation.</p><p>BONGINO: It is. Unfortunately, he is not making that up. I'm not proud this is a story that's going to really irk you, a man who served this country honorably.</p><p>A recent survey, Pete, finds only 16 percent of Gen Z are proud to be an American.</p><p>Now, I wanted this in the show because you wrote an entire book about the destruction of our education system. We're reaping what's been sown now, aren't we?</p><p>HEGSETH: It is a staggering number. You can't keep a country when you're teaching young people the country they're supposed to defend or love is evil. And so you get -- I mean, it was 75 percent for boomers. It made its way cascading through generation to now 16 percent? Is this t he Alamo of people that recognize that that flag right there is actually a beacon of goodness in this world?</p><p>We reap what we sow as you said, and we teach kids to hate it and we wonder why they want to give it away. It is scary.</p><p>BONGINO: Yes, and if you read Pete's book, you'll see exactly how we got here. Pete, this was a multigenerational --</p><p>HEGSETH: Not a mistake.</p><p>BONGINO: Multidecade process, it did not happen overnight.</p><p>Pete, thanks a lot. We always appreciate you coming on giving us your Hot Takes. Thank you.</p><p>HEGSETH: You got it.</p><p>BONGINO: Next how to train your brain, you know, like exercise and stuff, folks. But I love life facts about the brain, too. Do not miss this next segment.</p><p>BONGINO: Welcome back to UNFILTERED.</p><p>Folks, you know I love life hacks, that's my thing. You've got to train your muscles, you've got to exercise, but you've got to train your brain, too. We have to exercise it and keep it strong, stay sharp and disciplined. You know, like a workout routine.</p><p>There are some simple daily practices we can do to strengthen our mind, improve our memory, mood, energy, and relationship. It sounds like a good deal, right?</p><p>Joining me now is the author of the brand new book I love, \"Change Your Brain Every Day.\" I got a copy right here on my desk, friend of the show and psychiatrist, Dr. Daniel Amen.</p><p>Doc, thanks for joining the show. Again, I'm obsessed with your book. I've got a copy right here on my desk. I told my team, get him on ASAP. So you have these life hacks you can do day by day, it's written so well. And I love these three, they jumped out to me first. The Day 14, you know, do one simple thing at a time each day. Explain what you mean?</p><p>DR. DANIEL AMEN, PSYCHIATRIST: Well, when you look at brain health, some people think, oh, my goodness, there are so many things for me to do. So Nancy from Oxford, England picked up one of my books, and she is like, okay, too much. So she just did one simple thing at a time, started drinking more water, felt better; took her vitamins, felt better; ate better, started new learning.</p><p>And at the end of the year, she lost 70 pounds along with her depression, her apathy and her pain. So, you just have to start one simple thing and the thing to start with, just ask yourself this question, is this good for my brain? Or bad for it? And if you can answer that with information and love, you're going to start feeling better fast.</p><p>BONGINO: Great tip. Here's another one, Day 181: Six lessons from the scan of murderers. What can we take away from that?</p><p>AMEN: So at Amen Clinics, I built the world's largest database of brain scans related to behavior. We do a study called Brain SPECT imaging. And we've done 225,000 scans on people from 155 countries. But early on, I started to scan people who did bad things and we have a database of over a hundred murderers. And what we learned is almost all of them have troubled brains.</p><p>And it's not one thing, they are impulsive murderers, compulsive murderers, who actually saw different patterns of violence in the brain. We saw that traumatic brain injury is a major cause of murder that very few people think about. We saw that the mental health system is failing these people, because many of them when they commit their crime, if you think of the school shooters were already on medication, seeing somebody, but nobody was looking at their brain.</p><p>And what we really came to realize is that many of these brains can be rehabilitated, but the prison system doesn't look at or rehabilitate the brain. So once people get out, they're more likely to go back. But that's the conservative thing to do. Fix their brain, because then they keep their job, and they pay taxes.</p><p>BONGINO: Fascinating, Doc, last one, Day 209. I've got about a minute left here. How to make your child, the Republican, a Democrat, or anything you want. I mean, what about that?</p><p>AMEN: Children pick your values if you're bonded to them, if you are connected to them. If they don't have a relationship with you, they pick the opposite value. So my dad was gone all the time when I was little, and we didn't have a relationship. In 1972, he told me if I voted for McGovern, the country would go to hell. Well, I voted for McGovern, and the country went to hell, but it had nothing to do with McGovern.</p><p>So if you want your children to pick your values, you've got to spend time with them. You've got to listen to them. You have to work a relationship with them.</p><p>BONGINO: Doc, the book is amazing. \"Change Your Brain Every Day.\" I got a copy right here. I've been reading it bit by bit. Taking your advice by the way to do one simple thing at a time each day reading a page of the book. Congrats on the book. Thanks for coming on. We appreciate it.</p><p>AMEN: Thanks, Dan.</p><p>BONGINO: Before we go, don't forget to watch \"The Dan Bongino Show\" daily on FOX Nation. Here's a clip.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BONGINO: So your principal is fabricating pieces of a resume in your autobiography a grounds to resign? You realize your President is Joe Biden, right? But buddy, Corn Pop was a bad dude and he went to strike my legs and took out the razor with the chain when he got the legs and he tried to shoot a double leg takedown on me and a sprawl and I hit Corn Pop with the bike chain while the kids rubbing my legs and my legs are White in the pool. And I was in the pool and I was a lifeguard with the zinc on my nose. And Corn Pop came up and I got the switchblade and it was like \"West Side Story.\"</p><p>You believe this guy?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BONGINO: You can stream the show weekdays from 12:00 to 3:00 PM Eastern.</p><p>That does it for us tonight on UNFILTERED. We'll see you back here next Saturday night at 9:00 PM.

Detroit public schools will probably require them unless everyone in a room is vaccinated. In Pittsburgh, masks will likely be required regardless of vaccination status. In some states, schools cannot mandate face coverings under any circumstances.</p><p>With COVID-19 cases soaring nationwide, school districts across the U.S. are yet again confronting the realities of a polarized country and the lingering pandemic as they navigate mask requirements, vaccine rules and social distancing requirements for the fast-approaching new school year.</p><p>The spread of the delta variant and the deep political divisions over the outbreak have complicated decisions in districts from coast to coast. In some conservative states, lawmakers banned districts from requiring masks despite outcry from medical professionals. Schools are weighing a variety of plans to manage junior high and middle school classrooms filled with both vaccinated and unvaccinated students.</p><p>\"I'm so frustrated that it's become a political issue because it shouldn't be. It's science,\" said Mary Tuttle, who operates an Indianapolis in-home day care center and hopes the city's schools require masks for her daughters.</p><p>She worries that the delta variant could lead to a return to virtual learning, which caused her 10-year-old daughter to become depressed and anxious last year. Another daughter will turn 12 six days after starting 6th grade and will be vaccinated as soon as possible.</p><p>Adding to the concerns is a rise in cases overall - sharply in some states, including Arkansas, which won't let schools require masks. Public health researchers on Tuesday called Arkansas' rapidly climbing infections and hospitalizations a \"raging forest fire,\" and the state's top health official warned of significant future outbreaks in schools.</p><p>Arkansas leads the country in new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers, and it has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, with only 35% of the population fully vaccinated.</p><p>In Mississippi, the leading health official said Tuesday that intensive care units are full in 13 hospitals because of a surge in cases, and he provided an ominous warning in one of the least vaccinated states in the country: \"Y'all, we're going to have a rough few weeks,\" Dr. Thomas Dobbs said.</p><p>Weekly tallies by the American Academy of Pediatrics based on state reports show that COVID-19 cases in kids increased nationally in July after a couple of months of declines. The most recent data shows a 1% increase from July 1 to July 15, representing 43,000 additional cases.</p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics on Monday recommended universal masking in schools, even for those who are vaccinated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this month recommended mask-wearing indoors for students and staff who are not fully vaccinated.</p><p>The vaccine is not yet approved for children under 12. If it is shown to be safe and effective for younger ages, vaccine manufacturers could seek emergency authorization this fall or winter.</p><p>American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten said the fact that some states refuse to allow mask requirements \"is just plain wrong.\" She said the organization has embraced recommendations from the CDC.</p><p>But school officials say masking decisions have been complicated by conflicting advice from public health officials. School districts that can set their own policies are taking different approaches.</p><p>In Detroit public schools, everyone will likely be required to wear a mask unless an entire room is vaccinated. Officials are developing an identification system, perhaps by wearing lanyards, Superintendent Nikolai Vitti said.</p><p>In Pittsburgh, administrators are proposing that all public school students and staff be required to wear masks indoors to protect younger students and because of \"concerns around unknowns from the variant,\" spokeswoman Ebony R. Pugh said. Universal masking also protects the privacy of older students who have not been vaccinated, she said.</p><p>In Kansas, most schoolchildren and teachers will not be required to wear masks. The state's largest district, Wichita, made masks optional starting July 6 and surveyed parents before announcing its reopening plan, said Wichita Public Schools spokeswoman Susan Arensman.</p><p>\"A lot of them, their big talking points were about the emotional well-being of students and staff,\" Arensman said. \"They still wanted kids to be safe, but they also wanted kids to be back to normal.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p> A student plays the flute while wearing a protective face mask March 2 during a music class at the Sinaloa Middle School in Novato, Calif.

Most commonly known as drones, they have been used since the 1900s, initially by the US military for target practice.</p><p>Military applications still dominate the global UAV market, but the achievements of UAVs in military operations have boosted demand for drones in North America, Middle East and the Asia-Pacific. UAVs are becoming a key element in the intelligence and surveillance operations of military and fast expanding in other combative areas as well.</p><p>The fast development of the UAV global market is having a big impact on a range of mainstream industries. Apart from defense, applications also include environmental management, crisis management, agriculture, policing and crowd monitoring, civil engineering, fisheries protection, disaster management, telecommunications maintenance, oil and gas exploration, mineral exploration, mine safety, geophysical surveys and mapping.</p><p>The UAV market has traditionally been narrowly focused but it is rapidly diversifying. Given the pace at which technology and the effectiveness of aircraft are improving, and as sensor and automation technologies mature, commercial applications will rapidly grow over the next ten years.</p><p>1.2 Market Scope</p><p>The UAV sector is set to be the sector with the most dynamic growth in the aerospace industry globally in this decade. According to the Teal Group, global spending on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) programs is expected to more than triple over the next decade in military, commercial, and consumer markets.</p><p>In light of solid growth rates, the Teal Group forecasts global spending is expected to touch $20.3 billion by 2025. The civil UAS market is expected to grow faster than the military market over the next decade. The worldwide military UAS spending over the next decade is estimated to be US$216.5 billion. Of which, procurement spending will amount to US$162.2 billion and research spending will amount to US$72.5 billion. The US is expected to account for about 81% of the total military R&amp;D spending and about 48% of military procurement through to 2030.</p><p>The high level of military R&amp;D spending is forecast to be due to the bigger and higher-value systems procured by the US. The military UAS market growth will be led by unmanned combat aerial vehicles and high-altitude long endurance UAVs. The largest market segment over the next decade will be High Altitude Long Endurance UAVs, which will account for a third of the period's sales.</p><p>The civil UAS will be the most attractive market this decade as commercial applications take off and governments adopt UAVs for new roles in border security and public safety. The worldwide civil UAS market is expected to reach US$19.8 billion by 2031, from US$7.2 billion in 2022, according to the Teal Group. Over the coming decade, the civil market will grow at a CAGR of 9.1% and will generate US$139 billion in revenues. Civil UAS promises to be the most dynamic growth sector with commercial segment expected to lead the growth.</p><p>The worldwide commercial UAS market is projected to reach $9.5 billion by 2028. Delivery is likely to emerge as the leading sector for commercial UAS market in the US by 2030. Teal Group predicts that Teal growth opportunities will be in middle-mile (e.g., factory to warehouse) transportation, rather than in the last-mile deliveries. This is primarily due to complexities involved in regulating the last-mile deliveries, while the regulatory framework for middle-mile transportation is already in place. Globally, Agriculture will be the largest sector by 2030 led by more affordable UAS and heavy Chinese investments. This is also supported by UN projections which suggests world's population to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, causing significant growth in agricultural consumption. Another key sector that will drive growth of the commercial UAS market is Industrial Inspection. Construction will be the largest portion of the Industrial Inspection market. All ten of the largest worldwide construction firms are deploying or experimenting with UAS fleets.</p><p>China has a clear leadership in the consumer UAS manufacturing and is now seeking to expand its capabilities to commercial UAS manufacturing. The aggressive growth of the UAV industry in China is attributable to the policy and regulatory support as well as significant investments from the Chinese government.</p><p>Currently, Sichuan, Hunan, Hainan and Jiangxi provinces in China are pushing forward the reform of low-altitude airspace management, giving support to the commercialization of drone application. China's civil drone market is estimated at $6.6 billion in 2022, according to Shenzhen-based research firm AskCI Consulting. The industrial drone market is also witnessing rapid growth. According to data from Shenzhen-based Qianzhan Industry Research Institute, the industrial drone sales is projected to increase from 27.3 billion yuan in 2020 to 265.8 billion yuan in 2026. Shenzhen has more than 1,500 drone companies with civilian UAV business licenses.</p><p>Data from the Civil Aviation Administration of China showed that by the end of 2021, there are 781,000 registered drone users, and the number of registered drones totaled 832,000 in China. The Civil Aviation Administration of China released a plan that outlined several targets for the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) business in China by the years 2025, 2030, and 2035. These goals included the enhancement of rules and the expansion of airspace capacity for civilian UAVs.</p><p>Europe has fallen behind in the civil UAS market. It is now trying to catch up by enacting standardized airspace rules that will create a single market. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has established rules for small UAS across the European Union.</p><p>The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has become the first air transport safety regulator in the world to offer technical design guidance to urban planners and eVTOL manufacturers looking to build drone taxi vertiports across Europe. Europe also adopted 'European Drone Strategy 2.0' late last year aimed for the further development of the European drone market. Further, the implementation of the 'U-space' in January 2023, a European system to manage drone traffic safely, will lay the ground for increased operations. According to European Commission, the drone services market in Europe could be worth \u20ac14.5 billion, and create 145,000 jobs, by 2030.</p><p>The increase in defense spending by various countries to strengthen their defense forces is leading to growth in the number of military UAV systems. These UAV systems are being used for applications such as surveying, mapping, transportation, combat operations and monitoring. The US and European governments have already begun new programs using UAVs for protecting land and sea borders. Many other international agencies including the UN and other peacekeeping agencies are also deploying unmanned aerial protection systems.</p><p>According to the US Presidential budget for fiscal 2024, the US Department of Defense aims to hasten the deployment of advanced combat drones as part of a broader push to modernize the force and pursue cutting-edge technology. The budget includes $547.8 million for modifying five US Air Force MQ-9 Reapers to meet the US Marine Corps' interim requirement for a Group 5 UAS. The United States is not the only nation that is increasing defense spending on unmanned aerial vehicles. Earlier this year, Germany approved major uptick in defense spending on armed drones. German military will purchase ammunitions worth EUR152 million to arm German drones. This will be the first deployment of weaponized UAVs in German military.</p><p>Ukraine has announced plans to double down on its deployment of drones in its efforts to counter Russian forces, pledging nearly $540 million of spending in 2023 for the production and procurement of UAVs.</p><p>Japan has announced a record $40.7 billion defense budget for fiscal 2023, which will include significant spending on armed drones. It intends to raise defense spending to 2 percent of GDP by 2027. The Japanese defense ministry aims to introduce unmanned vehicles that can be used directly in combat, rather than just for surveillance and intelligence gathering.</p><p>According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), military expenditures are on the rise around the globe. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has led to increase in defense funding especially for drones. Over the next decade, growth in military market will increasingly shift towards international markets as more militaries incorporate UAVs into their forces.</p><p>Major drone providers from China and Israel have increased the manufacture and export of defense drones for foreign militaries. Many counties from Saudi Arabia to Myanmar and Iraq to Ethiopia, are stockpiling Chinese combat drones and deploying them on the battlefield.</p><p>The introduction of specially built unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) also promises to drive growth over the next decade. The emergence of the commercial UAS market, growing demand from governments to better patrol borders, and continued consumer drone growth all promise to drive more than a quadrupling of the non-military market over the next decade.</p><p>With increasing UAV installations across the globe, there is rising need to defend against such systems as well. In May 2022, South Korea approved a project to install uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) defense systems at 45 bases across the nation to neutralize hostile drones. South Korean government will spend NT$4.3 billion (US$144.45 million) to purchase the UAV defense systems.</p><p>Market Share</p><p>The world UAV sector is highly concentrated with a small number of companies holding most of the market share compared to other industries. Our estimates show there are more than 500 companies globally, with more than 200 commercial UAV companies, while the other 300 develop UAV for the military industry. AeroVironment, BAE Systems, Elbit Systems, Finmeccanica, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Navmar Applied Sciences, Northrop Grumman, Safran, Textron, Thales, Boeing, Tital Aerospace, TAI, AIA and Aviation Industry Corporation of China are among the biggest players in the UAV market.</p><p>A number of start-ups have made their mark on the market in recent years, however, and are challenging the dominance of the incumbent players. Technology companies like Intel, Qualcomm, Microsoft, Apple as well as venture capitalists have poured more millions of dollars into startup investments.</p><p>Impact of COVID-19 on the UAV Sector</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every industry, although not in an equal way. Some industries have felt the impact very differently to others. The effect on the UAV market especially commercial drones have been on the positive side. According to Drone Industry Insights, drone companies are on a path towards steady growth over the next many years. Global drone market size is forecast to reach US$55.8 billion by 2030, from US$30.6 billion in 2022, implying a CAGR of 7.8%. The services sector will remain the biggest segment, while hardware segment will be the fastest growing.</p><p>As the global economies were forced to shut down and implement strict shelter-in-place restrictions, the demand for unmanned aerial systems became higher. Further, the use of drones for transporting medical supplies proved a boon for the sector. Cargo, courier and warehousing are the sectors with the fastest adoption of drones. Many drone companies including Wingcopter, Zipline and Wing have been able to deliver and scale their solutions quicker than previously expected.</p><p>England's National Health Service (NHS) is among those trailing the vehicles to deliver fragile medicines to cancer patients living on the Isle of Wight. Chemotherapy drugs can have short shelf lives and thus quick delivery by drones is a boon for patients.</p><p>Walmart said that it completed 6,000 drone deliveries in 2022 from 36 US stores in seven states. These deliveries were done from drone delivery hubs operated by DroneUp, Flytrex and Zipline. Walmart has 4,700 stores located within 90% of the US population making it uniquely positioned to offer drone delivery at scale.</p><p>In June 2022, Zipline launched drone medical deliveries in Nigeria. Zipline will initially deliver over 200 different medical products, including medicines and vaccines, with plans to expand in the near future. This will enable Nigeria to create a strong and smart health system. In May 2022, Wingcopter announced a partnership with Continental Drones to develop a massive delivery network spanning 49 countries across Sub-Saharan Africa. The deal aims to deploy 12,000 of Wingcopter's 198 drone systems over the course of the next 5 years. In February 2022, Zipline announced launching operations in another African Nation with on-demand drone deliveries of medical supplies in Kenya. The company is already operating in Ghana, Nigeria, and Ivory Coast.</p><p>US-based Walgreens in partnership with Alphabet's Wing is targeting the drone delivery market. In April 2022, Walgreens announced that it will begin flying packages by drone to residents of Texas cities in partnership with Google's drone subsidiary, Wing.</p><p>US-based Matternet is another player targeting the medical delivery market. In September 2021, it launched the world's first city-wide drone delivery network for the rapid transport of medical goods in Abu Dhabi. The company will use drones to transport urgent, high-value goods such as COVID-19 vaccines, blood, and lab samples across the Abu Dhabi's health system.</p><p>LEK Consulting notes that drones could account for a large portion of package delivery market by 2040. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a rapid and more expansive testing of drone delivery systems. The technology has been able to accelerate its growth and development over the past 12 months or so.</p><p>To further assist the sector, the UK government announced new funding program for drone companies developing methods to deliver COVID-19 tests and personal protective equipment (PPE) to hospitals and rural communities. The government has announced ~\u00a37 million funding package for the sector.</p><p>According to research published in journal Patterns, drone deliveries could help reduce greenhouse emissions significantly. The paper states that greenhouse-gas emissions per parcel were 84% lower for drones than for diesel trucks. Companies such as Amazon have been testing the use of drones to deliver packages with an eye to reducing their environmental impact.</p><p>1.3 Market Trends</p><p>Start-ups Threaten Larger Incumbents</p><p>Over the past 20 years, the UAV sector has expanded and opened up to a whole new level of competition and innovation that had not been seen in the market. While large incumbents, especially the Big Three - Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman - have won a big slice of the available UAV deals, new and smaller entrants are increasingly winning against the big companies for UAV contracts, thus challenging their respective market positions.</p><p>A number of smaller start-up companies have burst onto the scene in recent years, threatening the market positions of the larger incumbents. Non-defense companies eager to diversify and get a slice of the fast-growing market have funded some start-ups.</p><p>The funding from Drone startups have started on a strong footing in 2023 after a robust 2022. In April 2023, San Francisco-based Zipline raised $330 million at about $4.2 billion, a 55% increase from its $2.7 billion valuation reached two years ago. The funding will help the company to carry out its expansion activities. In March 2023, French advanced air mobility (AAM) startup Ascendance Flight Technology says it is aggressively pushing to finalize the prototype of its ATEA hybrid vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) plane, and has raised new investment of \u20ac21 million ($22.6 million). In February 2023, US-based drone manufacturer, Skydio raised $230 million in Series E funding at a valuation of $2.2 billion. The funding will be used to setup a new manufacturing facility in America. In January 2023, Japan-based Terra Drone raised $14 million from oil giant Saudi Aramco. The company says it will utilize the funding to set up a new subsidiary for inspection services in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>In November 2022, India-based drone delivery platform Skye Air Mobility raised $1.7 million. Skye Air Mobility is currently operating in eight cities across India and plans to expand to 16 cities in the next 24 months. In October 2022, Australian drone logistics service provider Swoop Aero landed a new investment round for its first and last mile airborne delivery network, bringing its total backing to $26 million to date. Swoop Aero plans to use the funds to enter new markets, scale its integrated logistics networks, and expand its manufacturing capabilities.</p><p>Regulatory Uncertainties Overshadow the Segment</p><p>UAV vehicles have evolved swiftly in recent years, particularly since making the leap from military technology to consumer gadgetry. The technology they use could be useful for myriad business opportunities. For example, UAVs are being used in many sectors, like the agriculture, construction, energy, mining and entertainment, as well as geological surveys and, utility safety and maintenance, thanks to their ability to shoot aerial photos and video, as well as collect other data cheaply.</p><p>The growth of the UAV market, however, has drawn considerable attention from regulators and legislators eager to mitigate the complexities involved in the growth of the number of aeronautical vehicles in the skies. For instance, in the US there has been delays and confusion regarding the rules set by FAA. With the courts and Congress getting involved in regulation, clarity around the regulatory landscape is yet to emerge.</p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued new rules for the commercial drone industry. Under the new rules, the FAA will allow small drones to operate at night and over people and will require remote identification of the drones. The new rules went into effect on 21 April 2021. Remote ID will be required for all drones weighing 0.55 lb (0.25 kg) or more. Remote ID requires identification of drones in flight as well as the location of their control stations or takeoff point.</p><p>Further, in 2022, the FAA will require every new produced drone weighing over 0.55 pounds to broadcast its location. In 2023, it will be illegal to fly drone without this broadcasting capability.</p><p>For fiscal FY 2022, FAA is requesting a total of over $100 million in funding for unmanned aircraft system (UAS) research, development, and integration. This includes $31.3 million for UAS implementation which incorporates FAA Drone Zone. The FAA Drone Zone is a cloud-based information technology platform that includes a UAS registration system, Part 107 authorizations and optional waivers, and UAS accident reporting.</p><p>FAA budget request also includes $24 million for UAS concept validation and requirements development, UAS flight information management, and urban air mobility.</p><p>The FAA plans to launch field tests of unmanned aircraft traffic management capabilities. The Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management (UTM) field test, which is set to launch in the spring 2022 and continue into 2023, is expected to lead to new policies and the development of updated industry standards for drones operating beyond visual line-of-sight (BVLOS).</p><p>The commercial potential of UAV continues to attract big investors and venture capital. For example, Amazon's is investing in its Amazon Prime Air program to create a delivery system utilizing UAVs.</p><p>Alphabet's drone-delivery subsidiary Wing launched a new mobile and web app, OpenSky, which is free to use and informs drone pilots about airspace restrictions, pre-plan flights, and get airspace approvals. Drone flyers can also use the app to check information on areas where they can and cannot fly.</p><p>This is just one of the many proposed uses for UAVs, however. Within the next ten years, it is expected that more than 32,000 drones will be flying for commercial operations worldwide. FAA projects that remote pilot certificates could grow almost 3x to 350,000 over the next five years.</p><p>For the US, the potential economic impact of UAVs, according to the Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, could reach approximately US$13.7 billion within the next three years and create more than 100,000 employment opportunities once the FAA drafts comprehensive drone regulations.</p><p>Despite some progress by FAA on establishing rules, it remains unclear. The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) delivered a report in January 2023 stating on the need for FAA to more clearly communicate a strategy to integrate drones into the airspace. GAO notes that the commercial drone use is likely to expand to 858,000 in 2026 from 622,000 in 2021.</p><p>The main conclusions of the report are that FAA needs to do better in both establishing and communicating a comprehensive strategy for broader UAV use, and in defining a uniform procedure for issuing waiver.</p><p>Wing's CEO Adam Woodwort in March 2023 reiterated the need to make drone regulations more pragmatic and predictable. He emphasized the need for drone regulations that support commercial operations. He noted that many of the current regulations make sense for passenger-carrying airplanes, but not for small aircraft with no people onboard.</p><p>The Buzz from Parcel-Toting Drones</p><p>In a few decades from now, we may look back and remember a time before flying robots delivered consumer orders. At least this might be the case if delivery drones turn out the way most retailers \u2014 as well as service providers - envision them. A delivery drone, or also known as a parcelcopter, is an UAV utilized to transport goods, packages, and foodstuffs, and recently, the delivery systems have been a hot future state plans among vendors.</p><p>By 2023, Statista projects global drone delivery market to touch $1.6 billion. Asia-Pacific will be the largest market accounting for nearly 39% of the total, followed by North America (31%) and Europe (22%).</p><p>McKinsey notes that as of early 2022, more than 2,000 drone deliveries are occurring each day worldwide. The growth rate is accelerating, and it projects that there will be close to 1.5 million deliveries in 2022 in total, up from just under half a million in 2021.</p><p>Drone Industry Insights noted that services such as cargo, courier, intralogistics and warehousing were the fastest-growing drone market in 2021 and are likely to continue to remain so till 2026 with a CAGR of 24.3%. This is due to the increased popularity and demand of drone deliveries for both internal (intralogistics and warehousing) as well as external services.</p><p>Drone deliveries can cut emissions and reduce congestion on roads. According to Virginia Tech University, drone delivery could save the average consumer up to 56 hours per year, reduce vehicle traffic by 294 million miles per year and displace up to 113,900 tons of CO2 per year.</p><p>China-based ecommerce platform Meituan announced that it has completed more than 100,000 drone deliveries by 2022, an increase of more than 400% year-on-year. The company expects greater number of drone deliveries going forward.</p><p>Alphabet's drone delivery service Wing is adding complex route management and self-loading capability for its drone delivery fleet that will make it capable of handling tens of millions of deliveries for millions of consumers by mid 2024.</p><p>Given the large opportunity in the drone delivery market, the space is witnessing new entrants. In 2023, Japan Post announced its plans to expand and accelerate its mail drone delivery services in the country. It is now undertaking trials in populated zones in the country.</p><p>Singapore's civil aviation authority and transport ministry has chosen a private consortium of 13 members to develop the drone program. Under this program, the aim is to use drones for tasks that include delivering parcels, inspecting buildings and providing security. The companies involved in the project have carried our various pilots. These include drone parcel delivery as well as using drones to transport blood samples and specimens between hospitals and central laboratory. Drones are being tested for delivering parts and other materials to factories as well.</p><p>China is not too far behind in this race. DHL in partnership with China-based drone company EHang has launched drone delivery service in China. JD.com and Alibaba have tested the drone delivery system as well.</p><p>Putting the parcelcopter concept into service will take some time because of the many setbacks. The major setback for this concept in the US is that there is no specific flight system where there needs to be a specific path for the drone to travel and deliver in a populated area - and this needs to be solved. Once resolved, the big benefit should be that these delivery-by-drone systems could be commonplace within the next decade. Open season on the open skies could arrive sooner than expected.</p><p>The Obsession with Armed Flying Robots</p><p>The use of a UAV as a weapon first became known in World War II. After the war, little development occurred in drone technology and most remotely piloted vehicles were used for target practice. The US military's first major spending on UAVs began after the Vietnam War, and over the past two decades, the country has become the world's pre-eminent user and supplier.</p><p>Military UAVs in the US have gone through meteoric growth over the past decade. Development has taken a quantum leap \u2014 from lab concept to battle-tested proven technology. Today, America's comparative advantage in UAVs, however, is being battered as technological know-how disseminates throughout the international system. While existing technology has started to lag, global competitors are playing catch up in research and development for drone technology.</p><p>As such, the Pentagon is expected to ramp up its investment in unmanned aerial vehicles in the coming years. The US Defense Department budget request for fiscal year 2023 mentions that unmanned weapons systems, such as drone ships, planes, and ground vehicles, will play an increasing role in future US military planning. The president's fiscal year 2023 defense budget requests new spending on unmanned/autonomous systems technology.</p><p>The Air Force request includes $187 million for enhancements to the MQ-9 Reaper combat drone and $111 million for work on the MQ-4C Triton high-altitude surveillance drone. The Navy and Marine Corps have also requested additional funding for UAVs. The Navy requested $1.2 billion for the MQ-25 Stingray drone, which is to be deployed on carriers and perform aerial refueling and surveillance functions.</p><p>No country has ramped up its UAV research in recent years faster than China, where every major company for the Chinese military has a research and development center and funding allocations dedicated to drones. In recent years, the country has pumped considerable amounts of funds and engineering brainpower into the technology, a field previously dominated by the US and Israel.</p><p>Much of the work done, however, remains secret, but the large number of drones created underlines not only the country's willpower to catch up in the sector by building comparable combat and surveillance models like the Predator and the Global Hawk but also the desire to trade the technologies globally. Its armed UAV CH-4, Wing Loong I and Wing Loong II have been rapidly gaining market share especially in developing countries such as Nigeria, Jordan, Algeria and Middle Eastern countries.</p><p>Israel, second after the US in drone technology, has flown armed UAV models but few details are available. India has also revealed its intention to develop drones that will fire missiles and fly at 30,000 feet, followed by Russia, which has revealed models of UAVs with weapons (although there is little evidence that they are currently operational).</p><p>The Lucrative UAV Micro Segment</p><p>The new generation of UAVs is being developed to improve monitoring of many kinds of systems. From tracking bush fires in Australia to observing traffic in the US, infrared cameras to track missing people at night, and laser spectroscopy used to monitor air pollutions, UAVs are using a lot of the new up-to-date miniature sensor technology.</p><p>All of this requires more focus on the integration of sensor systems in an airborne device that is severely constrained in power and weight. Changing the sensor architecture or even take the control sensors out entirely, allowing the size of the UAV to reduce dramatically. This has created a new class of ultra-small UAV sensors.</p><p>Lockheed Martin's Lockheed Sanders MicroSTAR series of prototypes is one of the many examples of a mini UAV. The battery-operated MicroSTAR designs resembled kid's toys. The device has winglets instead of the single vertical plane tail, and a nose mounted propeller. MicroSTAR featured a five-gram navigation system that could give directions by the ground station but could also automatically keep on a heading or orbit a target.</p><p>The US army has been using mini UAVs for mission in Afghanistan and other areas. These mini UAVs provide near-real time video that allows soldiers to better survey their surroundings and detect enemies in combat. FLIR System's Black Hornet is one such mini UAV which weighs less than two ounces, can be deployed in less than one minute and has a range of over a mile. It is intended to eliminate battlefield blind spots thereby saving lives.</p><p>French drone maker Parrot is also an established player in micro UAV space. It has been selected by Swiss army to develop and supply micro-drones as part of the Swiss Mini UAV Program.</p><p>Despite the advancements, the current micro UAV market remains constrained, largely due to regulatory frameworks on unmanned operations in airspace. But once regulatory restraints are loosened and clarified, the potential of this technology will be unlocked. Mini UAVs are set to become one of the major contributors to both the economy and technology. Market growth, however, still very much depends on the pace of UAV development in different countries, thanks to the wide range of applications and the added value related to these unmanned machines.</p><p>1.4 Applications</p><p>Defense</p><p>Defense will continue to the largest market for UAVs for the foreseeable future. UAVs can play an important role in counter terrorism and counter insurgency activities. They can be deployed in highly dangerous missions thereby saving personnel lives. The UAVs are also being used in difficult terrains for intelligence gathering and surveillance. They provide high resolution images and videos which can significantly help ground troops. Drones have been used by militaries of many countries to conduct strikes against terrorists.</p><p>Transport</p><p>UAVs are increasingly used in transport activities such as e-commerce parcel delivery, food delivery and medicine delivery. Of these, e-commerce delivery is getting the maximum attention with large companies such as Amazon already doing pilot tests.</p><p>Another promising area for UAVs is the delivery of food. It could be used in heavily populated urban areas for food delivery by restaurants and also could be used to deliver foods to difficult terrains including oil rigs and remote islands. Medical logistics is another area where UAVs can be used to transport medicines and can also be used as flying defibrillators.</p><p>Infrastructure</p><p>UAVs can assist in the management of various kinds of infrastructure, specifically construction sites. In the pre- construction phase, drones can survey the land and provide accurate field data and images. They are able to capture high-resolution videos and images, which can significantly improve the speed and quality of the design process. In the construction phase, drones can inspect the sites and provide accurate information regarding the progress of the construction.</p><p>The data received could be used by investors and property owners to monitor if the project is progressing as per original schedule or not. Abu Dhabi has launched the trial stage of implementing drones as aerial monitoring and inspection tools for the city's engineering projects and construction sites.</p><p>US state of Arizona is mulling the use drones to inspect roads, bridges and other infrastructure. The state has introduced Drone Infrastructure Inspection Grant Act, that would dispense about $200 million to purchase drones and the other half to train pilots to fly them.</p><p>The FAA's rollout of the Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC) has helped standardize and expand the use of drones in construction. LAANC automates the application and approval process for airspace authorizations and is currently available at near 500 airports across the country. LAANC is currently in beta and will be tested further before nationwide rollout.</p><p>An increasing number of construction firms and real estate developers in the Middle East are turning to drones amid the COVID-19 crisis. Drones are being used for progress monitoring and site mapping as companies try to speed up delivery of projects. In November 2020, New York's Department of Finance's property division said that it is looking into the use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems for tasks such as surveying tax lots, geographic information system (GIS) mapping and aerial photography.</p><p>Agriculture</p><p>One of the largest projected applications of UAVs in in agriculture. Drones can be used by farmers to monitor their crops. UAVs can survey a farmland faster and at a lower cost than airplanes/satellites and also provide better data and images to farmers. The current altitude restrictions for UAVs limit the area that it can survey, but if the altitude restrictions ease a little, the area could expand and provide greater benefits to farmers.</p><p>Japan has been using UAVs for crop dusting for more than 20 years now and drones account for more than 90% of crop dusters. In the US as well, the adoption of drones in agriculture is increasing due to exemption from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) under the part 107 rule.</p><p>China's largest agriculture drone maker XAG is trying to automate rice farming in China with the launch of its drone-based direct seeding system called JetSeed. It could replace manual seed planting and raise efficiency amid a labor shortage due to COVID-19.</p><p>In January 2023, the United Kingdom's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has given operational authorization to China-based XAG's agricultural spraying aircraft P40 and V40. This is the first time drone spraying and spreading has been legalized for use on UK farms.</p><p>Public Safety</p><p>This area again presents huge opportunities for UAVs. Drones can be used for law enforcement, search and rescue missions, firefighting and medical services. Civil governments are deploying an increasing number of unmanned systems.</p><p>The US and European governments have launched many new pilot programs to deploy UAV systems to protect borders. The United Nations and other peacekeepers are also deploying unmanned aerial systems to provide protection.</p><p>In the US, many agencies have acquired drones. Most of these agencies are police/sheriff departments followed by fire departments. In October 2022, the sheriff department of Las Vegas announced plans to deploy 400 drones as responders to rising gun violence. In Indiana and Maryland, police have successfully used drones to catch suspects and thieves. In Oakland, the fire department used drones to hot spots, which were not extinguished during a firefighting mission. The Los Angeles Fire Department has been using drones to make hot-spot identification and aerial mapping for wildfire response, as well as incident response for other search and rescue missions.</p><p>Further, drones can collect information, data and images on natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes and wildfires. UAVs have great potential for surveying storm damage and locating people after natural disasters. The US National Guard is using AI-powered drones to track wildfires in real time. The AI-backed drones can predict the area where fire is most likely to spread based on previous fires.</p><p>The US is using drones for border security as well. The drones support the border patrol team by providing enhanced intelligence, surveillance capabilities and reducing the risk to human operators on the ground.</p><p>Inspections</p><p>UAVs can be used for inspections in areas such as wind turbines, oil pipelines, power lines, railroads and more. Oil and gas companies can use a drone to conduct the required monthly inspection of their pipelines. Instead of hiring a helicopter, which is costly, companies can use drones to do the same at lower cost. Drone inspections can survey hundreds of miles of pipeline and pinpoint the location of the leaks, thereby reducing traditional surveilling costs by nearly 90%.</p><p>In November 2021, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines announced plans to use of drones for passenger aircraft inspection. The drones can inspect the aircraft for minor damage inflicted by events like hailstorms and lightning strikes.</p><p>Similarly, UAVs can inspect wind turbines, several hundred feet in the air, removing the need for an individual to physically reach the place. Netherlands-based wind energy company Vestas is using drones to conduct inspection of its 1,250 wind turbines. Archaeologists can use UAVs to inspect the sites and also patrol for looters. The city of London is using drones for surveys which are used for repairing and maintaining assets across the underground rail network.</p><p>1.5 Regulatory Environment</p><p>Drones are taking off in a big way. Once the preserve of the military, UAVs are now widely popular in the commercial sector, thanks to consumer-grade UAVs that become increasingly sophisticated and cheaper. Though regulatory obstacles could hinder growth prospects.</p><p>Currently, there are different sets of rules governing the uses of commercial UAVs around the world. In December 2020, the US FAA approved a new set of regulations governing commercial UAVs. The FAA will allow small drones to operate at night and over people and will require remote identification of the drones. This new regulation will bring a step closer to commercial drone use for agriculture, infrastructure repair, and eventually, even deliveries from companies such as Amazon.</p><p>Canada has had safety regulations in place that govern the use of UAVs. A recreational pilot operating a drone weighing less than 35kgs does not currently require either a license or a special flying permit. It, however, must follow a list of Transport Canada safety guidelines, such as staying nine kilometers from an airport, flying under 90 meters and always keeping the craft within eyesight.</p><p>Australia requires no registration of recreational drones. Recreational drone operators must comply with Civil Aviation and Safety Authority (CASA) rules that allow drones to be flown only within a visual line of sight. There are other restrictions on the maximum altitude, vicinity near airports and flying over crowded places.</p><p>The regulations allow commercial operators to fly drones weighing less than 2kg without a license. Operators must still adhere to all the existing rules for recreational drone use such as not to fly within 5.5km of an airport, above 400 feet or within 30m of buildings, railways or vehicles, and always to have line of sight of the drone.</p><p>Drones that weigh less than 20kgs in the UK can fly in normal airspace for private use as long as the operator is not planning to use data or images from the flight acquired by flying close to people or objects. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) requires all UAVs to remain 150 meters from crowded events or large assemblies, 50m from an individual or building, and stay within line of sight, which is 500m horizontally and 122m vertically. Drones that weigh more than 20kgs are currently banned from flying in civilian airspace.</p><p>The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has established new rules on drones. Under the rules, drone operators will have to be registered with their national authority and the drones will need to have a direct remote identification system in place. The regulatory framework will ensure the protection of citizens' privacy rights while addressing security issues as well.</p><p>China is moving rapidly to establish regulatory framework for drones. In October 2020, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) announced the first Unmanned Civil Aviation Experimental Zones (UCAEZs) to help accelerate the drone industry in China. The new experimental zones are designed to not only offer the airspace for testing innovative drone applications, but to ease the process of developing drone businesses.</p><p>1.6 Challenges and Opportunities</p><p>Opportunities</p><p>UAV industry presents tremendous opportunities for investors, companies as well as government. UAV technology has reached a maturity point that has placed it at the forefront of aerospace manufacturing. As UAV companies around the world make drones more accessible, the UAV sector despite the undeveloped regulatory framework, is set to develop into one of the most dynamic growth industries this decade. There are some 450 UAV companies worldwide behind this growing multibillion-dollar industry, with the number growing.</p><p>Both the military and commercial markets are set to grow rapidly in the next few years, as the US economy continues to recover, technology continues to diffuse around the world, as designs become more streamlined and efficient and as more industries adopt existing business processes for UAV use.</p><p>The non-military, especially the commercial drone segment, is set to grow the fastest with projections of mid to high teens growth over the next the next decade. The latest developments in computer vision, machine learning, cloud and data analytics are expected to push drone deployment in the mainstream commercial sector. In the US and many other places around the world, the regulations either remain too restrictive or are yet to be given a final shape, which has been a deterrent in the pace of UAV adoption.</p><p>With the explosion of interest in building and operating unmanned aircraft systems, the use of UAV technology is set to generate more high-tech jobs, with millions in tax revenues and tens of billions in economic impact.</p><p>UAV technology is moving ever faster forward as the market continues to flourish. Industry will need to consider how to best to integrate UAVs into their businesses.</p><p>Challenges</p><p>Safety, privacy and regulatory barriers remain key challenges for the rapid adoption of UAVs. The most urgent challenge for the governments is to ensure that the drone operations remain safe.</p><p>Privacy is another key concern that needs to be addressed. UAVs collect massive amounts of data including video and images, which sometimes could result in the invasion of personal privacy. A livestream or a recording of individuals or buildings can easily be captured without consent. Also, even if the data collected is with consent, the transmission of data itself remains vulnerable to hack. The growth and evolution of the UAV industry has outpaced the development of rules and systems to govern their use. This uncertainty weighs on innovation and commercial adoption, unless there is more clarity on the rules.</p><p>Illegal use of UAVs for criminal activities is another big challenge. For instance, drug cartels have used drones to transfer illegal drugs in the US. These vehicles tend to fly for short periods at very low altitudes. This makes it very difficult to detect using conventional sensor systems. Also, UASs or drones in particular could be a source of public nuisance. If a drone flying over a public place loses control and falls, it could cause substantial damage to the property as well as endanger lives.</p><p>In conclusion, the UAVs have raised a lot of concerns and it is up to policymakers to design and create laws that facilitate the good use of the technology while discouraging its harmful use.</p><p>2.

Detroit public schools will probably require them unless everyone in a room is vaccinated. In Pittsburgh, masks will likely be required regardless of vaccination status. In some states, schools cannot mandate face coverings under any circumstances.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With COVID-19 cases soaring nationwide, school districts across the U.S. are yet again confronting the realities of a polarized country and the lingering pandemic as they navigate mask requirements, vaccine rules and social distancing requirements for the fast-approaching new school year.</p><p>The spread of the delta variant and the deep political divisions over the outbreak have complicated decisions in districts from coast to coast. In some conservative states, lawmakers banned districts from requiring masks despite outcry from medical professionals. Schools are weighing a variety of plans to manage junior high and middle school classrooms filled with both vaccinated and unvaccinated students.</p><p>\"I'm so frustrated that it's become a political issue because it shouldn't be. It's science,\" said Mary Tuttle, who operates an Indianapolis in-home day care center and hopes the city's schools require masks for her daughters.</p><p>She worries that the delta variant could lead to a return to virtual learning, which caused her 10-year-old daughter to become depressed and anxious last year. Another daughter will turn 12 six days after starting 6th grade and will be vaccinated as soon as possible.</p><p>Adding to the concerns is a rise in cases overall - sharply in some states, including Arkansas, which won't let schools require masks. Public health researchers on Tuesday called Arkansas' rapidly climbing infections and hospitalizations a \"raging forest fire,\" and the state's top health official warned of significant future outbreaks in schools.</p><p>Arkansas leads the country in new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers, and it has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, with only 35% of the population fully vaccinated.</p><p>In Mississippi, the leading health official said Tuesday that intensive care units are full in 13 hospitals because of a surge in cases, and he provided an ominous warning in one of the least vaccinated states in the country: \"Y'all, we're going to have a rough few weeks,\" Dr. Thomas Dobbs said.</p><p>Weekly tallies by the American Academy of Pediatrics based on state reports show that COVID-19 cases in kids increased nationally in July after a couple of months of declines. The most recent data shows a 1% increase from July 1 to July 15, representing 43,000 additional cases.</p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics on Monday recommended universal masking in schools, even for those who are vaccinated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this month recommended mask-wearing indoors for students and staff who are not fully vaccinated.</p><p>The vaccine is not yet approved for children under 12. If it is shown to be safe and effective for younger ages, vaccine manufacturers could seek emergency authorization this fall or winter.</p><p>American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten said the fact that some states refuse to allow mask requirements \"is just plain wrong.\" She said the organization has embraced recommendations from the CDC.</p><p>But school officials say masking decisions have been complicated by conflicting advice from public health officials. School districts that can set their own policies are taking different approaches.</p><p>In Detroit public schools, everyone will likely be required to wear a mask unless an entire room is vaccinated. Officials are developing an identification system, perhaps by wearing lanyards, Superintendent Nikolai Vitti said.</p><p>In Pittsburgh, administrators are proposing that all public school students and staff be required to wear masks indoors to protect younger students and because of \"concerns around unknowns from the variant,\" spokeswoman Ebony R. Pugh said. Universal masking also protects the privacy of older students who have not been vaccinated, she said.</p><p>In Kansas, most schoolchildren and teachers will not be required to wear masks. The state's largest district, Wichita, made masks optional starting July 6 and surveyed parents before announcing its reopening plan, said Wichita Public Schools spokeswoman Susan Arensman.</p><p>\"A lot of them, their big talking points were about the emotional well-being of students and staff,\" Arensman said. \"They still wanted kids to be safe, but they also wanted kids to be back to normal.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Haven Daily, Associated Press A student plays the flute while wearing a face mask March 2 during a music class at Sinaloa Middle School in Novato, Calif.

The Need for a System of Statistics for Environmental-Economic Decisions</p><p>\"The nation behaves well if it treats the natural resources as assets which it must turn over to the next generation increased, and not impaired, in value; and behaves badly if it leaves the land poorer to those who come after it. That is all I mean by the phrase, Conservation of natural resources. Use them; but use them so that as far as possible our children will be richer, and not poorer, because we have lived.\"</p><p>- THEODORE ROOSEVELT, SPEECH TO THE COLORADO LIVESTOCK ASSOCIATION IN DENVER ON AUGUST 29, 1910</p><p>* * *</p><p>KEY TERMS</p><p>Natural assets or natural capital stocks are durable physical or biological elements of nature that persist through time and contribute to current or future economic production, human enjoyment, or other services people value.</p><p>Environmental-economic statistics are organized data that enable measurement of the quantity and value of natural assets, connecting their services to the economy and human wellbeing, and tracking changes in these values through time.</p><p>National economic accounts are statistics on U.S. production, consumption, investment, exports, imports, and savings.</p><p>Ecosystem services is the income, including in-kind and implicit income, attributable to natural capital stocks.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Nature connects to society in many ways, including through connections to the economy. Stocks of harvestable natural resources, such as fish, timber, water, and minerals, underpin the economy and are the first links in many supply chains. Nature supports economic security and progress beyond providing harvestable resources. For example, standing forests and wetlands purify water, regulate climate, and provide opportunities for outdoor recreation. Whether harvested or left in place, nature provides economic opportunities in the present and stores economic opportunities for the future. This is why economists refer to stocks of nature as natural capital or natural assets.</p><p>Americans understand that the economy is intertwined with our climate,5 ecosystems, and biodiversity.6 Nearly every economic sector uses services from,7 and has important dependencies on, natural assets. Many important crop species depend on animal pollination to some degree, and slowing pollinator declines would likely improve food production.8 The quality of the air that Americans breathe influences worker productivity.9 Families rely on natural assets, from green spaces to local ponds (often without entrance fees) for recreation and rejuvenation, and these assets contribute to measurable physical and mental health benefits and can capitalize into property values, reduce health care expenditures, and generally improve lives.10</p><p>Measuring natural assets and maintaining related environmental-economic statistical series-- repeated measurements over time that relate the environment to the economy--are critical planning tools for a robust economy and financial stability. Economic decision-makers, from Federal leaders to businesses, are looking for information that puts nature in the language of economics and business. Many central bankers and financial regulators understand that \"[b]iodiversity loss could have significant macroeconomic implications. Failure to account for, mitigate, and adapt to these implications is a source of risks relevant for financial stability.\"11 Many business leaders know that it is critical to understand how natural assets are changing to help manage business risks, so called \"de-risking.\" They are looking to the Federal Government to model leadership in accounting for natural capital on balance sheets.</p><p>The Federal Government can provide this leadership by including natural capital in the national economic accounts. The national economic accounts provide foundational economic accounting and balance sheet information. Currently, national economic accounts are disconnected from environmental data, and natural assets are omitted from the balance sheet. The existing national economic accounts data for the United States provide an incomplete view of the Nation's economic opportunities and economic dependencies on natural assets. The United States has not regularly reported official statistics on changes in the quantity, condition, or value of natural assets or aggregated them into measures that connect with the existing national economic accounts or complement common economic headline statistics such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP).</p><p>Nobel laureate economists have repeatedly noted that maintaining or increasing national wealth, inclusive of natural capital wealth, is an important element of sustainable development.12 Yet, information on the quantity and value of natural assets remains disconnected from the core statistical measurements of the economy that drive the economic conversation and ultimately drive long-term national and subnational planning. The adage \"what gets measured gets improved\" can only be true when the measurement is connected with the broader national economic accounting systems that policy and management respond to, such as the Nation's core economic statistics, the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA)13 used to compute GDP, or the national balance sheet used to make long-term growth forecasts.14</p><p>Contemporary economic policy and broader discourse often focuses on \"economic growth,\" a term and concept that hardly existed before the NIPA.15 If that accounting system ignores key assets and critical services, as it currently does, then talking about growth can be misleading. Growth in terms of marketable economic output at the expense of wealth, value, and future opportunity is not what most Americans understand meaningful and sustainable economic growth to be. A fuller accounting of natural capital in the national economic accounts will help provide public and private decision makers with this essential context for understanding GDP growth.</p><p>This kind of accounting is possible. World Bank data suggest that, between 2010 and 2018, the value that the United States held in forest and mangrove assets declined by 10%, and the value of ten mineral resource holdings declined by 51%.16 Analysis of groundwater in Kansas between 1996 and 2005 revealed a decline in water wealth of around $1 billion,17 while other analysis suggests that, nationwide, productivity from water across the United States rose 65% between 2000 and 2015.18 Evidence suggests that air quality improvements following the Clean Air Act have generated substantial increases in implicit income and that ignoring air quality improvements has led to an underestimate of national income growth on the order of 1.5 to 3% per year.19 Spending on outdoor recreation (not including outdoor recreation for which no fees are required) contributes approximately $374 billion to economic output.20</p><p>The Strategic Plan builds on existing research on natural capital accounting and charts a path to execute the Administration's commitment to realize natural capital accounts within an integrated system of environmental-economic statistics that are aligned with the national economic accounts and suitable for reliable use in decision making.</p><p>Recommendation 1: Develop U.S. natural capital accounts and environmental-economic statistics that provide pragmatic information to:</p><p>a) Guide sustainable development and macroeconomic decision making;</p><p>b) Support Federal decision making in programmatic, policy, and regulatory settings;</p><p>c) Provide structure and data that promote the competitiveness of U.S. businesses;</p><p>d) Support resilient state, territorial, Indigenous, and local communities; and</p><p>e) Facilitate conservation and environmental policy.</p><p>The remainder of this section explains each of these categories of use.</p><p>A. Natural Capital Accounting and Sustainable Development of the U.S. Macro-Economy</p><p>Natural capital is a core asset class within the macro-economy of the United States.21 However, natural assets are currently omitted from the national balance sheet. A statistical accounting system provides a comprehensive, internally consistent framework for compiling, organizing, and reporting relevant information about economic performance and enables analyses to guide decisions. The balance sheet and the rest of the NIPA are important to the Congressional Budget Office's and OMB's forecasting and budgeting exercises, along with Central Bank products.</p><p>Natural capital accounting is critical for macroeconomic policy, which aims to create conditions for sustained growth, financial and price stability, and full employment. Considering dependencies on climate and nature strongly enhances the ability to meet these goals.22 Omitting economic dependencies on nature leads to misattribution of systematic macroeconomic change.</p><p>In the case of natural assets, change in their aggregate value--or Change in Natural Asset Wealth--is an important indicator for sustainable development and future economic opportunity.23 A high-level summary that describes the state of natural-resource-based opportunity is important for shaping key national discussions and can complement changes in GDP and other macroeconomic indicators and provide visibility into one of GDP's well-known \"blind spots.\" GDP has dominated discourse because it provides a simple summary of a complex process using a single number. Yet, Americans have watched GDP grow at a faster pace than median wages and generally faster than their own abilities to enjoy the goods and services of a growing economy,24 while also being increasingly concerned about important services that are not well measured by GDP.25 This blind spot in GDP leads to a disconnect between the measure driving the economic discussions and people's everyday experience. International and domestic pressures imply that it is important for the United States to expand its core economic indicators in order to have broader conversations about economic policy that can address 21st century challenges.26 Measuring changes in the value of natural assets is an important step toward achieving this goal.</p><p>Experts agree that indicators beyond GDP are necessary. The Stiglitz Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress recommended a dashboard approach to measuring economic progress, where GDP has a smaller role than it is traditionally given.27 Economists often state that Net Domestic Product (NDP), which deducts for loss of assets--including natural assets--is a better benchmark measure of economic progress than GDP.28 The international community is expected to call for increased accounting for and attention to natural resource depletion, degradation, and growth and increased focus on NDP and Net National Income (NNI) as part of the 2025 update to the internationally agreed upon System of National Accounts (SNA).29,30 Change in wealth, inclusive of natural asset wealth, is also a critical indicator of sustainable development.31 By considering changes, rather than only depreciation, NDP or NNI can be linked to Adjusted Net Savings.32</p><p>Research indicates that natural assets are important for long-term financial forecasting and assessing economic stability.33 The dominant macroeconomic modeling frameworks implicitly assume, through the common \"all else equal\" assumption, a constant environment and climate and an unchanging stock of natural capital. However, climate change and systematic changes in natural capital generally pose micro- and macro-prudential risk that can cause system-level shocks. A lack of clear accounting generates greater vulnerability by undermining the ability to predict such shocks or by generating systemic errors, through misallocation of causality and a failure to account for connections among sectors, in the models used for macroeconomic planning.34 The most likely place changes in climate and other natural capital appear is through measurement of other critical factors, such as productivity because that captures residuals inputs not counted by other factors. Also, a lack of aggregate information about the market value of traded natural capital assets (e.g., land or mineral assets) makes it difficult to identify price inflation or deflation among some asset classes. The organized data contained within natural capital accounts and other environmental-economic statistics are important to achieving financial stability.</p><p>Natural capital accounts can provide important early-warning mechanisms associated with physical and transition risk from climate change because many of the economic impacts of climate change are mediated through changes in natural assets. For example, environmental-economic statistics will provide a foundation to better interpret the interviews and surveys that district Federal Reserve Banks use to guide policy. The Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) Teal and Beige Books regularly capture statements and survey information about how business depends on nature and on environmental influences on business performance; common examples include mentions of water, forest fires, storms, and other environmental processes. In one case, the Beige Book documents a four-day forest fire, in 1998, that cost the Daytona Beach area $300 million. In 2022, the Federal Reserve announced plans to begin to assess the resilience of financial institutions to climate-related financial risk in 2023.35 Understanding trends in natural capital could make these assessments easier.</p><p>More structured information will make some environmental shocks better understood as persistent trends within macroeconomic analysis. The Banque de France recently published a paper investigating the links between natural capital loss and financial instability and found that 42% of securities, by value, held by French financial institutions are highly or very highly dependent on services generated by natural capital.36 Change in natural capital may also affect the real neutral rate of interest (r-star), which is an important element in monetary policy and may be influenced by environmental conditions.37 There is also growing interest in the role of natural capital in sovereign credit ratings.38</p><p>B. Natural Capital Accounting and Federal Decision Making</p><p>The Federal Government regularly encounters situations in which regulatory and other Federal decisions affect the generation and distribution of benefits and costs through environmental pathways (that is, the regulation of one sector can influence generation of, access to, and distribution of environmental benefits experienced in other sectors).39 Currently, when the Federal Government analyzes how decisions change the value of natural assets or ecosystem services, the analysis is done without the support of a broader system that provides a clear understanding of how the environment fits together with other economic activities in the same way the statistical system provides clear information about the way economic sectors fit together.</p><p>For example, agencies can list relevant North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes in their regulatory agendas, regulations, and regulatory analysis. A similar classification and taxonomy system does not exist for nature. Economic statistics are available to highlight connections to, and among, industries, but no similar system exists for the environment or natural assets. Today, there is increasing understanding of how regulation of one sector can influence prices and quantities in other sectors, and data from national economic accounts can help in identifying these interactions. Environmental-economic statistics can bring the environment and natural assets into this system in a way that is analogous to other economic sectors. For example, investments made to remediate hazardous waste sites under the</p><p>Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) are currently accounted for in the NIPA, but these investments are not classified as</p><p>environmental protection expenditures in GDP. Linking land remediation investments through a system of natural capital accounts will enable accounting for these investments as environmental activities. The returns on these investments would be reflected as increases in land or recreation values and would appear on the national balance sheet as increases in the Nation's fixed capital.</p><p>The Federal Government is already working to support this kind of analysis,40 but data need to be better organized, standardized, and regularly updated. Natural capital accounts and associate environmental-economic statistics will provide a guiding framework for how currently disparate data can come together to better inform regulatory decision making.</p><p>Supporting recommendation: The system of Statistics for Environmental-Economic Decisions should provide national, regional, and state-level statistics. A large number of Federal decisions have broad non-localized impacts, in which case national statistics are often most appropriate. In some cases, Federal agencies lack the resources to conduct localized evaluations. In such cases, the aggregations provided in a national system of natural capital accounts will improve Federal decision making and provide greater predictability for entities affected by changes in natural capital. While developing and using the environmental-economic statistics, decision makers will need to recognize that a national set of statistics cannot provide all the information for every local decision, and there will be cases when localized measurement will remain important and outside the scope of Statistics for Environmental-Economic Decisions.</p><p>Non-regulatory Federal decisions related to programs and projects can also benefit from natural capital accounts. The United States faces numerous current and foreseeable policy challenges, such as infrastructure development, supply chain security, changes in U.S. labor supply, adapting to a changing climate, and addressing legacy environmental injustices. Natural capital accounts provide visibility to key elements of U.S. supply chains, their vulnerabilities, and their role in securing economic and financial stability. Currently, the United States is investing billions of dollars to develop new infrastructure and protect existing infrastructure41 while committing to accelerating nature-based solutions.42 New human-built infrastructure will appear as a produced asset on national balance sheets, but investment in nature-based solutions will likely be miscategorized in, and potentially lost to, the traditional economic accounting system.</p><p>C. Natural Capital Accounting and Competitiveness of U.S. Businesses</p><p>The development of national natural capital accounts and environmental-economic statistics serves to model good accounting behavior and spur private action. The Federal Government often focuses on claims made to environmental and other regulators about firm impact and</p><p>dependencies on nature. Firms also increasingly make claims about their relationship to nature, including impacts and dependencies on nature, when communicating with banks, investors, insurance providers, consumers, and other stakeholders. A system of natural capital accounts puts nature in language that investors and banks understand. It enables banks to identify connections between natural assets and their loan books, leading to shifts in lending practices.</p><p>When reliable data are not available, making such claims may expose firms to legal and reputational risk, and the inability to make such claims may limit access to financing, insurance, and market share. A Federal system of environmental-economic statistics will help de-risk (i.e., reduce the risk posed by) these claims by providing an official data source and demonstrates a systematic accounting system that firms can safely emulate or build upon. Furthermore, a standardized system could help clarify and inform expectations for firms, thereby de-risking the claims firms make. Beyond the data themselves, the supporting structure and taxonomy of the environmental-economic statistics can provide assurance in a Federally-designed structure on which to base auditing of environmental claims.</p><p>The business sector increasingly understands that tens of trillions of dollars of economic output depend on natural capital.43 This is especially true in emerging sectors such as the bioeconomy. A Credit Suisse report found that 70% of investors feel that the data to manage natural capital is insufficient.44 Firms increasingly focus on securing long-term stakeholder value, managing supply-chain risks, and minimizing environmental risk exposure. Access to organized, reliable data on natural assets and changing environmental-economic conditions will benefit the U.S. private sector. The U.S. approach to natural capital accounts and environmental-economic statistics will increase U.S. private sector competitiveness by making it substantially easier for firms to expand environmental reporting by providing a benchmark data series and structure.45 Businesses currently use existing economic data compiled under the SNA46 and the NIPA. Major business consulting firms regularly extract data from the NIPA to help explain business conditions and assist individual enterprises in making strategic decisions. Law firms increasingly need to advise enterprises on corporate responsibility as it relates to environmental impacts and are looking to the Federal Government to lead with reliable accounting practices. Natural capital accounting data and associated environmental-economic statistics are relevant to all these businesses, which need, or want, to make nature-related claims that are trusted, standardized, and based on regularly reported data.</p><p>Major financial institutions offer natural capital insurance products47 that are likely to increase in importance as nature-based solutions expand. The New York Stock Exchange is initiating a partnership that enables trading of natural assets in the form of \"Natural Asset Companies\" to facilitate liquidity between natural capital and financial capital.48 Firms increasingly focus on voluntary frameworks to guide environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting, such as the framework developed by the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD)49 and the Natural Capital Protocol.50 However, business leaders often cite uneven data quality and definitions as a barrier to using natural capital in decision-making. A standardized, regularly-updated, national system of natural capital accounts and associated environmental-economic statistics is necessary for these frameworks to succeed and to enable U.S. firms to compete as other countries develop such accounting systems.</p><p>D. Natural Capital Accounting and Resilient State, Territorial, Local, Tribal, and Indigenous Communities</p><p>Subnational and Tribal governments rely on national economic accounting data to parameterize regional planning models.51 The system of natural capital accounts will provide data and structure to embed the environment into these planning tools in a streamlined, low-burden fashion. This is especially true for infrastructure investments and climate resilience planning. Coordination with subnational and Tribal governments is especially important because the economic value of most natural capital is partially determined by its geographic location.</p><p>Remote work and a changing labor force influence how jobs are tied to the environment and may increasingly influence local tax revenue and bond rates. This includes natural resource-dependent jobs and the location-based quality-of-life tradeoffs American workers make when given the option of remote work. Natural capital accounting can help anticipate this labor transition, helping towns and cities across America.</p><p>Supporting recommendation: Develop engagement plans to coordinate with state, territorial, local, and Tribal Governments and with Indigenous Organizations to support their needs and collect information on natural assets, as appropriate, with plans tailored to each groups' specific needs. Governments increasingly recognize the importance of accounting for and appropriately valuing natural assets to improve decision making. Multiple states have begun investigating, to varying degrees, whether natural capital accounting could improve state-level decision making. Existing accounts contain information that may be relevant to diverse state agencies, including those responsible for agriculture, economic development, resource development, tourism, state parks, wildlife, and environmental quality. States may also have data sources to contribute. States are often familiar with dashboard-style interfaces that summarize state performance across various indicators;52 such information, properly distilled from accounts into policy-relevant indicators, may be relevant and accessible for state-level decision making. Engagement is discussed further in Section V.</p><p>Supporting recommendation: Consider the equity implications of technical decisions related to classifications and the geographic groupings,53 be clear about biases that may emerge as a result of these decisions, and make design choices that illuminate existing inequities and biases and attempt to avoid future ones. What is counted in the American economy is not separable from who is counted in the American economy. Natural capital accounts will begin to clarify the existing allocation of natural assets. From that starting point, it may be possible to better target investments in natural capital that, if pursued, could address some of the roots of environmental injustices.</p><p>Accounting for natural capital adds previously overlooked assets to the balance sheet. By making the balance sheet more inclusive of nature, the national accounting system implicitly will be more inclusive of the people who contribute to the caretaking and stewardship of natural assets, especially Indigenous Communities and rural Americans.</p><p>The Working Group acknowledges, and many public comments reflect, that natural capital accounts and environmental-economics statistics cannot resolve inequity and environmental injustice alone. Accurate statistical information is one of many important tools to reduce inequity and environmental injustice. Still, it is likely that environmental-economic statistics will not be provided at sufficiently local scales to address all localized problems.</p><p>Supporting recommendation: Acknowledge that an economics-based statistical system may not fit with some worldviews, especially those of some Indigenous Peoples, and follow three paths forward to partially ameliorate this risk. These are:</p><p>1. Work to weave in elements of these world views via the multiple accounting boundaries that this Strategic Plan recommends.</p><p>2. In reports and documents based on the natural capital accounts or environmental-economics statistics, reference other Federal activities, such as the National Nature Assessment,54 which may reflect world views that are incongruent with an economics-based statistical system.</p><p>3. Continue public engagement throughout the development process. Engagement is further discussed in Section V.</p><p>E. Conservation as an Economic Necessity</p><p>Conservation and the protection of the environment are often pitted against economic progress. This is a false dichotomy but is unsurprising when measurement of conservation and economic success occur in different units and are seldom integrated into a single system. The Statistics for Environmental-Economic Decisions system can give rise to economic policy that incorporates conservation as an investment in the economy, such as enhancing worker productivity, health, and supporting the tourism and travel industries. As national natural capital accounts bring water, soil, and other natural assets onto balance sheets, it is reasonable to expect that the private sector will accelerate transformation of its own balance sheets to create similar accounting. This may enable conservation activities and stewardship of natural capital to become a credit-enhancing activity for America's landowners who contribute to increasing the stock of U.S. natural capital.</p><p>Natural capital accounts will clarify the importance of natural assets in areas where economic output differs from social outcomes. For example, individual studies have demonstrated that access to parks can drive physical health improvements for people, improving their quality of life, and reduce medical costs. But the magnitude of these services, and changes in them, are not regularly reported at a national scale, even in the healthcare accounts.55 Similarly, case studies of nature-based solutions, like wetlands and rain swales for storm water management, show that these investments reduce \"defensive expenditures\" by reducing stormwater management expenditures and flood risks. However, the value added of major national investments in nature-based solutions, such as those made in resilient infrastructure through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 (IIJA), will not be visible on the nation's balance sheet as it is compiled today. As natural capital accounts become available, the return on nationwide investment in the nature-based infrastructure sector and other sectors will become clearer.</p><p>Supporting recommendation: The Conservation Stewardship Atlas, National Nature Assessment, annual reports, and emerging natural capital accounts should be aligned and complementary where feasible. The natural capital accounts will provide a critical input to the National Nature Assessment,56 which will report on the status and trends in U.S. lands, waters, wildlife, biodiversity, ecosystems, and the benefits they provide, including to the economy. The planned Conservation Stewardship Atlas is a tool for tracking a range of conservation benefits provided by U.S. lands and waters, particularly for biodiversity, climate and equity benefits.</p><p>Natural capital accounts, once developed, could complement other data in the Atlas by identifying how conservation actions are contributing to economic conservation goals, and helping to quantify the return on conservation and investment in nature-based solutions.</p><p>* * *</p><p>(Continues with Part 3 of 10)</p><p>The footnotes and report are posted at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Natural-Capital-Accounting-Strategy-final.pdf\">https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Natural-Capital-Accounting-Strategy-final.pdf</url></p><p>TARGETED NEWS SERVICE (founded 2004) features non-partisan 'edited journalism' news briefs and information for news organizations, public policy groups and individuals; as well as 'gathered' public policy information, including news releases, reports, speeches.

Feedback from the survey will be used to shape the future of nature-based recreation in Rhode Island including fishing, hunting and boating, and management of state owned/operated conservation lands and management areas. Survey data will also help prioritize funding for future conservation efforts and support the growth and management of outdoor recreation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We encourage Rhode Islanders to participate in this important survey and share information about their involvement in activities such as fishing, hunting, boating, hiking, and bird-watching on state conservation lands,\" said DEM Director Janet Coit. \"Their valuable feedback will help us create better outdoor opportunities for all Rhode Islanders and visitors. Providing people with places to get outdoors and enjoy nature is part of DEM's core mission, is good for health, and fosters our next generation of environmental stewards.\"</p><p>DEM invites a broad representation of stakeholders including local and state leaders, environmental organizations, private-sector groups, and all others interested in outdoor recreation to take the survey and share their thoughts about the use of state lands. Hearing directly from the people that use Rhode Island's network of management areas and conservation lands will help DEM gauge the level and type of use, how the public values state lands, and develop ideas for better management and funding to keep areas open, staffed, and operational.</p><p>The survey takes only a few minutes to complete and is available on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dem.ri.gov/naturesurvey\">www.dem.ri.gov/naturesurvey</url>.</p><p>The effort is part of a broader project DEM is conducting to assess the Division of Fish &amp; Wildlife and the Division of Forest Environment's strategic priorities, oversight, and stewardship of state-owned/operated conservation and management areas, including fishing access areas and boat ramps. The project includes lands that are directly managed by DEM's Divisions of Fish &amp; Wildlife and Forest Environment; state parks and beaches are not included. Visit the list of state-owned/operated conservation and management areas by clicking here.</p><p>With more than 60,000 acres of state of land, including 25 state management areas, 400 miles of hiking and biking trails, 200 fishing spots, and over 200 public boat ramps in Rhode Island, recreationists of all kinds have plentiful options of places for hunting, fishing, hiking, boating, photographing wildlife, watching birds, or just enjoying the outdoors.</p><p>DEM's Division of Fish and Wildlife is responsible for managing thousands of species of wildlife, including freshwater species. Revenue generated from fishing and hunting license and permit sales supports Rhode Island fish and wildlife conservation programs. A critical source of funding, these monies are leveraged to match federal Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Program dollars that support nature-based recreational opportunities for fishing, hunting, and boating in Rhode Island.</p><p>A steward of forest-based recreation, DEM's Division of Forest Environment manages 40,000 acres of state-owned rural forestland including the Arcadia and George Washington Management Areas. The Division also works across the state with property owners along with rural and urban communities on a wide range of forestry topics including forest health, forest fire prevention, community tree planting, and private forest land management to maximize the positive benefits forests bring to all Rhode Islanders.</p><p>For more information on DEM programs and initiatives, visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dem.ri.gov\">www.dem.ri.gov</url>.

Glendora Ridge Road and Glendora Mountain Road were both open.</p><p>\"We ask our public to stay out of the fire area to allow the land to recover,\" the USFS said. \"Due to the good work of the firefighters, the Ranch 2 Fire did not turn into a large fire. The rugged and steep terrain, the dry chaparral and very, very warm days made this an unusually challenging fire.</p><p>The USFS is estimating that full containment will be achieved on Friday.</p><p>No structural damage has been reported since the suspected arson blaze began about 2:45 p.m. on Aug. 13 near North San Gabriel Canyon Road and North Ranch Road.</p><p>Eight cases of heat-related injuries to firefighters have been reported, and 50 firefighters have been treated for exposure to poison oak during the firefighting effort, said Capt. Steve Concialdi of the Orange County Fire Authority, who served as an information officer for the Ranch2 Fire.</p><p>The number of firefighters assigned to the blaze was reduced Tuesday to 179 from 275 on Monday.</p><p>Felony charges were filed last week against a 36-year-old homeless man who allegedly set the blaze during an argument with a fellow transient. Osmin Palencia, who lives in a tent near the Mountain Cove community, could face up to 23 years in state prison if convicted of one count each of arson during a state of emergency and arson of a structure or forest, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office.</p><p>Palencia -- who allegedly has a prior conviction from 2015 for dissuading a witness -- surrendered to authorities on Aug. 16 and has remained behind bars since then. He is set to be arraigned Sept. 11 at the West Covina courthouse.</p><p>The Angeles National Forest changed its Forest Fire Danger Level from very high to extreme last week and moved into full fire-restriction mode, including prohibiting camp fires in developed sites. Cooking stoves, lanterns and similar devices that use propane, white gas or similar fuels are prohibited.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNS-AZUSAFIREAZUSAWILDFIRE96CONTAINED4237ACRESBURNEDSTRETCHOFHIGHWAY39OPEN</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60P7-JVS1-DYTF-R0M2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">152634</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"463\"/><timeReceived>1:40 AM PST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 City News Service, Inc.

It was their final trek out of their ranch near Guadalupita in Mora County to rescue precious items and animals. <br/>'It's been stressful, like, the whole time, honestly,' 18-year-old Adam Torres said. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG_4834-scaled.jpeg\">https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG_4834-scaled.jpeg</url> Adam Torres, 18, and his mother, Josephine, stand in front of their truck on Saturday along N.M. 120 near Wagon Mound. The family was ordered to leave the ranch near Guadalupita due to the merged Hermit's Peak and Calf Canyon fires. (Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM) <br/>With the ranch within several miles of the fire, they did not know what they'd encounter when they returned. They've never seen anything like it, they said. <br/>The fires the family fled all sparked in a 24-hour period and quickly tore through a combined 100,000 acres of picturesque meadows, villages and forests. About 30 pronghorn antelope could be seen Saturday crossing the highway away from the blazes. The herd was at least the second seen running down a mesa in front of a pillar of smoke, according to a Taos County sheriff's deputy. <br/>The fires burned Saturday on either side of the Torres caravan, which was headed west on N.M. 120 toward Wagon Mound. On the south side, the combined Hermit's Peak and Calf Canyon fire destroyed structures and burned, as of Sunday evening, 54,000 acres. On the north, the Cooks Peak fire had taken another 50,000 acres of its own. <br/>Both are already among the 20 biggest fires in New Mexico history[1], according to the Southwest Coordination Center, an interagency fire-response office. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG_6886-scaled.jpeg\">https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG_6886-scaled.jpeg</url> Pronghorn antelope graze while smoke fills the air on N.M. 120, where two major wildfires erupted within hours of each other in April 2022. (Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM) <br/>The wildfires were just three of 20 burning Saturday in 16 of 33 counties in New Mexico. <br/>This weekend, the state was the nation's epicenter for forest fires, ones that are breaking out earlier and at a greater rate than normal. A map of the nation's forest fires compiled by the National Wildfire Coordinating Group shows New Mexico basically buried in icons noting active fires[2], along with a handful in Arizona and other Southwest states. <br/>New Mexico in April typically averages a little more than six fires[3] that burn more than 100 acres, according to the SWCC. <br/>'Yesterday, we experienced a combination of conditions that quite frankly is unprecedented in New Mexico history,' said Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham in a briefing Saturday afternoon. 'It is only April, and yet we are seeing fire spread that we've only ever seen in this state in late May and June. So our risk season is incredibly and dangerously early.' <br/>On Friday, meteorologists warned of 'catastrophic' and 'dire[4]' windy and dry conditions, and they were right. Wind gusts exceeded 70 mph in northern New Mexico, and a megadrought \u2014 which scientists say is a byproduct of climate change \u2014 left forests and grasslands incredibly dry and quick to burn. <br/>Even before Friday, the United States had seen an above-average fire season already. This year's forest fire season has been 'above average,' according to the National Weather Service, with 19,774 counted as of April 21[5]. The 10-year average at that date is 13,720. <br/>Just because the fires are starting early doesn't mean the fire season will be shorter, either, Lujan Grisham said. <br/>'We have a longer, more dramatic and quite frankly more dangerous significant fire season ahead of us,' she said. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG_4723-scaled.jpeg\">https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG_4723-scaled.jpeg</url> The combined Calf Canyon and Hermit's Peak fires burn north of Las Vegas, New Mexico on Saturday, April 23. (Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source New Mexico) <br/>The fires ripped through a northeast swath of the Santa Fe National Forest, about an hour north of Las Vegas. In the process, they destroyed an estimated 200 structures. <br/>Eric Maestas believes one of those is his family home of more than 40 years, near Cleveland, New Mexico, northwest of Mora. He said his neighbors told him the house was gone, though he was still awaiting official word. <br/>He and his elderly parents and sibling evacuated the home Friday, after getting notice from the sheriff's office that it was time. The area around Mora has since lost electricity, and gas stations are closed. <br/>'Everybody was panicking. They shut down all the electricity. They shut down all the cell phones. There was nothing. People were going crazy,' Maestas told Source New Mexico. 'They shut down all the stores. And everybody was fighting to get gas and get out of there. It was pretty crazy.' <br/>Maestas said he can't recall ever seeing a fire build itself so quickly, seemingly out of nowhere, carried by high winds. Ca\u00f1oncito Creek ran dry last year, he said. <br/>'The river that runs through our property never went dry. Last year it did, and all the fish died,' he said. <br/>He spoke briefly to Source New Mexico as he left an evacuation shelter in a Las Vegas middle school gymnasium. He carried a box of food and water along with a new pair of slippers and stuffed it in a small sedan to bring to a campsite where he is staying temporarily, he said. His parents are elderly, and his dad is on oxygen. <br/>'The smoke was, like, very intense there for like a couple of days, even before it reached us,' he said. 'But it's fine. We're all alive.' <br/>More photos below from the fires in Northern New Mexico: <br/> The combined Calf Canyon and Hermit's Peak fires burn north of Las Vegas, New Mexico on Saturday, April 23.

These aircraft are designed to store huge amount      of water of fire retardant chemical during flight and spread them at specified locations to control the fire from spreading further. Increase in forest &amp; industrial fire incidents at      different locations has enabled aircraft manufacturers to develop and introduce advanced firefighting aircraft to tackle such incidents, which eventually leads to growth of the market across      the globe. Moreover, with advancements in technology followed by the need for efficient aircraft, firefighter aircraft manufacturers have manufactured and converted existing aircraft &amp;      helicopter lineup in such a way that they can be used as firefighter aircraft. For instance, during the Amazon forest fire in 2019, Brazil modified its C-130 Hercules aircraft into water      bombers, and tens of thousands of military personnel were deployed to the Amazon in an effort to combat the fires in 2019.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Get Sample PDF@ <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/14273\">https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/14273</url></emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Major Market Players:</emphasis><br/>AeroVironment, Inc.<br/>Airbus SE<br/>  Bombardier<br/>Coulson Aircrane LTD.<br/>Kaman Corporation<br/>Lockheed Martin Corporation<br/>SAAB<br/>ShinMaywa Industries Ltd.<br/>Textron Inc.<br/>Viking Air Ltd.</p><p>In addition, factors such as use of general aircraft to extinguish wildfire and increase in fire-related incidents in the oil &amp; gas industry supplements growth of the market by increasing      demand for efficient firefighting aircraft. Moreover, delayed delivery of aircraft and high capital requirement creates barrier for growth of the market. However, entering into contract &amp;      agreements for long-term business opportunities and incorporation of new technologies to put out fire is expected to create ample opportunities for growth of the market during the forecast      period.</p><p>The global firefighting aircraft market is segmented into type, service provider, max. takeoff weight, water capacity, and region. By type, the market is segmented into fixed wing and      multi-rotor. By service provider, it is segmented into firefighting organizations and military. By max. takeoff weight, the global market has been segmented into below 50,000 kg and above      50,000 kg. By water capacity, it is segmented into less than 5,000 ltr, 5,000   10,000 ltr, and more than 10,000 ltr. By region, the global market is studied across North America, Europe,      Asia-Pacific, and LAMEA0.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Key Market Segments</emphasis><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">By Type</emphasis><br/>  Fixed Wing<br/>  Multi-Rotor<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">By Service Provider</emphasis><br/>  Firefighting Organizations<br/>  Military<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">By Max.

These aircraft carry chemical or fire retardants that at the press of a button are dropped at locations to extinguish wildfire. Moreover, these firefighting      aircraft are designed in such a way that they can carry a huge amount of fire extinguishing components that can be spread over a huge area to stop fire from moving further. This increased max.      takeoff weight of aircraft creates wider scope for growth of the market across the globe.</p><p>Significant increase in fire related accidents, especially in the oil &amp; gas industry increases demand for efficient safety measures along with the need for available firefighting aircraft      &amp; drones to be present at nearby locations, which drives the market growth. Furthermore, stringent rules &amp; regulations by governments along with technological advancements in      firefighting technology also acts as driving factor for the market growth. In addition, numerous companies as well as industry owners deploy active firefighting systems such as helicopters and      drones, which proves to be efficient in firefighting scenarios and at the same time are easy to operate. Such developments &amp; technological advancements create a positive impact on growth of      the market across the globe.</p><p>Governments &amp; fire departments across the globe create a demand for efficient firefighting solutions, owing to rise in concerns regarding forest fires as well as due to industrial mishap,      which costs much to governments and local residents. Firefighting aircraft are made to order product lines, which are mostly built as per demand along with signed contracts and agreements.      Commencement of firefighter aircraft solutions is expected to be carried out through contracts and agreements between end users and developers, which creates a positive impact on growth of the      market in the longer run. These contracts mention a timely and efficient service to be delivered in need and a fixed payment is paid in return to services, which keeps both contract holders      attached to the contract. These contracts and agreements are associated with long-term business opportunities with end users. Market participants need to focus on winning contracts and      agreements to gain a competitive advantage in the global market, thus creating a wider scope for growth of the market during the forecast period.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Buy Now@ <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/purchase-enquiry/14273\">https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/purchase-enquiry/14273</url></emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Key Benefits For Stakeholders</emphasis><br/>  This study presents analytical depiction of the global firefighting aircraft market analysis along with current trends and future estimations to depict imminent investment pockets.<br/>  The overall firefighting aircraft market opportunity is determined by understanding profitable trends to gain a stronger foothold.<br/>  The report presents information related to the key drivers, restraints, and opportunities of the global firefighting aircraft market with a detailed impact analysis.<br/>  The current firefighting aircraft market is quantitatively analyzed from 2020 to 2030 to benchmark the financial competency.<br/>  Porter s five forces analysis illustrates the potency of the buyers and suppliers in the industry.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Contact Info:</emphasis><br/>Name: David Correa<br/>Email: Send Email<br/>Organization: Allied Market Research<br/>Address: 5933 NE Win Sivers Drive #205, Portland, OR 97220 United States<br/>Phone: 1-800-792-5285<br/>Website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com\">https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com</url>/</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">About Allied Market Research</emphasis><br/>Allied Market Research (AMR) is a full-service market research and business-consulting wing of Allied Analytics LLP, based in Portland, Oregon.

Apache Sitgreaves National Forests - issued the following press release:</p><p>Due to extreme fire danger in all vegetation types, the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests will enter Stage 1 Fire Restrictions along with the other national forests in Arizona on Friday, October 9th, at 8:00 AM to protect public health and reduce preventable human-caused wildfires.</p><p>\"This seems very odd for October. We are seeing values that are normally seen in mid-June and all values continue to trend upward, \"said Gary Strickland, Forest Fire Management Officer. \"Wildfire occurrence is rising in reaction to receptive fuels. Firefighters are currently engaged in fire suppression operations on the Cow Canyon Fire and the Jake Springs Fire and continue to respond to an increase of abandoned campfires and new starts on the forest. We are asking the public for their cooperation during this time to keep our communities safe.\"</p><p>Criteria used to determine when to implement fire restrictions include current and predicted weather, fuel moisture, fire activity levels, and available firefighting resources.</p><p>Restrictions will remain in effect until December 31, 2020, or until forest officials determine that conditions have changed sufficiently to reduce the risk of human-caused wildfires, whichever occurs first.</p><p>Under Stage 1 Restrictions the following acts are prohibited: 16 U.S.C. Section 551 and 36 C.F.R. Section 261.50(a) and (b)</p><p>* Igniting, building, maintaining, or using a fire, including charcoal and briquettes outside a fire structure that is provided by the Forest Service within a designated area. 36 C.F.R. Section 261.52(a).</p><p>* Smoking, except within an enclosed vehicle or building, a developed recreation site, or while stopped in an area at least three (3) feet in diameter that is barren or cleared of all flammable material. 36 C.F.R. Section 261.52(d).</p><p>Exemptions to the restrictions include the following: 36 C.F.R. Section 261.50(e)</p><p>* Holders of Forest Service Special Use Authorizations are exempt from restriction #1 above, provided such fires are within a fire structure and they are within their permitted area.</p><p>* Persons using a stove or grill that is solely fueled by liquid petroleum or liquid petroleum gas (LPG) fuels.</p><p>* Persons using a stove fire in a designated area.</p><p>* Any Federal, State or local officer, or member of an organized rescue or fire fighting force in the performance of an official duty.</p><p>Recreational target shooting and legal hunting activities are permitted and are not affected by this order. Fireworks and explosives, including exploding targets, are never allowed on national forests. Use good judgment and basic safety precautions when hiking, fishing or camping; and follow Leave No Trace principles (<url normalizedValue=\"https://lnt.org/why/7-principles/\">https://lnt.org/why/7-principles/</url>).</p><p>Several Forests in AZ and NM are still in fire restrictions.

Vegetation remains at critical dryness levels, U.S. Forest Service officials said.</p><p>Crews have been focusing on building containment lines on the western edge of the fire between Fern and Cold Creek canyons, according to fire officials, who said good relative humidity recovery was expected to help slow fire activity.</p><p>The western flank of the fire, where terrain is especially steep, has been especially difficult for firefighters, according to the U.S. Forest Service, which is estimating that full containment will be achieved on Friday.</p><p>No structural damage has been reported since the suspected arson blaze began about 2:45 p.m. Aug. 13 near North San Gabriel Canyon Road and North Ranch Road.</p><p>Eight cases of heat-related injuries to firefighters have been reported, and 50 firefighters have been treated for exposure to poison oak during the firefighting effort, said Capt. Steve Concialdi of the Orange County Fire Authority, who is serving as an information officer for the Ranch2 Fire.</p><p>The number of firefighters assigned to the blaze was reduced from 412 to 284 on Sunday. Incident commanders anticipate reducing that number further in the near future, Concialdi said.</p><p>Felony charges were filed last week against a 36-year-old homeless man who allegedly set the blaze during an argument with a fellow transient. Osmin Palencia, who lives in a tent near the Mountain Cove community, could face up to 23 years in state prison if convicted of one count each of arson during a state of emergency and arson of a structure or forest, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office.</p><p>Palencia -- who allegedly has a prior conviction from 2015 for dissuading a witness -- surrendered to authorities on Aug. 16 and has remained behind bars since then. He is set to be arraigned Sept. 11 at the West Covina courthouse.</p><p>All evacuation orders have been lifted, but the following road closures remain in effect:</p><p>-- San Gabriel Canyon Road/Highway 39: closed at Northbound Highway 39 at Sierra Madre Avenue (southbound Highway 39 is closed at East Fork Road);</p><p>-- Glendora Mountain Road: closed from Big Dalton to East Fork;</p><p>-- Glendora Ridge Road: closed from Glendora Mountain Road to Mt.

The western Maharashtra state, home to Mumbai, is at the center of the new outbreak, having registered over 47,200 new cases on Monday.Shekhar Mande, director general at India's Council of Scientific and Industrial Research warned that people need to take precautions to prevent a nationwide surge in cases.Recently, India's capital region, Delhi, decided to impose a night curfew after recording over 3500 new infections in a single day.\"All the pandemics in the world have come in the form of waves. We are currently seeing a strong third wave in some European countries, so a third wave cannot be ruled out in India,\" Mande told reporters during a remote news conference.The recent rise in cases has been attributed to an increase in public gatherings and people ignoring COVID containment measures. </p><p>Many Indians are also experiencing pandemic fatigue a year after coronavirus first emerged in India. New variants and a \"double mutation\" of the virus are also circulating in India. Election season is also underway for over 200 million people in Assam, Bengal, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.\"Many parts still have a large vulnerable population that is susceptible to contracting an infection. This makes it imperative to follow COVID appropriate behavior, especially wearing a mask when stepping out,\" Randeep Guleria, director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, told DW.How can vaccinations be increased?Indian virologists have said the surge in cases means it is imperative for health authorities to increase the vaccination rate.\"This requires an increase in vaccine supply, more administration points and convincing people to take the vaccine; at least in areas seeing the surge,\" virologist Shahid Jameel told DW.Jacob John, a renowned virologist and former professor at the Christian Medical College, said that India's vaccine administration needs to be \"unshackled.\"\"If you want to put out a forest fire, you get to the source. Similarly, target groups in areas where the infections are surging need to be vaccinated,\" John told DW.\"Given the current trajectory of the infections, I see it plateauing only by the end of April,\" he added.There are also concerns that India could reach a point where both the national and global demand for vaccines could overwhelm the domestic manufacturing capacity, putting people everywhere at risk of a longer-lasting pandemic. The Serum Institute of India is a major manufacturer of the AstraZeneca vaccine, and India has been a major exporter of doses.India's vaccination drive kicked off on January 16, and the government has set a target of vaccinating 300 million people by July. So far, nearly 83 million doses have been administered.\"What we really need to do is vaccinate everyone, and quickly. We have to open the floodgates and involve everybody,\" Arvind Kumar, a physician at Medanta Hospital in Gurugram told DW.Over the past two weeks India's daily vaccination rate has increased from 1 to around 2 million doses. Experts say that at this rate, it would take nine months to fully vaccinate 20% of India's population (275 million people) with two doses.On April 1, the government opened up vaccinations to anyone over the age of 45, and has mandated that all public and private vaccination centers stay open every day including on Sundays.India has approved two vaccines: one developed by Oxford-AstraZeneca and manufactured by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India, and another developed by the Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DEWL1099901617715838745258793000204</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7828</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62CN-0DF1-F03R-N0SN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567696</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"694\"/><timeReceived>1:30 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Deutsche Welle Asia</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"04\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>April 6, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002145</classCode><className>VIRUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOXW</classCode><className>PANDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002064</classCode><className>EPIDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001785</classCode><className>VACCINES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N923120CC</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001880</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002058</classCode><className>DISEASE AGENTS &amp;

The 'chubby little cubby all stuffed with fluff' is almost 100 years old, born in 1926 as a creation of author A.A. Milne. </p><p><br/><br/>The classic children's book teddy bear came to life in 1977 when Disney[2] released the full-length movieThe Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.The original characters jumped off the pages of Milne's books, much to the delight of audiences around the world. <br/><br/>In England, the beloved group of fictional friends[3] was well known. Disney was unsure how Americans would react to the animated stuffed animals, so they added another sub-character not included in the original books. <br/><br/> The Hundred Acre Wood <br/><br/>Rabbit, Tigger, Eeyore and Winnie the Pooh pose at Walt Disney Pictures presents the premiere of 'Winnie The Pooh' at Walt Disney Studios on July 10, 2011 in Burbank, California. | Getty Images <br/><br/>Disney retained the rights to Winnie the Pooh in 1961. Several years later, in 1966, the first animated short featuring Pooh bear was released. According toSmithsonian Magazine[4], 'there have been a steady stream of movies, TV shows, video games, and amusement park rides ever since.' <br/><br/>Anyone that has turned the page of a Winnie the Pooh book knows the honey-loving bear goes on endless adventures with his friends. Christopher Robin[5], Eeyore, Tigger, Piglet, Kanga, and Roo round out the group, along with Owl and Rabbit. <br/><br/>According toThe Telegraph[6], Ashdown Forest, located in East Sussex, United Kingdom, inspired the Hundred Acre Wood. They reported, 'several locations in the Pooh stories can be matched to real places in and around the forest.' <br/><br/>In 2019,CBS News[7]announced that 50 acres of the inspirational forest were destroyed by fire. Under national protection for its wildlife, officials expect the area will eventually return to its original grandeur. <br/><br/> Why Disney added another character to the classic storybook movie <br/><br/>Happy Groundhog\u2014er Gopher\u2014Day! pic.twitter.com/WdD6F8rXCo[8] \u2014 Disney (@Disney) February 2, 2019[9] <br/><br/>The new friend added toThe Many Adventures of Winnie the Poohwas Gopher. The whistling, dynamite-loving animal is the only character not included in the original books. <br/><br/>According toRanker[10], 'Disney wanted a character with a more 'folksy' personality, something that American viewers would be more likely to relate to.' They noted Gopher's first line in the movie is 'I'm not in the book, but I'm at your service!' <br/><br/>Oh My[11]explained the playful Gopher is talking about not having his name in the phone book and not referring to not being included in the beloved storybooks. <br/><br/>Disney got their inspiration for Gopher from the beaver that appeared inLady and the Tramp.Amino [12]explains he was a 'short-tempered but quick thinking animal who spoke with a whistley lisp.' <br/><br/>In the end, English audiences never connected to Gopher, but U.S. viewers enjoyed how the zany animal interacted with Pooh and his friends. <br/><br/> What happened to Gopher? <br/><br/>The Mini Adventures of Winnie the Pooh: Pooh and Gopher[13] <br/><br/>In 2011, when Disney released the Winnie the Pooh movie, Gopher was not part of the cast. <br/><br/>Some believe that his dynamite blasting was considered too violent. The constant bickering with Rabbit could be another explanation for removing him from future projects. <br/><br/>The most likely reasoning behind getting rid of the silly rodent was that he was not a character in the books written by Milne. Since Disney wanted to stay true to the original concept[14], it is believed they decided to remove any reference to Gopher moving forward. The last time the animal appeared in a scene was inPooh's Heffalump Halloween Movie. <br/><br/>Gopher may be gone but not forgotten. In 2019, Gopher appeared in the video gameKingdom Hearts III.The fun-loving character is also still an animatronic in the Winnie the Pooh ride at Walt Disney World, forever casting a place in the history of the Hundred Acre Wood. <br/><br/>RELATED: 'Winnie the Pooh': Are All the Characters Symbolic of Mental Health Disorder?[15] <br/> Read the original article from The Cheat Sheet[16] <br/> [

I was told it's a kind of delta wing or hang glider with a small engine and just enough room for two people. </p><p><br/>Well, up to that moment, my policy about high and dangerous places was that I preferred to enjoy such views only when wearing a harness and attached to a rope. Nevertheless, I picked up the phone and called a friend with hang glider experience for an opinion. <br/>'You have a chance to fly in an ultralight?' he said. 'Go for it! My wife and son both loved the experience!' <br/>Well, I assumed that his wife and son had not only enjoyed their trike flights but had also survived them, so I accepted the invitation. <br/>So the following Sunday, I headed for Kordich Air Sports \u2014 a 40-minute drive from Guadalajara \u2014 where I had an appointment to soar into the sky at 9 a.m. <br/>The Kordich Air Sports club is located at Los Pozos, 40 minutes from Guadalajara or Lake Chapala. Kordich Air <br/>After driving through a pueblito called Los Pozos, I stopped and asked a local man if I was on the right track. <br/>'S qu s,' said David Garca with a big smile, but he said he prefers to call the place I was looking for 'Los Pozos International Airport' because, as he explained, it now attracts hang gliding enthusiasts from all over Mexico and a few other countries. They gather here to float upon the extraordinary thermal updrafts created by the unique geography of Los Pozos. <br/>Los Pozos is bounded by a towering cliff on one side and desert-like, treeless flats on the other, plus 80-kilometer-long Lake Chapala nearby. <br/>A few minutes later, I was given a warm welcome by owner Pedro Kordich, who has been flying delta wings for some 35 years. <br/>'Early in the morning, we have ideal conditions for flying ultralights,' Kordich told me, 'but a few hours later, the thermals begin to rise, and then it's perfect for hang gliders. At Los Pozos, you can have the experience of surfing, only you are riding waves of air instead of water.' <br/>But now it was time for my ultralight flight. <br/>The delta wing has no engine and is launched from atop a cliff. Kordich Air <br/>First, I slid into my seat behind Pedro. Then he and an assistant snapped a seat belt on me and fitted a huge helmet on my head with a built-in communication system. I felt a bit like an astronaut about to head into space. <br/>'Vmonos,' Pedro shouted with a big laugh as we sped along the runway. <br/>Suddenly, we were in the air and Pedro was already turning the aircraft left and right, pointing things out to me even though we were only 20 meters off the ground. He was 'steering' by weight-shifting: pushing, pulling and turning the bottom bar of a big tubular triangle. I was amazed at how maneuverable this trike was in comparison to a commercial plane. <br/>Then we went up high and fast, and suddenly I could see, in one panoramic view, all of Lake Chapala and, beyond it, the Nevado de Colima volcano, at 4,260 meters, the highest point in Jalisco. <br/>In addition, I hate to say, I could see countless forest fires blazing in the hills all around us. It was an overpowering view. <br/>'If we fly over one of those incendios, you might feel some turbulence,' came the tinny voice of Pedro through my earphones. <br/>'Flying is my life,' says Pedro Kordich. 'It's a way of communing with nature.' <br/>I answered something, but I'm not sure what it was since I discovered that I couldn't hear my own voice due to the engine's roar. Without a doubt, I must have said, 'Hey, sure, let's fly right over a forest fire' because that's just what we did. <br/>Far below (maybe 400 meters?), I could see orange flames licking the sky. Our smooth ride suddenly got bumpy. Apparently, this is what you would experience if you flew in the afternoon around here, which is why they do the trike flights in the morning. <br/>The next phase of my ultralight educational experience was discovering exactly what happens when the engine fails. <br/>Pedro turned it off and: nothing! We didn't fall. We stayed right where we were, only now, it was a whole lot quieter. <br/>This truly amazed me. Our trike was behaving as if it were a kite tethered to an invisible rope, 'as idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean.' <br/>I recalled a comment a friend had made about his second hang glider flight in this very place. <br/>The view from an ultralight: mountains and, sadly, forest fires. <br/>'The thermals lifted me up, and there I stayed for over three hours. It was a wonderful experience, and I didn't come down until the sun set.' <br/>My experience was also marvelous, and I believed I was up there for at least half an hour. However, when I came back down to Earth, I was told my flight had lasted only 10 minutes. <br/>Well, those 10 minutes were jam-packed with rich experiences I'll never forget. I highly recommend you give it a try! <br/>As I was preparing to leave, a lot of hang glider pilots were arriving. <br/>Now, the hang glider (delta wing) differs from the trike in that there's no motor. Takeoff and landing depend on the pilot's legs. This means the hang glider flights all start at the top of the sheer cliff that was towering above us. <br/>One of the hang glider pilots I talked to was Mexican photographer and cinematographer Lars Herrmann. I asked him what he found so attractive about this sport. <br/>A young passenger enjoys her birthday present: a flight in a trike. Chris Lloyd <br/>'Hang gliding is about nature,' said Herrmann. 'It has a really strong spiritual side. It's about being up there all by yourself, reading the weather conditions, reading the clouds. <br/>'When you're in a hang glider, everything is beautiful; there's no war when you're up there, no envy. You forget about everything, and you concentrate on the present. You don't worry about your possessions; you only think about flying. Hang gliding is the very best antidote for a midlife crisis.' <br/>A short flight in a trike costs 1,700 pesos and lasts 10 minutes. For 2,300 pesos, you can fly twice as high for 15 minutes. <br/>If you just want to sit and watch the action in the sky above, it won't cost a centavo. <br/>Kordich Air Sports also has a new tandem option: you are in a delta wing with an expert pilot, but instead of jumping off the top of the cliff, a trike tows the two of you, pulling you up to the proper altitude, where \u2014 like Ana Paula Daz, one of only three women who practice hang gliding in Mexico \u2014 you will have a chance to discover that this sport is pura libertad, or unbounded freedom. <br/>In a future story, I hope to describe the tandem delta wing experience. <br/>'Hang gliding is pura libertad: unbounded freedom,' says Ana Paula Daz. <br/>For more info, phone Pedro Kordich (who speaks excellent English) at mobile 331-270-3838 or visit the Kordich Air Facebook page[1]. And if you've been in one of these marvelous machines yourself, by all means, let me (and our readers) know what it was like for you. <br/>The writer has lived near Guadalajara, Jalisco, since 1985.

Forest Protection Bureau and the N.H. Fire Marshal's Office are reminding everyone to avoid behaviors that can contribute to the start and the spread of wildfires.</p><p>The Governor's proclamation issued on September 24 restricting fires and banning smoking in or near woodlands remains in effect until further notice.</p><p>\"It is important to note that even with elevated drought conditions persistent statewide, daily fire danger assessments will continue to fluctuate with changing weather conditions,\" said Chief Steven Sherman, N.H. Forest Protection Bureau. \"This fluctuation which at times could drop to moderate or even low should not be interpreted to mean that the effects of drought on wildfire potential have been eliminated.</p><p>\"Daily fire danger assessments, which the public is most likely to see posted outside of local fire departments, are a rating of the potential for fires to ignite, spread and require suppression action on a given day. The current fire restrictions imposed at the state level must remain in effect to protect the state's citizens and natural resources until the drought conditions improve reducing the threat of wildfire,\" stated Sherman.</p><p>\"The elements that make fall in New Hampshire so enjoyable leaves changing, crisp air and dozens of great outdoor activities unfortunately can all increase the possibility of wildfires,\" said N.H. Fire Marshal Paul Parisi. \"As we all transition to a new season, one thing that doesn't change is that every one of us needs to practice good wildfire prevention habits.\"</p><p>Ninety percent of wildfires in New Hampshire result from human causes.</p><p>The Forest Protection Bureau and the Fire Marshal's Office ask all New Hampshire residents and visitors to make the following adjustments until conditions have improved:</p><p>Consult with your local Forest Fire Warden regarding fire permit requirements, weather conditions and open burning restrictions before kindling a fire;</p><p>Watch for sparks and embers that might be drawn away from your campfire into surrounding grass, leaves or the air;</p><p>Properly dispose of woodstove ash, making sure all materials are completely extinguished and placed in a metal container with a secured lid away from any combustibles;</p><p>Wait until conditions improve and burn permits are being issued before burning any debris from fall yard cleanup;</p><p>Extinguish all smoking materials completely and discard them properly, as the heat from them can start a fire;</p><p>Check with your local fire department before using fireworks;</p><p>Help firefighters by conserving water, including by not watering lawns and gardens, allowing cars to remain unwashed, and refraining from hosing down driveways and sidewalks as well as other uses considered aesthetic.</p><p>In New Hampshire, fire permits are required for all open outdoor burning, which includes campfires and bonfires as well as debris fires that commonly occur in the fall. Statewide burn restrictions remain in effect and municipalities may choose to enact additional restrictions.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123996338</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:610Y-VY01-DYTH-G2M4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"543\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 5, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DS5C</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008X9E</classCode><className>MARSHALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000854</classCode><className>PLANT CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009T9T</classCode><className>SMOKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008XH6</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DS6G</classCode><className>WATER CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DAHT</classCode><className>SMOKING BANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DKUI</classCode><className>WATER RESOURCES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DS5C</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DS6G</classCode><className>WATER CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DAHT</classCode><className>SMOKING BANS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX576</classCode><className>CONCORD, NH, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>GS145</classCode><className>NEW HAMPSHIRE, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Arrow Lodge, where the Queens arrive without invitation in the middle of the night, is something of a haunted house, complete with a scuttling figure Inspector Queen describes as a giant crab and a retainer who could plausibly have been played by Boris Karloff on the tale's first publication in 1933. Dr. John Xavier, a celebrated surgeon who's retired at 45, is clearly engaged in some kind of hush-hush research. But although he's a cordial host to his unexpected guests, he says nothing that first night about the work he and Dr. Percival Holmes are doing, and by morning he's lost his chance, shot to death with half a playing card, the six of spades, clutched in his hand. </p><p>That card and a knave of diamonds found ripped in half in the dead hand of Dr. Xavier's brother, Mark, when he's murdered soon after, are virtually the only clues Ellery has, but he expatiates on their significance so early and often that some readers, though very few of the tiny cast of characters, may forget the much more pressing threat of the fire that's inexorably climbing closer and closer. The result is the most atmospheric of the early cases about and by Queen (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Dutch Shoe Mystery</emphasis>, 1931, etc.) and the one in which the detective's legendary analytical prowess (\"what I am about to say constitutes probably the most fantastic reconstruction of a clue in the history of the so-called 'clever' crime\") is both most impressive and most strained, improbable, and out of place. A pioneering, preposterously far-fetched, but still impressive example of the locked-in-a-cabin whodunit.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Publication Date: </emphasis>2020-02-04</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Publisher: </emphasis>Penzler Publishers</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stage: </emphasis>Adult</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ISBN: </emphasis>978-1-61316-154-8</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Price: </emphasis>$25.95</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Author: </emphasis>Queen, Ellery</h></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KIRKUS-2000199115</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KIRKUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XVN-9CB1-JC8J-R46P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"323\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Kirkus Media LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Kirkus Reviews (Print)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30101\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 1, 2020, Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp; Journals</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZCS</classCode><className>TWINS &amp; MULTIPLE BIRTHS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001566</classCode><className>SHOOTINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001932</classCode><className>CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; CORRECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001182</classCode><className>MURDER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>N621399QC</classCode><className>PHYSICIANS &amp; SURGEONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>N621399QC</classCode><className>PHYSICIANS &amp; SURGEONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS148</classCode><className>NEW YORK, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Apples from both orchards will be sold at the Autumn Harvest site.</p><p>\"This is going to work out great for apple sales and wine,\" Becky Mullane said in a telephone interview with the Leader-Telegram.</p><p>As they take over the winery, the Mullanes look to keep what the McIlquhams have built \u2014 a selection of wines and a destination for people to visit.</p><p>\"We are definitely keeping the Autumn Harvest name,\" Becky Mullane said.</p><p>She does see lots of potential for package deals, events and other ways of using the multiple businesses her family now owns together.</p><p>\"Definitely they work hand-in-hand,\" Becky Mullane said. \"Weddings and wine they go together.\"</p><p>Her family moved to the Chippewa Valley in 2014 after a search for an area that had good conditions for growing apples after their previous orchard in New Mexico was struck by back-to-back natural disasters.</p><p>On June 26, 2011, a forest fire burned its way over a hill and into the valley where Dixon's Apple Orchard stood since 1944 between Albuquerque and Santa Fe. Though some of the apple trees survived and bore fruit, floods followed the fire and made it untenable to continue running the orchard there.</p><p>Becky Mullane, who learned the apple trade from her grandfather who founded Dixon's, looked to her Midwest roots for a new place to grow. While the climate of her hometown of Duluth, Minn., was too cold, she found the Chippewa Valley had good soil, fair weather and plenty of groundwater needed to grow apples.</p><p>Their 6-year-old Cadott orchard produces Honeycrisp, Zestar, McIntosh and Champagne apples.

Juvenile Detention Center prudently battles pandemic</p><p>Regarding Tony Messenger's column \"Outbreak of COVID-19 infects juveniles, staff at St. Louis County detention facility\" (April 30): The juvenile was tested for the novel coronavirus on April 20, 2020. The results came back positive on April 21. The juvenile's parents were notified immediately, as were Juvenile Detention Center staff. All courthouse employees were notified the next morning, April 22.</p><p>We have been in constant communication with the County Department of Public Health. We are following their protocols to limit the spread of the virus in our Juvenile Detention Center and throughout our courthouse.</p><p>At the court's request, the Department of Public Health tested all juveniles in detention for the virus on April 27. The results came back two days later. Judge Michael Burton notified all staff immediately. Despite the fact that all juveniles who tested positive last week were asymptomatic, the Department of Public Health monitored them several times a day.</p><p>The two staff members who tested positive have not been at the detention center since April 19. They are quarantined at home. There are no other positive results at this time.</p><p>We continue to carefully monitor the health of our employees and juveniles in the detention center. We continue to follow the protocols recommended by the Department of Public Health to prevent the spread of the virus, including a hospital grade sanitation of the facilities on a regular basis, restricting access to the building, providing personal protective equipment for staff, requiring all youth to wear masks, and quarantining new residents upon arrival.</p><p>The health and safety of our youth and employees are always a top priority of the court.</p><p>Christine A. Bertelson - Clayton</p><p>Director of Strategic Communications</p><p>St. Louis County Courts/21st Judicial Circuit</p><p>Meatpackers and lawmakers should be treated equally</p><p>Regarding \"Despite Trump executive order, meat-processing plants struggle to stay open\" (May 1) and \"Worried about virus US House won't return- for now\" (April 29): In the first article, President Donald Trump is forcing workers to go into meatpacking plants. Twenty workers have already died in these plants. It is estimated that 6,500 are sick or have been exposed to the virus while working near someone who has tested positive. In the second article, House Democratic leaders shelved plans to return to work on the next virus aid package. This was based upon the Capitol physician's warning that the public health danger was too great. The lawmakers vigorously objected to the meeting schedule, so they are not going to work.</p><p>What in the world is wrong with our country? How can Americans be treated so differently? No wonder the general public has such a low opinion of politicians and feels like the system is stacked against them. It is.</p><p>Is a worker's life in a meatpacking plant worth less than politicians' lives in Washington? What happened to \"all men are created equal\"?</p><p>John Davis - St. Charles</p><p>Nurses and health care workers deserve our gratitude</p><p>Regarding \"On the front lines: How three St. Louis health care workers are helping fight coronavirus\" (May 3): With all the anxiety and uncertainty that has come with the pandemic, our new normal has also brought on a newfound appreciation for our area health care workers, who are putting themselves on the front line to protect and treat those in our community.</p><p>It is only fitting that during National Nurses Week this week, we take the time to thank our local nurses, doctors and health care professionals. These individuals are working tirelessly and sacrificing so much to help ensure our health and safety.</p><p>As a registered nurse and program mentor helping to train future nurses, I have seen firsthand how much time, effort and patience it takes to be in this profession. These last few months have only emphasized the courage and compassion these professionals possess. To those out there who are looking for ways to give back and contribute to the fight against the coronavirus, start this week by showing your support to your local heroes. In this time of crisis, the least we can do is reach out and express our gratitude in any way possible.</p><p>Janine Lange, R.N. - Imperial</p><p>Parson's reopening now is a crime against Missourians</p><p>As Gov. Mike Parson opens Missouri, I'm concerned about several things. First, if a business decides to open, what happens to the employees who are at risk? Will they lose their unemployment compensation? It seems they will because many will have to refuse work. I also don't understand why we are reopening when there is insufficient testing and when cases aren't even expected to peak until the latter part of May. Let's make a comparison.</p><p>How to fight a forest fire: 1. Clear an area to create a fire break (quarantine). 2. Put out hot spots (treat). 3. Make sure all hot spots are out (test and trace). 4. Allow people to go back to the former hot zone in on a limited basis, but carefully monitor for new hot spots and put them out immediately.</p><p>How not to fight a forest fire: 1. Put out some of the fire, but allow people back in.</p><p>I believe the governor's decision to reopen is reckless and will result in multiple deaths - basically crimes against Missouri citizens and all bordering states. Let's get sufficient testing and wait to reopen so we don't have to shut down again within a few weeks. It's the wise thing to do. Recent polls show that 70% of the public wants to remain shut down.</p><p>Karen Clark - Lake Saint Louis</p><p>Read more letters online</p><p>at STLToday.com/letters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SLPD-1003484830</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SLPD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64JK-J4G1-DY37-338X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11810</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1005\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Inc.

Corporate Update</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TORONTO, Aug.  26, 2021  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sparton Resources Inc. (TSXV: SRI) (\"Sparton\"\u00a0or the\u00a0\"Company\") reported today that it has raised approximately $600,000 in new capital through the exercise of outstanding warrants and incentive stock options. Ninety-five percent (95%) of the outstanding warrants from the 2020 Company financing (see Sparton news release dated August 3rd, 2020) were exercised, as well as seventy-four (74%) percent of the outstanding incentive stock options. Funds will be used to support Company exploration programs, retire a portion of corporate debt and for general corporate purposes.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Exploration Update</p><p>Exploration programs have continued during this field season despite local Covid restrictions, manpower shortages and forest fire work bans in certain areas. At Bruell in Quebec, Eldorado Gold has completed mapping and soil geochemical surveys over the entire property and is in the process of compiling all of the results. Depending on equipment availability, drilling is planned for this coming fall.</p><p>At the Oakes and Matachewan Area precious metal and copper properties a surface trenching program has been laid out in the field and is expected to begin shortly, when local contractor equipment is available. In addition, initial planning is underway for a possible three-dimensional IP (Induced Polarization) survey covering part of the Oakes area using the 3D Distributed Array System. This IP method reduces the necessity for line cutting on the property and will be used to interpret targets in conjunction with the detailed magnetic survey completed last season.</p><p>VRB Energy</p><p>VRB Energy continues working on final certification of its advanced Gen3 flow battery system and negotiations for new contracts. The initial 100Mh phase of the Hubei \u201cGiga factory\u201d project has begun with cell stack manufacturing underway at VRB Energy\u2019s Beijing area factory. We anticipate a series of major announcements relating to program developments over the coming months.</p><p>Dr. Mynyr Hoxa Joins Advisory Board</p><p>Sparton is delighted to welcome Dr. Mynyr Hoxa to its Technical Advisory Board. Dr. Hoxha is a Professional Geoscientist with more than 30 years of mining and exploration industry experience. In 2004, he joined FNX Mining as Senior Geologist and in 2008 was promoted to Chief Geologist. Since 2015, he served as Chief Geologist at the Young Davidson Gold Mine, for Alamos Gold. The Young Davidson Mine is located less than 3 km from Sparton\u2019s Oakes Property. Dr. Hoxha\u2019s experience at Young Davidson will be very valuable to the Company in its work in the Matachewan area. He is very familiar with Sparton\u2019s past work at the Oakes property and understands the geologic controls on mineralization in the area. He has a wealth of relevant experience and a noteworthy track record of base and precious metal discoveries in this region.</p><p>Edcor Drilling Services - New Contracts</p><p>The Company\u2019s subsidiary, Edcor Drilling, a diamond core drilling service organization, has recently executed contracts for 3,000 meters of new work and is expected to contribute revenue to Sparton in the coming months. Several other contacts are under negotiation and Edcor is expected to be operational at least through year end. Currently the drilling industry is confronted with a major shortage of skilled workers and equipment and the demand has created new opportunities.</p><p>New Stock Options </p><p>The Sparton board has approved effective August 24th, 2021, the issuance of a total of 2,700,000 incentive stock options priced at $0.10 per common share, to its directors, advisors, consultants, and officers. Thirty percent (30%) of the options will vest immediately, 30% will vest on August 24th, 2022, and 40% will vest on August 24th, 2023.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>\u201cThe Company wishes to thank its stakeholders for their support in exercising the warrants from the 2020 financing as well as the exercise of most of the outstanding stock options. Sparton is looking forward to positive developments on all fronts in the coming months,\" stated Lee Barker, Company CEO.</p><p>For more information contact:</p><p>A. Lee Barker, M.A. Sc., P.

When wildfires burn forests and grasslands, biomass-burning aerosols are produced, forming smoke clouds. The composition, size, and mixing state of biomass-burning aerosols determine the optical properties of the smoke plumes in the atmosphere, and those properties determine how much the smoke clouds absorb and scatter the solar radiation. </p><p>For the new study, published in Nature Communications[1], researchers compared climate models' predictions to large amounts of wildfire data collected in field sites around the world as well in laboratory experiments, and they found major differences. 'We collected field data from across the globe, and we found that the models make a lot of assumptions about the physical and optical properties of the biomass-burning[2] aerosols, and those assumptions were not accurate,' says corresponding author Xiaohong Liu, professor in the atmospheric sciences department at Texas A&amp;#38;M University. Climate models such as those examined in the study are used to create important climate change reports, such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment that is published about every seven years, he says. 'In this study we evaluate the climate models used in the IPCC assessment, and we found out that these models assume biomass-burning smoke is more light-absorbing than our data actually shows,' Liu says. 'Our study shows that biomass-burning has a more net-cooling effect than previously thought.' 'We found that many of the most advanced climate models simulate biomass-burning aerosols or smoke that is darker, or more light absorbing, than what we see in observations,' says lead author Hunter Brown, who recently received his PhD from the University of Wyoming and who recently joined Liu at Texas A&amp;#38;M. 'This has implications for the climate predictions[3] made by these models.' Observations and models used in the study covered a wide temporal range. Researchers chose Africa, South America, and Southeastern Asia, in addition to boreal fire regions, because these are the largest contributors to biomass-burning smoke emissions in the world, Brown says. These biomass-burning aerosols are extremely complicated, Liu says. The complexity involves the aerosols' physical and chemical properties, determined by the fire's burning conditions and the fuel types such as dry grasslands or forests. 'The smoke is very complicated North American forest fire smoke is very different than Australian bush fire smoke, because of the different types of fuel and burning conditions,' he says. 'They can produce darker or brighter smoke, and the chemical evolution of the smoke in the atmosphere can be very complicated.' Liu directed this research, which involved both modelers and observationalists around the world. The team used the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)-Wyoming Supercomputing Center for data processing and model sensitivity simulations. The team incorporated its findings into the NCAR climate model, and found that the modifications improved the models' accuracy in predicting wildfires' effects on climate. 'Now we have a better understanding of the properties of these biomass-burning aerosols, so that now then we can improve the models[4] and improve predictions,' Liu says.

But a century later, wildfires like this summer's Greenwood blaze continue to threaten the North Woods. Elsewhere, fire-prone areas like California have seen historically large infernos in recent years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Duluthian Tim Larson wondered whether the devastation from a century ago could repeat. It's been on his mind since reading \"Minnesota, 1918: When Flu, Fire, and War Ravaged the State\" by Star Tribune reporter Curt Brown.</p><p>\"A hundred years later, we have had another pandemic as well as some [major] fires,\" Larson said. He sought answers from Curious Minnesota, the Star Tribune's community reporting project fueled by great reader questions.</p><p>Because Minnesota's ecosystem of boreal forests and prairie grasslands relies on occasional fires to remain healthy, it also makes them prone to large wildfires. But forestry and wildfire experts said reformed logging practices, the modern landscape of rural Minnesota and better fire response help prevent the devastation of a century ago from happening again.</p><p>Cities erased by fire</p><p>The Hinckley fire of 1894 and the Moose Lake-Cloquet fires of 1918 together burned more than 2,000 square miles - about 1.3 million acres. They killed more than 900 people, most of whom had no warning.</p><p>Only 2 inches of rain fell in central Minnesota the summer of the Hinckley fire. On Sept. 1, 1894, high winds turned a typical forest fire into a moving firestorm that consumed the 1,200-person logging town and surrounding areas.</p><p>Trains could barely keep ahead of the inferno. At least 418 people died, but a few survived by hunkering down in lakes and wells or a gravel pit. The death toll does not include many Native Americans who were living in the area, according to the Hinckley Fire Museum.</p><p>The 1918 fires, which swept violently from Moose Lake to Duluth over three days, killed at least 453 people as many tried to flee on foot, horse and buggy, train or car. In Moose Lake, dozens who tried driving to escape the 65-mile-per-hour blaze died when smoke obscured a curve in a road.</p><p>More than 40 towns or villages were damaged or destroyed. The city of Cloquet, population 9,000, was \"all but wiped out,\" according to an account in the Tribune. Moose Lake was \"a waste of ashes.\"</p><p>The 1894 and 1918 fires both began in the late summer or early fall during periods of low humidity, strong winds and high temperatures; perfect conditions to brew a raging inferno.</p><p>Those conditions easily exist today, especially with a changing climate, said Allissa Reynolds, acting wildfire prevention supervisor for the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.</p><p>\"The big difference back then is these [historical] fires followed the logging boom where 'slash' was left in the woods,\" she said, referring to the tops, limbs and branches that loggers once abandoned on the forest floor.</p><p>Trees also weren't replanted by timber barons, who quickly harvested lumber to \"build the great cities of the Midwest,\" said John DuPlissis, silviculture research program manager at the University of Minnesota Duluth's Natural Resources Research Institute.</p><p>When a coal-burning rail car sparked the 1918 fire, that forest slash helped the fire grow rapidly as it merged with other fires and ravaged northeastern Minnesota.</p><p>Practices began to change in the 1920s, and logging companies today make use of entire trees. Now the bigger worry is drought and large stands of trees killed off by spruce budworm and emerald ash borer.</p><p>\"That stuff burns very easily,\" DuPlissis said. All it takes is a tossed cigarette butt or errant firework to spark a wildfire, he added.</p><p>Modern fire response</p><p>Kyle Gill, forest manager and research coordinator of the Cloquet Forestry Center, said that rural population centers today have fragmented forests, major openings in woodland areas for power lines, roads and buildings, as well as less fuel lying around. Those factors inhibit fires from growing hot enough to create their own weather and jump open spaces.</p><p>The same is not true for areas like the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, a portion of which saw severe fire damage this summer. It's also why California and other Western states experience such enormous fires: greater expanses of land with no breaks in flammable brush and dead trees (and the added problem of no monthslong snowpack).</p><p>But modern technology also helps reduce the likelihood of fires raging out of control.</p><p>Fire response and community notification is faster. Fire towers and lookouts have been replaced by aircraft, satellites and cellphones. Planes, too, help extinguish aggressive fires more quickly by dropping water or fire retardant in hard-to-reach places. Fire response now comes from a variety of agencies, including national, state and local entities.</p><p>Weather, including wind speed, is also monitored regularly for indicators of potential fire, and crews know what kind of vegetation will ignite and how quickly.</p><p>Ultimately, people play the largest part in reducing devastation. Roads and housing - if properly maintained - can work to block advancing wildfires. Keeping trees 30 or more feet from structures, reducing brush and maintaining cut and watered grass can all prevent property loss.</p><p>Heeding burning restrictions on campfires is critical, said Reynolds of the DNR.</p><p>\"We, as humans, cause 98% of wildfires in Minnesota,\" Reynolds said. Lightning, by comparison, causes only 2%.</p><p>Jana Hollingsworth \u00b7 218-508-2450</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRIB-MERLIN64575485</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRIB2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67D8-NF61-JC8F-K49S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8384</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-01-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"935\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Star Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN)</publicationName><edition>METRO EDITION</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"10\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>October 3, 2021 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>FIRE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>HISTORY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>MINNESOTA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>DISASTER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>DEATH</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Canoes</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjZFNUYxOUY5M0I1NEE3NUE1RjY2RjhBNjdDNjU3NkY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUJGMzIwOUU1NUY0NDU3MzhFRjhFRkMxQzgxOEI3MEY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

MCV1 coverage has been stagnant globally for more than a decade at between 84 and 85 per cent, while MCV2 coverage has been steadily increasing but is still only at 71 percent.</p><p>Natasha Crowcroft, senior technical advisor on measles and rubella at the WHO, said that the good news was that measles vaccinations had saved more than 25.5 million lives globally since 2000. But the low vaccine coverage meant the number of unprotected children was growing every year.</p><p>Stalled coverage</p><p>\"The big issue is not actually large holes in coverage, it's the stalling in coverage\", Dr. Crowcroft told a news conference in Geneva.</p><p>\"It's a bit like, you know, tinder for a forest fire, it reaches a point where an outbreak really takes off. And that's what we saw in 2019, with the almost explosive outbreaks in areas that have had inadequate coverage over many years\", Dr. Crowcroft said.</p><p>\"If you have coverage around about that 80 per cent level, then you get the sense that things are going okay, but they're not really, and eventually you see these large outbreaks.\"</p><p>Vaccine hesitancy</p><p>Weak health systems and the inability to reach children were the main problem globally, and vaccine hesitancy was an additional problem in some countries, she said.</p><p>Last week UNICEF and WHO issued a joint call to action to avert major measles and polio epidemics, calling for an additional $255 million over the next three years to address dangerous measles immunity gaps in the 45 countries at the highest risk of an imminent outbreak.</p><p>Countries that have recently suffered large measles outbreaks include the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Madagascar, Central African Republic (CAR), Georgia, Kazakhstan, North Macedonia, Samoa, Tonga, and Ukraine, Dr. Crowcroft said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124077140</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:618V-GPD1-JCBF-S0GR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"517\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"11\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>November 12, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This modality recognizes the efforts made by countries like Costa Rica to respond to the climate crisis and provides funds so that they can continue successful public policies.</p><p>The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the REDD+ Secretariat supported Costa Rica to develop and present the proposal to the GCF, which asked to recognize 14.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide captured in that period through the country's forests.</p><p>The funds will directly benefit thousands of Costa Ricans through three mechanisms, to be executed over the next five years (2021-2026) through the Ministry of Environment and Energy (known as MINAE): strengthen the existing Payment for Environmental Services (PES) scheme; Expand the PES scheme in indigenous territories, and strengthen forest fire prevention measures in rural communities through the National System of Conservation Areas (known as SINAC).The national PES program will be an important mechanism to transfer needed cash resources directly to impoverished groups to support the COVID-19 recovery phase.</p><p>\"The protection of the environment becomes a source of wealth that improves the quality of life of the people of our country, it benefits the generation of jobs in the communities and that it takes us at a good pace towards our goal of being a decarbonized country by 2050\", said Carlos Alvarado, President of Costa Rica when reiterating the commitment of the country to continue working for climate action.</p><p>After decades of continuous forest loss, Costa Rica managed to halt and reverse the rate of deforestation in the 1980s, in part thanks to the support of successful programs such as the PSE. Today, thanks to the implementation of public policies and actions aimed at recognizing the importance of forests, it has a forest coverage of about 52%, protects more than a quarter of its territory, and is home to 6% of the biodiversity of the planet.</p><p>\"Once again, Costa Rica shows the world that environmental sustainability is economically viable and socially inclusive. It fills us with joy to be able to support the mobilization of important resources and thus move forward on the path of decoupling the financing of environmental protection from those fiscal revenues that come from carbon consumption\" said Jose Vicente Troya Rodriguez, UNDP Resident Representative in Costa Rica.</p><p>UNDP is working with governments, civil society, and the private sector to develop recovery plans for COVID-19 that embrace renewable energy, sustainable business, green urban planning, and nature-based jobs and livelihoods. This is crucial not only to protect ecosystems and biodiversity and restore nature but it will also bring other concrete benefits including the creation of new green jobs and reductions in inequalities while fostering more resilient communities.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7292718 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7292718</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:618G-5Y11-JC11-1429-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"578\"/><timeReceived>8:40 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"11\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>November 11, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The composition, size and mixing state of biomass-burning aerosols determine the optical properties of the smoke plumes in the atmosphere, and those properties determine how much the smoke clouds absorb and scatter the solar radiation. The researchers compared climate models' predictions to large amounts of wildfire data collected in field sites around the world as well in laboratory experiments, and they found major differences.</p><p>\"We collected field data from across the globe, and we found that the models make a lot of assumptions about the physical and optical properties of the biomass-burning aerosols, and those assumptions were not accurate,\" Liu said.</p><p>Climate models such as those examined in this study are used to create important climate change reports, such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment that is published about every seven years, he said.</p><p>\"In this study we evaluate the climate models used in the IPCC assessment, and we found out that these models assume biomass-burning smoke is more light-absorbing than our data actually shows,\" Liu said. \"Our study shows that biomass-burning has a more net-cooling effect than previously thought.\"</p><p>The study was led by Hunter Brown, who recently received his Ph.D. from the University of Wyoming and was advised by Liu during his time as a professor at Wyoming from 2013-2019. Brown recently joined Liu's team at Texas AandM as a postdoctoral researcher to continue his research on biomass-burning aerosols.</p><p>\"We found that many of the most advanced climate models simulate biomass-burning aerosols or smoke that is darker, or more light absorbing, than what we see in observations,\" Brown said. \"This has implications for the climate predictions made by these models.\"</p><p>Observations and models used in the study covered a wide temporal range. Africa, South America and Southeastern Asia, in addition to boreal fire regions, were chosen because these are the largest contributors to biomass-burning smoke emissions in the world, Brown said.</p><p>These biomass-burning aerosols are extremely complicated, Liu said. The complexity involves the aerosols' physical and chemical properties, which are determined by the fire's burning conditions and the fuel types such as dry grasslands or forests.</p><p>\"The smoke is very complicated North American forest fire smoke is very different than Australian bush fire smoke, because of the different types of fuel and burning conditions,\" he said. \"They can produce darker or brighter smoke, and the chemical evolution of the smoke in the atmosphere can be very complicated.\"</p><p>Liu directed this research, which involved both modelers and observationalists around the world. The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)-Wyoming Supercomputing Center was used for data processing and model sensitivity simulations.</p><p>\"Now we have a better understanding of the properties of these biomass-burning aerosols, so that now then we can improve the models and improve predictions,\" Liu said.</p><p>The team incorporated its findings into the NCAR climate model, and found that the modifications improved the models' accuracy in predicting wildfires' effects on climate.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124219889</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61VX-S631-DYTH-G38M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-01-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"652\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"01\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>January 26, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

(AP) \u2014 Arkansas on Tuesday ran out of intensive care unit beds for COVID-19 patients for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic began, Gov. Asa Hutchinson announced, as a surge in cases continued overwhelming hospitals in the state.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The state's ICU capacity for COVID patients barely eased hours after Hutchinson's announcement, with only one hospital in southeast Arkansas showing availability, according to the state's system for coordinating coronavirus patients. Virus patients make up about half of the state's ICU beds. The number of virus patients in ICUs and on ventilators reached a new high in the state on Monday.</p><p>\u201cEveryone should know the strain this puts on our hospitals and the need to get our vaccinations and how critical our bed space is,\" Hutchinson told reporters at a news conference.</p><p>Hutchinson said hospitals in the state were working to open more ICU beds for virus patients. Arkansas Department of Health Chief of Staff Renee Mallory said one hospital planned to open additional beds later Tuesday and possibly later in the week. The Department of Health on Tuesday said the state's total available ICU beds dropped by four to 18.</p><p>\u201cFor us, it is much more difficult to coordinate these transfer requests,\" said Jeff Tabor, program manager for Arkansas COVIDComm, the state's system for matching COVID-19 patients with hospitals. \u201cThe patients during the summer surge are so much sicker than during the winter surge.\"</p><p>Arkansas ranks fifth in the country for new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers. Arkansas has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, with 40% of the state's population fully vaccinated.</p><p>The state on Tuesday reported more than 2,200 new virus cases and 45 new COVID-19 deaths. The state reported 10,950 additional doses of the vaccine have been given. The number of COVID-19 patients overall in the state dropped by 44 to 1,367.</p><p>Dr. Jose Romero, the state's health secretary, said the surge in cases is continuing to keep the state's ICU capacity tight.</p><p>\u201cThe more beds we open up, the more they\u2019re going to get filled,\u201d Romero told reporters.</p><p>Baptist Health planned to open 18 additional ICU beds, 15 of them for COVID-19 patients, at its hospitals in Fort Smith and North Little Rock. Greg Crain, president of Baptist's metro region, said it hoped to open the beds in Fort Smith on Friday and in North Little Rock on Aug. 31.</p><p>In a <url normalizedValue=\"https://publichealth.uams.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/08/UAMS-COPH-COVID-Report-august2021-final.pdf\">report issued earlier Tuesday</url>, public health researchers forecast that the state's death toll from COVID-19 will exceed 7,000 by Aug. 30. Arkansas on Tuesday reported 6,749 people have died from the virus since the pandemic began.</p><p>\u201cIf this forecast holds true, COVID-19 will have killed more Arkansans than all the wars in the 20th and 21st centuries,\u201d the forecast by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences' Fay W. Boozman College of Public Health said.</p><p>The researchers' forecast also predicted the number of children hospitalized due to COVID-19 will increase by 20% through Aug. 30 and 34% through Sept. 14.</p><p>\u201cHospitalizations and patients requiring intensive cases have reached record numbers and put our hospital system in a precarious position,\" the report said. The report's cover featured a photo of a forest fire, a reference to how UAMS researchers <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/science-health-education-forests-arkansas-3b1adb89c919596f4a763140b1fe0b13\">have described the state's surge in cases and hospitalizations</url>.</p><p>The state Health Department on Tuesday also issued an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.healthy.arkansas.gov/images/uploads/pdf/Ivermectin_Notice_8.24.21.pdf\">advisory</url> warning people to not use livestock medicine to try and treat COVID-19. The advisory follows an uptick in calls to the Arkansas Poison Control Center about people taking ivermectin intended for animal or livestock use.</p><p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved ivermectin in both people and animals for some parasitic worms and for head lice and skin conditions. It has not approved its use in treating or preventing COVID-19 in humans. Some Arkansas Republican lawmakers have touted the drug as a potential treatment for COVID-19.</p><p>The advisory warns that the veterinary formulation of the drug can be highly toxic in humans. Some symptoms associated with ivermectin toxicity are rash, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, neurological disorders and potentially severe hepatitis requiring hospitalization.</p><p>Mississippi's health department this week issued <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-coronavirus-pandemic-69c5f6d4476ca9b25bc7038e99a4a075\">a similar warning</url> about ivermectin's use.</p><p>Also Tuesday, a group of parents filed a lawsuit challenging an Arkansas school district's decision to require masks following <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-arkansas-coronavirus-pandemic-d79a14a84f0c7ba3bd6d8b3cf4039404\">a judge's ruling blocking the state's mask mandate ban</url>.</p><p>The lawsuit against the Cabot School District argues the local school board did not have the authority to impose the requirement. <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-arkansas-coronavirus-pandemic-09507dda1470461cc36dbeb834455d2a\">A similar lawsuit was filed against a northwest Arkansas school district last week</url>.</p><p>More than 100 public school districts and charter schools have approved mask requirements after a judge issued a preliminary inunction against the state law banning mask mandates by government entities. The requirements cover more than half of the state's public school students.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

However, on Saturday evening, the agency reversed course. Hourlong rolling outages were reported up and down the state, including across San Diego County.</p><p>California ISO ordered the first rolling outages in nearly 20 years on Friday when it directed utilities around the state to shed their power loads. The state's three biggest utilities - Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, Southern California Edison and SDG&amp;E - turned off power to more than 410,000 homes and businesses for about an hour at a time until the emergency declaration ended 3 1/2 hours later.</p><p>The power grid is mostly stressed during the late afternoon and early evening because of higher demand and solar energy production falling.</p><p>The heat wave has brought brutally high temperatures, increasing wildfire danger Saturday.</p><p>Records were set up and down the state, including in Lake Elsinore, where the mercury hit 114; Riverside at 109 and Gilroy at 108, according to the National Weather Service.</p><p>In San Diego County, the high was in Borrego Springs, which hit 118, breaking a record of 117 set in 2015. Records were also broken in Alpine, where the temperature reached 102. That broke the standing record of 101 for Aug. 15, set in 2015. Campo reached 108, breaking the record of 106, also set in 2015. And Lake Cuyamaca reached 96, tying the record set in 1967.</p><p>The scorching temperatures are a concern for firefighters battling blazes that have destroyed several homes and erupted near rural and urban foothill neighborhoods, driving through tinder-dry brush.</p><p>Firefighters were working to contain wildfires near Los Angeles on Saturday. A huge forest fire that prompted evacuations north of Los Angeles flared up around noon, sending up a cloud of smoke as it headed toward thick, dry brush in the Angeles National Forest. The Lake fire was just 12 percent contained Saturday, and after threatening more than 5,400 homes, it had charred more than 23 square miles of brush and trees. Fire officials said 21 buildings had been destroyed, including at least five homes.</p><p>The Ranch 2 fire burning in the Angeles National Forest above Azusa was at 1,400 acres and 3 percent contained as of Saturday morning, officials estimated.

Although it was burning into forest land, evacuation orders remained in effect for the western Antelope Valley because erratic winds in the forecast could push the fire toward homes, fire spokesman Jake Miller said.</p><p>Fire crews managed to stop the fire's movement down to the desert floor when it flared up Friday afternoon. In one dramatic moment, several firefighters ran to safety when a longhorn bull that was apparently escaping the blaze charged at them.</p><p>The Lake Fire was just 12% contained as of Saturday morning, and after threatening more than 5,400 homes, it had charred more than 23 square miles (59.5 square kilometers) of brush and trees. Fire officials said 21 buildings had been destroyed, including at least five homes.</p><p>Firefighters were struggling in steep, rugged terrain amid scorching temperatures. The National Weather Service warned temperatures could hit 111 degrees (44 Celsius) in the Antelope Valley Saturday, and winds gusting 15-20 mph (24-32 kph) was expected later in the afternoon.</p><p>\u201cIn addition to that, we have a very unstable air mass over the Lake Fire that\u2019s going to allow for a pyrocumulus (cloud) development later today so that will create extreme fire behavior,\u201d meteorologist Matt Mehle said.</p><p>Record-breaking heat is possible through the weekend, with triple-digit temperatures and unhealthy air predicted for many parts of the state. There also was a chance of isolated thunderstorms worsening the fire threat by creating dry lightning and strong downdrafts, fire officials said</p><p>There was no containment of a blaze that blackened foothills above the Los Angeles suburb of Azusa. It churned through 2.3 square miles (5.96 square kilometers) of brush on Thursday and was moving away from homes.

Although it was burning into forest land, evacuation orders remained in effect for the western Antelope Valley because erratic winds in the forecast could push the fire toward homes, fire spokesman Jake Miller said.</p><p>Fire crews managed to stop the fire's movement down to the desert floor when it flared up Friday afternoon. In one dramatic moment, several firefighters ran to safety when a longhorn bull that was apparently escaping the blaze charged at them.</p><p>The Lake Fire was just 12% contained as of Saturday morning, and after threatening more than 5,400 homes, it had charred more than 23 square miles (59.5 square kilometers) of brush and trees. Fire officials said 21 buildings had been destroyed, including at least five homes.</p><p>Firefighters were struggling in steep, rugged terrain amid scorching temperatures. The National Weather Service warned temperatures could hit 111 degrees (44 Celsius) in the Antelope Valley Saturday, and winds gusting 15-20 mph (24-32 kph) was expected later in the afternoon.</p><p>\u201cIn addition to that, we have a very unstable air mass over the Lake Fire that\u2019s going to allow for a pyrocumulus (cloud) development later today so that will create extreme fire behavior,\u201d meteorologist Matt Mehle said.</p><p>Record-breaking heat is possible through the weekend, with triple-digit temperatures and unhealthy air predicted for many parts of the state. There also was a chance of isolated thunderstorms worsening the fire threat by creating dry lightning and strong downdrafts, fire officials said</p><p>There was no containment of a blaze that blackened foothills above the Los Angeles suburb of Azusa. It churned through 2.3 square miles (5.96 square kilometers) of brush on Thursday and was moving away from homes. Evacuation orders issued to residents were lifted early Friday.</p><p>Azusa police said they were looking for a homeless man suspected of starting the fire.

ALL IN with Chris Hayes starts now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALI VELSHI, MSNBC HOST (voiceover): Tonight, on ALL IN.</p><p>JUSTIN JONES (D-TN), STATE REPRESENTATIVE: We continue to show up in the people`s house. Power to the people.</p><p>VELSHI: With one expelled lawmaker returned to his position and another on his way, tonight, how the anti-democratic movement thrives in state houses across the country. Then --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: President Trump, will you come and speak to us? President Trump?</p><p>VELSHI: As the Manhattan D.A. sues Jim Jordan and House Republicans for trying to obstruct the prosecution of Donald Trump. Rebecca Traister on what the focus on Trump`s arrest may be costing us. Plus --</p><p>CRAIG GREENBERG, MAYOR OF LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY: Under current Kentucky law, the assault rifle that was used to murder five of our neighbors and shoot at rescuing police officers will one day be auctioned off. Think about that.</p><p>VELSHI: As Kentucky searches for answers in the wake of a mass murderer, the governor of one state that`s about to sign an assault weapons ban joins me live when ALL IN starts right now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VELSHI (on camera): Good evening from New York. I`m Ali Velshi in for Chris Hayes. We`re watching the continuing fallout from the aggressive anti- democratic power played by Republicans in the Tennessee State House. Now, tomorrow, a local board of commissioners in Memphis which is in Shelby County is expected to vote on whether to reinstate Justin Pearson who`s one of two Black Democratic lawmakers expelled by Republicans over decorum violations, stemming from a gun reform protest that they held at the state capitol after a mass school shooting in Tennessee.</p><p>As we covered on the show, the other expelled lawmaker, Justin Jones, made his triumphant return to the State House yesterday after a local council in Nashville, the county he`s from voted unanimously to return him to fill the vacancy left by his own expulsion. Now, this particular ploy by the legislature was so egregious, a Republican supermajority wielding its power to remove two democratically elected lawmakers on trivial charges, that it got national attention and backfired.</p><p>A new poll out today shows that a majority of Tennessee residents think the expulsions were wrong and Tennessee is a very Republican state. It doesn`t have a single statewide elected Democrat. But because this scheme in Tennessee was so brazen, and because voters who care about democracy mobilized so quickly, it was able to become a national story practically overnight, even amid a very busy news cycle. And because that mobilization was so quick, Representative Justin Jones didn`t even miss a day of work. He was expelled and reinstated over the course of one weekend.</p><p>And while what happened in Tennessee is particularly notable, it`s far from the only example of conservative legislatures working quietly to roll democracy back. Just ask Justin Jones.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONES: This is a historic day for Tennessee, but it is -- it may mark a very dark day for Tennessee, because it was signaled to the nation that there is no democracy in this state. It will signal to the nation that if it can happen here in Tennessee, it`s coming to your state next. And that is why the nation is watching us what we do here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VELSHI: There`s no other way to put it. Authoritarianism is ascendant in the Republican Party, and state legislatures are leading that charge. In Montana, State Republicans are trying to change how the elections are run, but only for the 2024 Senate race. They`re trying to switch that race in particular to a two -- to a top two primary system which would effectively block any third party candidates from the ballot. It`s all part of a scheme to defeat the popular incumbent Democratic Senator Jon Tester.</p><p>Republicans think he benefits from the current system which allows third- party candidates to siphon votes from their nominees. And Montana has taken quite a few steps recently to rollback democratic norms. In 2021, the Republican state legislature tried to end the statewide elections of Supreme Court justices and instead have those justices elected by district, which of course means the legislature could gerrymander the map and supportive conservatives the same year they also successfully changed the state`s voter ID law to ban the use of student IDs from Montana colleges, making it that much more difficult for young people to participate in local democracy. According to one Republican legislator, her party changed the rules because, \"college students tend to be liberal.\" I love when they say the quiet parts out loud.</p><p>[20:05:28]</p><p>In Wisconsin, Republicans are already threatening to impeach a liberal state supreme court justice who won last week by 11 points because they are worried that she will help overturn the state`s abortion ban as well as their draconian worst-in-the-nation gerrymander. Those partisan voting maps are of course in and of themselves inherently anti-democratic, while Wisconsin is essentially evenly split 50-50 between the two parties in terms of voters. Republicans have been able to rig themselves a near permanent supermajority in the state legislature. In North Carolina, Republicans managed to convince a Democrat in a blue district to switch parties so they can achieve a supermajority and override the two-term Democratic governor`s veto power.</p><p>And these are just a handful of examples. There are so, so many more. Maybe you know about some of these, maybe you didn`t. If you did, it may be because you live in one of those states that I`ve just talked about, or you heard or read about it in the national media. But some of these stories go underreported, because local news has been on the decline for years, slowly bled to death by a lack of funding, or rated for parts by venture capitalists.</p><p>A lot of this stuff just flies under the radar. We all know when Marjorie Taylor-Greene or Matt Gaetz say something ridiculous and offensive because Capitol Hill is full of reporters. But what about when a Florida House Republican compares trans folks to mutants and demons like a representative named Webster Barnaby did just yesterday?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WEBSTER BARNABY (R-FL), STATE REPRESENTATIVE: To all the folks that are in the audience that consider themselves gender dysphoria, says -- I don`t know what all that means. I really don`t know what all that means. I`m looking at society today and it`s like I`m watching an X-Men movie. It`s like we have mutants living among us on planet Earth.</p><p>The Lord rebuke you, Satan, and all of your demons and all of your imps are coming parade before us. That`s right. I called you demons and imps.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VELSHI: That`s some crazy stuff right there. But that kind of rhetoric is all over the place within the state Republican Parties. Nearly every troubling trend and the creeping threat of right-wing authoritarianism in this country is spearheaded in Republican-led state houses. They get the least amount of attention both from the media and from the voters, but the fight to save democracy will have to start at the state and local level.</p><p>Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett is a Democrat of Texas who previously served as a state lawmaker in the Texas House. Ben Wikler is the chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, played a major role in securing a victory for Democrats in that state Supreme Court election last week. Both join me now. Thanks for being here.</p><p>Congressman Crockett, good to see you. You`re OG on this -- on this topic, you and your fellow Texas state representatives when you were in the State House. Had this kind of thing going on, you had to stage protests and activities within the confines of the legislature and the legislative system in order to stop what ended up being a first in the nation abortion ban.</p><p>REP. JASMINE CROCKETT (D-TX): Yes, no, you`re absolutely right. And Ali, the only reason that you and I came to even know each other is because of that protest. You`re right, I`m listening to us speak and your monologue, and I`m snapping and I`m saying amen, brother, Amen. Keep preaching, right? Because that`s exactly what it`s been. We could not get the coverage, not that we weren`t necessarily looking for coverage, but we want to make sure that our constituents are informed.</p><p>Most people didn`t even have an idea of who their state representatives were. They could tell you who their senators were, who their congresspeople were, but they couldn`t tell you about the state reps. And they had no idea that when they were complaining about criminal justice issues, they really needed to be talking to us. They had no idea that an abortion ban was going to be coming down. They had no idea that you know, what started off as a bathroom bill would then continue on and turn into anti-trans legislation. And they had no idea that the Republicans would be so desperate to bring about voter suppression in the State of Texas that we would flee the state and end up having warrants out for our rights, and really bring national attention to the issue.</p><p>VELSHI: And I guess that`s the point of the exercise. I was talking to Reverend Al the other day, and he was saying, you know, people always say you`re just doing it for the attention. He says, yes, that`s kind of the point. We need to actually get attention on these issues because when voters, Ben, start to learn about what`s going on in your state, in Wisconsin, what you found is they actually did respond.</p><p>[20:10:01]</p><p>BEN WIKLER, CHAIR, WISCONSIN DEMOCRATIC PARTY: Absolutely. They`re furious when they find out. But Republicans don`t want them to find out. One of the stunning things about politics today is that when you just accurately describe what Republicans are trying to do, in state houses in Wisconsin, across the country, voters initially think that it must be a lie, because they can`t imagine that anyone would try to get away with a power grab so brazen and extreme.</p><p>In Wisconsin, we had this Supreme Court race. There were millions of dollars of ads. Eventually, it sank in for folks that Republicans were trying to, on the one hand, rip away their reproductive freedom, and on the other hand, smashed democracy so badly, that voters would have no ability to fight back against it. Their only path for voters to take back control over their own bodies over their democracy was to win the Supreme Court race. And that`s exactly what they did, by a landslide.</p><p>But frankly, if it hadn`t been for this opportunity, we would have been stuck in a doom loop that could have lasted for decades.</p><p>VELSHI: A doom loop. That`s interesting, because one could look at these electoral and gerrymandered and weirdly rigged systems, Congresswoman Crockett, and say we`re in a doom loop. You chose not to do that in Texas, but much like Tennessee, Texas is a -- at the moment, a very red state. Options are limited. They were limited for you to counter these majorities.</p><p>So, what`s the lesson you learn from all of the things that you and your colleagues did in the Texas State Legislature that you`re now seeing happen in certain places like, you know, what the two Justins did in Tennessee? What is -- what are the lessons for both democracy, for legislators, and for voters to look at these things and say, we`re in a doom loop, we can`t get out of it?</p><p>CROCKETT: No, I think that, you know, we, as the Texas Democrats, we rang the alarms, and we basically said, listen, democracy is under attack, most people weren`t paying attention to what the Supreme Court was doing as it relates to the Voting Rights Act. Most people haven`t connected the dots around gerrymandering. Most people don`t quite understand what gerrymandering looks like, right? But when you talk about Wisconsin, Wisconsin really is a very good example.</p><p>How is it that when you have a U.S. Senate race, it`s almost 50-50? How is it that you have a Democrat that wins for the Supreme Court and wins by over, you know, 10 points, but for some reason, when you look at how the state is up, it doesn`t look anywhere near like 50-50 when it comes to representation. But one of the things that the Justins have brought out is that representation matters, even when you are in the extremely minority, it is important that you speak up for your constituency and that they have a voice. And that`s exactly what they did.</p><p>And unfortunately, the Republicans aren`t really the smartest folks sometimes, right? And so, they didn`t think this through. They thought that they would just go ahead and do this, and no one would pay attention, or no one would care, because it was two Black guys, right? They were like, well, maybe we shouldn`t do it for the White woman. But no one is going to care about these Black men. But guess what? The entire community came together and showed them that they did care because this isn`t about or it shouldn`t be about race, it should be about fairness. And it should be about letting people be the voice that they have been elected to be even if you disagree with that, because that`s what democracy looks like.</p><p>VELSHI: And ironically, the protest was actually about guns just to start with right after a mass shooting in Texas, something that majority -- even Tennesseans, even in a -- in a very red state like that believe in common sense gun laws. But Ben, what was fascinating about this, I know that you have been in contact with the -- with the Democratic Party in in Tennessee, we saw a remarkably rapid mobilization over the weekend partly because of what Congresswoman Crockett has said that I don`t know what Republicans in that statehouse were thinking this was going to end up as. But they ended up creating democratic folk heroes out of the two Justins.</p><p>Justin Jones was expelled Thursday, he was back on Monday. Tell me about this coalition that comes into play that we don`t even know exists, people who on Thursday and Friday did not know that they were warriors for democracy who suddenly went into action.</p><p>WIKLER: You know, they said democracy dies in darkness. Well, it thrives in the sunlight. When people see what they do, when these people see these authoritarian attacks across the country, they will rally to your side. And there have been hundreds of thousands of dollars flowing into both Justins` campaign accounts, to the Tennessee Democratic Party`s account. People are ready to make phone calls to go to bat to support them.</p><p>Not only are they coming back to the state legislature, but also Democrats are in court to fight back against the gerrymandered maps that gave Republicans supermajorities in the first place. It`s a 60-40 state for Trump in Tennessee, but it`s not a Republicans supermajority state. Democrats are going to be able to win back state legislative seats and make a massive difference. The Republicans scheme backfired.</p><p>VELSHI: I could talk to you both about this for a really long time. I appreciate you both taking time to be with us. You are both going down in the history books for the things that you have done to uphold democracy in this country. The Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett and Ben Wikler, thank you very much for being with us this evening and for kicking the show off.</p><p>[20:15:04]</p><p>All right, coming up, the Manhattan district attorney fights back against Republican interference into his prosecution of Donald Trump, but is the case distracting America from the larger threat that Trump poses? That`s next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>Today, the Manhattan district attorney who`s prosecuting Donald Trump took the extraordinary step of suing a sitting member of Congress. D.A. Alvin Bragg is accusing Jim Jordan of Ohio, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee of \"An unprecedentedly brazen and unconstitutional attack by members of Congress on an ongoing New York State criminal prosecution and investigation.\"</p><p>[20:20:13]</p><p>The lawsuit alleges that on March 20th, 10 days before Trump was actually indicted, Jordan \"began a transparent campaign to intimidate and attack District Attorney Bragg, making demands for confidential documents and testimony from the district attorney himself as well as his current and former employees and officials.\" Bragg says the campaign originated with a Trump lawyer, and he`s asking the court to block a subpoena from Jordan to a former assistant D.A. who investigated Trump as well as any future subpoenas against Bragg or his staff.</p><p>Now, this unusual lawsuit is just the latest twist in the unprecedented indictment of the former U.S. president, a saga that has dominated the news for weeks. But is it possible as Rebecca Traister writes in New York Magazine that the focus on the hope that the ex-president may finally get his legal (INAUDIBLE) distracts us from a far greater danger than the man himself, which is the dire anti-democratic breakdown that Trump unleashed, and that the conservative movement in this country has embraced.</p><p>Rebecca Traister, writer-at-large for New York Magazine joins me now. Rebecca, good to see you. I was so taken by this fascinating piece in which you seem to be having a debate with yourself about how you should -- how one should feel about the fact that the accountability for Donald Trump may have begun. You talk about something called the dangerous fantasy of Trump`s indictment. Tell me what you mean by that?</p><p>REBECCA TRAISTER, WRITER-AT-LARGE, NEW YORK MAGAZINE: Well, I think that stems from my suspicion which I`ve harbored for a long time, that so much focus on Donald Trump as an individual works actually to cast him as an aberration rather than as an emblem of his party and where his party was moving before he became president and where it continues to move.</p><p>You know, you noted the anti-democratic wave that Trump unleashed. I would argue that that wave was being unleashed long before. Listening to the conversation you just had with Jasmine and with Ben talking about the Republican Party`s takeover of state legislatures while the Democratic Party and I would argue a lot of the political media looked in other directions for years preceding Donald Trump`s candidacy and presidency.</p><p>You know, we know that he won thanks to the Electoral College, an institution that was set up to permit minorities of voters to have power. The Federalist Society was already had created a pipeline for the Supreme Court. Mitch McConnell had already stolen a seat from the sitting President Barack Obama. All that preceded Donald Trump. And all of that tells us a lot about where we are now.</p><p>Trump was an incredibly powerful, dangerous, awful tool of that party. But -- and he actually permitted us to see some of these things which I think both Democrats and a political media were willfully blind to for a long time. That`s part of the conversation you just had. But right now, in this moment where he`s being, you know, tried for things indicted for things that actually aren`t about the harm he did to the nation, right? They may include legal accountability for crimes he`s committed. The amount of attention being directed to him worries me because it makes -- it makes me think that people are going to think we`ve somehow solved the problem by getting Donald Trump. And that couldn`t be further from the truth.</p><p>VELSHI: The conservative jurist, Michael Luttig made a similar point the other day. He thinks that there is a serious and pernicious threat to democracy afoot, and that Republicans are behind it. And that, as you say, account -- this Manhattan case is not accountability for any of what Trump or his party really did and continue to do with this country. That`s not to say that there is justification in prosecuting him for these things, but you are worried that it`s not the thing that is at the root of the erosion of our democracy.</p><p>TRAISTER: Well, it worries me for a couple of reasons. I mean, for one thing, I think that for me, the kind of savage system of the criminal justice system, the fantasy that it can solve. problems created by other savage systems and structures politically I think is a fantasy. And again, I think it`s a fallacy that Trump himself is an outlier rather than, you know, an avatar of what his party has become.</p><p>And in focusing on him and the singularity of Trump as this kind of tacky criminal and you know, being able to finally get him, I think it makes other members of his party who are arguably more dangerous, certainly as dangerous, arguably more dangerous, whether you`re talking about Ron DeSantis, whether you`re talking about Brian Kemp, Greg Abbott, whether you`re talking about the Republican legislatures, and you were just describing some of what we`re seeing them do, full-on attacks on human beings, on health care, on voting rights, gerrymandering districts, trying to seize all the mechanisms of political power in this country. And none of those -- none of those things necessarily have anything to do with Donald Trump.</p><p>And if we permit ourselves to think that there`s some end goal in you know, in putting him in prison, it takes so much of our attention away from these crucial fights all around the country right now. Democracy is in dire danger. And -- but it`s not going to be -- we`re not going to be saved from that danger in lower Manhattan, you know, at 100 Center Street at Donald Trump`s indictment.</p><p>[20:25:28]</p><p>VELSHI: Well, before your Twitter feed explodes, I just think it`s fair without giving away the story that I really think everybody should read, that you do conclude with the idea that you can hold both thoughts at the same time, right? You can -- you can enjoy the fact that Donald Trump may be facing justice and realize the fact that it may have nothing to do with solving our larger problem. But you heard that conversation. You didn`t write this as a media criticism necessarily. But this whole issue of everything that is going on in these laboratories of autocracy that our state legislatures that are run by Republicans, in some cases, as we were pointing out last night in Tennessee, where they don`t run against anybody. A lot of people are claimed. There aren`t even people running against some of these people.</p><p>TRAISTER: Right.</p><p>VELSHI: What do we do to make everybody realize because it`s not as handy and convenient as thinking about Donald Trump and focusing your energies on him? How do you focus your energy on something much broader and much more dangerous?</p><p>TRAISTER: Well, here`s where I`m going to say something actually about contradicting myself about what`s been good about Donald Trump is that his election actually prompted a flood of first-time candidates, people who hadn`t been paying attention, who hadn`t been directed by either the political media or the Democratic Party to pay attention to the local politics.</p><p>One of the things you saw coming out of his victory in 2016 and Hillary Clinton`s loss in 2016 was a flood of people suddenly interested in politics and organizing in ways they hadn`t been before. And so, you can already -- it`s not fixed and we need more of that flood and we need more people getting involved and running for spots on school boards and city councils and state legislatures. But that has been a real shift, in part prompted by some of the focus on Donald Trump when he was the president and figuring out how to fight him.</p><p>VELSHI: Rebecca, thank you for a very thoughtful article. I always appreciate talking to you, Rebecca Traister.</p><p>Still ahead, new research details the rapidly increasing threat that climate change poses to American cities. Is the water level creeping up near your home? We`ll talk about that next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[20:30:00]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS HAYES, MSNBC HOST: This is Isle de Jean Charles, Louisiana. People here have lived on the water and off the land for centuries. But now that land is disappearing, and the encroaching water is forcing them out, making them among what some have called the first climate refugees in America. Because it isn`t just Isle de Jean Charles that is under threat, the entire Louisiana coastline is disappearing.</p><p>ALEX KOLKER, PROFESSOR OF EARTH SCIENCES, TULANE UNIVERSITY: Louisiana has lost a very large amount of land over the last century, something close to 1900 square miles worth of land. That is equivalent today to about a football field and our football field an hour.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VELSHI: Football field an hour. That piece, by the way, ran on this show nearly seven years ago. This is what Isle de Jean Charles looks like now, seven years, more rising seas, less than one square miles of land remains above water. Even in 2016, it was clear that the rising sea levels situation was bad, but today it`s even worse than Chris and scientists thought when they did that story.</p><p>The Washington Post reports on two new academic papers showing the dramatic and abnormal sea level rise along the southern coast of the United States since 2010. One paper calculates, \"the rise of sea level -- the rate of sea level rise since 2010 at more than 10 millimeters or one centimeter per year in the region, more than double the global average over the same period.</p><p>The second study finds the same trend since 2010 across the U.S. Gulf Coast and southeastern coastlines, calling the rise unprecedented in at least 120 years. A researcher involved ominously told the post, \"it`s a window into the future.\"</p><p>Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Chris Mooney covered this for The Washington Post. He joins me now. Chris, thank you for being with us. You know, there`s been -- in the last six weeks, there`s been a number of articles warning about how dire this is and past the point of no return. But when you talk about keeping climate change to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels or measuring increase in sea level in 10-millimeter increments, one-centimeter increments, it becomes hard for people to understand that when you measure this across the entire Earth, this is really, really very serious.</p><p>CHRIS MOONEY, REPORTER, THE WASHINGTON POST: It adds up quite fast. You`re talking about five inches over a period of 10 years, some places may be even a little bit faster than that. So, we did the numbers on Pensacola, Florida, which is one of the places that has these fast rates. And it`s -- basically, it`s happened in a year since the year 2010. So, it adds up really -- it makes a big difference especially in a hurricane but also for more regular flooding.</p><p>VELSHI: Yes, just think about the -- you know, if you have a house, think about what that would feel like if you`re -- the water level rises at that rate. Let`s talk a little bit about what can be done. What`s the practical effect on people in the Gulf in the southeast. I know whenever there`s a hurricane, we end up in places for instance, in the southeast, even if the hurricanes not going to Charleston, would go to Charleston because Charleston is going to flood anyway. Miami still has sunny day storm sewer backups. You know, practically speaking, what does this mean?</p><p>[20:35:08]</p><p>MOONEY: Well, so firstly, if there`s a hurricane, it`s going to be able send more water on the lake. But even outside of a hurricane, you have a great, dramatic uptick in regular what they call sunny day flooding, which this whole region has experienced much more frequently. And it seems pretty clear that the rapid increase in the level of the sea is contributing a great deal to that. And that can be a big inconvenience.</p><p>Also, when it rains, it may not rain as quickly because the sea level is high. So, it really starts to become a problem for infrastructure. You have roads you can`t travel across a lot of the time. In terms of what can you do, there`s different levels of adaptation. So, you run from New Orleans which has really expensive walls around it to a lot of places that really don`t have much at all. It varies greatly.</p><p>VELSHI: Chris, talk to me about your takeaway. I was quoting from the IPCC study the other day where they`re saying, we`re at the point of no return. We may be past the point of no return. And we`re not doing things as aggressively as we should. Even as a country that has committed to meeting the Paris Climate Accord, we`re just -- we`re just necessarily not going to. And in fact, some of the things we`re undertaking today continue to move us in the wrong direction. Particularly -- I mean, this is -- this is one thing, sea level rises, but fossil fuels and the contribution of CO2 to the environment. It doesn`t seem like as a world, people are taking it seriously, but governments are taking it as seriously as they should.</p><p>MOONEY: What`s happening is that change is too slow unlike the rate of sea level rises too fast, right? The adoption of renewable energy and declining use of fossil fuels, adoption of electric vehicles, they`re all happening but if you look at the math of 1.5 degrees Celsius and how fast emissions have to fall in order to keep that in sight, which is something we actually did really extensively in a big data journalism piece last year, then you realize that the change is far too slow. And actually, you`re almost certainly going to go over 1.5 degrees Celsius, and that means you`re going to have full carbon back out of the air smell. It`s not at all clear how that`s going to happen. And certainly, the technology and infrastructure not built out to do that at this point.</p><p>VELSHI: Chris, thank you. We appreciate your reporting on this. Chris Mooney is a reporter for The Washington Post.</p><p>All right, still to come, the widespread impact of gun violence across this country.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. JASON SMITH, CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER, UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE HEALTH: I`m a doctor I don`t know what the answers are. But to everyone who helps make policy both at state, city, federal, I would simply ask you to do something because doing nothing which is what we`ve been doing is not working.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VELSHI: Kentucky officials plead for action with another state -- while another state takes action to crack down on gun violence. That`s up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[20:40:00]</p><p>VELSHI: The city of Louisville is reeling from yesterday`s shooting, the 146th mass shooting in America so far this year. And we now know that the gunman used a depressingly familiar murder weapon in that attack, an AR-15 rifle purchased legally last week. Now, according to data compiled by Mother Jones, this makes the Louisville shooting the seventh mass shooting in the past 11 months alone to be carried out with an AR-15.</p><p>Today, Louisville`s Mayor, Democrat Craig Greenberg, highlighted a shocking Kentucky law that governs what will happen to that lethal weapon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GREENBERG: Under current Kentucky law, the assault rifle that was used to murder five of our neighbors and shoot at rescuing police officers will one day be auctioned off. Think about that. That murder weapon will be back on the streets one day under Kentucky`s current law.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VELSHI: Thanks to those kinds of dangerously twisted gun laws around the country, a majority of adult Americans \"have either personally or had a family member who has been impacted by a gun-related incident such as witnessing a shooting, being threatened by a gun, or being injured or killed by a gun. And about one in five have a family member who has been killed by a gun including death by suicide.\"</p><p>Mayor Greenberg, a survivor of an attempted shooting himself spoke about how this epidemic of gun violence now touches all of us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GREENBERG: This isn`t about partisan politics. This is about life and death. This is about preventing tragedies. You may think this will never happen to you, never happened to any of your friends, or loved ones. I used to think that. The sad truth is that now no one in our city, no one in our state, no one in our country has that luxury anymore.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VELSHI: At the same press conference, we heard from the chief medical officer at the Louisville hospital that cared for several of yesterday`s victims. Dr. Jason Smith begged the policymakers to do something about the gun violence that plagues his emergency room, his city, and this entire country.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SMITH: I`ll be honest, caring for three shooting victims, plus the other that came in is not a frequent day for us. And the events surrounding this made this obviously much more difficult, but to be honest with you, we barely had to adjust our operating room schedule to be able to do this. That`s how frequent we are having to deal with gun violence in our community. I`m weary. There`s only so many times you can walk into a room and tell someone they`re not coming home tomorrow.</p><p>I`m a doctor. I don`t know what the answers are. But to everyone who helps make policy both at state, city, federal, I would simply ask you to do something because doing nothing, which is what we`ve been doing is not working.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VELSHI: Now, for now, a solution is not evident in deep-red Kentucky or on the federal level with a divided Congress, but there is one state that is about to implement a big step in the right direction, an assault weapons ban. I`ll talk to the governor signing that bill into law next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[20:50:00]</p><p>VELSHI: Back in 1994, the Democrat Jay Inslee was a freshman U.S. Congressman representing a Central Eastern District of Washington State when he voted for a Federal Assault Weapons Ban. He later said the vote cost him his seat. And indeed, Inslee lost his bid for reelection as the 1994 Republican revolution swept a wave of conservatives into office.</p><p>Nearly 30 years later, Inslee is now the Democratic governor of Washington. And while the national Assault Weapons Ban has expired, his state is forging its own gun regulations. The State Senate just approved a bill that would ban assault weapons in Washington and now returns to the State House for final approval. And if it passes, it heads to Governor Inslee`s desk for his signature.</p><p>Joining me now is the governor, Jay Inslee, the Democratic governor of Washington State. Governor Inslee, good to see you. Thank you for being with us this evening.</p><p>GOV. JAY INSLEE (D-WA): Good evening! Good evening!</p><p>VELSHI: Your state -- this ban has been introduced in Washington state for a few years now. It`s never passed until now. What`s changed?</p><p>INSLEE: Well, people have had a bellyful of violence, gun violence. They understand there is no reason on this green earth why we need weapons of war in our streets, and they`ve seen their children being exposed to violence in their schools. And now, this is a vast, vast majority of Washingtonians and Americans who want to take these weapons of war off our streets. So, I will be signing up bill in the next couple of weeks to ban assault weapons. And since 1994, it`s been a long road, but thank goodness, we`re getting there.</p><p>But this is not the only thing we need to do. We`re also -- I`m confident we`ll be passing a bill this year to require a safety training course for people before they buy a firearm and have a 10-day waiting period, which will join our other laws we passed in last year to require the gun owners to safely store their firearms. We need to do several things, not just one thing.</p><p>But the time has come for action. Inaction is not an excuse. We may not solve all the problems, but we can take major steps. And I`m glad I`ll be taking a significant step in the next couple of weeks.</p><p>VELSHI: Well, look, what you say makes sense that people are fed up. They are -- they`re prepared to see common sense regulations on guns that do not mean the elimination of the Second Amendment. And you`re moving in lockstep with where the population is. There are a whole lot of states moving in the other direction. And I don`t know whether it`s a protection racket that is the NRA that warns people that no matter whether there was a mass shooting in your town or a school shooting, do not suggest anything, otherwise, you`ll lose your protection.</p><p>Why are there states, particularly in the southeast going in entirely the opposite direction than your country is -- your state is?</p><p>INSLEE: Well, it has been my experience frequently that politicians have been listening to the NRA rather than their constituents. In 1994, even when I was removed from office, in the state of Washington, there was a majority in favor of this. But the NRA has some political clout, and you have some folks who vote just on one issue, and therefore democracy doesn`t work always and the public will is not followed.</p><p>But in this case, I am confident that the public will is they don`t want AR-15 intruding on their children`s schools. And we need to continue to press this. And maybe we won`t succeed in every single state in every single month. But every state that follows my state and following democracy and addressing common sense gun measures, we will keep this ball rolling, just like we are doing in protecting a woman`s right of choice, just like we`re doing and moving against climate change.</p><p>These are the majority opinions of vast majorities of Americans. And sometimes you have to make progress state by state, not necessarily in the congressional field. And the more states to do this, the more it moves the needle, both politically and culturally. And I`m convinced that the momentum is now to give our children some measure of safety. And that means passing these commonsense measures.</p><p>VELSHI: You talked about protecting a woman`s rights to choose. You`re in the midst of up a few major stories in the last few days. You have stockpiled medication of abortion, the pill mifepristone, which might be banned nationwide in a matter of days. Tell me -- tell me what your thought processes behind that and what that actually means. If the -- if the medication is banned for distribution, will people be able to get mifepristone that you have stockpiled?</p><p>INSLEE: Yes, in our state, because our state had the foresight to stockpile three or four years in supply of mifepristone, we took possession of that, it was safely in our hands before the judge in Texas, the Trump appointee issued their ruling. And because of that, we now will be free to continue to dispense this to women in Washington state, even if the Texas judge`s decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court. So, I can pretty much say with confidence, we will be able to continue to dispense this product.</p><p>[20:55:25]</p><p>We also, as you know, had one federal judge in Washington state actually ruled the opposite because of the great work of our Attorney General Bob Ferguson, so we don`t know what the Supreme Court is going to do. But we do know that Washington women are going to have access to the mifepristone. I`m glad other states are now joining us in this regard. And I think this is kind of one of the measures as an eye opener, we`re going to have to be creative and aggressive on a state-by-state basis, because those people who would want to suppress this right and women are going to come after us state by state.</p><p>In Idaho, my adjoining state, they`re trying to ban the right to cross state lines to exercise the right of choice. And I think this just an opening salvo and we need to be aggressive and creative. I`m glad we have it. It`s going to work. And I hope other states join us.</p><p>VELSHI: Let me ask you about Idaho. You actually wrote a letter to the governor of Idaho condemning that state`s bill that makes it a crime to help a minor get an abortion out of state. In the letter you wrote, we welcome Idaho`s patients and healthcare providers with open arms in Washington. Abortions banned in Idaho with very rare exceptions. In your state, minors can get an abortion without parental consent. Tell me how this all plays out for you. Do you actually imagine that you`re going to see Idahoan fugitives coming into Washington because we`ve seen what happens in in Ohio when somebody -- when a minor can`t get an abortion, you know, it`s draconian.</p><p>INSLEE: Look, there`s a really simple principle here. Idaho can make the laws for their state, but they`re not going to make the laws for Washington State. Women has a right of choice and the laws are determined by our legislature and our people. And those laws apply to activities within the state of Washington. And we are not going to allow Idaho politicians dictate to the citizens of Washington what happens in the state of Washington.</p><p>This bill attempts to regulate what happens in Washington State. The Idaho legislature does not have jurisdiction in my state, in our state, and therefore they will not be allowed to dictate who can travel to and from Idaho. By the way, this -- they attempt to apply this to Washington citizens too. They try to say Washington citizens who happen to travel and Idaho essentially can`t travel back in some sense.</p><p>So, we`re going to resist this. I assume there`s going to be litigation in some sense. We`re going to have to figure out whether we can be a party or we just Planned Parenthood. But one way or another, we cannot allow one state to cut off the right of travel in the United States. This is a constitutional right to travel across state lines. And what is legal in Washington will remain legal in Washington state. That`s a very important constitutional principle.</p><p>VELSHI: I got a couple of minutes left. I don`t want to start a fight between fantastic Canadian border states. But last night, I had Governor Whitmer on the show and she said that if people want to live in a state that respects the rights that they`ve come to expect, they should move to Michigan. You seem to be doing something like that in Washington. You`re creating a safe haven for people who care about gun safety, people who care about abortion, people who care about living their best free lives, something that libertarians and conservatives used to pride red states for being.</p><p>INSLEE: Well, we -- I mean, we don`t -- that`s -- I don`t get up in the morning trying to create a sanctuary. But we do care about other people. Look, when Idaho and their politicians did -- frankly, did not act responsibly during the COVID epidemic, they did not take measures that could have saved people`s lives, as a consequence, they had scores of people get sick. And they came over to Washington and we gave them health care. We treated them. They`re Americans. We care about them in their lives. We care about everybody.</p><p>And we care about the right choice for all women. So, women are welcome in our state, and we will have the means to provide them the right of choice in our state. And that will -- that will continue. And these are basically fundamental freedom issues. We ought to have freedom for a woman`s right of choice. We ought to have freedom for kids to go to school and not be assaulted by a weapon of war. There ought to be a freedom to breathe and not be consumed by forest fire smoke because of climate change.</p><p>So, I would say that we are a state that believes in freedom, and others are welcome to come and enjoy it. I think Gretchen Whitmer is a tremendous governor. She`s got a beautiful state and she can come visit us too. So, I`m glad to be a party that stands up for freedom --</p><p>VELSHI: Well, played.</p><p>INSLEE: -- right now in this clash.</p><p>VELSHI: Well, played, Governor. And all of you can go to Canada really easily, so that`s good too. Nice to see you, Governor as always.

Those are the two things hospitals are short on during the pandemic.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Grande Ronde Hospital is no different.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hospital staff addressed those concerns during a virtual public forum on Wednesday, Aug. 18. Doctors, hospital staff and public officials outlined the current status of the hospital and how it plans to navigate through the recent rise in COVID-19 cases.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We must band together against this unrelenting pandemic and the variants we're facing if we want to reclaim the way of life that we enjoy in Eastern Oregon,\" Grande Ronde Hospital President and Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Davis said.</p><p>Davis spoke at the virtual meeting alongside several doctors from the hospital as well as La Grande Mayor Steve Clements, Center for Human Development Public Health Administrator Carrie Brogoitti, La Grande School District Superintendent George Mendoza and Union County Commissioner Matt Scarfo.</p><p>Davis emphasized the increasing statewide COVID-19 numbers in August and noted staff fatigue and shortages are weighing heavily on the hospital. According to Davis, there were only two available ICU beds in Eastern Oregon at one point earlier this month. To his knowledge, there are currently none available in Eastern Oregon.</p><p>As of Aug. 18, Union County had recorded 328 COVID-19 cases, setting a record high for monthly cases, and the county's seven-day average for positive tests was just over 20 per day.</p><p>Davis also stated approximately 10% of ICU beds in Oregon are currently available for new patients. The ICU at Grande Ronde Hospital has six beds, operating with a maximum of three to four COVID-19 patients at once.</p><p>Grande Ronde Hospital has 25 total beds, but that number can be increased in the case of a mass influx of patients. On Aug. 19, five beds remained empty at the hospital, but that number fluctuates daily. In the case of a large increase of patients, alternative care sites in the area can be utilized to create extra space. Grande Ronde Hospital is not currently utilizing the GRH Pavilion for additional space.</p><p>Davis said staffing issues are more pertinent right now. From overall fatigue due to the pandemic to the large amount of labor and equipment required to work in the ICU, the staff has been pushed to new limits by COVID-19.</p><p>\"We're struggling because of a staffing issue, but there are beds available,\" he said.</p><p>Nationwide issue</p><p>The hospital capacity stretches across the region and the entire country.</p><p>GRH would typically transfer patients to medical facilities in Boise, Walla Walla or the Tri-Cities, but many of the larger hospitals are currently unable to take patients. Davis mentioned an instance of a patient being transferred to Montana and a patient who required more than 40 phone calls to find a bed for.</p><p>1 month free with $8.25 monthly digital only subscription. Promo Code: DIGI</p><p>\"It's hard to transfer patients, and it's hard to get them admitted to our hospital because we're low on beds at times,\" said Dr. Stephen McIlmoil, an emergency medicine doctor at Grande Ronde Hospital.</p><p>McIlmoil noted that the emergency room at the hospital is packed with patients beyond just those dealing with COVID-19.</p><p>The hospital staff reported there has been a 200% increase in emergency room visits in Eastern Oregon during the recent COVID-19 surge. Others from the hospital who spoke, including Dr. Zach Spoehr-Labutta, a pediatric doctor, emphasized the concern.</p><p>\"This is the first point in the pandemic that I am legitimately afraid for my patients,\" he said.</p><p>In addition to hospitals exhausting resources, nursing homes are feeling the impacts of hospitals reaching capacity.</p><p>According to a spokesperson at the Grande Ronde Retirement Residence, in La Grande, finding room for patients has been more difficult in the last two months than it ever has been.</p><p>Davis emphasized the strain in staffing is being felt across the state, which has resulted in the National Guard assisting and providing support functions at several hospitals, including St. Charles Bend. Grande Ronde Hospital has 160 cots from the National Guard that it can use in the event of a mass influx of patients, but the National Guard itself is not currently being used in La Grande.</p><p>Local authorities</p><p>Scarfo added his thoughts during the meeting, suggesting that the county is working with the Oregon Health Authority to conduct mass offsite testing in the coming weeks in order to relieve pressure on hospital staff.</p><p>Mendoza emphasized the La Grande School District's risk mitigation measures heading into the school year.</p><p>Mendoza added that a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases in the district has made operations difficult, but he is hopeful that protocols will create a productive in-person school year.</p><p>Clements added his recommendation for mask usage, and cautioned residents about the repercussions that can come from large gatherings.</p><p>\"We're in this together,\" Clements said. \"If there was a forest fire that was blowing in our direction, this community would pull together in a heartbeat. I wish that was the case now.\"</p><p>___ (c)2021 The Observer (La Grande, Ore.)

While there are still unanswered questions about the fire, forestry experts at North Carolina State University said there is one thing they do know: Animals and trees that live there are fire-adapted - meaning they have ways to flee or hide from the flames, survive or regenerate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We have really good scientific evidence in the Southeast, including the area where Pilot Mountain is, that fire on the landscape is necessary for healthy ecosystems,\" said Laurel Kays, an extension assistant at NCState. \"So a lot of the impacts of this fire are going to come down to: How is this fire burning, what are the fire effects doing to that ecosystem and did it burn in a way that going to be beneficial?\"</p><p>The Abstract spoke with Kays and with Joseph Roise, a professor of forestry and environmental resources at NCState, about the ways that wildlife respond to wildfire. They also talked about reasons that forestry experts use prescribed, or controlled, burns.</p><p>The Abstract: What are wildfires versus prescribed fires?</p><p>Laurel Kays: Prescribed fires are fires on the landscape that are set intentionally by trained personnel to achieve specific goals. They follow laws, regulations, and policies in place to ensure these fires are safe and effective. Wildfires, on the other hand, are fires that are not planned and may start from intentional arson, accidental human actions or lightning.</p><p>The North Carolina State Parks have an active prescribed burning program within Pilot Mountain State Park in part to try and reduce the severity of wildfires if and when they do happen. One of the important reasons why we do prescribed fire is to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires. It reduces the risk that wildfire is going to get too difficult to control, endanger human health and burn at such severity that it will damage the ecosystem.</p><p>With prescribed fire, we can get fire on the ground, and choose the weather, day and time, and burn in a way that we are protecting both human and ecosystem health. We are getting the benefits without the things that many of us are scared of.</p><p>Joseph Roise: With wildfires, you always have concerns about the urban-rural interface, and one of the big things they were trying to do at Pilot Mountain was burn out around the buildings and remove the fuel from around the buildings. If the forest burns, it's usually a positive thing, unless it's a crown fire and it just destroys everything. In a crown fire, it burns the top of the trees. You see a lot of those out West. But you rarely see a crown fire in the East that's sustained for a long distance.</p><p>TA: How does wildlife respond to wildfires?</p><p>Kays: Virtually the whole state has ecosystems that are fire adapted and require fire to remain healthy. The animals that live there have some mechanism to escape whether it's flying away in the case of birds, running away in the case of deer and rabbits, or burrowing down like amphibians and reptiles do. Particularly when we do prescribed burns, at relatively low severity, most wildlife are able to escape. And while individual animals sometimes do die in a fire, we have a lot of scientific evidence showing that overall the habitat created by the regular use of fire in fire-adapted ecosystems benefits wildlife populations.</p><p>TA: Are there trees that are more adapted to wildfire?</p><p>Roise: Native plants in North Carolina have evolved with fire. So they're fire adapted in one way or another. Oaks will survive because they have thick bark. The acorns have been buried in the ground by squirrels. Yellow poplar, their seeds are small, but they work their way into the soil, and they'll sprout up as soon as you get some sunlight. Sweet gum trees and saplings, many will get killed by the fire, depending on the intensity. But they have a root system that keeps producing, even though the fire might have killed the overstory. Red maple, their adaption is to produce a lot of seeds that will blow in from miles away. Next spring, if there is enough sunlight hitting the forest floor, you'll get some red maple trees coming out. The classic fire adapted species, the keystone one, is longleaf pine. It's not very prevalent at Pilot Mountain, but you do have loblolly, shortleaf and Virginia pine. All of those pine species have an adaptation to fire.</p><p>TA: How can fire actually benefit plants and animals?</p><p>Kays: In terms of how burns can benefit wildlife - in the long-term, they create habitat structures that our wildlife are evolved to thrive in. So for example, the red-cockaded woodpecker on the coastal plain evolved to be adapted to longleaf pine forest. Fire creates a forest with a very open understory with mature longleaf pines widely spaced, and with grasses and wildflowers that support the insects the red-cockaded woodpecker needs.</p><p>Roise: Fire reduces the fuel loading in a forest. Some smaller trees, diseased trees and some medium sized shrubs will be killed. Fire will open up the canopy so more sunlight will hit the ground. Add to that nutrients in the ash going into the soil. With that combination, come next spring there are going to be a lot more fresh, succulent, nutritious grasses in the understory. That means there will be better foraging for wildlife. That's one of the reasons, in fact a primary tool, for increasing wildlife habitat quality. Wildlife managers commonly burn their forest on a regular cycle, like every three to four years.</p><p>TA: What is the fire season in North Carolina?</p><p>Kays: We have very different ecosystems and we have different fire seasons than the Western United States. Our natural fire seasons are spring and fall. The weather tends to be drier. In the fall, hardwoods, or non-conifers, that's when they drop their leaves, and the leaves start to dry out and become flammable. If you think about our summer - the humidity is just so high. Which isn't to say we never have wildfires in the summer, and prescribed fire in the summer can produce needed fire effects, but you think about stepping outside in the summer in North Carolina.yeah. It's pretty wet.

More than a dozen witnesses took the stand, with county election officials, tribal members and individual voters answering flurries of questions from lawyers about the impacts of new voting laws[2] passed by the 2021 Legislature. <br/>The lawsuit, presided over by District Court Judge Michael Moses, will decide the fate of a trio of laws that ended Election Day voter registration[3], implemented new photo identification requirements for voters[4] and prohibited paid ballot collection[5] in the state. <br/>A collection of plaintiffs including the Montana Democratic Party, four tribal nations, youth voting organizations such as Montana Youth Action, and the Indigenous voting rights nonprofit Western Native Voice are challenging the constitutionality[6] of the new laws. Attorneys representing Republican Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen, the case's sole defendant, have countered that the laws were necessary to prevent voter fraud and bolster voter confidence. <br/>So far, the trial has had its lighter moments. On Thursday, as the day's action looked like it would wrap early, Moses stated his kids wouldn't mind as it was his birthday \u2014 a candid moment that inspired a round of applause from both legal teams. But the weight of the events that unfolded in court was undeniable, as the testimony entered by witnesses fueled tense moments and hit on the personal experiences of voters navigating Montana's new electoral landscape. <br/>Here are some of the high points from the trial's first week: <br/>ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN <br/>One of the defense's primary arguments is that HB 176 reduces the Election Day burden on local election administrators[7] \u2014 a position originally staked out by Republican lawmakers advocating for its passage during the 2021 legislature. On Wednesday, the court heard directly from Missoula County Election Administrator Bradley Seaman on that point. Seaman acknowledged in his testimony that his office has experienced long lines on Election Day in the past, but clarified that those lines occurred at the county's election center, where same-day registration activities were consolidated prior to their elimination. <br/>'You can't register at the polling place by law in Montana,' Seaman said, suggesting that the lines did not inhibit registered voters from casting their ballots at the polls. <br/> What else you need to know: <br/> 08.17.202208.17.2022  <br/> 08.15.202208.15.2022  <br/> 08.15.202208.18.2022  <br/><br/><br/>Seaman went on to describe, in detail, the various safeguards in place for county election officials to protect against voter fraud and stated that he's 'unaware of any mistakes' he or his staff have made in the past due to Election Day registration lines. Seaman also noted two details about the new laws. In the case of HB 176, he testified that the law still allows a 'small subgroup' of voters who have moved to a new precinct within the same county to update their registration and vote on Election Day. Seaman said SB 169 established a new form \u2014 known as a Declaration of Impediment \u2014 that election officials can have voters fill out in lieu of a photo ID in certain extenuating circumstances. <br/>The form displayed in the courtroom indicated it was created in April 2021, four days after Gov. Greg Gianforte signed SB 169 into law. Seaman testified he didn't learn of it until February 2022. <br/> related <url normalizedValue=\"https://montanafreepress.org/2022/08/16/montana-voting-rights-laws-go-to-trial/\">https://montanafreepress.org/2022/08/16/montana-voting-rights-laws-go-to-trial/</url> What's at stake as new election laws go to trial[2] Over the next 10 days, attorneys on either side of Montana's election administration lawsuit will explore how three challenged laws impact voters, election officials and voter confidence. Here's a look at the arguments they laid out on day one. <br/><br/><br/>'I'm not certain why we didn't see it,' Seaman said. <br/>On cross-examination, defense attorney Mac Morris pressed Seaman about the stance various county election officials took on HB 176 during the 2021 session. Morris noted that roughly two dozen officials from rural counties expressed support for the bill in a survey conducted by the Montana Association of Clerk and Recorders. Seaman maintained that he didn't recall the exact number of county officials who supported HB 176 but said he knew that the association's members were split on the issue. <br/>Also on the administrative impacts front, Montana Democratic Party Data Director Jacob Hopkins was asked Friday if he had observed any delays in ballot processing at county election offices. Hopkins said that data from Gallatin County did lag somewhat during the 2020 general election cycle. The delays, he added, were due to the county storing absentee ballots for five days before processing them to prevent election staff from potential exposure to COVID-19. <br/>IMPACTS ON INDIGENOUS VOTERS <br/>Attorneys on both sides spent much of late Tuesday and early Wednesday questioning Dawn Gray, managing attorney for the Blackfeet Nation, about the impacts of the new laws on Indigenous voters. Gray reiterated many of the observations previously made by expert witnesses regarding the lack of transportation and reliable mail service in reservation communities and spoke at length about recent challenges the tribe has faced in improving voter access for its members. <br/>'This was before the vaccine, so it was scary times, and we wanted to provide safe access to voting during that time frame.' Dawn Gray, managing attorney for the Blackfeet Nation, commenting on the removal of ballot dropboxs in the days before the 2020 election. <br/>Gray testified that in 2020, election officials in Glacier County abruptly pulled ballot drop boxes from reservation sites three days before the election. The drop boxes were highly desirable on the reservation at that time due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Gray said. <br/>'This was before the vaccine,' she said, 'so it was scary times, and we wanted to provide safe access to voting during that time frame.' <br/>The tribe, Gray said, responded by employing ballot collectors to assist members in submitting their ballots \u2014 an option the plaintiffs maintain is jeopardized by HB 530. The defendants said ballot collection could still be available to tribal governments pending Jacobsen's adoption of new rules under the law. <br/>THE FRAUD ARGUMENT <br/>The specter of voter fraud[8] came up repeatedly throughout the week, with defense attorneys asking several witnesses whether they'd seen any evidence of fraud occurring in the state. That narrative came to a head Friday when Leonard Smith, an attorney representing Jacobsen, cross-examined Hopkins. Smith stated that two individuals were arrested in Phillips County last year for illegally registering and voting in a mayoral election. As Montana Free Press previously reported[9], those individuals \u2014 a pair of non-U.S. residents employed as public school teachers \u2014 were not arrested but are facing charges. <br/>Smith asked if Hopkins was aware that if those two votes were found to be fraudulent, that they could have impacted the result of the election. Hopkins replied that that would depend on how the individuals voted. <br/>Smith also pressed Hopkins about a 2016 news story about a Livingston resident complaining to law enforcement about intimidating behavior on the part of a canvasser later identified as working for the Montana Democratic Party. Hopkins said he had no knowledge of the incident as it predated his involvement with the party, but he agreed with Smith's assertion that intimidation goes against the party's guidelines for ballot collectors. <br/>As for the plaintiffs' stance on voter fraud, that was summed up Monday by expert witness Daniel McCool, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Utah. <br/>'As another political scientist put it, you're more likely to die in a lightning strike than to commit voter fraud,' McCool told the court. <br/>VOTER PERSPECTIVE <br/>Some of the most compelling moments in the trial's first week came from the testimony of voters, called by the plaintiffs' attorneys to share first-hand their experiences with the new laws. Kendra Miller, a data analyst for the Montana Federation of Public Employees, laid the groundwork for this side of the trial Wednesday by telling the court her analysis of the effects of HB 176. Miller testified that through public records requests and data from the secretary of state's office, she determined that 268 Montanans attempted to utilize Election Day voter registration during the 2021 municipal elections \u2014 59 of whom were unable to cast their votes due to the new law. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://apps.montanafreepress.org/montana-legislature-lawsuit-tracker\">https://apps.montanafreepress.org/montana-legislature-lawsuit-tracker</url>/ <br/>Two such individuals took the stand this week. Thomas Bogle told the court Tuesday that he and his wife moved to Bozeman in April 2021 and registered to vote absentee that September while obtaining their Montana driver's licenses. His wife received her ballot, Bogle said, but he never got his. He said when he arrived at the courthouse on Election Day, he was informed that his voter registration form never made it to the county elections office, and as such he was unable to vote. <br/>Jacobsen's legal team countered that testimony, saying it's the responsibility of individual voters, such as Bogle, to check their elector status earlier and address any problems before the close of late registration. Under HB 176, that deadline is now noon the day before an election. <br/>'If I had missed work, I would have been fired.' Bozeman voter Sarah Denson, in response to a question from a lawyer for the Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen who asked Denson whether she thought working on Election Day was more important than voting. <br/>Sarah Denson, a Miles City native now living in Bozeman, pushed back on that argument. Denson testified Wednesday that she believed she had successfully updated her residency status in 2021 when she changed her address through the U.S. Postal Service. After her absentee ballot failed to show up, she said, she visited the courthouse on Election Day and was informed that she was still registered to vote in Miles City. <br/>Attorney David Knobel, representing Jacobsen, asked Denson whether she could have driven to Miles City to cast her ballot in person on Election Day if she had chosen not to go to work. Denson replied that was not an option. <br/>'So you thought that working was more important than voting?' Knobel asked. <br/>'If I had missed work,' Denson answered, 'I would have been fired.' <br/>The trial resumes Monday in Yellowstone County District Court and is currently scheduled to conclude on Friday. <br/> latest stories Gianforte wields 'executive privilege' argument against sensitive records requests[10] In two lawsuits, one brought by an environment and public lands activist and the other brought by the Montana Environmental Information Center, the Gianforte administration has argued the governor's 'deliberative process' should be exempt from the state's open records law.

While there are still unanswered questions about the fire, forestry experts at North Carolina State University said there is one thing they do know: Animals and trees that live there are fire-adapted meaning they have ways to flee or hide from the flames, survive or regenerate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We have really good scientific evidence in the Southeast, including the area where Pilot Mountain is, that fire on the landscape is necessary for healthy ecosystems,\" said Laurel Kays, an extension assistant at NC State. \"So a lot of the impacts of this fire are going to come down to: How is this fire burning, what are the fire effects doing to that ecosystem and did it burn in a way that going to be beneficial?\"</p><p>The Abstract spoke with Kays and with Joseph Roise, a professor of forestry and environmental resources at NC State, about the ways that wildlife respond to wildfire. They also talked about reasons that forestry experts use prescribed, or controlled, burns.</p><p>The Abstract: What are wildfires versus prescribed fires?</p><p>Laurel Kays: Prescribed fires are fires on the landscape that are set intentionally by trained personnel to achieve specific goals. They follow laws, regulations, and policies in place to ensure these fires are safe and effective. Wildfires, on the other hand, are fires that are not planned and may start from intentional arson, accidental human actions or lightning.</p><p>The North Carolina State Parks have an active prescribed burning program within Pilot Mountain State Park in part to try and reduce the severity of wildfires if and when they do happen. One of the important reasons why we do prescribed fire is to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires. It reduces the risk that wildfire is going to get too difficult to control, endanger human health and burn at such severity that it will damage the ecosystem.</p><p>With prescribed fire, we can get fire on the ground, and choose the weather, day and time, and burn in a way that we are protecting both human and ecosystem health. We are getting the benefits without the things that many of us are scared of.</p><p>Joseph Roise: With wildfires, you always have concerns about the urban-rural interface, and one of the big things they were trying to do at Pilot Mountain was burn out around the buildings and remove the fuel from around the buildings. If the forest burns, it's usually a positive thing, unless it's a crown fire and it just destroys everything. In a crown fire, it burns the top of the trees. You see a lot of those out West. But you rarely see a crown fire in the East that's sustained for a long distance.</p><p>TA: How does wildlife respond to wildfires?</p><p>Kays: Virtually the whole state has ecosystems that are fire adapted and require fire to remain healthy. The animals that live there have some mechanism to escape whether it's flying away in the case of birds, running away in the case of deer and rabbits, or burrowing down like amphibians and reptiles do. Particularly when we do prescribed burns, at relatively low severity, most wildlife are able to escape. And while individual animals sometimes do die in a fire, we have a lot of scientific evidence showing that overall the habitat created by the regular use of fire in fire-adapted ecosystems benefits wildlife populations.</p><p>TA: Are there trees that are more adapted to wildfire?</p><p>Roise: Native plants in North Carolina have evolved with fire. So they're fire adapted in one way or another. Oaks will survive because they have thick bark. The acorns have been buried in the ground by squirrels. Yellow poplar, their seeds are small, but they work their way into the soil, and they'll sprout up as soon as you get some sunlight. Sweet gum trees and saplings, many will get killed by the fire, depending on the intensity. But they have a root system that keeps producing, even though the fire might have killed the overstory. Red maple, their adaption is to produce a lot of seeds that will blow in from miles away. Next spring, if there is enough sunlight hitting the forest floor, you'll get some red maple trees coming out. The classic fire adapted species, the keystone one, is longleaf pine. It's not very prevalent at Pilot Mountain, but you do have loblolly, shortleaf and Virginia pine. All of those pine species have an adaptation to fire.</p><p>TA: How can fire actually benefit plants and animals?</p><p>Kays: In terms of how burns can benefit wildlife in the long-term, they create habitat structures that our wildlife are evolved to thrive in. So for example, the red-cockaded woodpecker on the coastal plain evolved to be adapted to longleaf pine forest. Fire creates a forest with a very open understory with mature longleaf pines widely spaced, and with grasses and wildflowers that support the insects the red-cockaded woodpecker needs.</p><p>Roise: Fire reduces the fuel loading in a forest. Some smaller trees, diseased trees and some medium sized shrubs will be killed. Fire will open up the canopy so more sunlight will hit the ground. Add to that nutrients in the ash going into the soil. With that combination, come next spring there are going to be a lot more fresh, succulent, nutritious grasses in the understory. That means there will be better foraging for wildlife. That's one of the reasons, in fact a primary tool, for increasing wildlife habitat quality. Wildlife managers commonly burn their forest on a regular cycle, like every three to four years.</p><p>TA: What is the fire season in North Carolina?</p><p>Kays: We have very different ecosystems and we have different fire seasons than the Western United States. Our natural fire seasons are spring and fall. The weather tends to be drier. In the fall, hardwoods, or non-conifers, that's when they drop their leaves, and the leaves start to dry out and become flammable. If you think about our summer the humidity</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124877258</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:646R-9N61-DYTH-G08B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-12-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"998\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"12\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>December 1, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Its unacceptable to me, or to any Montanan, that we are doing so with outdated aircraft, said Governor Bullock.</p><p>It couldnt be clearer that the President is choosing to fund his border wall over keeping our citizen soldiers and Airmen safe. By that matter, hes choosing a vanity project over honoring those who defend our freedom and liberty and keep our communities safe. I wont stand idly by until Montanas National Guard members are given what they are owed, continued Governor Bullock.</p><p>Montana Air National Guard members are currently operating a C-130H fleet from 1974 that utilizes technology no longer used by the airlines and equipment the Active Duty Air Force no longer uses.</p><p>Congress appropriated $3.8 billion, including $196 million for Air National Guard C-130J aircraft. That funding would have supported efforts to update Montanas C-130H fleet to the modern C-130Js. The Trump Administration is reprogramming these dollars for construction of the southern border wall.</p><p>Governor Bullock also sent a letter asking Senator Daines and Congressman Gianforte to join in requesting for an end to the reprogramming. The letter is attached.</p><p>The National Governors Association today expressed opposition to the reprogramming. The full statement can be found at this link. The Adjutants General Association of the United States, including General Quinn of Montana, expressed how reprogramming impacts the National Guard budget.

Competing brush having been newly cleared by fire, the serotinous sentinels are then better positioned to produce new growth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Elections operate on a more regular schedule than California conflagrations, and those November Tuesdays don't always rise to the level of catastrophe for an entire political party. But the surprise 2021 victory of GOP outsider Glenn Youngkin over heavily favored Democratic nominee Terry McAuliffe in Virginia's gubernatorial race, along with a handful of other shock victories for Republicans and shock defeats for pet progressive causes, was greeted by many left-leaners in the political class as a potentially terrain-changing calamity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Democrats need to go back to school,\" wrote<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Washington Post</emphasis>\u00a0columnist James Hohmann.\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Times</emphasis>\u00a0editorial board business and economics writer Binyamin Appelbaum produced a damning post-election video pointing out that \"it is in the blue states where affordable\u00a0housing is often hardest to find, there are some of the most acute\u00a0disparities in education funding,\u00a0and economic inequality is\u00a0increasing most quickly.\"</p><p>Irascible Democratic strategist James Carville was even more blunt, telling PBS anchor Judy Woodruff, \"What went wrong is this stupid wokeness.\" Carville elaborated: \"Don't just look at Virginia and New Jersey. Look at Long Island, look at Buffalo, look at Minneapolis. Even look at Seattle, Washington. I mean, this defund-the-police lunacy, this take Abraham Lincoln's name off of schools\u2026people see that, and it\u2026just really [has] a suppressive effect all across the country [for] Democrats. Some of these people need to go to a woke detox center or something. They're expressing language that people just don't use, and there's a backlash and a frustration at that.\"</p><p>The parties of first-term presidents tend to take a drubbing at the ballot box in non-presidential-election years. Since World War II, only one rookie president has seen his party gain congressional seats in his first midterm elections: George W. Bush in 2002, at the height of post-9/11, pre\u2013Iraq War fever, and his GOP gained just eight seats in the House of Representatives. The other 11 first-term presidents watched their parties lose an average of 29 House seats. Three of the last four presidents incurred three of the top four losses: Barack Obama's 63 in 2010, Bill Clinton's 52 in 1994, and Donald Trump's 40 in 2018.</p><p>It makes intuitive sense that elections ostensibly having nothing to do with the White House are increasingly becoming referenda on the country's chief executive. The federal government has metastasized so quickly that the size of the federal deficit alone in fiscal year 2021 ($2.77 trillion) is larger than the entire amount of federal spending every year in the country's history through 1997, adjusted for inflation.</p><p>The commander in chief now has unchecked power to drone U.S. citizens to death or detain them indefinitely without criminal charge. His surveillance state routinely vacuums up information about the communications activities of all of us, warrant or no. The administrative state he oversees has become a free-floating enforcer of presidential whims, such as the national eviction moratorium that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention maintained for 12 months and the vaccine mandate that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration imposed on private businesses in November.</p><p>As power in the capital has swollen, civic and journalistic activity in the hinterlands has withered, so political energy and attention during our apprehensive times inevitably fixate on the personality at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. It's no wonder that midterm swings have gotten larger, or that state and local politicians try to make their campaigns about the sitting (or even former) president.</p><p>But it's a mistake to treat these developments as a fixed law of nature, grinding along irrespective of individual free will. For elections to swing from one party to another, you need swing voters. And as much as they are routinely maligned by those who make their living in politics, these swing voters have a name: the independents.</p><p>Even the narrowest definition of this bloc\u2014people who vote for third-party and independent candidates\u2014reveals an outsized influence on elections. For example, nontraditional presidential voters shrank by 3.9 percentage points between 2016 and 2020, from 5.7 percent (including 3.3 percent for Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson) to 1.8 percent of the electorate. The Democratic nominee's share of the popular vote, meanwhile, climbed by 3.1 percentage points; Trump gained 0.8 percentage points. Exit polls in 2020 showed that 59 percent of major-party returnees voted for Biden.</p><p>This trend was reflected not just in 2020 pre-election and exit polls of 2016 third-party/independent voters but also in the attitudes of more broadly defined \"independents.\" Gallup, Pew, and several other public opinion organizations ask people to describe their political affiliations (Democratic, Republican, or independent), and that question produces a number considerably larger than 5.7 percent. In the case of Gallup, which has been asking the question since 1988, \"independent\" has been the No. 1 answer in every survey since 2013, reaching an all-time high of 50 percent in February 2021.</p><p>Trump narrowly beat Hillary Clinton among self-described independents in 2016, 43 percent to 42 percent, according to Pew. But throughout his tumultuous presidency, this bloc never once gave him a job approval rating higher than 47 percent, even as nine out of 10 Republicans routinely gave their standard-bearer a thumbs-up.</p><p>Biden started his term with an approval rate among independents that Trump could only dream of: 61 percent. But from there it plummeted, all the way down to 34 percent as of October 2021. In our negatively polarized times, when party members stand by their man in opposition to the other team, overall approval hinges on the attitudes of independents. The 46th president has had the worst first-year approval ratings, in the low 40s, of any modern president\u2014except Donald Trump.</p><p>One reason some political commentators are forever writing articles headlined \"The Myth of the Independent Voter\" is that the bloc does not necessarily have a coherent and predictable set of ideological or political-consumer preferences. Furthermore, the group contains internal clumps that usually vote for the same party across elections. Both critiques are true. But they miss an important point.</p><p>Government overreach\u2014in overall size, in meddling with private transactions, in regulating our intimate decisions, in punishing disfavored groups\u2014can be likened to a forest fire: Eventually, it will burn high and hot enough for even the apolitical to feel the flames. We will be discovering and arguing over exactly what unsealed the rosin among the independent voters who seeded Democratic defeats in November 2021. But political professionals of all species need to relearn one clear lesson: If you make the government feel too dangerous, a corrective bloc of voters will pour cold water on your face. At a time of bipartisan big-government populism, such small victories may be the only thing that keeps us going.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RSNMMC-TheIndependentsStrikeBack</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RSNMMC2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G63-H8F3-SBH3-V4F6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">494996</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1251\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Reason Foundation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Reason (Magazine)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"65828\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"01\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>January 23, 2022 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;
