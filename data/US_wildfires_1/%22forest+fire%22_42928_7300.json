Since January, nearly 750 wildfires have burned more than 8,200 acres in Florida. Most were caused by people. Currently, the are 62 active wildfires burning over 1,740 acres across the state.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Wildfire Awareness Week is an important reminder of the devastating effect wildfires can have on our communities and natural resources,\" said Commissioner Nikki Fried. \"As we continue to navigate through these difficult and uncertain times, it's critical for everyone to be aware, use extreme caution, and follow the law, ensuring the safety of your family, communities and our firefighters.\"</p><p>The leading causes of wildfires this time of year are escaped yard debris burning and unauthorized debris burns. The Florida Forest Service administers Florida's outdoor burning and forest fire laws. Some burns, such as piles larger than 8 feet in diameter and broadcast acreage burns, require an authorization [ pdf 476.6 KB ] . Burning yard waste does not require an authorization as long as residents meet the following requirements:</p><p>* Meet the required setbacks and no local, city or county ordinances prohibit burning;</p><p>* The yard waste was generated on your property and will fit in an 8-foot diameter pile or non-combustible container;</p><p>* The fire is ignited after 8:00 a.m. central time or 9:00 a.m. eastern time and is extinguished one hour before sunset.</p><p>Yard waste is any vegetative debris such as grass clippings, brush, leaves, tree limbs and palm fronds that are a result of yard maintenance. It is illegal to burn household garbage (including paper products), treated lumber, plastics, rubber materials, tires, pesticides, paint and aerosol containers.</p><p>\"Spring and early summer are the peak of Florida's year-round wildfire season, making it necessary for residents to be extra careful with outdoor burning,\" said Erin Albury, State Forester and Director of the Florida Forest Service. \"With the rainfall below normal and current weather conditions across the state, I urge all residents to understand their role in preventing wildfires and avoiding further tragedy in our state.\"</p><p>All residents should adhere to the following outdoor fire safety requirements:</p><p>* Never leave a fire unattended;</p><p>* Never burn on windy days or when humidity is below 30 percent;</p><p>* Keep a water source and suppression equipment on-hand;</p><p>* Completely extinguish the fire before leaving it.</p><p>Florida Wildfire Awareness Week was created in recognition of Florida's devastating 1998 wildfire season, when more than half a million acres burned, and 337 structures were damaged or destroyed by wildfires. The wildfire threat in North Florida is substantially greater than normal given the nearly 3 million acres impacted and 72 million tons of trees broken, uprooted or blown over by Hurricane Michael in October 2018. Floridians and visitors alike are urged to take action to protect their homes and property before a wildfire starts and be prepared to evacuate if needed. Learn more about burning outdoors in Florida by visiting FDACS.gov/FLForestService.</p><p>The Florida Forest Service, a division of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, manages more than 1 million acres of state forests and provides forest management assistance on more than 17 million acres of private and community forests. The Florida Forest Service is also responsible for protecting homes, forestland and natural resources from the devastating effects of wildfire on more than 26 million acres.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7078427 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7078427</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YKB-FSK1-JC11-11V2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"633\"/><timeReceived>8:25 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 4, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Definitions vary, but tend to go something like this: A Republican In Name Only is a member of the uniparty establishment. This means that politician is part of a ruling elite that is betraying the interests of Americans in almost every important area of policy. RINOs are compliant with the entire rhetorical message of progressive Democrats, from the reality of \"systemic racism\" to the \"climate emergency.\" They offer nothing unique or useful in the way of solutions to real problems, but merely go along with the Democratic policy agenda.</p><p><br/>The entire value proposition of RINOs, if you want to call it that, is that somehow they're able to moderate the worst excesses of the Democrats. So what? At their best, they just delay the agenda of what is possibly the most corrupt concentration of anti-American oligarchs and government careerists in American history. RINOs are worthless, not merely for their cowardice masquerading as moderation, but for their utter lack of alternative solutions.<br/>DINOs, on the other hand, are something completely different. And the emerging breed of Democrats In Name Only coming out of California are something extraordinary. The policies these DINOs are promoting are stimulated by California's status as a fully realized one-party progressive state. They see a dismal reality-unreliable energy, water rationing, traffic gridlock, unaffordable housing, out-of-control homelessness, rampant and unpunished crime, burning forests, and an increasingly worthless system of public education-and all of it is a consequence of progressive politics. They've realized that the progressives will do nothing but make these problems worse.<br/>One of the earliest California Democrats to identify the failures of progressive politics is the noted urban geographer and economist\u00a0Joel Kotkin. About 10 years ago, Kotkin's observations of California politics led him to re-register as an independent, making this lifelong Democrat one of the original\u00a0walkaways. In a\u00a0recent essay\u00a0published by the Claremont Institute, Kotkin describes the emerging political economy in the United States, California in particular. He writes:<br/>The reality of this grim future is already evident in places like California, where the climate change agenda has achieved near religious status and has produced policies that slow growth on the periphery, the one place where middle-class families could afford homes, dropping homeownership rates there for younger people far more than elsewhere.<br/>Kotkin's landmark essay does a superb job of explaining the looming clash between the nationalist oligarchs of China and Russia and the globalist oligarchs in the West. It's much bigger than merely a DINO manifesto. But Kotkin's significance in the context of the rise of the DINOs is how he exemplifies a seismic political shift that has just begun-Democrats have become the party of a corrupt elite, and now those pragmatic and conscientious Democrats who reject the stupefying collateral damage are striking back.<br/>Two young California politicians, both Democrats, are harbingers of a DINO movement that may completely transform politics in America. The first, Michael Shellenberger, ran for governor in California's jungle primary in 2018 and\u00a0came in 9th place. Shellenberger, a prolific writer, has just published a\u00a0blistering essay\u00a0that indicts California's progressive Democrats for destroying the state.<br/>Titled \"Why I Am Not A Progressive,\" Shellenberger's essay is an expos\u00e9 of the abandoned values and failed policies of progressives. Explaining how for decades he identified as a progressive because of their empowering values, Shellenberger writes, \"But now, on all the major issues of the day, the message from progressives is 'No, you can't.'\" He then describes the transition progressives made from a message of empowerment to one of disempowerment, writing:<br/>The reason progressives believe that 'No one is safe,' when it comes to climate change, and that the drug death 'homelessness' crisis is unsolvable, is [that] they are in the grip of a victim ideology characterized by safetyism, learned helplessness, and disempowerment. This isn't really that new. Since the 1960s, the New Left has argued that we can't solve any of our major problems until we overthrow our racist, sexist, and capitalistic system. But for most of my life, up through the election of Obama, there was still a New Deal, 'Yes we can!,' and 'We can do it!' optimism that sat side-by-side with the New Left's fundamentally disempowering critique of the system. That's all gone. On climate change, drug deaths, and cultural issues like racism, the message from progressives is that we are doomed unless we dismantle the institutions responsible for our oppressive, racist system.<br/>These are \"Nixon Goes to China\" moments. Shellenberger supports proposals that most Republicans, much less RINOs, fear to broach. Develop nuclear power. Confine and treat drug addicts and the mentally ill. Dare to pursue controversial policies that will solve the challenge of providing clean energy. Dare to acknowledge that \"safe injection sites\" are not only destroying the neighborhoods where they've been imposed on residents pursuant to the doctrine of \"inclusive zoning,\" but they're also destroying the lives of the addicts themselves.<br/>Perhaps the most surprising and potent expression of DINO disruption to-date is the emergence of 29-year-old\u00a0Kevin Paffrath\u00a0as a viable candidate for governor in the upcoming recall election of Gavin Newsom.<br/>Consider Paffrath's plan for the homeless (all of this can be found on his\u00a0campaign website). He intends to use the National Guard to construct centralized shelters, which would enable the Guard, in conjunction with law enforcement, immediately to remove the homeless from California's streets and parks. Compare this to Newsom's plan to continue with and even expand the corrupt practice of constructing homeless housing at a cost of several hundred thousand dollars per unit, spreading them throughout suburban communities, with minimal behavioral conditions on placement.<br/>Paffrath advocates restricting immigration to people who can support themselves without government assistance.<br/>On water policy, he advocates more reservoirs, desalination, and even proposes building an aqueduct from the Mississippi River to the Colorado River and sharing the water with other states! If you like water, you have to like this guy. As he puts it, \"We can create new jobs and solve problems instead of focusing on buying votes.\"<br/>Paffrath recognizes that it is impossible to transition to green energy immediately. He recognizes it is necessary to increase the efficiency of natural gas power plants and keep them open.<br/>For almost every issue, Paffrath, the DINO, comes up with solutions that the average RINO would reject out of hand. He has evaluated the forest fire epidemic and correctly identified the difficulty of getting approval for controlled burns as one of the primary causes of California's overgrown, tinder dry forests. And then he goes one step further, observing that the cost of controlled burns is $32 per acre, whereas it costs $1,500 per acre to fight a wildfire.<br/>On\u00a0education, Paffrath calls for \"Future schools,\" a model where partnerships would be formed with businesses to offer students a practical education including vocational training. He suggests these alternative schools can also accommodate homeless people and help rehabilitate prisoners.<br/>Returning to the theme of common sense over and over again, Paffrath asks, \"even if we were to spend money on infrastructure to reduce our traffic problems, why don't we spend the money where we actually have traffic?\" Bye bye, high speed rail. On housing, Paffrath has identified 482 separate regulations affecting home construction. His solutions are politically eclectic. He wants to deregulate to encourage more construction, including energy producing homes located near wind farms and solar farms (personally I'll skip the home by the turbines). Yet he recognizes the importance of protecting existing local communities from having high-density housing forced upon them.<br/>DINOs defy easy categorization. They are ideologically eclectic. Unlike the irrelevant RINOs, they have a bold and practical policy agenda. If DINOs of this caliber multiply across the nation and start to win elections, they will find themselves making common cause not only with smart disaffected Democrats, but with much of the Republican base. And that, as history has demonstrated, is a recipe for realignment.<br/>This article originally appeared on the website American Greatness.<br/>\u00a0*\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0 \u00a0*<br/>Edward Ring is a contributing editor for the California Policy Center.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-143823</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63GX-W931-DY1R-B2SP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1452\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2021 California Policy, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>California Policy Center</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 30, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>LATEST CALIFORNIA NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Democrats in Name Only</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>DINOs</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Ed Ring</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Edward Ring</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Election</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Kevin Paffrath</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Recall Newsom</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Republicans</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>RINO</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Education Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Alternative Placements</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTMyMDc5M0RERTE0NDcwMEFGOTk5NERFMTIyMEE1Mjg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzBCRkVBRDQ2MUYxNDlGMUFGQzc3N0ZCMDYyMzc5NTA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TCX</classCode><className>US DEMOCRATIC PARTY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002003</classCode><className>ELECTIONS &amp;

Since January, nearly 750 wildfires have burned more than 8,200 acres in Florida. Most were caused by people. Currently, the are 62 active wildfires burning over 1,740 acres across the state.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wildfire Awareness Week is an important reminder of the devastating effect wildfires can have on our communities and natural resources, said Commissioner Nikki Fried. As we continue to navigate through these difficult and uncertain times, its critical for everyone to be aware, use extreme caution, and follow the law, ensuring the safety of your family, communities and our firefighters.</p><p>The leading causes of wildfires this time of year are escaped yard debris burning and unauthorized debris burns. The Florida Forest Service administers Floridas outdoor burning and forest fire laws. Some burns, such as piles larger than 8 feet in diameter and broadcast acreage burns, require an authorization [ 476.6 kB ] . Burning yard waste does not require an authorization as long as residents meet the following requirements:</p><p>Meet the required setbacks and no local, city or county ordinances prohibit burning;</p><p>The yard waste was generated on your property and will fit in an 8-foot diameter pile or non-combustible container;</p><p>The fire is ignited after 8:00 a.m. central time or 9:00 a.m. eastern time and is extinguished one hour before sunset.</p><p>Yard waste is any vegetative debris such as grass clippings, brush, leaves, tree limbs and palm fronds that are a result of yard maintenance. It is illegal to burn household garbage (including paper products), treated lumber, plastics, rubber materials, tires, pesticides, paint and aerosol containers.</p><p>Spring and early summer are the peak of Floridas year-round wildfire season, making it necessary for residents to be extra careful with outdoor burning, said Erin Albury, State Forester and Director of the Florida Forest Service. With the rainfall below normal and current weather conditions across the state, I urge all residents to understand their role in preventing wildfires and avoiding further tragedy in our state.</p><p>All residents should adhere to the following outdoor fire safety requirements:</p><p>Never leave a fire unattended;</p><p>Never burn on windy days or when humidity is below 30 percent;</p><p>Keep a water source and suppression equipment on-hand;</p><p>Completely extinguish the fire before leaving it.</p><p>Florida Wildfire Awareness Week was created in recognition of Floridas devastating 1998 wildfire season, when more than half a million acres burned, and 337 structures were damaged or destroyed by wildfires. The wildfire threat in North Florida is substantially greater than normal given the nearly 3 million acres impacted and 72 million tons of trees broken, uprooted or blown over by Hurricane Michael in October 2018. Floridians and visitors alike are urged to take action to protect their homes and property before a wildfire starts and be prepared to evacuate if needed. Learn more about burning outdoors in Florida by visiting FDACS.gov/FLForestService.</p><p>The Florida Forest Service, a division of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, manages more than 1 million acres of state forests and provides forest management assistance on more than 17 million acres of private and community forests. The Florida Forest Service is also responsible for protecting homes, forestland and natural resources from the devastating effects of wildfire on more than 26 million acres.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123601140</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YKC-8KT1-DYTH-G04Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"620\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 3, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The critique of the Hayes family property is specious (\"Big landowner feels heat for Greenwood fire,\" Aug. 26). While 12,000 acres seems large, it is minimal as you consider the scale of the upstate forest fire. Other than clear-cutting a safe zone around structures, wildfire will still burn through timbered land and forest-floor slash and other vegetation will not slow down its progress. A nearly single species forest allows the spruce budworm to ravage the land as it easily spreads. This same scenario is being repeated in the western U.S. as the pine bark beetle has devastated hundreds of millions of acres of pine trees.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The solution here? Periodic controlled burns and targeted logging can create a patchwork of mixed species and age-class differences. This also has the benefit to wildlife as a multi-age forest provides diverse food sources.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We can never \"preserve\" nature in a static postcard condition. Ecological succession is a reality and we need to understand it and work with the natural phenomenon. If we don't, nature will do it for us.</p><p>Joe Polunc, Waconia</p><p>\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7</p><p>One might question why the U.S. Forest Service does not practice what it preaches. \"Big landowner feels heat for Greenwood fire\" is a very one-sided article and portrays those private owners as irresponsible property managers. Please share with all how many acres are owned by the state and federal government in the Superior National Forest. Please explain what percentage of dead trees state agencies have cut down and chipped up. They are great at giving suggestions yet poor at managing our renewable resource. It is time for their hands to be untied and the responsibility of our forest management be squarely put in their laps. There has been too much interference by environmentalists and lawyers and politicians.</p><p>I own land not far from the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness that was torched by the Ham Lake fire. I was not compensated for our losses due to government's inability to keep the forest healthy. If you think the Greenwood fire is bad, you have yet to experience when many more thousands of acres in the BWCA ignites. God save us all, but it is inevitable unless logging is resumed as soon as possible. A forest is a living breathing wonder but when it dies, it is a huge liability.</p><p>Nancy Anderson, Bloomington</p><p>BIRDS</p><p>Safe habitat is crucial</p><p>When's the last time you passed a vacant field and heard the song of a meadowlark or a bobolink? Do you remember when it was common to hear and see them? Are you aware that there is a vacant lot right here in Maplewood that has not only nesting meadowlarks and bobolinks but at least a couple other dozen grassland birds, including the endangered Henslow's sparrow? (\"A vacant lot, a golf course, an outcry,\" Aug. 26.) This rare grassland may be lost to us and to the birds who live there. Kudos to Maplewood Mayor Marylee Abrams, who wants the county to wait upon the ecology report by the firm they hired to complete a natural resources study. That report will not be completed until sometime later this year. Abrams indicates that the report will definitely influence her and the city's position on what happens to this vacant field that isn't \"vacant\" at all.

They have survived one. They did not exist as a life form in the prior events. Furthermore, had they been around at the other extinctions, they may not have survived them. The way the author phrases their survival - \"Modern bird species, like those you see in your yard, stem from that 1% of life that survived all five events\" - would also imply that humans have also survived five extinctions, because we too come from that 1%, which is as incorrect as saying birds have.</p><p>The headline \"Birds are veterans of mass extinction\" is very misleading, as well as being a very unscientific statement.</p><p>I would welcome a follow-up article correcting these statements.</p><p>Recent volumes that might help in this matter are \"The Ends of the World: Volcanic Apocalypses, Lethal Oceans, and Our Quest to Understand Earth's Past Mass Extinctions\" by Peter Brannen, as well as \"The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History\" by Elizabeth Kolbert.</p><p>Both do admirable jobs at grappling with the geology and science behind the extinction events.</p><p>Bob Reilly, Minneapolis</p><p>CLIMATE CHANGE</p><p>Southwest light rail would help</p><p>A recent letter claims that building the Southwest light-rail line \"would increase greenhouse gas emissions compared to the no-build option\" according to its final environmental impact statement (EIS) and puts the Twin Cities on the wrong side of the campaign for cleaner power (Readers Write, Aug. 26). This is misleading.</p><p>While the final EIS predicts a \"temporary increase in greenhouse gases from the construction equipment and vehicles,\" it also finds a long-term impact of \"net greenhouse-gas emissions reduction in the region and beneficial [greenhouse gas] and climate change effects.\" He also implies that the transition to electric vehicles will outpace the transition to renewable sources of electricity, which seems doubtful.</p><p>Building green infrastructure and living more densely are essential strategies for reducing global warming. Future generations will thank us for building SWLRT.</p><p>Richard Adair, Minneapolis</p><p>POLICING</p><p>At last, some intellectual honesty</p><p>I write to commend retired Hennepin County public defender Richard Carlson for his commentary of Aug. 26 (\"Pass the amendment and jettison bad cops,\" Opinion Exchange). I often disagree with his conclusions, as I do this time. I do, however, commend his intellectual honesty.</p><p>Attorneys are trained to evaluate the facts. However, when they are in advocate mode they only acknowledge the facts that support their position. Carlson explains his support for the public safety amendment while also acknowledging its shortcomings.</p><p>Advocates for the amendment usually ignore or gloss over the current consequences of a demoralized and depleted Minneapolis Police Department on the increase of violent crime in the city. Carlson does not. Still, he is ready to bet on the need for the ambiguous public safety charter amendment as necessary to resolve the seemingly intractable problems in the MPD. We disagree, but with integrity.</p><p>Gregory Scott Hestness, Minneapolis</p><p>The writer is retired chief of the University of Minnesota Police Department and retired deputy chief of the Minneapolis Police Department.</p><p>\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7</p><p>The article \"Second attorney asks to ban livestream for trial in George Floyd killing\" brought up some interesting points between the potential consequences of livestreaming a high-profile court case, as we learned in the trial of Derek Chauvin. Leita Walker and Emmy Parsons in Bloomberg Law News in March noted that audiovisual coverage is not allowed during the guilt/innocence phase of criminal trials, according to Minnesota court rules. However, due to the pandemic, spectators were not allowed, which meant livestreaming was.</p><p>Livestreaming allows for fair trials open to the public, as required in the Constitution. While it is crucial to have the witnesses feel safe enough to testify, not livestreaming the trial of the officers who contributed to the brutality and death in this case is an injustice to the integrity of the legal process. Police accountability is an issue, given that prior to Floyd's death, only one officer in Minnesota history had been held accountable and convicted of murder. The public should be allowed to see that the offenders are held responsible for their actions and are fairly dealt with, because police historically have been free from such accountability.</p><p>Molly Clarke, Minneapolis</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRIB-MERLIN64136067</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRIB2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63H3-D921-JC8F-K3JF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8384</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1335\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Star Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN)</publicationName><edition>METRO EDITION</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 30, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>FOREST SERVICE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>OPINION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>Business &amp;

General Assembly last fall, Greta Thunberg found herself constantly interrupted by world leaders, including U.N. chief Ant\u00c3\u00b3nio Guterres and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had formed a queue to speak to her and take selfies. \"Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister of New Zealand, waits in line but doesn't quite make it before it's time for the event to start,\" Thunberg recalls. Such surreal memories for a teenager form the opening to a 75-minute monologue broadcast on Swedish public radio Saturday that soon shifts to the serious matter of climate change that's at the heart of Thunberg's work. The 17-year-old has become a global figurehead of the youth climate movement since she started her one-woman protests outside the Swedish Parliament in 2018. Thunberg's blunt words to presidents and prime ministers, peppered with scientific facts about the need to urgently cut greenhouse gas emissions, have won her praise and awards, but also the occasional pushback and even death threats. </p><p>To Thunberg's disappointment, her message doesn't seem to be getting through even to those leaders who applaud her work. The message is certainly stark: Thunberg cites a U.N. report that estimates the world can only keep emitting the current amount of carbon dioxide for the next 7 \u00c2\u00bd years. Any longer and it becomes impossible to meet the Paris climate accord's ambitious goal of keeping global temperatures from rising by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) this century. Most governments refuse to accept the idea that the world has only a fixed \"carbon budget\" left, because it implies that a sudden shift away from fossil fuel will need to happen in just a few years. \"Do you remember the London Olympics? 'Gangnam Style' or the first 'Hunger Games' movie?\" Thunberg asks her audience on Swedish radio station P1. \"Those things all happened about seven or eight years ago. That's the amount of time we're talking about.\" Her monthslong journey from Sweden to America's West Coast and back -- by train, sailboat and an electric car loaned by Arnold Schwarzenegger -- highlighted the impact that global warming is already having, from melting glaciers to fiercer forest fire seasons, Thunberg said. It also opened her eyes to economic and social disparities affecting in particular Indigenous, Black and minority communities, voices she has sought to amplify in the climate debate. \"The climate and sustainability crisis is not a fair crisis,\" Thunberg says. \"The ones who'll be hit hardest from its consequences are often the ones who have done the least to cause the problem in the first place.\" Her frustration extends to journalists who want to know about \"the real Greta\" but interrupt her when she talks about the science of climate change. \"People want something simple and concrete, and they want me to be naive, angry, childish and emotional,\" Thunberg says. \"That is the story that sells and creates the most clicks.\" Thunberg blasts governments and businesses that use what she calls \"creative accounting\" to make their emissions look lower than they are and apply the word \"green\" to industries that are not. \"The emperors are naked. Every single one,\" she says. \"It turns out our whole society is just one big nudist party.\" Some critics have accused Thunberg of being a doom-monger. But she insists that her message is one of hope, not despair. \"There are signs of change, of awakening,\" she says. \"Just take the Me Too movement, Black Lives Matter or the school strike movement [for climate action], for instance,\" she says, adding that the world has passed a \"social tipping point\" where it becomes impossible to look away. The global response to the COVID-19 pandemic may provide a necessary wake-up call, she suggests. \"The corona tragedy of course has no long-term positive effects on the climate, apart from one thing only: namely the insight into how you should perceive and treat an emergency. Because during the corona crisis, we suddenly act with necessary force.\" -- Frank Jordans, Associated Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CLIWRE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CLIWRE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60D6-T7M1-F0YC-P008-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388351</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"679\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLC</copyright><publicationName>ClimateWire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 22, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But in a split second Friday, the festive gathering in northern Israel turned into one of the country\u2019s worst-ever tragedies, with at least 45 people crushed to death and dozens injured in a stampede.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The disaster prompted a national outpouring of grief as devastated families rushed to identify their dead relatives and bury them ahead of the Jewish Sabbath. There was also anger toward authorities over an accident that experts had long feared, further clouding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s hopes of remaining in office.</p><p>Netanyahu, who briefly visited Mount Meron at midday, offered his condolences. \u201cIn these moments our people unite and that is what we are doing at this moment as well,\u201d he said.</p><p>He announced Sunday would be a day of national mourning and said he had joined the masses of people who donated blood for the victims. Israel's President Reuven Rivlin lit 45 candles in honor of the dead.

But in a split second Friday, the festive gathering in northern Israel turned into one of the country\u2019s worst-ever tragedies, with at least 45 people crushed to death and dozens injured in a stampede.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The disaster prompted a national outpouring of grief as devastated families rushed to identify their dead relatives and bury them ahead of the Jewish Sabbath. There was also anger toward authorities over an accident that experts had long feared, further clouding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s hopes of remaining in office.</p><p>Netanyahu, who briefly visited Mount Meron at midday, offered his condolences. \u201cIn these moments our people unite and that is what we are doing at this moment as well,\u201d he said.</p><p>He announced Sunday would be a day of national mourning and said he had joined the masses of people who donated blood for the victims.

It was one of the country's deadliest civilian disasters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The stampede began when large numbers of people thronged a narrow tunnel-like passage during the event, according to witnesses and video footage. People began falling on top of each other near the end of the walkway, as they descended slippery metal stairs, witnesses said.</p><p>One of the injured, Avraham Leibe, told Israeli public broadcaster Kan that a crush of people trying to descend the mountain caused a \"general bedlam\" on a slippery metal slope followed by stairs. \"Nobody managed to halt,\" he said from a hospital bed. \"I saw one after the other fall.\"</p><p>Video footage showed large numbers of people, most of them black-clad ultra-Orthodox men, squeezed in the tunnel. Initial reports and witnesses said police barricades had prevented people from exiting quickly.</p><p>The stampede occurred during the celebrations of Lag BaOmer at Mount Meron, the first mass religious gathering to be held legally since Israel lifted nearly all restrictions related to the coronavirus pandemic. The country has seen cases plummet since launching one of the world's most successful vaccination campaigns late last year.</p><p>Lag BaOmer draws tens of thousands of people, most of them ultra-Orthodox Jews, each year to honor Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai, a 2nd century sage and mystic who is believed to be buried there. Large crowds traditionally light bonfires, pray and dance as part of the celebrations.</p><p>This year, media estimated the crowd at about 100,000 people.</p><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who briefly visited Mount Meron around midday Friday, said it was \"one of the worst disasters that has befallen the state of Israel\" and offered condolences to the families. He said Sunday would be a day of national mourning.</p><p>Netanyahu was jeered by dozens of ultra-Orthodox protesters, who blamed the government and police for the tragedy.</p><p>Velvel Brevda, a rabbi who witnessed the stampede, accused police of putting up barriers that had prevented people from leaving through exits that were usually open in past years.</p><p>\"Where should we leave from?\" he said. \"And the officers who were there couldn't care less.\"</p><p>He said the government was responsible for the deaths of \"beautiful holy Jews that were killed here for no reason whatsoever, just to prove a point that they're in charge of this place instead of the Orthodox Jews being in charge.\"</p><p>At least 45 people were killed, according to the Israeli Health Ministry, with four people remaining in critical condition. In the immediate aftermath of the stampede, rescue workers collected the bodies, wrapped them in white covers and laid them side by side on the ground at the site.</p><p>Bodies were later taken to Israel's central forensic pathology institute for identification.</p><p>Efforts were still under way to identify some of the victims and connect families with missing relatives. In the night from Thursday to Friday, cell phone coverage around Mount Meron had collapsed for hours and emergency hotlines were overwhelmed with phone calls.</p><p>In the overwhelmingly ultra-Orthodox city of Bnei Brak, near Tel Aviv, officials were working with healthcare workers to connect the families of the missing. \"The picture is slowly becoming clearer,\" Kivi Hess, a municipal spokesman, told Channel 13 TV.</p><p>In a race against time, a number of funerals were to be held before sundown Friday, the start of the Jewish Sabbath when burials do not take place. The country's figurehead president, Reuven Rivlin, lit 45 memorial candles to honor the dead.</p><p>The death toll at Mount Meron exceeded the 44 people killed in a 2010 forest fire. That had previously been believed to be the deadliest civilian tragedy in the country's history.</p><p>Zaki Heller, spokesman for the Magen David Adom rescue service, said 150 people had been hurt in the stampede.</p><p>Heller told Israel Army Radio that \"no one had ever dreamed\" something like this could happen. \"In one moment, we went from a happy event to an immense tragedy,\" he said.</p><p>The Justice Ministry said the police's internal investigations department was launching a probe into possible criminal misconduct by officers.</p><p>The deadly stampede was also bound to have political reverberations at a time of great uncertainty following an inconclusive March election, the fourth in two years.</p><p>Netanyahu has so far been unsuccessful in forming a governing coalition, and his time for doing so runs out early next week. His political rivals, including former allies bent on ending his 12-year rule, will then get a chance to try to cobble together an alliance from a patchwork of left-wing, centrist and hawkish parties.</p><p>Netanyahu needs the continued support of ultra-Orthodox parties, his long-time allies, if he wants to keep faint hopes alive of staying in power.</p><p>Israeli media reported Friday that earlier this month, Netanyahu assured ultra-Orthodox politicians in a meeting that the Lag BaOmer celebrations would take place with few limitations.</p><p>The reports said this decision was supported by Cabinet ministers and police, despite objections by health officials who warned of a risk of renewed coronavirus infections.</p><p>Last year, observances on Mount Meron were limited due to the pandemic.</p><p>At the start of this year's celebrations, Public Security Minister Amir Ohana, police chief Yaakov Shabtai and other top officials visited the event and met with police, who had deployed 5,000 extra forces to maintain order.</p><p>Condolences were sent by foreign leaders and diplomats, including the U.S. charge d'affaires. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wrote on Twitter that his \"thoughts are with the Israeli people and those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.\"</p><p>The European Union conveyed \"deepest condolences to families and friends of the victims\" and wished a speedy recovery to the injured. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said his country stands by Israel after the \"terrifying news from Mount Meron.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">By Associated Press Writer Josef Federman.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.tampabay.com/resizer/QpfoziO4DTkD9XU9t2vP-nN6I90=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tbt/JEZ35W2NZVGJFOWVW5A4TXUB4U.jpg\">See image link</url><br/>Israeli security officials and rescuers stand around the bodies of victims who died during a Lag Ba'Omer celebrations at Mt.

Yet no one knows with certainty what's on the horizon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What does it mean for a virus to become endemic? How long does immunity from vaccination or infection last? When you wake up with a sore throat, what type of test can indicate whether you have allergies or COVID-19? Do you still need to wear a mask? And most importantly: When will this all end?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Right now, the virus is trying to arrive at a successful strategy,\" said David Relman, MD, the Thomas C. and Joan M. Merigan Professor, professor of microbiology and immunology, and a former president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. \"Viruses just want to replicate and persist in a population, and what this virus looks like three years from now is probably still different from what it will look like in five to 10 years.\"</p><p>Since March 11, 2020, more than 6 million people have died of COVID-19, which is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In the United States alone, the death toll is approaching 1 million. Recent changes in Centers for Disease Control guidelines and waning commitment from the public on mitigation efforts like masking and distancing, coupled with a fall in hospitalizations and deaths, mean that many parts of the country are returning to business as usual in what is still a very unusual time.</p><p>If it's endemic, is that good?</p><p>There's no sign the virus is going away anytime soon. Nevertheless, many of us cling to the hope that the harm it can cause will decrease that COVID-19 will become nothing more worrisome than the common cold. This scenario is what many people think of when they hear the term endemic.</p><p>But, in reality, endemic doesn't mean harmless. Tuberculosis and HIV two well-known endemic diseases together cause millions of deaths each year around the world. Another endemic disease, influenza, not only kills hundreds of thousands of people globally each year, but it also periodically mutates to cause full-blown pandemics, like the 1918 Spanish influenza, which is estimated to have killed 50 million people worldwide.</p><p>Endemicity is also not certain.</p><p>\"An endemic relationship speaks to a degree of adaptation that allows a stable co-existence,\" Relman said. \"In many cases, epidemics fizzle out after a year or two if the infectious agent is unsuccessful in establishing this relationship. It's a real crapshoot to see if SARS-CoV-2 has what it takes to adapt successfully, and we will need to watch and wait and see if this happens.\"</p><p>Herd immunity which occurs when viral transmission is effectively stopped because enough people in a population have become immune is another hopeful term. Immunity can be achieved either by recovering from infection or by getting vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. But that immunity appears to wane within weeks or months, leaving people susceptible to reinfection or breakthrough infections.</p><p>\"When you talk about herd immunity, you have to ask yourself what that means at a global population level,\" Relman said. \"Whose herd do you mean? And to what degree of immunity? The unvaccinated will eventually accumulate some degree of immunity, but we may well continue to see unequal outcomes in severe disease and deaths between vaccinated and unvaccinated people for some period of time.\"</p><p>As of early March, the Centers for Disease Control reports that 65% of the U.S. population was fully vaccinated, but only 50% of those eligible for boosters had received one. Some vaccine-hesitant people feel that immunity obtained through infection is preferable to vaccination. But becoming infected is a gamble.</p><p>\"Infection does induce immunity, and in some cases this can be long-lasting,\" said Bali Pulendran, PhD, professor of microbiology and immunology and of pathology. \"But no one can predict how their body will respond to infection. In some cases, infection causes severe disease that can be fatal in a small minority of people. Would you do a bungee jump if you were told that the risk of dying was 0.5%?\"</p><p>Navigating COVID-19 testing</p><p>Since the beginning of the pandemic, Stanford Medicine has been at the epicenter of diagnostic and research testing to track the spread of the virus and the way our immune systems respond to infection and vaccination. Recently, the Stanford Clinical Virology Laboratory completed its 1 millionth PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. And last week, the laboratory launched a new test to track antibody levels in infected or vaccinated people a critical way to monitor how immunity wanes. The lab is the first among regulated clinical testing laboratories nationwide to offer the test.</p><p>\"This is the same assay that was used during clinical trials of several COVID-19 vaccines, and it is calibrated to the WHO international standard,\" said Benjamin Pinsky, MD, PhD, medical director of the laboratory. \"Until now, assays from different companies would give varying results that are difficult to interpret. Now, we will have harmonized data that can be used to guide clinical and policy decisions.\" The test is primarily being used to determine whether immunocompromised people have mounted a protective antibody response after vaccination and to identify those who may benefit from additional boosters or who are at greater risk of severe disease.</p><p>\"Of course, whether a vaccine will provide protection also depends on the degree of exposure a person has to the virus,\" said Scott Boyd, MD, PhD, associate professor of pathology, who recently published a study with research scientist Katharina Roltgen and other Stanford colleagues comparing antibody responses to infection versus vaccination. \"If you're sitting 2 feet away from a highly contagious person, and neither of you is wearing a mask, you will have more exposure than if you were still masking and distancing.\"</p><p>But how do you know if you are contagious, or even infected? Pinsky cautions that although at-home rapid tests, or antigen tests, are useful, they have their limitations.</p><p>\"People need to remember that a negative result does not rule out an infection,\" Pinsky said. \"They are useful only when the result is positive. If the rapid test is negative, you could still be infected, and you could still transmit the virus to others. I think it's hard for people to wrap their minds around that.\"</p><p>Rapid tests are appropriate for people who have symptoms of COVID-19, including a fever, sore throat, runny nose and muscle aches, Boyd and Pinsky said. \"If the result is positive, you have confirmed that you are infected with SARS-CoV-2,\" Boyd said. \"If it's negative, and your symptoms continue, you should seek out a PCR test.\"</p><p>\"Antigen tests can also be used to track the course of a known infection, and they can facilitate an earlier release from isolation and return to work,\" Pinsky added.</p><p>To mask or not to mask</p><p>Pinsky envisions a reduction in demand for at-home COVID-19 testing and a decline in availability of the tests as manufacturers are confronted with reduced demand and additional regulatory requirements from the Food and Drug Administration.</p><p>\"At some point, we're not going to be isolating everyone who has COVID-19,\" Pinsky said. \"When that happens, the value of testing will be decreased if the result doesn't affect patient management. We don't test every person with respiratory symptoms for the flu during influenza season because for most people it wouldn't change their care.\"</p><p>As mask requirements and restrictions on gatherings have rolled back, the burden of disease prevention has fallen more squarely on those who have the most to lose the immunocompromised and those with children too young to be vaccinated.</p><p>\"Leaving mitigation efforts up to people at high risk means they are going to need even higher levels of protection,\" said Abraar Karan, MD, an infectious disease fellow at Stanford Medicine who has advocated for increased availability of high-quality N95 masks. \"This is an ethically fraught position. But pragmatically it is what is happening. Unfortunately, public health decisions often run counter to health equity, which inherently means allocating more resources to the most vulnerable.\"</p><p>Even in healthy people, infection can carry significant risks.</p><p>\"I'm concerned about the long-term effects on the brain, heart and other organ systems,\" said Karan, noting recent data suggesting an association between COVID-19 infection and brain inflammation and vascular effects, including erectile dysfunction. \"It's concerning that some people no longer consider infection to be a big deal.\"</p><p>Researchers at Stanford Medicine are monitoring people who have recovered from COVID-19 infection as part of the National Institutes of Health's RECOVER Initiative to learn more about the lasting effects of the infection. Last spring, Stanford Medicine launched a clinic dedicated to helping people manage symptoms that can include fatigue, shortness of breath and cognitive dysfunction, or \"brain fog.\"</p><p>The long game</p><p>The trauma of the pandemic has taught us valuable lessons and reinforced some we already knew. The next pandemic won't be a surprise, at least to infectious disease experts like Yvonne Maldonado, MD, the Taube Professor in Global Health and Infectious Diseases. \"It's not if, but when,\" Maldonado said. \"We've seen multiple outbreaks of newly emerging diseases over the past 50 years, including several other coronaviruses. It happens as predictably as lightning starting a forest fire. We are going to need to think smart and move fast.\"</p><p>Airborne viruses are particularly difficult to combat. \"We need long-term solutions like increased air filtration in workplaces and schools, and access to high-quality, reusable masks,\" Karan said. Conditions in the developing world are even more dire.</p><p>\"Most of our mitigation efforts have been rolled out with no thought to equity whatsoever,\" said Maldonado, a professor of pediatric infectious diseases and of health research and policy. \"Half of all the available vaccines have gone exclusively to high-income countries, while over 75% of people in sub-Saharan Africa have little or no access to places to even wash their hands.\"</p><p>Low levels of vaccination mean the virus has easy access to reservoirs of susceptible people in whom it can mutate and develop into new variants. But mutations can also happen when the virus is forced to adapt to a new challenge, such as the immunity developed after vaccination, Relman noted. \"Another challenge the virus hasn't faced much yet are the drugs we are developing to treat infection,\" he said. \"As we begin using oral medications that people can take outside the hospital, it wouldn't surprise me if we see some seriously resistant variants. That doesn't mean they will be more virulent, though, just more resistant to treatment.\"</p><p>On the whole, Maldonado said, she is hopeful. \"Over the past two years, we have conquered so many obstacles. In one year we developed and approved a vaccine that is nearly 100% effective, and we have now administered nearly 11 billion doses around the world. This is a triumph. And we are going to continue to get better at making new vaccines.\"</p><p>Improvements on the horizon include increased understanding about the most effective dose amounts and schedules for specific population and age groups, and new technologies and vaccine platforms that can rapidly pivot to combat new viral variants or even new viruses that might drive the next pandemic.</p><p>Even with these advances, most of us have probably have more COVID-19 vaccinations in our future.</p><p>\"Until we learn how to enhance the durability of vaccine-induced immunity, we may very well need a booster at least annually, or perhaps even more frequently,\" Pulendran said. \"There will almost certainly be a COVID-29, or a COVID-50, so we will continue to keep our eyes on the ball and innovate new vaccines that are globally accessible.\"</p><p>How many more anniversaries of this pandemic will we have to commemorate?</p><p>\"I don't know many people who think that this virus will end human civilization,\" Relman said. \"But everyone who latches onto the idea that the virus will fade away is forgetting that there are almost certainly going to be major bumps in the road, and those bumps could be painful. Two years is not long enough to know how this story ends.\"</p><p>Krista Conger</p><p>Krista Conger is a Senior Science Writer in the Office of Communications.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125081992</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6504-TY21-JCBF-S4VG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2126\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"03\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>March 11, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Now, one early-stage biotech is teaming up with a Danish drugmaker to advance an inhaled version of a tapeworm medapproved since 1982that could strike the disease before it has a chance to progress past the lungs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Denmark's Union Therapeutics in August snared the option for a worldwide exclusive license of TFF Pharmaceuticals' dry powder niclosamidea tapeworm med that has shown promise against COVID-19made using the Austin, Texas-based biotech's thin-film freezing technology.</p><p>Union has pledged upward of $210 million for potential development, regulatory and sales milestones as well as single-digit royalties, the companies said in a release. In return, it will receive dry powder and oral formulations of niclosamide straight from TFF, which prefers to keep its patented thin-film freezing platform close to the vest, TFF's CEO Glenn Mattes said in an interview. Union will be on the hook for clinical development duties and potential marketing if the drug wins a green light.</p><p>The companies will collaborate to secure government funding for the treatment as a potential COVID-19 therapy, with TFF pursuing fast-tracked approval in the U.S., Dale Christensen, director of clinical development at TFF, said.</p><p>Stateside, the company is plotting an accelerated trial to pin down safety and dosing information; TFF aims to study a single ascending dose followed by multiple ascending doses of both its oral and inhaled niclosamide formulations in healthy adults. Once that trial wraps, the company aims to move into trials in COVID-19 patients, ideally in about eight to nine months, Christensen said.</p><p>Meanwhile, Union, which boasts six years of niclosamide experience in other treatment fields, kicked off its own clinical study of an inhaled formulation earlier this year. That compoundan optimized salt form of the drugis currently in phase 1 trials for use as an inhaled treatment for COVID-19.</p><p>Union hopes the collaboration with TFF will broaden its current niclosamide offerings, not only in COVID-19, but in other diseases, too. Plus, the team-up could help usher in the global rollout of a drug for earlier-stage COVID-19, filling a gap in the treatment options that have so far been authorized.</p><p>Like Union, TFF has been working with niclosamide for an extended period of time and has taken an interesting approach to the formulation of niclosamide for COVID-19,\" Rasmus Toft-Kehler, CEO and co-founder of Union, said. \"This will allow us to maximize the likelihood of getting the best possible product to as many COVID-19 patient segments in the shortest possible time frame.\"</p><p>That \"interesting approach\" is the product of TFF's patented thin-film freezing platform. Developed by the Division of Molecular Pharmaceutics and Drug Delivery at the University of Texas, Austin, the rapid-freezing technology improves the absorption rate of poorly water-soluble drugs, translating into the development of dry powder drug formulations especially well-suited for inhalation. What's more, dry powder formulations created with the thin-film freezing platform have strong aerodynamic properties, allowing drug particles to reach as much as 75% of the deep lungan enticing target for diseases like COVID-19.</p><p>By delivering a treatment like niclosamide straight to a patient's lungs, TFF's thin-film formulations could quash COVID-19 before the disease has the chance to spread to other parts of the body.</p><p>\"Only late in [COVID-19] does the virus start escaping the lungs and get into the blood,\" Christensen said. \"It makes sense to provide the drug to the lung, where the virus is specifically replicating. It's far easier to throw a bucket of water to douse a campfire instead of waiting to have to put out a forest fire.\"</p><p>Beyond the Union deal, TFF thinks its thin-film freezing technology could have major implications for the development of other COVID-19 treatments, and even vaccines and diagnostics.</p><p>The technology can be used to create room temperature-stable versions of vaccines, which could allow distributors to break the cold chain, Christensen said. Plus, thin-film freezing can be used to make absorbable antibody formulations.</p><p>TFF has already forged three separate deals to expand its thin-film freezing tech across multiple treatment fields, including a partnership in the cannabinoid space, a tie-up with the University of Georgia for a broad-spectrum flu vaccine and a deal with the U.S. Army to develop two specific monoclonal antibodies as antiviral countermeasures, Mattes said. 2020 Global Data Point.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHARMO-183116500</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHARMO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60P8-WFD1-F11P-X1NJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428557</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"770\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Global Data Point.

To protect themselves from this danger, the inhabitants have to prepare their houses immediately:</p><p>* Pick up flammable items from outside your home . Patio chairs, tables or furniture, toys, rugs, and trash cans should be put inside.</p><p>* Collect flammable vegetation. This includes those outside and in drains.</p><p>* Leave an outside light on outside . Your home must remain visible at night.</p><p>* Talk to your neighbors.

There is an ongoing risk of key water treatment infrastructure found in evacuated areas north of Santa Cruz County. The city is providing additional resources and regional fire and relief resources. The city's 8-acre Scotts Valley known as Skypark is serving as the primary CAL-FIRE (fire department) operation center for the management of the entire county.

Most commonly known as drones, they have been used since the 1900s, initially by the US military for target practice.</p><p>Military applications still dominate the global UAV market, but the achievements of UAVs in military operations have boosted demand for drones in North America, Middle East and the Asia-Pacific. UAVs are becoming a key element in the intelligence and surveillance operations of military and fast expanding in other combative areas as well.</p><p>The fast development of the UAV global market is having a big impact on a range of mainstream industries. Apart from defense, applications also include environmental management, crisis management, agriculture, policing and crowd monitoring, civil engineering, fisheries protection, disaster management, telecommunications maintenance, oil and gas exploration, mineral exploration, mine safety, geophysical surveys and mapping.</p><p>The UAV market has traditionally been narrowly focused but it is rapidly diversifying. Given the pace at which technology and the effectiveness of aircraft are improving, and as sensor and automation technologies mature, commercial applications will rapidly grow over the next ten years.</p><p>1.2 Market Scope</p><p>The UAV sector is set to be the sector with the most dynamic growth in the aerospace industry globally in this decade. According to the Teal Group, global spending on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) programs is expected to more than triple over the next decade in military, commercial, and consumer markets.</p><p>In light of solid growth rates, the Teal Group forecasts global spending is expected to touch $20.3 billion by 2025. The civil UAS market is expected to grow faster than the military market over the next decade. The worldwide military UAS spending over the next decade is estimated to be US$216.5 billion. Of which, procurement spending will amount to US$162.2 billion and research spending will amount to US$72.5 billion. The US is expected to account for about 81% of the total military R&amp;D spending and about 48% of military procurement through to 2030.</p><p>The high level of military R&amp;D spending is forecast to be due to the bigger and higher-value systems procured by the US. The military UAS market growth will be led by unmanned combat aerial vehicles and high-altitude long endurance UAVs. The largest market segment over the next decade will be High Altitude Long Endurance UAVs, which will account for a third of the period's sales.</p><p>The civil UAS will be the most attractive market this decade as commercial applications take off and governments adopt UAVs for new roles in border security and public safety. The worldwide civil UAS market is expected to reach US$19.8 billion by 2031, from US$7.2 billion in 2022, according to the Teal Group. Over the coming decade, the civil market will grow at a CAGR of 9.1% and will generate US$139 billion in revenues. Civil UAS promises to be the most dynamic growth sector with commercial segment expected to lead the growth.</p><p>The worldwide commercial UAS market is projected to reach $9.5 billion by 2028. Delivery is likely to emerge as the leading sector for commercial UAS market in the US by 2030. Teal Group predicts that Teal growth opportunities will be in middle-mile (e.g., factory to warehouse) transportation, rather than in the last-mile deliveries. This is primarily due to complexities involved in regulating the last-mile deliveries, while the regulatory framework for middle-mile transportation is already in place. Globally, Agriculture will be the largest sector by 2030 led by more affordable UAS and heavy Chinese investments. This is also supported by UN projections which suggests world's population to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, causing significant growth in agricultural consumption. Another key sector that will drive growth of the commercial UAS market is Industrial Inspection. Construction will be the largest portion of the Industrial Inspection market. All ten of the largest worldwide construction firms are deploying or experimenting with UAS fleets.</p><p>China has a clear leadership in the consumer UAS manufacturing and is now seeking to expand its capabilities to commercial UAS manufacturing. The aggressive growth of the UAV industry in China is attributable to the policy and regulatory support as well as significant investments from the Chinese government.</p><p>Currently, Sichuan, Hunan, Hainan and Jiangxi provinces in China are pushing forward the reform of low-altitude airspace management, giving support to the commercialization of drone application. China's civil drone market is estimated at $6.6 billion in 2022, according to Shenzhen-based research firm AskCI Consulting. The industrial drone market is also witnessing rapid growth. According to data from Shenzhen-based Qianzhan Industry Research Institute, the industrial drone sales is projected to increase from 27.3 billion yuan in 2020 to 265.8 billion yuan in 2026. Shenzhen has more than 1,500 drone companies with civilian UAV business licenses.</p><p>Data from the Civil Aviation Administration of China showed that by the end of 2021, there are 781,000 registered drone users, and the number of registered drones totaled 832,000 in China. The Civil Aviation Administration of China released a plan that outlined several targets for the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) business in China by the years 2025, 2030, and 2035. These goals included the enhancement of rules and the expansion of airspace capacity for civilian UAVs.</p><p>Europe has fallen behind in the civil UAS market. It is now trying to catch up by enacting standardized airspace rules that will create a single market. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has established rules for small UAS across the European Union.</p><p>The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has become the first air transport safety regulator in the world to offer technical design guidance to urban planners and eVTOL manufacturers looking to build drone taxi vertiports across Europe.</p><p>Governments around the world are deploying an increasing number of military UAV systems. The US and European governments have already begun new programs using UAVs for protecting land and sea borders. Many other international agencies including the UN and other peacekeeping agencies are also deploying unmanned aerial protection systems.</p><p>The United States is not the only nation that is increasing defense spending on unmanned aerial vehicles. Earlier this year, Germany approved major uptick in defense spending on armed drones. German military will purchase ammunitions worth EUR152 million to arm German drones. This will be the first deployment of weaponized UAVs in German military.</p><p>In January 2023, Ukraine announced plans to double down on its deployment of drones in its efforts to counter Russian forces, pledging nearly $540 million of spending for the production and procurement of UAVs.</p><p>In August 2022, Japan announced a record $40.7 billion defense budget for fiscal 2023, which will include significant spending on armed drones. The Japanese defense ministry aims to introduce unmanned vehicles that can be used directly in combat, rather than just for surveillance and intelligence gathering.</p><p>According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), military expenditures are on the rise around the globe. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has led to increase in defense funding especially for drones. Over the next decade, growth in military market will increasingly shift towards international markets as more militaries incorporate UAVs into their forces.</p><p>Major drone providers from China and Israel have increased the manufacture and export of defense drones for foreign militaries. Many counties from Saudi Arabia to Myanmar and Iraq to Ethiopia, are stockpiling Chinese combat drones and deploying them on the battlefield.</p><p>The introduction of specially built unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) also promises to drive growth over the next decade. The emergence of the commercial UAS market, growing demand from governments to better patrol borders, and continued consumer drone growth all promise to drive more than a quadrupling of the non-military market over the next decade.</p><p>With increasing UAV installations across the globe, there is rising need to defend against such systems as well. In May 2022, South Korea approved a project to install uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) defense systems at 45 bases across the nation to neutralize hostile drones. South Korean government will spend NT$4.3 billion (US$144.45 million) to purchase the UAV defense systems.</p><p>Market Share</p><p>The world UAV sector is highly concentrated with a small number of companies holding most of the market share compared to other industries. Our estimates show there are more than 500 companies globally, with more than 200 commercial UAV companies, while the other 300 develop UAV for the military industry. AeroVironment, BAE Systems, Elbit Systems, Finmeccanica, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Navmar Applied Sciences, Northrop Grumman, Safran, Textron, Thales, Boeing, Tital Aerospace, TAI, AIA and Aviation Industry Corporation of China are among the biggest players in the UAV market.</p><p>A number of start-ups have made their mark on the market in recent years, however, and are challenging the dominance of the incumbent players. Technology companies like Intel, Qualcomm, Microsoft, Apple as well as venture capitalists have poured more millions of dollars into startup investments.</p><p>Impact of COVID-19 on the UAV Sector</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every industry, although not in an equal way. Some industries have felt the impact very differently to others. The effect on the UAV market especially commercial drones have been on the positive side. According to Drone Industry Insights, drone companies are on a path towards steady growth over the next many years. Global drone market size is forecast to reach US$55.8 billion by 2030, from US$30.6 billion in 2022, implying a CAGR of 7.8%. The services sector will remain the biggest segment, while hardware segment will be the fastest growing.</p><p>As the global economies were forced to shut down and implement strict shelter-in-place restrictions, the demand for unmanned aerial systems became higher. Further, the use of drones for transporting medical supplies proved a boon for the sector. Cargo, courier and warehousing are the sectors with the fastest adoption of drones. Many drone companies including Wingcopter, Zipline and Wing have been able to deliver and scale their solutions quicker than previously expected.</p><p>England's National Health Service (NHS) is among those trailing the vehicles to deliver fragile medicines to cancer patients living on the Isle of Wight. Chemotherapy drugs can have short shelf lives and thus quick delivery by drones is a boon for patients.</p><p>Walmart said that it completed 6,000 drone deliveries in 2022 from 36 US stores in seven states. These deliveries were done from drone delivery hubs operated by DroneUp, Flytrex and Zipline. Walmart has 4,700 stores located within 90% of the US population making it uniquely positioned to offer drone delivery at scale.</p><p>In June 2022, Zipline launched drone medical deliveries in Nigeria. Zipline will initially deliver over 200 different medical products, including medicines and vaccines, with plans to expand in the near future. This will enable Nigeria to create a strong and smart health system. In May 2022, Wingcopter announced a partnership with Continental Drones to develop a massive delivery network spanning 49 countries across Sub-Saharan Africa. The deal aims to deploy 12,000 of Wingcopter's 198 drone systems over the course of the next 5 years. In February 2022, Zipline announced launching operations in another African Nation with on-demand drone deliveries of medical supplies in Kenya. The company is already operating in Ghana, Nigeria, and Ivory Coast.</p><p>US-based Walgreens in partnership with Alphabet's Wing is targeting the drone delivery market. In April 2022, Walgreens announced that it will begin flying packages by drone to residents of Texas cities in partnership with Google's drone subsidiary, Wing.</p><p>US-based Matternet is another player targeting the medical delivery market. In September 2021, it launched the world's first city-wide drone delivery network for the rapid transport of medical goods in Abu Dhabi. The company will use drones to transport urgent, high-value goods such as COVID-19 vaccines, blood, and lab samples across the Abu Dhabi's health system.</p><p>LEK Consulting notes that drones could account for a large portion of package delivery market by 2040. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a rapid and more expansive testing of drone delivery systems. The technology has been able to accelerate its growth and development over the past 12 months or so.</p><p>To further assist the sector, the UK government announced new funding program for drone companies developing methods to deliver COVID-19 tests and personal protective equipment (PPE) to hospitals and rural communities. The government has announced ~\u00a37 million funding package for the sector.</p><p>According to research published in journal Patterns, drone deliveries could help reduce greenhouse emissions significantly. The paper states that greenhouse-gas emissions per parcel were 84% lower for drones than for diesel trucks. Companies such as Amazon have been testing the use of drones to deliver packages with an eye to reducing their environmental impact.</p><p>1.3 Market Trends</p><p>Start-ups Threaten Larger Incumbents</p><p>Over the past 20 years, the UAV sector has expanded and opened up to a whole new level of competition and innovation that had not been seen in the market. While large incumbents, especially the Big Three - Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman - have won a big slice of the available UAV deals, new and smaller entrants are increasingly winning against the big companies for UAV contracts, thus challenging their respective market positions.</p><p>A number of smaller start-up companies have burst onto the scene in recent years, threatening the market positions of the larger incumbents. Non-defense companies eager to diversify and get a slice of the fast-growing market have funded some start-ups.</p><p>The funding from Drone startups have started on a strong footing in 2023 after a robust 2022. In January 2023, Japan-based Terra Drone raised $14 million from oil giant Saudi Aramco. The company says it will utilize the funding to set up a new subsidiary for inspection services in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>In November 2022, India-based drone delivery platform Skye Air Mobility raised $1.7 million. Skye Air Mobility is currently operating in eight cities across India and plans to expand to 16 cities in the next 24 months. In October 2022, Australian drone logistics service provider Swoop Aero landed a new investment round for its first and last mile airborne delivery network, bringing its total backing to $26 million to date. Swoop Aero plans to use the funds to enter new markets, scale its integrated logistics networks, and expand its manufacturing capabilities. In September 2022, Japanese flying car and cargo drone developer SkyDrive Inc. raised 9.6 billion yen in its Series C funding round, bringing the company's total funding to date to 14.7 billion yen. The same month, Flyability, the leading indoor inspection drone company, raised CHF15 million in Series C funding for its collision-tolerant drone, Elios 3. Elios 3 allows inspectors to visualize their assets in 3D models created in real-time as the drone flies. In August 2022, drone delivery company Windracers landed a third round of funding from the Future Flight challenge at UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), a government-backed organization. The funding amount was not disclosed.</p><p>In June 2022, Detroit-based drone software provider Airspace Link raised $23 million at a valuation of nearly $200 million. The company aims to build highways in the sky for the unmanned aircrafts. In June 2022, Indoor Robotics, an indoor drone technology company raised $15 million in Series A funding. This round will enable Indoor Robotics to push product development and expand in new geographies. In May 2022, US-based drone software company SkySpecs raised $80 million in Series D funding. The company works with wind farms to monitor the health of turbine blades.</p><p>In April 2022, solar drone inspection provider Raptor Maps raised $22 million in funding. Using drone aircraft, Raptor Maps captures images, including thermal imagery, of both potential PV sites and installed facilities. In March 2022, advanced air mobility leader Skyports raised $23 million in Series B funding. The funding will allow the company to strengthen its status as a global leader in the advanced air mobility infrastructure and drone operations sectors. Another startup, Terra Drone Corp raised $70 million in Series B funding in March 2022. The funding will be used to scale up operations and invest in innovation.</p><p>Regulatory Uncertainties Overshadow the Segment</p><p>UAV vehicles have evolved swiftly in recent years, particularly since making the leap from military technology to consumer gadgetry. The technology they use could be useful for myriad business opportunities. For example, UAVs are being used in many sectors, like the agriculture, construction, energy, mining and entertainment, as well as geological surveys and, utility safety and maintenance, thanks to their ability to shoot aerial photos and video, as well as collect other data cheaply.</p><p>The growth of the UAV market, however, has drawn considerable attention from regulators and legislators eager to mitigate the complexities involved in the growth of the number of aeronautical vehicles in the skies. For instance, in the US there has been delays and confusion regarding the rules set by FAA. With the courts and Congress getting involved in regulation, clarity around the regulatory landscape is yet to emerge.</p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued new rules for the commercial drone industry. Under the new rules, the FAA will allow small drones to operate at night and over people and will require remote identification of the drones. The new rules went into effect on 21 April 2021. Remote ID will be required for all drones weighing 0.55 lb (0.25 kg) or more. Remote ID requires identification of drones in flight as well as the location of their control stations or takeoff point.</p><p>Further, in 2022, the FAA will require every new produced drone weighing over 0.55 pounds to broadcast its location. In 2023, it will be illegal to fly drone without this broadcasting capability.</p><p>For fiscal FY 2022, FAA is requesting a total of over $100 million in funding for unmanned aircraft system (UAS) research, development, and integration. This includes $31.3 million for UAS implementation which incorporates FAA Drone Zone. The FAA Drone Zone is a cloud-based information technology platform that includes a UAS registration system, Part 107 authorizations and optional waivers, and UAS accident reporting.</p><p>FAA budget request also includes $24 million for UAS concept validation and requirements development, UAS flight information management, and urban air mobility.</p><p>The FAA plans to launch field tests of unmanned aircraft traffic management capabilities. The Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management (UTM) field test, which is set to launch in the spring 2022 and continue into 2023, is expected to lead to new policies and the development of updated industry standards for drones operating beyond visual line-of-sight (BVLOS).</p><p>The commercial potential of UAV continues to attract big investors and venture capital. For example, Amazon's is investing in its Amazon Prime Air program to create a delivery system utilizing UAVs.</p><p>Alphabet's drone-delivery subsidiary Wing launched a new mobile and web app, OpenSky, which is free to use and informs drone pilots about airspace restrictions, pre-plan flights, and get airspace approvals. Drone flyers can also use the app to check information on areas where they can and cannot fly.</p><p>This is just one of the many proposed uses for UAVs, however. Within the next ten years, it is expected that more than 32,000 drones will be flying for commercial operations worldwide. FAA projects that remote pilot certificates could grow almost 3x to 350,000 over the next five years.</p><p>For the US, the potential economic impact of UAVs, according to the Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, could reach approximately US$13.7 billion within the next three years and create more than 100,000 employment opportunities once the FAA drafts comprehensive drone regulations.</p><p>Despite some progress by FAA on establishing rules, it remains unclear. The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) delivered a report in January 2023 on the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) efforts to integrate drones into the national airspace and its methods of processing requests for operations not covered by Part 107 rules.</p><p>The main conclusions of the report are that FAA needs to do better in both establishing and communicating a comprehensive strategy for broader UAV use, and in defining a uniform procedure for issuing waiver.</p><p>The Buzz from Parcel-Toting Drones</p><p>In a few decades from now, we may look back and remember a time before flying robots delivered consumer orders. At least this might be the case if delivery drones turn out the way most retailers \u2014 as well as service providers - envision them. A delivery drone, or also known as a parcelcopter, is an UAV utilized to transport goods, packages, and foodstuffs, and recently, the delivery systems have been a hot future state plans among vendors.</p><p>By 2023, Statista projects global drone delivery market to touch $1.6 billion. Asia-Pacific will be the largest market accounting for nearly 39% of the total, followed by North America (31%) and Europe (22%).</p><p>McKinsey notes that as of early 2022, more than 2,000 drone deliveries are occurring each day worldwide. The growth rate is accelerating, and it projects that there will be close to 1.5 million deliveries in 2022 in total, up from just under half a million in 2021.</p><p>Drone Industry Insights noted that services such as cargo, courier, intralogistics and warehousing were the fastest-growing drone market in 2021 and are likely to continue to remain so till 2026 with a CAGR of 24.3%. This is due to the increased popularity and demand of drone deliveries for both internal (intralogistics and warehousing) as well as external services.</p><p>Drone deliveries can cut emissions and reduce congestion on roads. According to Virginia Tech University, drone delivery could save the average consumer up to 56 hours per year, reduce vehicle traffic by 294 million miles per year and displace up to 113,900 tons of CO2 per year.</p><p>China-based ecommerce platform Meituan announced that it has completed more than 100,000 drone deliveries by 2022, an increase of more than 400% year-on-year. The company expects greater number of drone deliveries going forward.</p><p>In October 2022, Alphabet's drone delivery service Wing announced the launch of its operations in Ireland. Initially, Wing will focus on delivering small, light parcels ordered to vendors close to the buyers' homes, mostly containing food or medicines. In October 2022, Zipline announced the launch of drone delivery of prescriptions and other medicines to the households of Salt Lake City in the US. This move follows similar service launched in North Carolina last year.</p><p>In September 2022, Africa-focused e-commerce firm Jumia Technologies partnered with drone-delivery startup Zipline to deliver household items to remote areas of Ghana. This will enable customers from remote and rural areas to order and receive electronics, cosmetics, fashion and other products.</p><p>In June 2022, Walmart announced same day drone deliveries in six US states. The move follows years of small scale testing and now customers will be able to get the goods delivered in as little as 30 minutes. The six states include Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Texas, Utah and Virginia, with the potential to reach up to four million homes, according to Walmart.</p><p>Given the large opportunity in the drone delivery market, the space is witnessing new entrants. The latest is Mesa Air Group, which in October 2021, announced partnership with aerospace technology company, Flirtey to launch last-mile food delivery business using drones in the US. Mesa will first order four delivery drones from Flirtey, with an option to order an additional 500 drones.</p><p>Singapore's civil aviation authority and transport ministry has chosen a private consortium of 13 members to develop the drone program. Under this program, the aim is to use drones for tasks that include delivering parcels, inspecting buildings and providing security. The companies involved in the project have carried our various pilots. These include drone parcel delivery as well as using drones to transport blood samples and specimens between hospitals and central laboratory. Drones are being tested for delivering parts and other materials to factories as well.</p><p>China is not too far behind in this race. DHL in partnership with China-based drone company EHang has launched drone delivery service in China. JD.com and Alibaba have tested the drone delivery system as well.</p><p>Putting the parcelcopter concept into service will take some time because of the many setbacks. The major setback for this concept in the US is that there is no specific flight system where there needs to be a specific path for the drone to travel and deliver in a populated area - and this needs to be solved. Once resolved, the big benefit should be that these delivery-by-drone systems could be commonplace within the next decade. Open season on the open skies could arrive sooner than expected.</p><p>The Obsession with Armed Flying Robots</p><p>The use of a UAV as a weapon first became known in World War II. After the war, little development occurred in drone technology and most remotely piloted vehicles were used for target practice. The US military's first major spending on UAVs began after the Vietnam War, and over the past two decades, the country has become the world's pre-eminent user and supplier.</p><p>Military UAVs in the US have gone through meteoric growth over the past decade. Development has taken a quantum leap \u2014 from lab concept to battle-tested proven technology. Today, America's comparative advantage in UAVs, however, is being battered as technological know-how disseminates throughout the international system. While existing technology has started to lag, global competitors are playing catch up in research and development for drone technology.</p><p>As such, the Pentagon is expected to ramp up its investment in unmanned aerial vehicles in the coming years. The US Defense Department budget request for fiscal year 2023 mentions that unmanned weapons systems, such as drone ships, planes, and ground vehicles, will play an increasing role in future US military planning. The president's fiscal year 2023 defense budget requests new spending on unmanned/autonomous systems technology.</p><p>The Air Force request includes $187 million for enhancements to the MQ-9 Reaper combat drone and $111 million for work on the MQ-4C Triton high-altitude surveillance drone. The Navy and Marine Corps have also requested additional funding for UAVs. The Navy requested $1.2 billion for the MQ-25 Stingray drone, which is to be deployed on carriers and perform aerial refueling and surveillance functions.</p><p>No country has ramped up its UAV research in recent years faster than China, where every major company for the Chinese military has a research and development center and funding allocations dedicated to drones. In recent years, the country has pumped considerable amounts of funds and engineering brainpower into the technology, a field previously dominated by the US and Israel.</p><p>Much of the work done, however, remains secret, but the large number of drones created underlines not only the country's willpower to catch up in the sector by building comparable combat and surveillance models like the Predator and the Global Hawk but also the desire to trade the technologies globally. Its armed UAV CH-4, Wing Loong I and Wing Loong II have been rapidly gaining market share especially in developing countries such as Nigeria, Jordan, Algeria and Middle Eastern countries.</p><p>Israel, second after the US in drone technology, has flown armed UAV models but few details are available. India has also revealed its intention to develop drones that will fire missiles and fly at 30,000 feet, followed by Russia, which has revealed models of UAVs with weapons (although there is little evidence that they are currently operational).</p><p>The Lucrative UAV Micro Segment</p><p>The new generation of UAVs is being developed to improve monitoring of many kinds of systems. From tracking bush fires in Australia to observing traffic in the US, infrared cameras to track missing people at night, and laser spectroscopy used to monitor air pollutions, UAVs are using a lot of the new up-to-date miniature sensor technology.</p><p>All of this requires more focus on the integration of sensor systems in an airborne device that is severely constrained in power and weight. Changing the sensor architecture or even take the control sensors out entirely, allowing the size of the UAV to reduce dramatically. This has created a new class of ultra-small UAV sensors.</p><p>Lockheed Martin's Lockheed Sanders MicroSTAR series of prototypes is one of the many examples of a mini UAV. The battery-operated MicroSTAR designs resembled kid's toys. The device has winglets instead of the single vertical plane tail, and a nose mounted propeller. MicroSTAR featured a five-gram navigation system that could give directions by the ground station but could also automatically keep on a heading or orbit a target.</p><p>The US army has been using mini UAVs for mission in Afghanistan and other areas. These mini UAVs provide near-real time video that allows soldiers to better survey their surroundings and detect enemies in combat. FLIR System's Black Hornet is one such mini UAV which weighs less than two ounces, can be deployed in less than one minute and has a range of over a mile. It is intended to eliminate battlefield blind spots thereby saving lives.</p><p>French drone maker Parrot is also an established player in micro UAV space. It has been selected by Swiss army to develop and supply micro-drones as part of the Swiss Mini UAV Program.</p><p>Despite the advancements, the current micro UAV market remains constrained, largely due to regulatory frameworks on unmanned operations in airspace. But once regulatory restraints are loosened and clarified, the potential of this technology will be unlocked. Mini UAVs are set to become one of the major contributors to both the economy and technology. Market growth, however, still very much depends on the pace of UAV development in different countries, thanks to the wide range of applications and the added value related to these unmanned machines.</p><p>1.4 Applications</p><p>Defense</p><p>Defense will continue to the largest market for UAVs for the foreseeable future. UAVs can play an important role in counter terrorism and counter insurgency activities. They can be deployed in highly dangerous missions thereby saving personnel lives. The UAVs are also being used in difficult terrains for intelligence gathering and surveillance. They provide high resolution images and videos which can significantly help ground troops. Drones have been used by militaries of many countries to conduct strikes against terrorists.</p><p>Transport</p><p>UAVs are increasingly used in transport activities such as e-commerce parcel delivery, food delivery and medicine delivery. Of these, e-commerce delivery is getting the maximum attention with large companies such as Amazon already doing pilot tests.</p><p>Another promising area for UAVs is the delivery of food. It could be used in heavily populated urban areas for food delivery by restaurants and also could be used to deliver foods to difficult terrains including oil rigs and remote islands. Medical logistics is another area where UAVs can be used to transport medicines and can also be used as flying defibrillators.</p><p>Infrastructure</p><p>UAVs can assist in the management of various kinds of infrastructure, specifically construction sites. In the pre- construction phase, drones can survey the land and provide accurate field data and images. They are able to capture high-resolution videos and images, which can significantly improve the speed and quality of the design process. In the construction phase, drones can inspect the sites and provide accurate information regarding the progress of the construction.</p><p>The data received could be used by investors and property owners to monitor if the project is progressing as per original schedule or not. Abu Dhabi has launched the trial stage of implementing drones as aerial monitoring and inspection tools for the city's engineering projects and construction sites.</p><p>US state of Arizona is mulling the use drones to inspect roads, bridges and other infrastructure. The state has introduced Drone Infrastructure Inspection Grant Act, that would dispense about $200 million to purchase drones and the other half to train pilots to fly them.</p><p>The FAA's rollout of the Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC) has helped standardize and expand the use of drones in construction. LAANC automates the application and approval process for airspace authorizations and is currently available at near 500 airports across the country. LAANC is currently in beta and will be tested further before nationwide rollout.</p><p>An increasing number of construction firms and real estate developers in the Middle East are turning to drones amid the COVID-19 crisis. Drones are being used for progress monitoring and site mapping as companies try to speed up delivery of projects. In November 2020, New York's Department of Finance's property division said that it is looking into the use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems for tasks such as surveying tax lots, geographic information system (GIS) mapping and aerial photography.</p><p>Agriculture</p><p>One of the largest projected applications of UAVs in in agriculture. Drones can be used by farmers to monitor their crops. UAVs can survey a farmland faster and at a lower cost than airplanes/satellites and also provide better data and images to farmers. The current altitude restrictions for UAVs limit the area that it can survey, but if the altitude restrictions ease a little, the area could expand and provide greater benefits to farmers.</p><p>Japan has been using UAVs for crop dusting for more than 20 years now and drones account for more than 90% of crop dusters. In the US as well, the adoption of drones in agriculture is increasing due to exemption from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) under the part 107 rule.</p><p>China's largest agriculture drone maker XAG is trying to automate rice farming in China with the launch of its drone-based direct seeding system called JetSeed. It could replace manual seed planting and raise efficiency amid a labor shortage due to COVID-19.</p><p>In January 2023, the United Kingdom's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has given operational authorization to China-based XAG's agricultural spraying aircraft P40 and V40. This is the first time drone spraying and spreading has been legalized for use on UK farms.</p><p>Public Safety</p><p>This area again presents huge opportunities for UAVs. Drones can be used for law enforcement, search and rescue missions, firefighting and medical services. Civil governments are deploying an increasing number of unmanned systems.</p><p>The US and European governments have launched many new pilot programs to deploy UAV systems to protect borders. The United Nations and other peacekeepers are also deploying unmanned aerial systems to provide protection.</p><p>In the US, many agencies have acquired drones. Most of these agencies are police/sheriff departments followed by fire departments. In October 2022, the sheriff department of Las Vegas announced plans to deploy 400 drones as responders to rising gun violence. In Indiana and Maryland, police have successfully used drones to catch suspects and thieves. In Oakland, the fire department used drones to hot spots, which were not extinguished during a firefighting mission. The Los Angeles Fire Department has been using drones to make hot-spot identification and aerial mapping for wildfire response, as well as incident response for other search and rescue missions.</p><p>Further, drones can collect information, data and images on natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes and wildfires. UAVs have great potential for surveying storm damage and locating people after natural disasters. The US National Guard is using AI-powered drones to track wildfires in real time. The AI-backed drones can predict the area where fire is most likely to spread based on previous fires.</p><p>The US is using drones for border security as well. The drones support the border patrol team by providing enhanced intelligence, surveillance capabilities and reducing the risk to human operators on the ground.</p><p>Inspections</p><p>UAVs can be used for inspections in areas such as wind turbines, oil pipelines, power lines, railroads and more. Oil and gas companies can use a drone to conduct the required monthly inspection of their pipelines. Instead of hiring a helicopter, which is costly, companies can use drones to do the same at lower cost. Drone inspections can survey hundreds of miles of pipeline and pinpoint the location of the leaks, thereby reducing traditional surveilling costs by nearly 90%.</p><p>In November 2021, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines announced plans to use of drones for passenger aircraft inspection. The drones can inspect the aircraft for minor damage inflicted by events like hailstorms and lightning strikes.</p><p>Similarly, UAVs can inspect wind turbines, several hundred feet in the air, removing the need for an individual to physically reach the place. Netherlands-based wind energy company Vestas is using drones to conduct inspection of its 1,250 wind turbines. Archaeologists can use UAVs to inspect the sites and also patrol for looters. The city of London is using drones for surveys which are used for repairing and maintaining assets across the underground rail network.</p><p>1.5 Regulatory Environment</p><p>Drones are taking off in a big way. Once the preserve of the military, UAVs are now widely popular in the commercial sector, thanks to consumer-grade UAVs that become increasingly sophisticated and cheaper. Though regulatory obstacles could hinder growth prospects.</p><p>Currently, there are different sets of rules governing the uses of commercial UAVs around the world. In December 2020, the US FAA approved a new set of regulations governing commercial UAVs. The FAA will allow small drones to operate at night and over people and will require remote identification of the drones. This new regulation will bring a step closer to commercial drone use for agriculture, infrastructure repair, and eventually, even deliveries from companies such as Amazon.</p><p>Canada has had safety regulations in place that govern the use of UAVs. A recreational pilot operating a drone weighing less than 35kgs does not currently require either a license or a special flying permit. It, however, must follow a list of Transport Canada safety guidelines, such as staying nine kilometers from an airport, flying under 90 meters and always keeping the craft within eyesight.</p><p>Australia requires no registration of recreational drones. Recreational drone operators must comply with Civil Aviation and Safety Authority (CASA) rules that allow drones to be flown only within a visual line of sight. There are other restrictions on the maximum altitude, vicinity near airports and flying over crowded places.</p><p>The regulations allow commercial operators to fly drones weighing less than 2kg without a license. Operators must still adhere to all the existing rules for recreational drone use such as not to fly within 5.5km of an airport, above 400 feet or within 30m of buildings, railways or vehicles, and always to have line of sight of the drone.</p><p>Drones that weigh less than 20kgs in the UK can fly in normal airspace for private use as long as the operator is not planning to use data or images from the flight acquired by flying close to people or objects. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) requires all UAVs to remain 150 meters from crowded events or large assemblies, 50m from an individual or building, and stay within line of sight, which is 500m horizontally and 122m vertically. Drones that weigh more than 20kgs are currently banned from flying in civilian airspace.</p><p>The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has established new rules on drones. Under the rules, drone operators will have to be registered with their national authority and the drones will need to have a direct remote identification system in place. The regulatory framework will ensure the protection of citizens' privacy rights while addressing security issues as well.</p><p>China is moving rapidly to establish regulatory framework for drones. In October 2020, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) announced the first Unmanned Civil Aviation Experimental Zones (UCAEZs) to help accelerate the drone industry in China. The new experimental zones are designed to not only offer the airspace for testing innovative drone applications, but to ease the process of developing drone businesses.</p><p>1.6 Challenges and Opportunities</p><p>Opportunities</p><p>UAV industry presents tremendous opportunities for investors, companies as well as government. UAV technology has reached a maturity point that has placed it at the forefront of aerospace manufacturing. As UAV companies around the world make drones more accessible, the UAV sector despite the undeveloped regulatory framework, is set to develop into one of the most dynamic growth industries this decade. There are some 450 UAV companies worldwide behind this growing multibillion-dollar industry, with the number growing.</p><p>Both the military and commercial markets are set to grow rapidly in the next few years, as the US economy continues to recover, technology continues to diffuse around the world, as designs become more streamlined and efficient and as more industries adopt existing business processes for UAV use.</p><p>The non-military, especially the commercial drone segment, is set to grow the fastest with projections of mid to high teens growth over the next the next decade. The latest developments in computer vision, machine learning, cloud and data analytics are expected to push drone deployment in the mainstream commercial sector. In the US and many other places around the world, the regulations either remain too restrictive or are yet to be given a final shape, which has been a deterrent in the pace of UAV adoption.</p><p>With the explosion of interest in building and operating unmanned aircraft systems, the use of UAV technology is set to generate more high-tech jobs, with millions in tax revenues and tens of billions in economic impact.</p><p>UAV technology is moving ever faster forward as the market continues to flourish. Industry will need to consider how to best to integrate UAVs into their businesses.</p><p>Challenges</p><p>Safety, privacy and regulatory barriers remain key challenges for the rapid adoption of UAVs. The most urgent challenge for the governments is to ensure that the drone operations remain safe.</p><p>Privacy is another key concern that needs to be addressed. UAVs collect massive amounts of data including video and images, which sometimes could result in the invasion of personal privacy. A livestream or a recording of individuals or buildings can easily be captured without consent. Also, even if the data collected is with consent, the transmission of data itself remains vulnerable to hack. The growth and evolution of the UAV industry has outpaced the development of rules and systems to govern their use. This uncertainty weighs on innovation and commercial adoption, unless there is more clarity on the rules.</p><p>Illegal use of UAVs for criminal activities is another big challenge. For instance, drug cartels have used drones to transfer illegal drugs in the US. These vehicles tend to fly for short periods at very low altitudes. This makes it very difficult to detect using conventional sensor systems. Also, UASs or drones in particular could be a source of public nuisance. If a drone flying over a public place loses control and falls, it could cause substantial damage to the property as well as endanger lives.</p><p>In conclusion, the UAVs have raised a lot of concerns and it is up to policymakers to design and create laws that facilitate the good use of the technology while discouraging its harmful use.</p><p>2.

The lower temperatures and the higher humidity, that is also helping but there is still a lot of work to be done. Thankfully, yes, there are a lot of resources here but unfortunately, there are a lot of families that will come back to their homes and this is what they're going to look like. It's interesting to see the fire behavior.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I want to see if I can show you one of the trucks here because half of it was burned. The other half was not. So it's just interesting to see how this fire moves throughout the area but the reality is that it is so dry and that is why, Bianna, it is spreading so quickly.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BIANNA GOLODRYGA, CNN ANCHOR: Yes, no rhyme or reason. And look, this isn't an anomaly. We're covering the story every year, these wildfires out in that part of the country. Camila Bernal, thank you so much. Stay safe.</p><p>Well, today, the White House is launching a new website aimed at helping Americans cool down. A scorching heat suffocates much of the country. The conditions intensifying on the west coast this week, with forecasters predicting potentially deadly record-breaking heat today from Northern California to the Pacific Northwest. Joining me now is the governor of Washington State Jay Inslee. Governor, thank you so much for joining us today. How are you?</p><p>GOV. JAY INSLEE, (D-WA): Hey, Bianna.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: How are you preparing your residents there for this heat wave?</p><p>INSLEE: Oh, two ways. One, we're doing the obvious things, we've opened up quite a few cooling centers, and we've adopted new rules that protect workers who have to work outside in these hot temperatures. We're doing things to help people get more air conditioners and heat pumps that can be used as air conditioners. We're getting people information about how to stay cool. But those are the -- those are the sort of, you know, first aid.</p><p>But look we need -- we need intensive care for our communities. We need to defeat carbon pollution that is causing this horrendous. This is the second summer in a row we baked. Summer before that we were choking on forest fire smoke, our kids literally couldn't go outside or some are now dying there because the water is too hot for them literally to live in.</p><p>We've got to cut to the heart of this problem and attack at it -- at its source, which is carbon pollution. And I'm glad we got 23 states doing that. We know we've been hampered by the Senate, but we are acting in our states. This is our destiny, it's in our hands.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Yes.</p><p>INSLEE: We need to take action and we are.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Hampered by the Senate and hampered by the Supreme Court as well. Give us some examples of what you yourself are doing as governor in Washington State.</p><p>INSLEE: Well, we're doing a lot in Washington State. We have a bill that will give us clean electricity in decades to come, 100 percent clean non-polluting electricity. We have the best capital investment bill which caps the amount of pollution and generates funds to help people get access to clean energy and heat pumps and the like.</p><p>We have a low carbon fuel standard, which will give consumers cleaner fuels and help the transition to electric cars. We soon will have a requirement that we go to zero polluting cars in the out years as soon as the president will act to allow the states to move forward. And we're building communities that are both resilient and low carbon by adopting transportation measures that have low carbon emitting sources of public transit, more access to electric cars.</p><p>So these sweet of these policies put us well on the way to cutting our pollution in half by 2030. But we're not alone. Well, as I said, we started the U.S. climate Alliance. We now have 23 states, all of whom are moving forward to meet our Paris commitments to reduce pollution. But we've all got to accelerate our game.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Yes.</p><p>INSLEE: Look, this is just a foretaste. You were just covering these horrendous fires in California, unbelievable rainstorms that shut down Yellowstone National Park, and record rains in St. Louis the other day. This is just the cutting edge of what's heading our way in this avalanche. Literally avalanches of Mount Rainier --</p><p>GOLODRYGA: And --</p><p>INSLEE: And what is happening to it.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: And yet, Governor, we see this with our very own eyes, we're living it, millions of Americans are suffering, many are dying from these record-breaking temperatures or the fires, what have you. And yet, as you mentioned, the president's hands really are tied federally in terms of what he can do, Build Back Better doesn't appear to have a path forward in addressing climate change.</p><p>A new poll shows that 59 percent of Americans though, say the federal government is doing too little to reduce the effects of global climate change, you, yourself. And your 2020 presidential bid ran specifically on this issue, as we know it didn't get you very far in that race. Why -- how do you explain that disconnect with what's happening on the ground with how Americans feel and yet no significant results in terms of what can be done to prevent this and stop it?</p><p>INSLEE: Well, again, we have significant results in our state. So states are now in the engines of fighting climate change and we're acting our states.</p><p>[11:35:03]</p><p>I urge everyone to get out there and vote, vote for state officials and federal that can cause action. Look, the federal government is a system that's broken between the filibuster and gerrymandering and the Republican Party, all of whom have refused to act on climate change. But here's some good news. The president does have tools at his disposal. He has ungratified that he acted to develop offshore wind. He now has at least five buckets. He can act by executive action.</p><p>Senate can't stop him, not -- I don't even think the Supreme Court to have acted on regulation to reduce carbon pollution, act to stop digging the hole deeper by stopping offshore drilling, acting to allow us to help people get access to electric cars in the years to come, acting to help finance getting access to heat pumps that can both heat and cool your home, and moving forward with more efficiency standards. He has lots of tools in his toolbox. We're counting on him to use those in the upcoming weeks and months because we have to use every single tool at our disposal.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Yes.</p><p>INSLEE: This destiny is in our hands. And I know people feel despair about this. But the antidote to despair is action. And I hope everybody will take some action in the upcoming weeks and months starting by voting in November. Look we got to -- we're here to exercise our franchise here to vote to fight climate change. I hope everybody will this November and we know who that is. And it's not the Republican Party.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Governor Jay Inslee, we are thinking of your residents there, another scorcher of a day, and the difference is 100 degrees in the Northwest means so many people don't have air conditions.</p><p>INSLEE: Yes.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Unlike what they have in the south and even here in the Northeast. Thank you so much for joining us. We appreciate it.</p><p>INSLEE: You got it. Thank you.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: And a quick programming note, don't miss a new episode of \"UNITED SHADES OF AMERICA.\" Kamau Bell looks at how years of drought and extreme heat waves are leading to terrible wildfires. That's Sunday at 10 p.m. Eastern and Pacific only on CNN. And coming up. New details about the private efforts of Chief Justice John Roberts to save Abortion Rights, what was going on behind the scenes? Up next.</p><p>[11:42:02]</p><p>GOLODRYGA: WNBA star Brittney Griner, back in a Russian court this morning, her defense arguing that she used the cannabis oil found in her luggage at the airport for medical purposes. Griner has been held in Russia since February. If convicted, she faces up to 10 years in prison. Griner is expected to return to court and testify at a hearing tomorrow, of course, we'll bring you any developments in that case.</p><p>And back here in the U.S. New CNN reporting takes us behind the scenes in the Supreme Court battle over Roe v. Wade. Multiple sources say Chief Justice John Roberts fought to preserve the constitutional right to abortion, but clearly had failed to convince any of his fellow conservative justices. So what happened? CNN legal analyst Joan Biskupic is live with her new reporting. This is fascinating, Joan, tell us what you learned.</p><p>JOAN BISKUPIC, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Sure, Bianna. And your question was exactly right. What happened? And what I wanted to know is what was the Chief doing during this time and how were his colleagues reacting to him? When the justices first took a vote on this case in December, it was essentially 5, 1, 3. 5 Justices on the far right to reverse Roe, one justice in the middle, the chief, to uphold a ban from Mississippi on abortions after 15 weeks, and then the three liberals who didn't want any disruption with abortion rights, and why just strike down the Mississippi law.</p><p>The chief worked for weeks and weeks, months to try to pick off one of those five justices on the far-right to stop the overturning of Roe. The justices beyond hadn't even taken the case originally to decide the momentous question of the future of Roe. They had taken it only to decide the Mississippi part. And the chief thought that what the Conservatives were doing to his right was a violation of you know judicial restraint and precedent dating back nearly a half-century. And he was starting to make a little bit of progress, I believe. But the leak in -- on May 2 really changed things.</p><p>Conservatives on his right were already anxious to what the chief was doing. And then once it was revealed publicly that Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, two of his targets for any change had already voted that way, those votes became essentially locked in and harder for the chief to maneuver. But I do have to say that after the public leak of the draft of the Dobbs decision overturning Roe came out, Chief Justice John Roberts continued. He continued to try to convince one of his colleagues to just hold off on the reversal of Roe at this point but just could not do it.</p><p>And as I say, I think the public document made it a bit harder because the chief likes to work in secret, make secret concessions, draw out secret concessions, and with everyone knowing what was happening, a very difficult task became even harder. In the end, it's possible that justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett were never going to change their votes because of -- because of where they really were on this issue from the start, Bianna.</p><p>[11:45:09]</p><p>GOLODRYGA: But it is interesting with this added context is to further understanding Chief Justice's anger, right, as to the outing and the leak of that document and of that decision. It currently is under investigation as we speak. Joan Biskupic, thank you so much for that. Really fascinating.</p><p>BISKUPIC: Thank you.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: And coming up. The Pope saying I humbly beg forgiveness for indigenous abuse in Canada's Catholic schools. But is the apology enough? I'll speak with the leader of the Metis indigenous community. That's ahead.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>POPE FRANCIS: Speaking in a foreign language.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[11:50:05]</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Tens of thousands of people gathering right now to hear from Pope Francis. His open-air mass is set to begin just moments from now in Edmonton, Canada. The Pope's trip is centered around apologizing for the Catholic Church's role in the abuse of Canadian indigenous children in residential schools. CNN's Paula Newton is in Edmonton, Canada, and joins us with the latest. Paula, tell us the situation on the ground there. What is his -- what is the reaction?</p><p>PAULA NEWTON, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Well, the Popemobile has just come by us here in the stadium. This is more of a day of healing in stark contrast, and as of yesterday, which was a day of apology. Right now, a lot of enthusiasm for this open-air mass, tens of thousands in the stadium right now. The Popemobile has made its pass through the stadium. Several babies pass up to the Pope to be blessed and kiss and a lot of enthusiasm. I think this is coming again the day after, of course, that the Pope, literally on a beg for forgiveness. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>POPE FRANCIS: Speaking in a foreign language.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm here because the first step of my penitential pilgrimage among you is that of again asking forgiveness of telling you once more that I'm deeply sorry. Sorry for the ways in which regrettably, many Christians supported the colonizing mentality of the powers that oppressed the indigenous peoples. I'm sorry. (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: You know, I know what this is about is about literally the torturous treatment that about 150,000 indigenous peoples received in Canada for more than a century. They were torn away from their families, as young as four, put into residential schools, the majority of rich -- which were run by the Catholic Church. This apology for this treatment has been decades in the making. And given the post trail health, everyone appreciates that he is here. But as I said, it is a long time in coming.</p><p>I have to say the Pope looks quite good and in fact, rejuvenated after a bit of jetlag from just being in the Popemobile and being able to see the crowds with such enthusiasm. And, of course, also touching, bless those babies. The mass will be getting underway here within just a few moments. And we will continue to bring you more here from Edmonton, Canada, as I said, as they await what is now really a program of healing through this country.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: I have to say it is quite an amazing image to see the Pope there sharing a stage with the indigenous chiefs. Paula Newton, thank you.</p><p>Well, joining me now is Cassidy Caron, president of the Metis National Council. Thank you so much for joining us, Cassidy. So it really is not an over characterization to say you played a large part in making this trip by the Pope possible, and his apology as well. How are you feeling today?</p><p>CASSIDY CARON, PRESIDENT, METIS NATIONAL COUNCIL: Well, thank you for that introduction. And, you know, I can't say that I played a really large part in making this happen today. I really just helped facilitate the survivors who shared their stories with Pope Francis over at the Vatican earlier this spring to prepare him for his trip over here. Today, I feel good. I think the words that Pope Francis shared yesterday at the opening event at Maskwaci, you know, it set the stage for the week to come where Pope Francis -- he's really learned.</p><p>He's really listened about the stories from our survivors about what happened on these lands. And the way that he wants to continue to move forward. I think he really truly expressed that in his apology yesterday. There's certainly a lot more work that has to be done, a lot more commitments that we're looking for from the Catholic Church, but it was another step forward on our pathway to reconciliation. And I'm looking forward to hearing what Pope Francis will say at the stadium event today, as well as the community event that I will be attending this afternoon.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: You mentioned your visit to the Vatican earlier this year. Can you give us a sense from your interactions with how much the Pope actually was aware of these abuses prior to your visit?</p><p>CARON: So I think he had definitely done some research, or his staff, people had done some research for him. But it's the stories that come directly from residential school survivors that impact anyone. If the Pope himself, it impacted him, it compelled him to make the apology while we were over there on April 1 at the Vatican. It's those stories that come directly from the people who have that lived experience. That's the work that needs to be done to compel people to want to continue having conversations about what happened and want to continue to move forward in a better way.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Yes, we see images there from just moments ago of the Pope blessing babies that are brought over to him. The Pope said this is just the first step in his apology tour. What do those next steps need to look like for the community?</p><p>[11:55:06]</p><p>CARON: So there's quite a bit. And from the Metis National Council perspective, even just the Pope saying that this is the first step indicates to us that he was listening. Because when we went over to Rome, when we were preparing with the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops, we expressed to them that an apology is simply the first step in providing that acknowledgment that the Catholic Church has a role to play in reconciliation. Because they played a role in the damage and the destruction of our families, our communities, and our nation, they have a role to play in moving forward.</p><p>And so, yes, we -- you know, when we were in Rome, we delivered Pope Francis with a book, and in that book contains many stories for Metis residential school survivors, and it also carved out a pathway for the Pope himself, the Vatican, the Cardinals, the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops, it carved out that path for action. And we compiled actions under truth, healing, reconciliation, and justice.</p><p>And so, you know, an apology was the first step. Pope Francis yesterday announced that there would be a serious investigation. We don't yet know what that serious investigation would entail. However, there's a lot that needs to be investigated. The individuals who perpetuated crimes against children and those who are still living, they need to be extradited to Canada to be tried for their crimes. That's a part of justice that has to happen.</p><p>We have a lot of investigating on the grounds that residential schools we're on to find all of our children who were buried in these unmarked graves. There's a lot of these investigation pieces that need to continue to move forward. And so we're looking forward to finding out more about that.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Well, and the important and historic first step from the Pope and hopefully a big step forward to closure for the community. Cassidy Caron, thank you so much. And thank you so much for watching. \"INSIDE POLITICS\" is up next after this quick break.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2022072602CNV59</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6615-KKS1-DXH2-6484-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3035\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"07\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>July 26, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Climate</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Heatwave</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Senate</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Supreme Court</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Brittney Griner</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>John Roberts</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Roe V.

But it's not. Yesterday there were 13 countries that reported over 10,000 new cases and 9 with over 200 new deaths. These are the countries with the big number of new cases (and their deaths on Friday): </p><p><br/>USA +90,208 (987 new deaths) <br/>Germany +48,184 (228 new deaths) <br/>UK +40,375 (145 new deaths) <br/>Russia +40,123 (1,235 new deaths) <br/>Ukraine +24,058 (750 new deaths) <br/>Turkey +23,637 (217 new deaths) <br/>Netherlands +16,204 (32 new deaths) <br/>Brazil +14,424 (612 new deaths) <br/>Poland +12,971 (31 new deaths) <br/>India +11,850 (555 new deaths) <br/>Austria +11,798 (40 new deaths) <br/>Czechia +10,411 (65 new deaths) <br/>Belgium +10,396 (65 new deaths) <br/> Some of these countries are reporting immense numbers when it comes to cases per million, Czechia-- early mask adapters-- worst of all: <br/><br/>Czechia- 173,900 cases per million <br/>USA- 143,369 cases per million <br/>North Dakota- 203,330 cases per million <br/>Alaska-191,159 cases per million <br/>Tennessee- 189,598 cases per million <br/>Wyoming- 185,713 cases per million <br/>South Dakota- 180,118 cases per million <br/>Utah- 178,264 cases per million <br/>South Carolina- 176,150 cases per million <br/>UK- 138,760 cases per million <br/>Netherlands- 132,035 <br/>Belgium- 126,428 cases per million <br/>Austria- 103,008 cases per million <br/>Brazil- 102,232 cases per million <br/>Turkey- 97,738 cases per million <br/>Poland- 84,037 cases per million <br/>Ukraine- 73,304 cases per million <br/>Russia- 61,585 cases per million <br/>Germany- 59,111 cases per million <br/>India- 24,616 cases per million <br/> I included the 7 American states-- unvaccinated Trump bastions-- that have worse rates of infection than even Czechia! Warning stay away from them-- and within a few days Florida is likely to be on that list (173,045 cases per million). <br/>Earlier today, Jim Heintz, reporting for AP from Moscow, wrote that \"Russia is reporting a new daily high number of COVID-19 deaths[1], while the the total number of coronavirus infections during the pandemic in the country has topped 9 million. The surge in daily deaths and infections that began in mid-September appeared to plateau over the past week, but the national coronavirus task force said Saturday that a record 1,241 people died from the virus over the past day, two more than the previous record reported on Wednesday. The task force said 39,256 new infections were recorded, bringing the country's case total to 9.03 million.\" The surge in infections and deaths comes amid low vaccination rates, lax public attitudes toward taking precautions and the government's reluctance to toughen restrictions. Fewer than 40% of Russia's nearly 146 million people have been fully vaccinated, even though the country approved a domestically developed COVID-19 vaccine months before most of the world.In total, the coronavirus task force has reported more than 254,000 deaths-- by far the highest death toll in Europe. Some experts believe the true figure is even higher. Reports by Russia's statistical service, Rosstat, that tally coronavirus-linked deaths retroactively reveal much higher mortality: 462,000 people with COVID-19 died between April 2020 and September of this year. About half the states' rates of infection are increasing and 11 states are seeing hospitalization rates increase as well, while deaths are already going up on 17 states. Epidemiologists looking at the new numbers-- and the low vaccination rates-- see a bad winter ahead. One, Ali Mokdad, told CNN that  &lt; &gt;states such as Florida have a false sense of security &lt; &gt; because their numbers have gone down in recent weeks. \"'Florida has a large population of the elderly, who went and got vaccinated. And the young people simply got infected. So the virus ran out of people to infect,\" he said. But he said immunity on both groups is waning. 'There will be a lot of winter travel to Florida,' he said. 'Infections will start all over again,' he predicted. 'We are so interconnected... Science is telling us we need three doses to be immune,' he said. 'We are losing our credibility as scientists unless you say it-- we need three doses to be protected.'\" <br/>Epidemiologists are blaming the unvaccinated and morons refusing to wear masks. Michael Osterholm, who heads the center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota \"thinks boosting people will help-- but says it's far more important to get more people vaccinated in the first place. 'If we see upticks in L.A. or New York City, we could just as easily find ourselves back to where we were. At this point, there's no evidence of that happening,' he said in his podcast[2] this week. 'But I must tell you that given the rates of vaccination... we surely could see major surges in both of those metropolitan areas where with the population density being what it is, could really, truly raise the number of national cases in short order,' he added. An estimated 60 million Americans remain unvaccinated. That's plenty of people who can help fuel new surges, Osterholm said. 'Overall, there's still a lot of human wood left for this coronavirus forest fire to burn,' he said. Even in states, cities and counties with high vaccination rates, enough people remain unvaccinated or undervaccinated to help keep the virus spreading. And if immunity is waning as quickly as some studies indicate it may be, Osterholm fears more breakthrough infections, even among the vaccinated. Osterholm is pessimistic about the coming weeks. 'That fact, combined with Delta, schools and upcoming holidays, has me skeptical that we won't be seeing new hotspots emerge in this country over the next several weeks and months. So where do I see us going? I think we will continue to see surges. They may not be nearly as high as the ones we've just had, but they will occur.'\" And plenty of states have such low vaccination levels that they're bonfires waiting to be ignited, Mokdad said.\"I mean, West Virginia [is] 41.1% fully vaccinated. So 60% of the population, at least, don't have immunity against infection,\" he said.\"So, what do you expect? We're going to have a surge. If you look at Montana, 51%. Wyoming, 44.6%. I mean, you could go on and on. There's so many states right now below 50. Louisiana, 48.1%. Alabama, 45.2%.\"These same states, Mokdad and Osterholm both pointed out, have populations largely resistant to mask use, as well.\"Nobody is listening,\" Mokdad said morosely. He said he and fellow epidemiologists were discussing how they could bring attention to the dire situation.\"Some of us we were talking about going on a hunger strike. We are really frustrated. It's depressing that we know how protect our population and we are not doing it,\" he said. Best advice: avoid counties with large numbers of Trump voters. These blood red counties are hellholes that should be avoided at all costs. Not a single one of them has a vaccination rate above 40% and not a single one of them has an average as high as their own state's vaccination rate. 9 of them have fewer than 20% of their populations vaccinated.

That`s where every Christmas tree that is cut down is benefiting women in need and is benefiting the land too. On top of that, the ranch itself is about to become an important refuge for veterans and their families. From Colorado, Barry Petersen has the story.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(Begin VT)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WOMAN: There she goes. Beautiful.</p><p>BARRY PETERSEN (voiceover): The roar of a chainsaw is the sound of Christmas in the Rockies, where people gathered at the Aspen Canyon Ranch to choose a tree. Paying with a donation to Denver`s Dolores Project which gives shelter to women experiencing homelessness. Some wanted tabletop size.</p><p>MAN: What do you think?</p><p>WOMAN: It`s perfect. It`s perfect.</p><p>BARRY PETERSEN: Marilee and Don Mosley want a big and tall, hunting deep into the forest.</p><p>DON MOSLEY: Yeah. Right for me to cut it.</p><p>MARILEE MOSLEY: Yeah. Look at it from all sides. Yeah. That looks perfect.</p><p>BARRY PETERSEN: Sawing it down was easy. But getting it out was a struggle through the underbrush stick with fallen trees and dead vegetation.</p><p>MARILEE MOSLEY: Yeah. I think it`d be perfect.</p><p>BARRY PETERSEN: Why?</p><p>MARILEE MOSLEY: It`s a perfect shape and the ornaments will hang nicely on it.</p><p>BARRY PETERSEN: Which is why this Christmas tree outing has a purpose. The more trees they cut, the better, because it helps prevent this. Simply put, a forest with more trees and more underbrush means more fuel, feeding more raging fires.</p><p>Fuel reduction means you cut the trees down.</p><p>RYAN MCNERNEY (Forester for the Colorado State Forest Service): Right.</p><p>BARRY PETERSEN: And got the undergrowth out.</p><p>RYAN MCNERNEY: Yes.</p><p>BARRY PETERSEN: Ryan McNerney is a forester for the Colorado State Forest Service, who developed a multi-year plan for this ranch.</p><p>Why have you done that in terms of forest fire mitigation?</p><p>RYAN MCNERNEY: So that the trees here on our left is very dense and overgrown and then because of that, there`s a ton of fuel in there that is available to be burned. Whereas on the other side--</p><p>BARRY PETERSEN: Over here.</p><p>RYAN MCNERNEY: --we`ve done a management activity over here that has really taken out a lot of the trees, spaced them out. By removing some trees were giving the other trees more space to grow and an ability to prevent themselves from being burned up.</p><p>BARRY PETERSEN: To get the trees out, a machine literally chops them up or workers cut and stack debris on hillsides into what are called teepees ready for controlled burns. This was once a dude ranch, then a pot smokers` B&amp;B.</p><p>When all that failed, its rustic cabins were left to decay. Philip Sevier took over and now the cabins are headed for nearby towns.</p><p>BARRY PETERSEN: They look a little worn now but they`re going to be refurbished and they`ll be homes.</p><p>PHILIP SEVIER: Yeah, they`ll be redone.</p><p>BARRY PETERSEN: Yeah. You`re recycling the log cabins of Colorado?</p><p>PHILIP SEVIER: Absolutely, yeah.</p><p>BARRY PETERSEN: The fire prevention plan makes the ranch more valuable and Sevier has gotten big bucks offers. He said no. Instead, he will sell it to a group called Project Sanctuary that brings military families together to reconnect after long deployments.</p><p>PHILIP SEVIER: If you give it to a rich guy, they`re going to put a big fence around it and close it off. When you sell it to an organization, there`s going to be hundreds of people affected positively because of this experience. The family fishing on the river hanging out hiking, we have beautiful lakes.</p><p>BARRY PETERSEN: And will help heal.</p><p>PHILIP SEVIER: It will. It will.</p><p>BARRY PETERSEN: The Mosley`s tree has gone from its forest home to their home.</p><p>What do the kids and especially the grandkids learn about this real tree that you have and you decorated?</p><p>MARILEE MOSLEY: Well, it`s from the forest. They see little trees when they go hiking and they touch the tops, and they say that I`ve touched the top of this tree and they know it`ll grow big.</p><p>BARRY PETERSEN: Marilee sees it through the delighted eyes of a five-year old.</p><p>What`s your favorite part of the Christmas tree?</p><p>GIRL: The lights.</p><p>BARRY PETERSEN: Why?</p><p>GIRL: Because they look like sparkles.</p><p>BARRY PETERSEN: And three-year-old Monty is a forest firefighting tree trimmer in the making.</p><p>What do you want for Christmas?</p><p>BOY: A Lego dragon.</p><p>BARRY PETERSEN: Okay. What do you want for Christmas?</p><p>MONTY: A chainsaw.</p><p>BARRY PETERSEN: What are going to do with the chain saw?</p><p>MONTY: Cut down trees.</p><p>BARRY PETERSEN: And with fewer trees left, the better chance the rest will survive and just maybe become next year`s plant of Christmas joy.</p><p>For CBS SATURDAY MORNING, Barry Petersen in the Rocky Mountains.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>DANA JACOBSON: So pretty. By the way, I think the Lego dragons more likely than the chainsaw at that age.</p><p>JEFF GLOR: Did that three-year-old just ask for a chainsaw?</p><p>MICHELLE MILLER: Yeah. Yeah.</p><p>DANA JACOBSON: Well, to help the environment.</p><p>MICHELLE MILLER: Yeah.</p><p>JEFF GLOR: Well, he`s trying to help.</p><p>MICHELLE MILLER: I was digging Barry`s Smokey the bear hat there.</p><p>JEFF GLOR: It`s a nice hat. We couldn`t decide whether it was a cowboy hat or a fedora, but it was good regardless.</p><p>MICHELLE MILLER: It`s just like Ranger Barry to the rescue.</p><p>DANA JACOBSON: Ranger Petersen.</p><p>JEFF GLOR: Barry Petersen is always stylish.</p><p>MICHELLE MILLER: Oh, yeah.</p><p>JEFF GLOR: Always.</p><p>MICHELLE MILLER: Ranger Petersen.</p><p>JEFF GLOR: All right.

Yes, she is. Nora Jones. You`re watching CBS SATURDAY MORNING.</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>JEFF GLOR: Scientists in Western Australia are closing out 2021 having made a rather startling discovery. On Friday, they identified what they`re calling the first ever millipede, official millipede having more than 1,000 legs.</p><p>DANA JACOBSON: Wow.</p><p>JEFF GLOR: The species they found lives in complete darkness in a subterranean habitat loaded with iron and volcanic rocks. And lacking eyes, it uses senses such as touch and smell to perceive its environment. Researchers say it apparently lives on fungi. There previously no known millipedes have 1,000 legs which actually means a thousand feet. The most was seven 750 legs just in case you are wondering.</p><p>DANA JACOBSON: But it was close.</p><p>JEFF GLOR: This new species has 1,306--</p><p>DANA JACOBSON: Wow.</p><p>JEFF GLOR: --making the word millipede accurate.</p><p>MICHELLE MILLER: Three hundred more versus 300 less.</p><p>DANA JACOBSON: Right.</p><p>JEFF GLOR: That thing is just crawling up in the--</p><p>DANA JACOBSON: I don`t want to. I was going to make a bad joke about probably in the dark because it`s shaving its legs all the time and then a thousand - no? Okay.</p><p>JEFF GLOR: That`s why you`re going to try (inaudible)--</p><p>DANA JACOBSON: I was going to try? Oh, it was a little funny in my head.</p><p>JEFF GLOR: Yes, actually.</p><p>DANA JACOBSON: That`s a little funny. If you`ve thrown something out by mistake, take heart, it probably was not as valuable as what one man says he lost when he lost track of his computer hard drive. We`re talking a value in the hundreds of millions of dollars. I`m sweating thinking about it. We`re going to explain this all just a head.</p><p>For some of you, your local news is next.

It is burning on mid to upper slopes on the northeast part of the ridge that separates the Little Salmon and Big Salmon drainages, approximately 4 miles up the drainage from the South Fork of the Flathead River on the west side of Garnet Creek.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to InciWeb, the fire received 1/10 of an inch of rain Wednesday morning and fire growth has been minimal as a result.</p><p>The fire is continuing to spread farther into the Garnet Creek drainage and is anticipated to eventually spot across the creek and establish on the western aspect of the slope.</p><p>Protection plans are in process as the fire is anticipated to spread toward the Salmon Forks cabin, located approximately 4 miles east of the current fire location. A crew has been established at the cabin to implement structure protection plans, and supplies are being packed in to Mud Lake Lookout so the historic building can be wrapped in the coming days.</p><p>Contacts are being made with individuals recreating in the area of the Little Salmon trails system and closure orders are posted.</p><p>There is an official closure order in place for the Little Salmon drainage and some connecting trails.</p><p>Due to the emergency nature of the fire, the District Ranger granted special permission for the first fire drone flight to take place on the district Wednesday. The drone was flown by the Spotted Bear Wildland Fire Module Leader (a qualified drone pilot) to identify the exact location of the fire without creating additional risk for personnel.</p><p>Current fire behavior is classified as creeping, mainly upslope to the south; currently lateral movement and backing downslope to the Little Salmon Creek bottom is limited. Single tree torching has been observed.</p><p>The Lion Creek Fire is listed at 161 acres. Hot and dry daytime conditions and strong nighttime thermal belts have kept the fire active.</p><p>Incident Commander Brandon Hightower reported the primary carrier of the fire continues to be heavy dead and downed fuels within an old prescribed fire burn scar from 1996. The fire is burning on a steep southerly aspect and continues to actively spread to the east.</p><p>Short uphill runs are hitting the top of the ridge, then backing downslope along the ridgeline to where Lion Creek turns to the north. The ridge is currently keeping the fire from establishing itself to the north. The fire is within a mile of an outfitter camp that is located in the north bowl of Lion Creek. There was a little activity on the west flank of the fire down by the Lion Creek Trail, but otherwise little to no spread west.</p><p>The current plan of action is to monitor fire spread particularly to the west down drainage into the valley. Although this is a low probability event, fire managers said they will continue to plan for it.</p><p>There are two smaller fires in the Kootenai region.</p><p>According to The Western News, Forest Service crews are battling the Swede Creek 30-acre wildfire in the Williams Gulch and Swede Mountain area.</p><p>Authorities responded to the scene after an air attack crew spotted smoke about 3:30 p.m. Wednesday. By the day's end, the Forest Service had about 25 firefighters on scene using engine modules, dozers, a helicopter, an air attack and two single-engine air tankers to battle the blaze.</p><p>Swede Mountain Road is closed due to the fire.</p><p>Dan Rose, forest fire management officer for the Kootenai National Forest, said effort went into creating a fire line. Rose expected it to be complete by Thursday afternoon.</p><p>He described the fire as \"low risk at this point in terms of the impact to our local communities.\"</p><p>While the cause of the blaze remains under investigation, Rose said officials have ruled out lightning.</p><p>Crews are also working on a smaller fire, the 14-acre Lightning Peak Fire, near Cow Creek.</p><p>The fire is burning east of the Fisher River and south of Wolf Creek. It was spotted Wednesday morning. A cause has not been determined.</p><p>___ (c)2020 the Daily Inter Lake (Kalispell, Mont.)

Chris Smith:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Residents of the Whiting community in Manchester Township south of Joint-Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JB-MDL) will receive added protection from the threat of wildfires because of new federal funding, said Rep. Chris Smith (NJ-04).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Department of Defense will provide funding to six projects in New Jersey (see list below) that promote land conservation near military sites, including $380,000 for a firebreak project to be built near the Roosevelt City section of Whiting. The firebreak will simultaneously protect the military mission of JB-MDL.</p><p>This modest but important federal funding will go a long way toward protecting areas near our military bases that are susceptible to forest fires ,\" Smith said. According to the NJ Forest Fire Service , more than 7,000 acres a year are consumed by an average of 1,500 wildfires in New Jersey, the most densely populated State in the union. The firebreak project will be in Manchester Township, home to nearly 44,000 people and many senior retirement communities ,\" he said.</p><p>PHOTO : Much of the 65-square mile Joint Base-MDL consists of forests. (U.S. Army Photo by Staff Sgt. Shawn Morris, at JB-MDL, 2013)</p><p>Manchester Township Mayor Ken Palmer said that he liked the idea of added fire protection for the Whiting section of the township.</p><p>We welcome any effort to provide firebreaks in the most wooded portion of our town ,\" Palmer said. Certainly, any safety measure to assist in this area is appreciated and extremely useful .\"</p><p>Smith noted that the $380,000 slated toward building a five-mile long firebreak near JB-MDL will protect people and property to the west of Whiting .\"</p><p>\" This area in Whiting is part of the New Jersey Pine Barrens is vulnerable to forest fires in the dry seasons or droughts ,\" Smith said. This project protects America's only Army-Navy-Air Force joint basethe second largest employer in New Jerseyand the missions it performs. More importantly, it also protects the residents of Whiting. There are many homes and businesses concentrated in Whiting which will be better protected through this project .\"</p><p>The DoD awarded the funds from its Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration (REPI) Program that promotes projects with local partners to collaborate in the preservation of compatible land uses near military installations, ranges and other strategic sites. REPI is designed to protect DoD assets and capabilities to maintain military readiness throughout the United States.</p><p>Smith said Naval Weapons Station Earle, headquartered in the Fourth District he represents, has been a leader in seeking the REMI grant. Dennis Blazak, Community Plans and Liaison Officer at Earle, has pursued this competitive funding for several years.</p><p>A total of $1,935,564.98 will be distributed to protect six military sites across 1.6 million acres in the Garden State that are threatened by development and encroachment which could impact the military mission:</p><p>-</p><p>$500,000 for storm surge protection for Naval Weapons Station Earle in Middletown, Monmouth County;</p><p>-</p><p>$500,000 for living shoreline protection in the form of a \"T\"-shaped oyster castle groin in Barnegat Bay, in Ocean County near Island Beach State Park.</p><p>-</p><p>$380,000 for wildfire mitigation near Joint Base MDL in Ocean/Burlington counties (Whiting project);</p><p>-</p><p>$300,000 to protect 44,000 acres of forest area in the Greenwood State from wildfire near the NJ National Guard Warren Grove Gunnery Range in Ocean/Burlington counties;</p><p>-</p><p>$150,000 for Rancocas Creek Watershed stormwater management to protect the area near Lockheed Martin plant that produces AEGIS technology for the U.S. Navy in Burlington County, and;</p><p>-</p><p>over $100,000 for storm surge protection near Earle, in Keansburg, Monmouth County.</p><p>PHOTO: Naval Weapons Station Earle sailors assist the NY/NJ Baykeepers install oyster castles in the waters off Earle's pier to establish a living shoreline at the entrance of Ware Creek (undated U.S. Navy file photo taken by Bill Addison)</p><p>The projects are being done in conjunction with the lead partner, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, as well as local authorities, and they will be augmented with state and local resources.</p><p>The competitive funding announced was part of a $17 million effort across the country to fund projects at a dozen locations. There is no required state or local match for the federal funding.</p><p>\" These projects which the DoD has identified will help make the bases safer should we face any upcoming rounds of base realignment and closure (BRAC) ,\" Smith said, who successfully led the fight to reverse the planned closure of Lakehurst Naval Air Engineering Station in 1995, as well as helped in other fights to save Fort Dix and McGuire AFB in the 1990s, later merged into the Joint Base in 2009. Earle is a critical base for the Navy and its logistical shipping, and protecting its mission is crucial to national security, and to the jobs of the men and women who work there .\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124028434</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:613T-J6N1-DYTH-G1DK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"836\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 20, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Ahmed Aden, a police officer.</p><p>LEBANON: Lebanese President Michel Aoun said the probe into this month's devastating blast in Beirut is \"very complex\" and would not be finished quickly.

Thousands of people assembled at Bangkok's Democracy Monument, where they heard speeches, watched skits and listened to music. Organizers issued a call for the government to take action by next month or face another major protest rally. The student-led movement had already declared three core demands: holding new elections, amending the constitution and ending the intimidation of critics of the government.

The comment was written and posted on June 21, 2021:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On behalf of the 16,000 members of the American Thoracic Society (ATS), I am pleased to submit the following comments on the Request for Comments: Technical Support Document: Social Cost of Carbon, Methane, and Nitrous Oxide Interim Estimates (OMB-2021-09679). As background, the ATS is a medical professional society of physicians, scientists, respiratory therapists, nurses, and allied health professionals dedicated to the prevention, detection, treatment and cure of respiratory disease, critical care illness and sleep disordered breathing. Our members pursue our missions through research, clinical care, education, and advocacy. Our members are strongly committed to advancing the science documenting climate changes and its adverse health effects as well as advocating for policies that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The ATS has identified climate change as one of the most important health concerns facing our patients, who are children and adults across the United States who suffer from critical illness or lung diseases (1, 2).</p><p>What is causing climate change?</p><p>CO2 concentrations are on the rise due to human activities that burn fossil fuels for energy. CO2 levels have risen by 40% since pre-industrial times. Due to the greenhouse effect of higher CO2 levels, temperatures are rising and are predicted to increase 0.5 degree to 5.6 degree F over the 21st century (3).</p><p>Climate Change Harms Human Health</p><p>Heat waves are predicted to worsen - by mid-21st century, more than 50% of the summers will have temperatures exceeding the highest temperatures seen in the 20th century (3). Extreme heat increases mortality, especially in the elderly and those with chronic diseases (4,5) and increases hospitalization for respiratory conditions and other causes (6,7). People living in cities, particularly elderly and low-income families in neighborhoods with large buildings, little open space, and less access to air conditioning, are especially vulnerable to extreme heat (8).</p><p>Climate change worsens air pollution and ground-level ozone: Higher temperatures result in higher levels of ozone pollution (a component of smog) (9), which worsens asthma and increases risk of respiratory hospitalization and mortality (10). Particulate matter (PM): Wildfires and dust storms are on the rise, releasing more PM. Fuel burning to meet air conditioning needs may also release more PM. PM increases risk of hospitalization and death for respiratory and cardiovascular conditions, including asthma and heart attacks (18,19). It slows lung function growth among children and hastens lung function decline in adults (11,12).</p><p>Climate change lengthens the pollen season and raises pollen production - Pollen levels rose over 40% in the 2000s compared to the 1990s in the northern states (13). The range of plant species is expanding towards the poles, exposing new populations to pollen. Changes in the pollen season may help explain the increasing prevalence of allergy in the US.</p><p>Mold exposure increases due to more frequent hurricanes, heavy rainfall, and flooding Mold at home, work and school can trigger asthma attacks and worsen other chronic lung conditions (10).</p><p>Forest fires become more frequent due to hot, dry conditions - Climate change is estimated to have nearly doubled the forest fire area burned across western US during 1984-2015 (10). Wildfires kill, and release a range of pollutants, including PM and acrolein (a respiratory irritant), and carcinogens such as formaldehyde and benzene. Breathing wildfire smoke increases risk of respiratory and cardiovascular emergency room visits and hospitalizations (14) (15) and overall mortality (16).</p><p>ATS members are seeing the adverse health effects in their patients - Climate scientists do not dispute that climate change is occurring. ATS doctors concur. In a 2015 survey (17), 77% of ATS members noted worsening of chronic lung disease as a consequence of climate change (ozone, wildfires, heat waves). Fifty-eight percent of ATS members observed an increase in allergic disease associated with pollen and mold levels.</p><p>Health Damage Functions Must Be Improved</p><p>The current social cost of carbon estimates do not fully capture the true health costs associated with climate change. The shortcomings of the current health-damage functions have been noted by the National Academies of Sciences, executive orders issued by the Biden Administration, and recent publications on social cost of carbon. The failure of the current economic models to capture the scientifically documented adverse health effects of climate change mean the current social costs of carbon estimates significantly underestimate the true social costs of carbon. The ATS notes the current heat-health damage functions used in economic models are particularly crude and do not appropriately use currently available data. Social cost of carbon models could be significantly improved by using available heat-health damage function data.</p><p>In an effort to improve the current heat-health damage functions, the ATS recently held a virtual workshop with experts from respiratory, cardiology, vector-borne infectious diseases and economics to review the available research on heat-health damage functions. There will be two products of this workshop: first a comprehensive literature review with pooled estimates of damage functions for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, child health and vector-borne diseases. The second product of the workshop will be a series of recommendations on how to improve the underlying research that supports the damage functions and future research needs to improve the reliability and precision of function damage function estimates. The ATS expects to have the literature review and pooled damage function work completed shortly (60-90 days) and hopes this information will be useful as the Administration develops new social cost of carbon estimates. We hope the research recommendations will guide federal research and program investments to improve the science and economic modeling that will be used in future social cost of carbon estimates.</p><p>High Discount Rates Undervalue Climate Health Effects</p><p>The ATS notes with concern economic models that use high discount rates. The use of high discount rates significantly undervalues the true benefits of addressing climate change for future generations and grossly overvalues the monetary benefits of current generations. In a recent survey of nearly 200 economists, the vast majority recommended using social cost of carbon discount rates between 1% and 3%, with higher (3%) discount rates for near-term (30-year) estimates and lower rates (1%) for long-term (30+ years) estimates. While ATS members are not experts in economic analysis, we believe strongly that high discount rates (7%) used in previous social cost of carbon estimates, including circular A-4, are inappropriate and would strongly urge Interagency Working Group to consider discount rates in the range of 1%-3%. We further recommend federal agencies continue to support climate change modeling assumptions that will further support and refine social cost of carbon model estimates.</p><p>The ATS appreciates the opportunity to comment on social cost of carbon estimates and the underlying assumptions supporting the current models. We hope our comments and our ongoing scholarly contributions to this field will help OMB and IWG determine future social cost of carbon estimates.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Lynn M.

We would have won.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: Then the special counsel investigation of January 6th finally moves into Georgia.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: Tell us, I need 11,000 votes, give me a break.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: And what we`re learning about criminal referrals from the January 6th committee,</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We`re going to be able to show in a lot more vivid and striking detail in our report precisely how Donald Trump put the whole plan together.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: Plus, Congressman Ruben Gallego on the Kari Lake lawsuit and Kyrsten Sinema`s Democratic defection. And incredible news of what could be the holy grail for the transition to a green energy future. And All In starts right now.</p><p>Good evening from New York. I`m Chris Hayes. When Republicans take over the House in just a few weeks, they will do so with a majority provided in part by some creative gerrymandering by Republican governors and legislators in a few states.</p><p>The strike surprisingly strong performance in New York state, where the Republican Party gained four House seats, including in districts Joe Biden won in 2020. Four House seats is basically half the majority. And so, you might think that New York Republicans have maybe figured something out in the era of Trump and MAGA about appealing to the median voter.</p><p>In fact, one could argue that was the underpinning of gubernatorial candidate Lee Zeldin`s gubernatorial campaign, even though he lost the general election to incumbent Democratic Kathy Hochul, Zeldin was disciplined and focused almost exclusively on crime, law and order and a bail reform law that he wrongly said was to blame for everything. And he outperformed Donald Trump`s 2020 performance by nearly 10 points in New York.</p><p>And the other thing is, it`s not like Republicans haven`t figured out how to have success in other deep blue states during this entire era. Take Maryland and Massachusetts, which are the most striking examples, both with extremely popular two-term Republican governors, Larry Hogan, and Charlie Baker. In fact, the pair were the number one and number three most popular governors according to a morning console poll, the number two being Republican Phil Scott, Vermont, another example of the same genre.</p><p>And to be clear, these men are all very much conservatives, Republicans, they definitely have stymied a lot of very good important progressive initiatives. There`s lots of things, I think they`ve done a bad job on. But they were in effect in a rhetoric generally, for lack of a better word, normal, normal non-MAGA Republicans. And yet what we have seen happen is that the Republican Party would rather take - rather than take the lead of Hogan and Baker, they`ve been so trapped by MAGA politics that Republicans would rather lose than follow the Hogan-Baker, Phil Scott model.</p><p>That`s exactly what happened in 2022, in both states, Maryland and Massachusetts and their gubernatorial races were neither Hogan nor Baker were on the ballot, and instead, Trump backed primary challengers won, their crowded Republican primary fields by pushing the MAGA line, in some cases, getting a Trump endorsement to the point where Charlie Baker refused to endorse the Republican nominee who was nominee to replace him.</p><p>Larry Hogan went even further calling the nominee in his state from the Republican Party to be his successor, not mentally stable. Now, you can imagine how those elections went. These are already states where Republicans have an uphill battle. They`re already states carried by Biden by double-digits. And you`ve got the outgoing, very well-liked Republican governors being like, no, no, no, no. Right. Well, Democrats won both governors mention (ph) in landslide.</p><p>And this is happening in states that aren`t deep blue, swing states like you saw it in Arizona, right crucial swing state. They just had the most devastating statewide results for Republicans in years. They went over three in the marquee races, potentially over four depending on how that razor-thin Attorney General recount plays out.</p><p>And again, same thing. Candidates were MAGA diehards backed by a state party, run by perennial fringe candidate Kelli Ward, who`s so extreme, she was nicknamed Chemtrail Kelli by a Super PAC allied with Mitch McConnell, over her conspiratorial thinking. These kinds of extremist candidates have cost Republicans over and over again. But not New York, right. So, New York is different. New York Republicans managed to buck that trend in 2022</p><p>But here`s the thing, wasn`t really because they moderated. But basically, they got very lucky. Zeldin again ran a fairly disciplined race to the top, but really what they had was Rupert Murdoch`s New York Post feeding a nearly uninterrupted stream of crime, fear-mongering into the populace with local news picking up lots of the stories and amplifying the apparent rampant lawlessness.</p><p>[20:05:00]</p><p>Now here`s the thing. Even the violent crime like felony assaults is up in New York. This year, the most serious crime homicide has thankfully fallen almost 10 percent. And while crime and violence are both real challenges in New York, one we reported on talked about, they`re also really serious issues in places like Philadelphia, which saw nowhere near the same level of political backlash on the issue. And I think that has a lot to do with the local media environment.</p><p>As Bloomberg found, mentions of violent crime, print, digital media headlines are way, way up. Republicans were able to kind of get that wind at their back and coast on the law-and-order message to victory. And if you think that they understand that that was what propelled them, they now need to carve out an identity distinct from Donald Trump and MAGAnism to be successful. You`d be really wrong.</p><p>Because here`s the thing, there are not any Republicans out there in the Larry Hogan vein really, voting for New York Republicans doesn`t get you some non-MAGA Larry Hogan, Charlie Baker type politician. No. It gets you what we saw at the annual gala thrown by New York young Republicans, which has become this incredibly radicalized pro-Trump, pro-insurrection group.</p><p>Southern Poverty Law Center had an investigative reporter there documenting the event, snapping these pictures that include Peter Brimelow, the man on the left in the white hair there. He`s the publisher of VDARE, an anti- immigrant white nationalist website, quite infamous in the hard Right circles. He`s posing for a photo with Steve Bannon. Of course, Donald Trump Jr. was there. The keynote speaker was none other than Georgia Congressman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who basically bragged about the insurrection and how she and Bannon would have done it right.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GREENE: I come to Washington, I swear in on January 3rd, I get accused of giving insurrection tours which I thought was hilarious, because I couldn`t even find the bathroom in the Capitol Hill. True story. Then on January 6th happens and next thing you know I organized the whole thing along with Steve Bannon here. And I am going to tell you something if Steve Bannon and I had organized that, we would have won. Not to mention, it would have been armed. See that`s the whole joke isn`t it. They say that thing was planned and I`m like, are you kidding me? A bunch of conservative, Second Amendment supporters went in the Capitol without guns and they think that we organized that. I don`t think so.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: I want to play that whole thing just because it`s fair to give the context and also the crowd reaction, right? She`s sort of doing a bit, not particularly adept comedian, but doing a bit nonetheless. And then you can hear the we were arm line and the reaction right, the yelps of support, also the sucking in her breath, then the scrambling to make it a joke. But the crowd was both aghast and also cheering the notion that if she and Steve Bannon had organized January 6th, there would have been a lot more bloodshed that the bullets would have been flying into the brains of the cops, rather than being concussed by hand.</p><p>And right there, hobnobbing with Far-Right figures. This thing to Marjorie Taylor Greene sort of boast about how a more effective, more bloody, more deadly and violent January 6th would have happened at her`s and Steve Bannon`s direction. A joke was exactly one of those Republicans who won a district that went for Joe Biden by eight points in 2020. You should know his name. Incoming Congressman George Santos. Mr. Santos won an upset victory in New York`s congressional district and is celebrating by attending a kind of insurrection ball with Marj Greene.</p><p>The only thing that will possibly teach these people a lesson is electoral defeat. So, the next Republican who flips the Democratic seat thinks twice before going to watch a Marjorie Taylor Greene enthusiastically tell the crowd, how she would have made sure people took up arms against our government and wage a seditious war.</p><p>David Jolly is former Republican Congressman of Florida who since left the party. Elaina Plott Calabro is a staff writer for The Atlantic, where her most recent piece is a profile about Marjorie Taylor Greene. Why is Marjorie Taylor Greene like this? A good question. Hopefully she will answer. They`re both joining me now.</p><p>David, let`s start with just the sort of optics here. I mean, Santos is freshman rep. Already probably one of the top frontline targets, right? If you`re the Democratic Party, you put it in a spreadsheet, and he`s in the top three probably. He is a very MAGA guy. He was a sort of stop the steal dude. To go for the New York Republican Party would be like, we want Marjorie Taylor Greene, Steve Bannon and Peter Brimelow and this congressman to go to that room. It just says that he doesn`t think anyone can touch him and it doesn`t matter what the median voter thinks, he`s fine.</p><p>DAVID JOLLY (D) FORMER CONGRESSMAN, FLORIDA: Yes, that`s right, Chris. The state of New York may have a number of one term Republican members in this incoming class for exactly the reasons you`ve said.</p><p>[20:10:00]</p><p>Those are some of the swing seats you`ll see that will be targeted by Democrats two years from now. You can call it poor judgment, or you can call it simply a reflection of where his politics are, and where the party is. It was a dangerous words by Marjorie Taylor Greene that deserved the censure of the house, but not just now embraced by incoming members of Congress, also embraced by Kevin McCarthy. That is part of this story as well.</p><p>This is part of his rise to the speakership is platforming people like Marjorie Taylor Greene. Chris, you`ll remember, you know, Newt Gingrich came to the speakership with the Contract with America, he was going to reform welfare, cut taxes, offer a strong defense. Kevin McCarthy is suggesting we`re going to platform someone who celebrated a violent insurrection, we`re going to examine Hunter Biden`s personal photos, and we`re going to attack the leading public health expert in the world that is responsible for saving millions of lives.</p><p>Kevin McCarthy is tied at the hip with what we saw in the New York Republican club, with Marjorie Taylor Greene as is the incoming Republican delegation from the state of New York,</p><p>HAYES: You know, there`s certain, Elaina, there`s certain politicians who, independent of their politics or ideology, I could add a sort of performance level say, well, this person is quite charismatic. I felt that way about Kari Lake, who is a TV presenter for years and is obviously knows what she`s doing when she`s doing public communication. I think that`s clearly true of Donald Trump in his own strange way.</p><p>Marjorie Taylor Greene doesn`t really strike me that way to be totally honest. And I`m not the intended audience. I`m willing to - I`m willing to admit, but I do wonder like, what you found out about how she has become the kind of person who would be the star keynote guest at these kinds of events.</p><p>ELAINA PLOTT CALABRO, THE ATLANTIC STAFF WRITER: I would say that the primary reason Marjorie Taylor Greene has ascended to this level in the party and so quickly, is that the Republican base, which is to say the people most likely to turn out and vote in primaries, take her absolutely seriously.</p><p>You`ll remember the kind of - sort of off denigrated line that people took Donald Trump seriously, but not literally. What I found in Marjorie Taylor`s district is that her biggest supporters actually do take her quite literally and love her for that. They love the idea that in retrospect, perhaps if Capitol insurrectionists had been armed, their preferred man would be president right now.</p><p>And the problem however is that because Marjorie Taylor Greene has been platform the way she does, her views are not marginalized by the party, as they were with say someone like Steve King of Iowa, he might remember. If you think about it, a congresswoman like Marjorie Taylor Greene is not saying anything or her tenor is not terribly different than someone like Steve King. But Steve King was also not one of the top Republican fundraisers in the entire conference--</p><p>HAYES: Right.</p><p>CALABRO: Which you go to Congressman Jolly`s point, this is why Kevin McCarthy, when he, you know, presumably does take the speakership, finally, he`s not going to censure Marjorie Taylor Greene for comments like this, because she is his critical link right now to possibly picking off the five or six more votes he needs with the Right.</p><p>HAYES: I would say - yes, I mean, he`s in - she is playing that role. And she strikes me as having some tactical sense, at least enough tactical sense to understand--</p><p>CALABRO: Absolutely--</p><p>HAYES: Her leverage right here. The thing I will say about her, I want to read this paragraph, unlike Josh Hawley or Ted Cruz, who are just in a truly painful and cringe inducing way doing essentially a bit, I mean, there`s a sort of kind of like MAGA working class Republican cosplay or whatever. Marjorie Taylor Greene has the politics that she`s prompting (ph), I think like to her core down to every last cell, that is what Marjorie Taylor Greene believes.</p><p>I think those old Facebook posts that got her in trouble like demonstrate that, she wasn`t performatively doing that. She was like, I think the Rothschilds might have used their lasers to start the forest fire in California. That`s a possibility. You`re right that her political origin story was not unlike that of millions of other Trump supporters, despite (inaudible) hinted and interest in politics. She found herself suddenly beguiled by a feeling, a conviction that despite the distance between Trump`s gold-plated world on her own, she knew exactly who he was. He reminded me of most men I know, she has said, men like my dad, I thought that was an interesting line.</p><p>It`s also the case, David that on this, you heard the crowd`s reaction of that insurrection line. We`re getting this breaking news out of talking points (inaudible) today and Hunter Walker reporting this for a whole bunch of these texts that (inaudible) turned over being made public. And you just realize the degree to which the stain of insurrection still hasn`t been laundered out of the Congress, right.</p><p>So, here`s Ralph Norman of South Carolina. This is on January 17th; this is after the insurrection. This is after January 6th. This is at the place - he says Mark and seeing what`s happening so quickly, reading about the Dominion lawsuits, attempting to stop any meaningful investigation, we are at a point of no return in saving our republic, our last hope is invoking martial law, please urge to president to do so and this is not that uncommon among the ranks the House Republicans.</p><p>[20:15:00]</p><p>JOLLY: Yes. Yes, Chris. That`s right. And we have to recognize the seriousness of this and the danger of this. And kind of the disconnect between House Republicans and Kevin McCarthy and many others in the party. Think of Jeb Bush, Ron DeSantis, Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, who want to get past all of this, Kevin McCarthy is now inviting it in closer and elevating it and celebrating it. And it is incredibly dangerous. I did not think that we would see a McCarthy leadership play that would involve going all the way to OK, we`re going to celebrate insurrectionists. I`m going to let you investigate the investigators related to January 6th, and we`re going to investigate the jail wardens who are responsible for the custodianship of those who were arrested for a violent insurrection.</p><p>But that`s where House Republicans are going to be. Now, to your point earlier in your opener, House Republicans are accountable to a different constituency, as Elaina said, than a statewide constituency, like you see in New York, or Maryland. And they will be rewarded for this. I expect this to be amplified for two straight years by a McCarthy, Republican House.</p><p>HAYES: We`ll see what happens in third district. Quickly, Elaina, just how much is Marjorie Taylor Greene`s performance of leverage - performance of leverage and how much is real leverage?</p><p>CALABRO: I would say it`s absolutely real leverage, like I said, she raises perhaps other than McCarthy himself and maybe Patrick Henry and Steve Scalise more money than anyone else in the House Republican conference. When she is invoked, small donors` turnout.</p><p>HAYES: David Jolly and Elaina Plott Calabro, thank you so much for your time. Appreciate it.</p><p>CALABRO: Thank you, Chris.</p><p>HAYES: Coming up, the Special Counsel continues to keep the pressure on Donald Trump Sr. issuing a subpoena to the man that he asked to stealing votes in Georgia. What it all means to the disgraced ex-president, next.</p><p>[20:20:00]</p><p>HAYES: It hasn`t even been a month since Jack Smith was appointed special counsel. Those investigations are making a lot of news amidst a flurry of activity, some of which is being reported publicly. Today, we got confirmation that the Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger received a subpoena from the special counsel. The source telling NBC News, the subpoena was only a request for documents. It was delivered just days after Smith subpoenaed local officials in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, four other states where Donald Trump tried to flip the results of the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>And it comes as the January 6th committee to base criminal referrals and its own investigation, committee met this weekend to discuss, Congressman Adam Schiff explained that even if some people are not referred doesn`t mean there isn`t evidence, they committed a crime.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): If we do make referrals, we want to be very careful about how we do them. But I think we`re all certainly in agreement that there is evidence of criminality here. And we want to make sure that the Justice Department is aware of that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: Harry Litman is a former U.S. Attorney and former Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Department of Justice, host of the Talking Feds Podcast. First, Harry, the subpoena to Raffensperger is striking to me for two reasons. One, wow. OK, like clearly if you`re subpoenaing Raffensperger, we have a broad idea of what you`re investigating, the attempt to overturn an election in the state of Georgia, similar to the Fulton County District Attorney. But two, like how did it take two years for that to happen? What does it mean about the Jack Smith era? What do you think of that second question?</p><p>HARRY LITMAN, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: Well, look, on the second, it means that whatever has happened in the last two years, including voluntary discussions. He is on the move that just since Thanksgiving, we`ve had two or three White House lawyers, three aides, Stephen Miller, now Raffensperger and roughly speaking, use a grand jury to gather facts, but also to prepare for trial. I think he knows, most of us know what Raffensperger knows, but it may well be that he`s already sort of focused on putting charges together.</p><p>So, how`s it - how did it take two years? We talked about this during the two years including all the time they spent with the marauders on the ground, but however long it took, he`s certainly true to his word that he`s not slowing things down. Really a flurry just since Thanksgiving.</p><p>HAYES: Yes, I guess here`s an institutional question. And as someone who worked as a U.S. Attorney where you had your own kind of - you had some autonomy, you`re running that office, but of course, you still work from Maine justice, and then worked at Maine justice. And there`s all sorts of complicated institutional dynamics of play. One of the things I thought was Garland putting this on Smith might allow Smith to be more aggressive or less hindered by worrying where every footfall happens than if you`re Garland because he`s insulated a little bit from the charges of conflict. What do you think of that logic, and whether that`s even a plausible scenario for what we`re seeing?</p><p>LITMAN: I think it`s an excellent point. He - Smith is like this person apart in his own office that now has been walled off in a way. So, there`s - he represents the institution a little bit less and you`re exactly right. There could be tension, perhaps why, you know, Georgia is doing this. Why is DOJ also doing it? There`s very, very good reason, but I think Smith can just put his head down and barrel head and it`s not the same kind of federal government to state government or DOJ to Georgia, it`s the guy who is just thinking about nothing other than investigating all that`s in front of him.</p><p>I`ve got the end of the day; Garland needs to winnow things down for whatever reason that would be Garland`s call. Smith is gathering it all.</p><p>[20:25:00]</p><p>HAYES: On the January 6th committee, I mean, there`s a lot - there`s been a lot of back and forth about the criminal referrals, essentially, they don`t bear a tremendous amount of legal weight. But one of the points that my colleague Rachel Maddow makes in her amazing podcast Ultra is that--</p><p>LITMAN: It`s so great, by the way, wow.</p><p>HAYES: It`s really. It`s astoundingly good. It`s a truly like incredible if you have not checked it out. And it`s totally revelatory. One of the points she makes in that is, look, there`s lots of aspects to what we would call civil society, democratic culture, democratic institutions, democratic actors that aren`t just a conviction or an indictment. And it`s important for everyone to signal disapproval and opprobrium for this kind of thing. And I wonder what you think of the ultimate meaning of these referrals if and when they come?</p><p>LITMAN: Yes, it is so right. Look, I - we say every time, Schiff says on TV, well, the Department of Justice doesn`t have to. This is really not about Congress to DOJ. This is about Congress to the public and fulfilling the role that they`ve done splendidly over the last several months which showed the series of set pieces--</p><p>HAYES: Yes.</p><p>LITMAN: With individual sort of villains in each and the people they`re contemplating referring and all signs are there going to. I think if there was a lot of discord about it, we would know it`s almost a companion piece to that - to the movie, here are the five referrals, Clark is the head of the DOJ chapter. And Eastman of the Pence can do anything chapter and Giuliani of the pressure electors` chapter and Meadows everywhere. So, these are - it would almost be discordant for them to have presented the pieces and then simply back down and calling them as they are criminals.</p><p>A final piece, I hope DOJ will get there. But I think this all the president`s men aspect is really important. Think about Nixon who wasn`t prosecuted, but everyone, the social judgment of Watergate is firm in part because Halderman goes to jail. Ehrlichman goes to jail, Trump was a conspire. That means he agreed with other people.</p><p>HAYES: Yes.</p><p>LITMAN: And whatever happens to him, it`s very important that those other people have accountability to this first step.</p><p>HAYES: Really good point. Harry Litman, thank you very much. Still to come after Senator Kyrsten Sinema ditches the Democratic Party, Arizona Congressman Ruben Gallego says he might run for her seat and he joins me just ahead. Don`t go anywhere.</p><p>[20:30:00]</p><p>HAYES: The sorest loser, the 2022 midterms and it was a competitive field, I think it`s safe to say is Kari Lake of Arizona. On some level that sound surprising. She was a Trump darling who ran her entire campaign for Arizona governor on stop to steal. She was a formidable, dangerous candidate, former local TV news anchor, she was a very smooth communicator who outperformed some of the other Republicans who ran statewide and also lost, including Blake Masters, who ran for Senate and Mark Finchem, another election denier who ran for Secretary of State.</p><p>The reason for Kari Lake`s defeat is very clear. She lost a lot of winnable Republicans because she was harping on the false claim of Trump`s stolen election in 2020. And crowing about things like putting these sticks to the heart of the McCain party in Arizona. A Washington Post analysis of exit polling found that 9 percent of self-described Republicans voted for Democrat Katie Hobbs over their party candidate, independents broke for Hobbs by 7 percent margin, and Lake received 120,000 fewer votes and the winning Republican candidate for State Treasurer who was the most successful statewide and stressed issues like fiscal discipline instead of conspiracy theories.</p><p>Lake ended up losing to Democrat Katie Hobbs by just 17,000 votes, but like her mentor, who lost to Joe Biden by about 10,000 votes. Kari Lake is refusing to understand the basic election of this election and is trying instead to get it overturned. She had one lawsuit already thrown out. On Friday, she filed a second lawsuit challenging the vote in Maricopa County, state`s largest county where Phoenix is, making unsupported claims of illegal ballots, intentional misconduct by election officials asking the court to just declare her the rightful winner or alternatively to redo the election in Maricopa.</p><p>She and her supporters are appearing all the places you would appear if you`re trying to get an election overturn. Like for instance, Steve Benton`s war room where she said this today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KARI LAKE (R) ARIZONA GOVERNOR CANDIDATE: This is about restoring faith in our elections. You talked about COVID, you talked about what`s being revealed, it was all there to really destroy a president, bring down President Trump and lead to the issues that led to the 2020 rigged election. Nothing was done about it. Very little was done to fix any of the problems that we saw in 2020. And now we get 2022. And it`s even worse. It`s all of the same stuff they pulled in 2020 and then they went above and beyond on that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: COVID, all a big plot to destroy Donald Trump. The big lesson for anyone with eyes to see it is that in Arizona and many other places, these kind of antics are unpopular and alienating and they repel voters. And Arizona has become a somewhat unlikely center of American policy in the last two elections and off the news of Senator Kyrsten Sinema`s announcement that she is leaving the Democratic Party to become an independent. One of her former Democratic colleagues in Arizona Congressman Ruben Gallego, who was potential primary challenges what many believed drove Sinema to change party affiliation, told NBC News he`s looking at running against her as the Democrat in 2024.</p><p>[20:35:00]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. RUBEN GALLEGO (D-AZ): If Kyrsten Sinema runs and actually stays in the race, she will help the Democrat win. So, I`m very excited for her to stay in the race. I think it`ll promise to show the fact that the Senate seat will stay and its very simple math. The Republicans have not been to hold the coalition together for quite a while. That`s half of the last three cycles. But the big voting bloc of Latinos are not going to go anywhere else, and they certainly aren`t going to go if there`s Latino member of congress that`s running on the ticket. And at the end of the day, that`s what it takes to win and Sinema doesn`t have it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: If there`s a Latino member of Congress running in the ticket. Sure. Sounds like he`s running. I`ll ask him when he joins me, next. Don`t go anywhere.</p><p>[20:40:00]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KYRSTEN SINEMA (D-AZ): Registering as an independent and showing up to work with the title of independent is a reflection of who I`ve always been. And it`s a reflection of who Arizona is.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: It may in fact be Kyrsten Sinema`s true rationale for switching parties, but I think she`s also leaving out a pretty big part of the equation, that becoming an independent also helps head off any Democratic primary challengers in 2024. And that`s a big problem for her at least it was, appointed on a Friday. Sinema is not popular among Arizona Democrats. I mean, astoundingly so, but as an independent she can force Democrats to decide whether to field their own candidate for Senate in two years, and risk splitting the vote which could tip the seat to a Far-Right Republican like God forbid Kari Lake.</p><p>Well, now the most likely Democratic primary challenger says he may still run against her in 2024. Arizona Congressman Ruben Gallego, he`s a Marine veteran in the Iraq war, has not been afraid of a fight during his time in Congress. He was first elected to represent Arizona`s seventh district, which includes parts of Phoenix had said fairly public verbal brawls with some Republicans. And on January 6th famously helped his colleagues on the House floor after rioters breached the building. Gallego spoke later about how his military instincts kicked in that day.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GALLEGO: I was ready to fight. I saw a lot of back in my day, but I was not going to die in the floor of the House of Representatives like I was not going to get taken up by some insurrections, bastard. My plan was to stab somebody in the eye and in the throat and take away their weapon and fight to survive.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: And Congressman Ruben Gallego joins me now. Congressman, it`s good to have you on the program. I know you`ve been asked this before. And you`ve been a little cagey. So, I`ll ask you again, more directly. Right now, if you had to choose, would you run for Senate?</p><p>GALLEGO: Well, right now, what I`m choosing to do is to put the team together, so I can make the decision. I`ve been putting together a great team, I think that will help me get in the right direction. I am a Marine, first, congressmen second, and Marines we prepare. And that`s what I`m doing right now.</p><p>HAYES: Were you surprised by Sinema`s announcement?</p><p>GALLEGO: Not really, I thought she was going to do this eventually. Look, she claims to be independent. That`s not the case. The case is that she can`t win a primary against me. And this is her only option. And more importantly, she really has just abandoned the values of Arizona. And her being independent has nothing to do with the values of Arizona. It just means that she has an easier time to run. And she could go and talk to her friends in Wall Street and pharma companies. But in the day, she long ago abandoned Arizona when it comes to representing their values.</p><p>HAYES: You - did you serve with her in Congress? Right. I mean, you were in the same delegation. I`m just curious what your relationship with her is like, have you spoken about this at all?</p><p>GALLEGO: Well, I`ve known her since my mid-20s. We both worked on campaigns together. We were in the State House, State Senate together, we`re in Congress together. I`ve supported her on every election. But she has really stopped talking to me and other Democrats, elected officials, which is not a problem. The problem is that she hasn`t talked to any Arizonans. Everyday Arizonans. She has avoided. She has not had one town hall in three years. She`s more likely to meet with lobbyists, and she is with a constituent.</p><p>And at the end of the day, again, she doesn`t have to talk to me. I`m just an elected official. The fact is, she ignores Arizona, she ignores our values, what we stand for. And I think that`s why she is in the predicament that she is right now. There she has to run because she can`t win a primary.</p><p>HAYES: Yes, it does seem her favorability ratings among the Arizona Democrats. I think the latest polling we had had, had her at 30 percent, 36 percent among Republicans, 41 percent among independents. What`s striking there is that it`s not actually a very good overall favorable reading. It`s not like she`s like crushing it with independents or Republicans either. It`s sort of low across the board. It`s 37 percent favorable, 54 unfavorable.</p><p>The calculation here does seem a kind of, a game of chicken, which is this, OK, I can`t survive a Republic - Democratic primary. If I run as an independent, you possibly split the vote, and you pave the way for Republican to win. I know you seem confident that`s not going to happen, but it is a state where that`s the kind of thing that seems like could happen given how narrow and closely contested the state is.</p><p>GALLEGO: Well, number one, I don`t scare easily, never have and never will. Number two, the math is - doesn`t prove that`s true. Republicans have not been able to hold a coalition for the last three cycles.</p><p>[20:45:00]</p><p>And they`re not going to be able to do it again. The same time, we have lot of Latino voters that I think are going to stick with the Democratic Party. And lastly, I don`t see Democrats, Republicans or independents, rushing towards someone who stood up for pharma when we were trying to negotiate the drug price benefits, who fought for hedge fund managers, which are nearly non-existent in Arizona, instead of really trying to fight to bring the price of insulin down. Those aren`t Arizona values. Those aren`t independent, they are not even Republican values.</p><p>So, unless there`s somehow a big influx of Wall Street lobbyists to move to Arizona, I don`t know where her base is going to come from.</p><p>HAYES: Where - how likely is the state or how complicated the state ballot access laws? I mean, is this going to be something she`s able to sustain, build an organization and have a proper campaign and be on the ballot?</p><p>GALLEGO: Look, I can`t tell you that. She has to run her own campaign. I know, for example, we`ve been - again, we`ve been talking about this, but we had a lot of support. Just this weekend at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.gallegoforarizona\">www.gallegoforarizona</url>, we had an amazing amount of people donating money, volunteering their time, and we`re not even close to doing a full announcement. I don`t think she can have that. No one gets excited about someone who`s fighting for the rich and trying to malign the poor. That`s not really in anybody`s DNA. That`s not - again, not even Republican`s DNA.</p><p>So, I don`t know where it`s going to come from. But that`s not my job to figure it out. That`d be her job to figure it out.</p><p>HAYES: You mentioned a few specific policy areas that you object to, there`s reporting that she was key in lobbying to maintain what`s called the carried interest loophole, something that the Democrats have wanted to zero out, in fact, Joe Manchin had supported zeroing it out. And she was a key figure in making sure that didn`t happen, hedge fund managers can still save - pay very, very low rates, if they get their income defined essentially as carried interest.</p><p>As well as protecting a big class of drugs that Big Pharma was lobbying very hard for. Are there other areas, like, for instance, the minimum wage, she famously voted thumbs down on raising it to $15 an hour, there are other specific areas where as you`ve watched her votes, or her public policy positions where you object to them?</p><p>GALLEGO: Well, I think that the first thing that that you owe as an elected official is to be responsive, right? I think it`s a mortal sin that you`ve been in the Senate for three years and have yet to have one town hall, unscripted town hall. When you have more meetings with lobbyists that are fundraising for you than you have with your citizens that have elected you. I think that`s a problem right there.</p><p>Number two, when you claim to have been a friend and a compatriot of John Lewis, and you have voted for him repeatedly for Speaker of the House, and then you use a Jim Crow era law, rule of the Senate, the filibuster to stop some very necessary reforms, especially after a coup. I think that`s another step right there. I think that just really put people and a lot of voters and myself in a very hard position.</p><p>And lastly, again, talk to your constituents, you owe it to them. We`re here for them. We`re not here for the lobbyists. We`re not here for the big donors. I know that`s what I`m going to do when I come home over the holidays. I`m going to listen to them, matter of fact actually, have a telephone town hall tomorrow, unscripted before all this happened, and I`m going to listen to them and that`s how I`m going to make my determination about my future. And I think she should try that.</p><p>HAYES: All right, Congressman Ruben Gallego, thank you so much for your time tonight.</p><p>GALLEGO: Thank you.</p><p>HAYES: Still ahead, a genuinely exciting development on the road to sustainable clean energy. What is fusion? And how can it help us? Next.</p><p>[20:50:00]</p><p>HAYES: The Holy Grail for a transition to a green energy carbon free future, a transition must happen if our planet is to survive in a sort of habitable state is some kind of source of energy that would produce zero carbon emissions. But crucially also work independently of external factors that are hard to regulate, like the sun or the wind, and be safe and run 24 hours a day, so it could replace like the base load of things like natural gas, and also create no dangerous waste. So, that`s a lot of stuff that you want, and it`s basically not existed.</p><p>We`ve got all sorts of alternatives, each with their own drawbacks. For decades, the U.S. government has funded research to develop precisely this kind of what would be miraculous energy source.</p><p>Well, tomorrow, the Department of Energy is set to announce, they have successfully generated net energy from a nuclear fusion reaction. That`s the source. That`s the thing that they`ve been researching for so long, nuclear fusion, which could be a kind of holy grail solution, meaning it could be the most significant scientific breakthrough in a generation.</p><p>For a look at what we can expect from tomorrow`s announcement, I want to bring in Evan Halper, he`s a business reporter for The Washington Post who specifically covers the green energy transition.</p><p>Evan, let`s just start with this. Nuclear power that we have that functions uses a process called fission. That`s the power that we have now. This is a different way of using nuclear power. How does it differ? Why has it been difficult to try to get working.</p><p>EVAN HALPER, THE WASHINGTON POST REPORTER: Yes, that`s exactly right. So, right now we use fission for nuclear power and the traditional nuclear power plants. The big difference here is that you can create this nuclear reaction if they can ever get this working. And you don`t have any of the nuclear waste. None of this kind of - you do have some radioactive fallout, just like you would for hospital equipment, say, but you don`t have this spent fuel and all this waste you`ve got to get rid of.</p><p>[20:55:00]</p><p>So, fusion works very differently than fission and fusion, what`s happening is two atoms need to come together at a very high velocity, velocity and high temperature and sort of they smashed together form this reaction, it`s the same reaction that creates the energy of a star, it creates the energy of a sun. And doing this just requires getting temperatures up to this - the temperature of the core of the sun, and at incredible speeds, and it just takes a lot of equipment and a lot of costs. And they`ve been trying to do it for decades to finally get the result that they`re going to announce tomorrow.</p><p>HAYES: Yes. So, the key sentence there that I`ve always helped me to think about this is, it`s the process happening in the sun, right. So, like the ore energy of the earth, that we`ve been relying on forever, which all ultimately flows from the sun is, is that`s what`s happening inside the sun and stars is this fusion process.</p><p>Now, when you say you`ve been trying for years, I mean, fusion has been this kind of subject of quite a bit of controversy. I mean, a whole bunch of naysayers have said, this is ludicrous boondoggle to pursue, it can`t work. It`s not going to work. And yet the U.S. government has been spending money on it for a very long time. Talk a little bit about the - just the controversy that`s even surrounded the funding and line of research for this for all these decades.</p><p>HALPER: Yes, you`re absolutely right and it`s not just criticism coming from the Right, or criticism coming from the Left. I mean, there are across the ideological spectrum, people have been suspicious of this, because a big reason the U.S. government started investing a lot of money in trying to replicate this fusion was had to do with nuclear weapons. This massive laser, the world`s biggest laser, that`s in a room the size of three football fields of the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, that was built in the hopes of being able to replicate this fusion, so that they can test nuclear weapons without having to do explosions.</p><p>And a lot of the funding for this program has been about nuclear weapons. It`s taken so long to be able to get this done. I mean, they were projecting that they would have had this what we call ignition or net energy gain like literally more than a decade ago, and it just hasn`t happened. And there have been cost overruns. And it`s just a lot of expensive equipment. And so there have been a lot of calls to pull the plug. But the government stayed with it, and the private sector stayed with it. And this announcement tomorrow will be a sort of affirmation from the Biden Administration that this is a project worth pursuing, this is money worth spending.</p><p>HAYES: We don`t have the result yet. And I don`t think we have a paper that circulated under peer review. So, this is, we`re just sort of going right on to this announcement, you say building devices that are large enough to create fusion power at scale, right, some commercial adaptation of it would require materials that are extraordinarily difficult to produce, the same time the reaction creates neutrons have put a tremendous amount of stress on the equipment creating it such that it can get destroyed in the process.</p><p>In other words, even if there`s a breakthrough, this is a long way from commercial viability, even as we have these incredibly, amazingly cheap forms of solar power and wind that get cheaper and cheaper every day. So, this isn`t necessarily something we`re going to see around the bend.</p><p>HALPER: We are looking at least a decade before we can see any kind of power plant that runs on this fusion. And that`s like the most optimistic estimate from folks that are in a company that are trying to build one of these power plants. Some scientists say never, some scientists say decades, but a year ago was looking like this could, just was never possibly going to happen. And so, the fact that they were able to create this net energy gain that they`re going to announce tomorrow has some of the naysayers saying well, maybe this could happen.</p><p>HAYES: So that`s the big announcement tomorrow is, after all these decades, we built something as a feat of engineering that produced energy, net energy, right, more energy than we expended on it from a successful and safe fusion reaction, is that where we`re going to hear tomorrow.</p><p>HALPER: That`s what we`re going to hear tomorrow. And it`s a big scientific breakthrough. They`ve been trying to do this for years, but you`re right, the engineering breakthrough and actually be able to build a power plant and harness this is - there`s a lot more optimism that it can be done now, but don`t be expecting to be using fusion power like in the next couple of years, maybe in 10 years.</p><p>HAYES: But it`s still like, this is real, right, like they did - they cracked something here they hadn`t before. That`s the takeaway.</p><p>HALPER: Yes, this definitely is a bit - we`ve talked to scientists, we`ve talked to physicists who`ve been involved in this for years and many of them are telling us, this is not a joke. This is a big deal. This is a major scientific breakthrough. And it`s always caveat it with at the same time, there`s all kinds of engineering that needs to be done to figure out how to take this breakthrough and turn it into electricity that all of us can use.</p><p>HAYES: Excited to watch it tomorrow. Evan Halper, thanks so much for breaking that down. Appreciate it. That is All In on this Monday night. The Rachel Maddow Show starts right now. Good evening, Rachel.</p><p>RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST: Chris, I was in the makeup chair a little bit earlier than I usually am tonight.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

They can live for billions of years, and they typically make slow transitions -- sometimes over many millions of years -- between the different stages of their lives.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So when a previously typical star's behavior rapidly changes in a few decades, astronomers take note and get to work.</p><p>Such is the case with a star known as SAO 244567, which lies at the center of Hen 3-1357, commonly known as the Stingray Nebula. The Stingray Nebula is a planetary nebula -- an expanse of material sloughed off from a star as it enters a new phase of old age and then heated by that same star into colorful displays that can last for up to a million years.</p><p>The tiny Stingray Nebula unexpectedly appeared in the 1980s and was first imaged by scientists in the 1990s using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. It is by far the youngest planetary nebula in our sky. A team of astronomers recently analyzed a more recent image of the nebula, taken in 2016 by Hubble, and found something unexpected: As they report in a paper accepted to the Astrophysical Journal, the Stingray Nebula has faded significantly and changed shape over the course of just 20 years.</p><p>If dimming continues at current rates, in 20 or 30 years the Stingray Nebula will be barely perceptible, and was likely already fading when Hubble obtained the first clear images of it in 1996, according to lead author Bruce Balick, an emeritus professor of astronomy at UW.</p><p>\"This is an unprecedented departure from typical behavior for a planetary nebula,\" said Balick. \"Over time, we would expect it to imperceptibly brighten and expand, which could easily go unnoticed in a century or more. But here we're seeing the Stingray nebula fade significantly in an incredibly compressed time frame of just 20 years. Moreover, its brightest inner structure has contracted -- not expanded -- as the nebula fades.\"</p><p>Planetary nebulae form after most stars, including stars like our own sun, swell into red giants as they exhaust hydrogen fuel. At the end of the red giant phase, the star then expels large amounts of its outer material as it gradually -- over the course of a million years -- transforms into a small, compact white dwarf. The sloughed-off material expands outward for several thousand years while the star heats the material, which eventually becomes ionized and glows.</p><p>Balick and his co-authors, Martin Guerrero at the Institute of Astrophysics of Andalusia in Spain and Gerardo Ramos-Larios at the University of Guadalajara in Mexico, compared Hubble images of the Stingray Nebula taken in 1996 and 2016. Hen 3-1357 changed shape markedly over 20 years, losing the sharp, sloping edges that gave the Stingray Nebula its name. Its colors have faded overall and once-prominent blue expanses of gas near its center are largely gone.</p><p>\"In a planetary nebula, the star is really the center of all the activity,\" said Balick. \"The material around it is directly responsive to the energy from its parent star.\"</p><p>The team analyzed light spectra from Hen 3-1357 emitted by chemical elements in the nebula. Emission levels of hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen all dropped between 1996 and 2016, particularly oxygen, which dropped by a factor of 900. The resulting fade in color and the nebula's change in shape are likely connected to the cooling of its parent star -- from a peak of about 107,500 degrees Fahrenheit in 2002 to just under 90,000 degrees Fahrenheit in 2015 -- which means it is giving off less ultraviolet ionizing radiation that heats the expelled gas and makes it glow.</p><p>\"Like a doused forest fire, the smoke wanes more slowly than the flames that created it,\" said Balick. \"Even so, we were amazed when the Hubble images revealed how quickly the nebula was fading. It took a month of work to believe it.\"</p><p>Astronomers have yet to understand why SAO 244567 made the Stingray Nebula light up and then fade almost as quickly. One theory, posited by a team led by Nicole Reindl at the University of Potsdam, is that the star underwent a brief burst of fresh helium fusion around its core, which stirred up its outer layers and caused its surface to both shrink and heat.</p><p>If so, then as its outer layers settle back down, the star may return to a more typical transition from red giant to white dwarf. Only future observations of the star and its nebula can confirm this.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, the best tool to follow future changes in the Stingray Nebula, the Hubble Space Telescope, is near the end of its life as well,\" said Balick. \"We can hope, but the odds aren't good for Hubble's survival as its three remaining gyroscopes start to fail. It's a good race to the finish.\"</p><p>The Hubble Space Telescope is an international partnership between NASA and the European Space Agency, or ESA, and managed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. The Space Telescope Science Institute is responsible for Hubble science operations. The research was also funded by the European Union and the National Council of Science and Technology in Mexico.</p><p>* * *</p><p>JOURNAL: Astrophysical Journal</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7313603 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7313603</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61FC-BM21-JC11-10KR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"861\"/><timeReceived>7:50 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"12\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>December 4, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST0008YVR</classCode><className>ASTRONOMY &amp; SPACE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009FXR</classCode><className>ASTROPHYSICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DN68</classCode><className>SPACE PROGRAMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0008X7S</classCode><className>OBSERVATORIES &amp; TELESCOPES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DNES</classCode><className>TEACHER RETIREMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST0008YZS</classCode><className>PHYSICS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DN68</classCode><className>SPACE PROGRAMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX518</classCode><className>SEATTLE, WA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GS163</classCode><className>WASHINGTON, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000A2MA</classCode><className>ANDALUSIA, SPAIN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>GC342</classCode><className>MEXICO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>GC325</classCode><className>SPAIN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Although new variants of SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus), the virus that causes COVID-19, could upend this trajectory, the country may be well positioned now to reimagine its public-health systems.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Over the past two years, as new variants of the novel coronavirus have emerged, US public-health priorities have focused on the critical missions of getting people tested, vaccinated, and boosted while maintaining access to healthcare. Inequalities that predated the pandemic were also laid bare as historically marginalized communities bore the brunt of the pandemic's ill effects.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Many public-health-system authorities are now redressing vulnerabilities and planning a stronger path forward. To help guide them on this journey, McKinsey previously set forth <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/pandemic-to-endemic-how-the-world-can-learn-to-live-with-covid-19\">four imperatives</url>\u00a0authorities can consider when framing a strategy for living with COVID-19 as the transition from pandemic to endemic gets under way: defining the next normal, tracking progress, limiting illness and death, and slowing transmission. </p><p>US state and local governments have a unique role to play in stewarding this evolution by defining and supporting how residents will live in a world with endemic COVID-19 and other health concerns. The ground on which this next normal settles may determine whether the lessons of the pandemic are heeded and could create fertile soil for public-health systems to emerge more resilient, equitable, and responsive to whatever challenges lie ahead.</p><h>Defining the next normal</h><p>In the thick of the COVID-19 pandemic, much of the public discourse focused on disease-specific metrics to understand the spread of the novel coronavirus. As endemic COVID-19 beckons, a broader set of criteria will likely become increasingly relevant.</p><p>McKinsey previously suggested that societies may need to define goals that recognize and balance differing public-health needs. That means focusing concurrently on reducing hospitalizations and death while also minimizing the impacts of economic and social disruptions stemming from pandemic-related policies, such as missed school days and workdays. The secondary impacts of COVID-19 on other public-health priorities, such as behavioral health and delays in seeking care, are also considerations. Moreover, some have suggested viewing the burden of COVID-19 in relation to other relevant diseases, by shifting from a focused lens to one encompassing the impact of all respiratory diseases collectively.</p><p>As the US federal, state, and local governments consider public health over the next five years, they will be determining what markers are important for a holistic, balanced view of US society's next normal. Four actions could help: </p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Developing a set of vital signs to track the health of society. </emphasis>As the pandemic becomes endemic, evaluating the public-health system could extend beyond the current key COVID-19-related measures, which include the excess mortality, hospitalization, case fatality, and transmission rates for the specific disease. The pandemic has focused the public's attention on a narrow set of health measures, and now may be the time to broaden this attention to a set of measures that encompasses broader societal healthcare outcomes (such as maternal and infant health, behavioral health, communicable disease, chronic disease, and environmental health). Factors that affect health (such as childhood lead exposure) could be part of the set, as could socioeconomic indicators (such as schooldays and workdays lost because of health issues, changes in employment rate, and demographic differences across various metrics). </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Engaging a diverse range of stakeholders to create the vital signs.</emphasis> Including stakeholders across different demographic and socioeconomic groups can provide varying viewpoints that are key to society's functioning and illuminate priorities for the public-health system.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Maintaining an evidence-based approach. </emphasis>An evidence-based approach to public health could provide a better understanding of how vital signs can interact with one another and affect daily life.

Throughout the process, leaders can acknowledge empathetically the difficulties faced when adapting to changing policies and could consider reemphasizing the shared goals of the next normal.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><h>Tracking progress</h><p>Once public-health goals are defined, it will be important to track progress toward them and communicate it to the US public.

Many US states have made investments to improve the quality of data and data visualization tools to democratize public-health information, enabling their constituents to understand what is happening in their own communities. Continuing to advance these solutions could enable governments to align the goals that define the next normal to a system of alerts akin to air quality level and forest fire risk level, for example. That may enable policy decisions to be adapted transparently based on public-health conditions. Separately, providing individuals with access to data on the public-health condition of their communities could allow them to determine their own risk appetites.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Reinforcing health data infrastructure and public-health surveillance systems.</emphasis> Public-health surveillance, with tracking and early intervention of any new variants, will likely prove critical in the next normal. Governments could play a pivotal role in deepening public-health infrastructure and investing in surveillance capabilities to ensure that any changes in population health can be detected early and monitored thoroughly to minimize the severity of outbreaks. Establishing robust integrated data sets from across healthcare stakeholders, public sources, and private sources-as well as the means to determine insights quickly and efficiently-will further strengthen the ability to understand or anticipate risks. Next-generation surveillance may require the use of a broader set of bioinformatics tools (such as genomic sequencing to detect variant mutations and wastewater-monitoring systems to detect community transmission).</p></bodyText></listItem></list><h>Limiting illness and death</h><p>Limiting illness and death may pivot on a combination of initiatives spanning vaccines, treatments, investment in robust healthcare delivery systems, resources for the highest risk populations, and health equity. </p><h>Vaccines </h><p>Vaccines have proven essential for curbing the spread of COVID-19, limiting COVID-19-related hospitalization and death, and alleviating pressure on hospital systems. As the novel coronavirus evolves, so too does the vaccination effort. US state and local governments could play a vital role in expanding access and uptake of COVID-19 vaccines by incentivizing hesitant adults, immunizing younger people, and providing boosters for the general population as required. This could be achieved through the following initiatives:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Integrating COVID-19 boosters into annual vaccination campaigns.</emphasis> While vaccines bolster immune defense against COVID-19, recent evidence shows that this immunity wanes over time. Accordingly, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended booster vaccinations for the general population. As variants continue to evolve and arise, periodic booster shots may provide an effective public-health tool to anticipate and control future outbreaks. In the short term, US state health departments and local health departments (LHDs) could combine campaigns related to annual vaccinations to simplify communications. Ensuring access to both COVID-19 and flu vaccines at dispensing locations could further simplify the journey. Longer-term, combination vaccines across multiple respiratory illnesses are in development and could simplify vaccination regimens and logistics. These measures to minimize friction could have meaningful impact on the pace and scale of booster uptake-more than half of respondents <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/covid-19-consumer-healthcare-insights-what-2021-may-hold\">recently surveyed by McKinsey</url>\u00a0who have been vaccinated with primary series COVID-19 shots but not booster shots said they plan to get the boosters.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Requiring evidence of receiving COVID-19 vaccines or recent negative test results when important to protect the public.</emphasis> Vaccine requirements have been shown to rapidly increase immunization and could be applied to a narrower group engaged in high-risk settings or to a broader population when appropriate for public-health reasons. For instance, New York City previously instituted a COVID-19 vaccine requirement for its 160,000 municipal workers and 150,000 staff in public schools. Vaccination numbers increased significantly among these populations. The vaccination rate (of at least one dose) among healthcare workers and full-time New York City school staff increased to 92\u00a0percent and more than 95\u00a0percent, respectively.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><h>Treatments </h><p>The past two years of the COVID-19 pandemic have led to key breakthroughs beyond vaccines, including new antiviral medications and other COVID-19 treatments. As the situation in the United States shifts from pandemic to endemic, it may be essential for those who become infected with the novel coronavirus to have adequate access to such therapies. </p><p>A strategy to consider is building capacity for end-to-end testing to treatment. In March 2022, President Biden announced a COVID-19 preparedness plan with a Test to Treat initiative, where the federal government offers free antiviral medications, such as PAXLOVID (nirmatrelvir and ritonavir) and LAGEVRIO (molnupiravir), for those who test positive for COVID-19. US state and local governments could play a vital role in the supply chain to enable access to those medications, including by ensuring adequate resource allocation, reinforcing distribution channels with local pharmacies, and communicating treatment availability to the public. </p><h>Health system robustness </h><p>Immunity remains the most powerful tool in curbing the progression of COVID-19. But vaccination will likely need to be complemented by a robust healthcare delivery system to treat those with more serious infection or higher baseline risk while managing the availability of general acute-care capacity. Significant funding from the US government has been made available to state and local governments for purposes such as building workforce and foundational capabilities. As such, they could consider the following actions: </p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Rebuilding the healthcare and public-health system workforces now.</emphasis> Both within the public-health system and within the healthcare delivery system, COVID-19 has exacted a high toll on the workforce, with nearly half of healthcare workers reporting some form of burnout (exhibit). Across the United States, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/nursing-in-2021-retaining-the-healthcare-workforce-when-we-need-it-most\">healthcare workers have opted out of the workforce</url>\u00a0and continue to state that they will keep doing so at alarming numbers. This suggests that now could be an ideal time for states to reassess holistically the current talent pool, projected needs, and estimated pipeline of healthcare workers capable of treating patients for all diseases, of which COVID-19 is one acute stressor. The public-sector workforce may face a similar challenge. By some estimates, US state and local governmental departments will need to grow their workforces by nearly 80\u00a0percent to provide a minimum set of healthcare services to Americans. This challenge is particularly amplified in foundational and cross-cutting capabilities in public health, such as communications and emergency preparedness, given that much of the funding for the public-health system has been program or disease area specific. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/building-the-us-public-health-workforce-of-the-future\">Rebuilding the US healthcare and public-health-system workforces</url>\u00a0quickly through investments in training, clinical-process redesign, workforce allocation, and automation could be a critical priority for every state to ensure a robust workforce for decades to come. </p></bodyText></listItem></list><h>Exhibit</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/public and social sector/our insights/pandemic to endemic where do us public health systems go from here/png-pandemicendemicushealth-ex.png\"> Link to Image </url></p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>modeling potential supply and demand of beds to identify areas at greatest risk</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>establishing longer-term contracts with temporary staffing agencies to channel additional staff to targeted areas of need</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>exploring potential policy or regulatory levers to enable flexibility in staffing levels, increase top-of-license practice, or upskill workers to meet needed roles</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>building supply chain robustness to enable rapid procurement of pandemic resources, including personal protective equipment and testing capacity</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>activating strategic healthcare capacity (for example, in partnership with the National Guard) as needed</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>providing access to mental-health and wellness resources for workers to support retention and well-being</p></bodyText></listItem></list><h>High-risk populations</h><p>As vaccines provide robust COVID-19 protection for most of the US population, jurisdictions may wish to focus resources on high-risk groups. As has been the case throughout the pandemic, this would include the elderly (people aged 65 and older), the immunocompromised, those who suffer from behavioral-health conditions, and those who have other high-risk underlying conditions. The risk factors for COVID-19 have been shown to be even greater for individuals who live in congregate settings. In that regard, placing special emphasis on locations such as long-term-care facilities, homeless shelters, group homes, and correctional facilities through all interventions (vaccination, testing, and treatment) could further curb severe illness and death.</p><h>Health equity</h><p>The pandemic has undoubtedly had a disproportionate impact on marginalized communities in the United States, where Black people are nearly 2.5 times more likely than their White counterparts to be hospitalized for COVID-19 and 1.7 times more likely to die from the disease, according to the CDC. The COVID-19 hospitalization rate is 2.2 times greater for Latinos than their White counterparts, and the death rate is 1.8 times greater. </p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>With healthcare workers opting out of the workforce at alarming numbers, now could be an ideal time for states to reassess holistically the current talent pool, projected needs, and estimated pipeline of healthcare workers capable of treating patients for all diseases.</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p>While the pandemic has shone a long overdue spotlight on racial health inequities in the United States, one prepandemic analysis estimated that deaths stemming from persistent health disparities have resulted in a loss of 3.5 million life years, heaped $93 billion in excess healthcare costs on the economy, and cost $42 billion in untapped productivity. Health departments could play a pivotal role in ensuring that funding and resources are appropriately focused on interventions that close these health equity gaps. To advance health equity, US state and local governments may need to tailor their capabilities to serve marginalized communities. </p><p>First, they could use analytic methods and tools to collect and report data on tests, hospitalization, and vaccination rates in various demographics. Having such information can help identify inequities in healthcare outcomes. According to the CDC, more than 25 percent of COVID-19 vaccinations are missing race or ethnicity data. Gaps in such knowledge can have an adverse impact on the ability to target interventions that can help address health equity challenges.</p><p>Second, governments could engage in community-centered, multilingual messaging campaigns to support historically marginalized populations. Given that vulnerable populations often foundationally face lower health literacy, tailored approaches may prove crucial. As an example, North Carolina has created a program to \"enhance messaging to the public and specific groups to promote vaccination and prevention efforts,\" including a focus on reaching \"AmericanIndian, disability, and Spanish-speaking communities.\" New York City, with its diverse population, provides priority information in 14 different languages. Such tools of cultural competency and congruency could help bridge gaps of mistrust and overcome hesitancy toward disease treatment and prevention. </p><p>Finally, governments could develop initiatives dedicated to increasing healthcare access for those who need it most. For many marginalized communities, access-not hesitancy-limits equitable healthcare delivery. Using insights from equitable data analyses and community engagement, state health departments and LHDs could strategically deploy resources to such populations. For instance, a US county is developing a series of initiatives targeted at reducing healthcare inequities in underserved communities. The programs include developing the healthcare workforce, promoting healthy behaviors in younger populations, and engaging with community healthcare workers. The effort could potentially reduce the likelihood of emergency department admissions by an estimated 50 to 75 percent for underserved individuals, reducing healthcare costs by $75 million to $200 million (primarily through Medicaid savings), in its first two decades. Facilitating partnerships across healthcare providers, community organizations, retail sites, and philanthropists could also provide more routine and reliable healthcare access, improve overall healthcare outcomes, and create a network to utilize when health crisis situations arise.</p><h>Slowing transmission</h><p>To slow disease transmission and endemic disease, US state and local governments could be guided by three fundamental principles for enabling a robust public life: maximize ability to detect disease outbreaks, minimize the time needed to coordinate and mobilize resources to address them, and promote nonpharmaceutical interventions as needed. Investing in the following could help:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Always-on public-health surveillance that uses a broad range of data sources. </emphasis>Health departments may want to ensure that public-health surveillance systems are designed to be always on by continuously monitoring for outbreaks through a broad set of tools (such as wastewater surveillance and sampled testing). Investments could prioritize more passive surveillance approaches that minimize impacts on individuals. Spikes in disease incidence could then trigger rapid responses.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Agile rapid-response teams. </emphasis>Always-on public-health surveillance systems could be coupled with rapid-response teams that could be quickly scaled up to perform essential outbreak control operations. Such operations could include testing, therapeutic interventions, securing hospital resources (for example, by pooling staffing resources during surges), and developing safe interaction policies. Governments could work with community stakeholders (such as schools, employers, and faith-based organizations) to develop scenario playbooks that would cater to different outbreak severities and local situational factors.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Coordination among state health departments and LHDs.</emphasis> In steady state and especially in preparation for emergencies, seamless coordination and a clear definition of roles and responsibilities among centralized US state actors and LHDs could prove crucial for mounting an effective outbreak response. State governments could begin by gathering information from LHDs through focus groups or listening tours. They could then form coordination teams that liaise operationally among state agencies and LHDs under a shared understanding of goals and each stakeholder's role in achieving them. For instance, the California Department of Public Health has set up a local coordination team that consolidates a menu of resources, including technical assistance, information, translation services, and vendor contracts, available to LHDs. The coordination teams could also facilitate local-to-local or cross-jurisdictional resource sharing to minimize siloing of LHDs.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Promoting nonpharmaceutical interventions that reduce local transmission. </emphasis>As more data about COVID-19 transmission and epidemiology emerge, governments could enable communities to have a vibrant public life while offering protection through nonpharmaceutical interventions that reduce disease spread. That could include maintaining policies that allow safe social interaction when case rates increase or new variants emerge (for example, through outdoor dining, physical distancing, and mask use in crowded areas). Investing in infrastructure that reduces disease transmission (such as air quality infrastructure in schools and workplaces) is another consideration.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>We may not know what exactly the transition to endemic COVID-19 in the United States will look like, but society will eventually reach the next normal, and state and local governments will play essential roles in determining its shape and contours. The design, prioritization, and sequencing of how each health department shapes its future could be very different, depending on its operating model, governance structures, community needs, and other strategic considerations. Planning now for this future state could ensure that the United States moves toward it intentionally-and could help create a society that's safer, healthier, and reunited with confidence.</p><h>About the authors</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/link.aspx?_id=E860BCC9E0C2444699B27519A67B6F16&amp;_z=z\">Pooja Kumar</url></emphasis> is a senior partner in McKinsey's Philadelphia office, where <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bill Yau</emphasis> is an associate partner;

Every weekend.  </p><p>But while comparisons to that historic fire are inevitable as wildfires burn out of control in California, Oregon and Washington, what's less clear is whether those blazes will bring about the same lasting change in the way the nation fights wildfires. That would require focusing far more resources on prescribed burns, as well as controls on development and a concerted national and global effort to make forests more resilient to climate change.\u00a0</p><p>\"If California moves, the rest of the American wildland fire establishment will move with it,\" said Stephen Pyne, America's preeminent fire historian. \"Will it happen now?\u00a0 The fires are big, but so is the pandemic, and the election, and the economic crisis. Will the fires lead to change? It depends on who controls the narrative\" and whether the fires have been \"hijacked for other agendas.\"</p><h>'The Boss is Dead'</h><p>The Big Blowup took place in August 1910: Hundreds of wildfires exploded over an area the size of Connecticut in the Bitterroot Mountains of Idaho and Montana. Roiling waves of flames hundreds of feet tall trapped Big Ed Pulaski, a ranger with the fledgling U.S. Forest Service, and the 43 men he was leading in the fight against the inferno. With minutes to save his crew from incineration, Pulaski led the men into a mine shaft in the woods.</p><p>He ordered them to lay on the floor of the tunnel and hung wet blankets at the entrance to keep out the flames. When smoke filled the shaft, some of the men panicked and tried to run back out. Pusaski pulled his pistol and held his crew at gunpoint until they all fell unconscious in the smoke. When they came to, one of the firefighters saw Pulaski lying at the mouth of the shaft and announced \"the boss is dead.\"</p><p>\"Like hell he is,\" was Pulaski's famous response.</p><p>All but five members of Pulaski's crew survived, but a third of the nearby town of Wallace, Idaho, where he and much of his crew lived, burned to the ground.</p><p>After the fire, Pulaski's injuries prevented him from working the woods as he once had, but that didn't prevent him from making another lasting contribution to the nation's firefighting efforts. Recognizing that there were no specialized tools to fight wildfires, he welded an axe to a hoe. The \"Pulaski\" remains the cornerstone tool on any fireline in the United States, including those currently burning on the West Coast.\u00a0</p><p>But with the current wildfires, other aspects of the Big Blowup's legacy loom even larger.\u00a0</p><h>The '10 a.m. Policy' for Fighting Wildfire</h><p>More than any other blazes in the nation's history, the fires of 1910 determined the future of wildland firefighting and forest management in the United States, to some degree because it was the first such disaster to dominate national news.\u00a0</p><p>The smoke from the more than 1,700 fires darkened the skies as far away as New England and peppered glaciers of Greenland with soot. The blazes burned more than three million acres of land, killed at least 85 people and destroyed entire towns.</p><p>It isn't surprising that the conflagration would lead the nation to see the fight against wildfires as a battle between good and evil-part of what American philosopher William James called \"the moral equivalent of war\" when he suggested that the nation's youth be conscripted into an \"army enlisted against nature.\" What is surprising is how the changes brought about by the Big Blowup can still be seen in the nation's forests and policy, even today.</p><p>The U.S. Forest Service, just five years old when the Big Blowup ignited, was widely reviled throughout the West for its efforts to impose order on what had been a free-for-all of logging, mining, hunting and development in the nation's forest reserves. Opponents of the service in Congress left it underfunded and understaffed.</p><p>The vast fires of 1910, and the heroic forest rangers who fought them, provided an opportunity to reform the service's reputation. Three consecutive chiefs of the Forest Service had served on the front lines of the fight against the 1910 conflagrations, and they pursued an increasingly aggressive effort to eradicate wildfire in the nation's woodlands, culminating in the \"10 a.m. policy\" of 1935, which decreed that every wildfire should be put out by the morning after it was sighted. Even Smokey Bear and his message of fire prevention is rooted in the aftermath of the Big Blowup.</p><p>But the zero tolerance approach toward wildfire that dominated U.S. forest policy throughout the 20th century had unintended and devastating consequences in many western forests. In some that historically burned with low severity ground fires as often as every two years, the lack of fire allowed trees and vegetation that would normally have burned off to flourish.\u00a0</p><p>A century after the Big Blowup, some western forests had more than 20 times as many trees as they did before the nation's attempt to eradicate fire from its forests. The lack of flames in previously fire-prone forests encouraged housing and other development to encroach ever deeper into the thickening forests, just as the warming and drying climate left those heavy loads increasingly primed to burn. Yet efforts to thin overgrown forests with prescribed burns-fires intentionally set to reduce the fuel load-have repeatedly been stymied by lack of funding and public resistance, even after disastrous wildfires have emphasized the need to \"reintroduce\" fire to the West's woodlands to return them to health. Last month, California agencies signed an agreement with the U.S. Forest Service to jointly thin a million acres a year of the state's forests by 2025. But far less ambitious forest thinning projects have failed in the past.</p><h>Will California Lead the Nation?\u00a0</h><p>There are other parallels between the current firestorms and the Big Blowup, aside from their size, speed and vast spread. Both devastated countless isolated communities and created their own weather systems that challenged firefighters.\u00a0</p><p>In 1910, trains rescued fleeing residents from the flames of their burning towns. During the current firestorms, National Guard helicopters extracted trapped campers from the burning woods in flights the pilots said were more difficult than those they made while being shot at in combat zones.</p><p>But it remains to be seen whether the current blazes can have an impact on U.S. policy comparable to that of the fires of 1910.</p><p>\"It's not the size of the fires, it's the size of their impact on society,\" said Pyne, the fire historian, emeritus professor at Arizona State University and author of more than a dozen books about wildfire around the world, including \"Year of the Fires\" about the blazes of 1910.\u00a0</p><p>Pyne said the current fires follow a series of disastrous blazes that failed to change U.S. forest, fire and climate policy.</p><p>\"After the 2017 season, and the fire into Santa Rosa, it was assumed that a switch had flipped.\u00a0 It didn't. After the 2018 fire burned Paradise, again it was assumed that something big must result. It didn't.,\" Pyne said, referring to two devastating wildfires in California.\u00a0</p><p>Even a fire in Yarnell, Arizona, that killed 19 of the nation's most elite wildland firefighters in June 2013 and was recounted in a star-studded Hollywood movie failed to lead to substantial efforts to make communities and landscapes more resilient to wildfire and firefighters safer, or to slow climate change.</p><p>\"The Yarnell Hill fire that burned over the Granite Mountain Hotshots did not, so far as I can tell, change policy or practice,\" Pyne said.</p><p>If change is to come, Pyne said, it's likely to begin in California, which has not only endured the worst of the last several years' fires, but is second only to the federal government in the size of its firefighting operation.\u00a0</p><p>If the Golden State can prioritize preparing for the inevitable blazes by thinning forests with prescribed burns, axes and chainsaws, rather than putting all of its resources into snuffing fires, the rest of the nation would most likely follow, Pyne says.\u00a0</p><p>Truly changing the nation's approach to fighting wildfires would also require the state to hold back development from the most flammable landscapes and, more broadly, chart a course to reduce forests' vulnerability to climate change.\u00a0</p><p>In the end, Pyne believes that the nation needs another Pulaski. Not the hero or the axe he invented, but a narrative that can change the nation's relationship with wildfire and the drivers of the current conflagrations.</p><p>\"What's the story?\" he asked. \"We have great narratives of fire as disaster and the firefight as battlefield. We have nothing that galvanizes the responses currently before us. I know we'll have arrived when Hollywood makes an action movie about prescribed fire. We're not there yet.\"</p><p>And if this year's blazes, with their comparisons to the Big Blowup, fail to affect the nation's forest, fire or climate policies, it may be unlikely that we ever will get there.</p><p>\"If four years of serial conflagrations don't move the needle,\" Pyne said, \"we might want to think about bunkers.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INCLNE-node60101</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INCLNE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60TK-Y971-F19V-50KV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">462782</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1656\"/><timeReceived>12:32 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 InsideClimate News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Inside Climate News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 11, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>Forest Lands</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTkzOTc4NEQ2MTQwNDg0Q0E0NDNFRkRDRDU1QUE0OEU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Each launch will have to be approved by the FAA.</p><p>More than 15,500 people responded during the public comment period regarding the proposed spaceport, with the vast majority voicing opposition to the project.</p><p>Camden County has spent more than $10 million so far to land a spaceport. The county has signed an option agreement with the Union Carbide Corp. to purchase its portion of the industrial site, approximately 4,000 acres, with plans to purchase the adjacent Bayer CropScience property. If the county is unable to reach an agreement to buy the Bayer tract, the county plans to secure access to the site through a lease or easement.</p><p>The Bayer site has 10 sites the may be potentially contaminated, the FAA report said.</p><p>Union Carbide would retain the landfill and buffer area around the landfill. The carved out area retained by the county would require a No Further Action sign off by Georgia Department of Natural Resources and Georgia Environmental Protection Division.</p><p>The proposal is for up to 12 vertical launches a year. The launches would take place in a single 100-degree trajectory over the Intracoastal Waterway.</p><p>There are no existing buildings at the site that could be converted to support launch operations. Construction of Spaceport Camden facilities and infrastructure will result in the clearing of 122 acres, taking about 15 months to build a vertical launch facility. Construction won't begin until the the final Record of Decision, which will be released in mid to late July, has been completed and required permits and approvals have been granted.</p><p>The vertical launch facility will include a launch pad and its associated structures, storage tanks, handling areas and vehicle and payload facilities. A lightning protection system, deluge water systems and water capture tank, 250-foot water tower, and other launch-related facilities including shops, office facilities and stormwater retention ponds are also part of the launch facility.</p><p>A launch control center will be built on 2.4 acres on an upland area in the extreme western portion of the site, located about 2.3 acres from the launch pad and one mile from the Mission Preparation Area.</p><p>What type of small rockets would be launched from the site is uncertain until a launch operator signs an agreement with the county. But the representative rocket is a two-stage, liquid oxygen filled launch vehicle capable of carrying a payload of up to 300 pounds into a low Earth orbit.</p><p>Launch vehicles will be equipped with a flight termination system designed to destroy the rocket if it does not work as intended or strays off its trajectory. Activation of the system will limit the risk to the public from a malfunctioning vehicle or its debris.</p><p>When a rocket approaches Cumberland and Little Cumberland islands, it should be between 70,000 and 100,000 feet in the air and take between six and 10 seconds to cross the island. Most of the vertical ascent would take place \"almost directly over the launch pad or within the boundary of the spaceport, the report said.</p><p>Mainland-based access restrictions would include areas around access points to the launch site at the end of Harrietts Bluff Road. Residents and guests on Cumberland and Little Cumberland islands, ticketed park visitors, government personnel and other spaceport designated persons would have no restrictions for access at any time.</p><p>There will be water-based restrictions prior to launches extending along the trajectory extending 12 nautical miles off shore. Advance notice of waterway closures will be posted at public docks to inform recreational and commercial fishermen and boaters.</p><p>There will also be manned and unmanned aerial surveillance outside the restricted areas near Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay and Cumberland Island.</p><p>The county acknowledges the possibility of launch failure but determined it has not identified \"any significant adverse impacts to biological resources that would result from the proposed action.\"</p><p>A malfunction would \"not result in longterm adverse effects to the Georgia coastal barrier resources system\" or cause adverse impacts to the coastal environment \"that cannot be satisfactorily mitigated,\" the report said.</p><p>Kyler questioned the determination that a malfunction would not have lasting impacts in the region.</p><p>\"How do you mitigate a forest fire on Cumberland Island satisfactorily?\" he asked. \"Stuff happens. We don't have to allow stuff to happen.\"</p><p>Longtime critic of the proposed spaceport, Steve Weinkle, called the decision an \"abomination.\"</p><p>\"The FAA should be ashamed,\" he said. \"We can confirm that the FAA has allowed the Camden County commissioners, lobbyists, and millionaire consultants to perform a Spaceport Camden bait and switch on taxpayers. Without getting into the misleading, contradictory, and intentionally omitted facts of today's Final Environmental Impact Statement, the proof we're being scammed is self-evident. The FAA is poised to approve a Spaceport license for a fictional tiny rocket but the plans remain for the mega-rocket spaceport.\"</p><p>He questioned how the launches would affect tourism, and commercial and recreational fishing.</p><p>\"Why are all the spaceport checkpoints required on our rivers and Cumberland Island National Seashore if it's safe for people to walk freely on Cumberland's trails and camp in their tents?\" he asked. \"Why will our waters be closed if it is safe outside the area marked in red? Why will the U.S. Coast Guard stop boaters but island residents can barbecue under the rocket hazard zone?\"</p><p>He also questioned why the draft EIS didn't include any of the Bayer property.</p><p>\"It is the site of the manufacturing of Temik pesticide until 2012 and has not been studied, and the FEIS admits that it may not be able to purchase the Bayer property,\" he said. \"Open Records Act responses from Georgia EPD state that neither Camden nor Union Carbide have explored modification of the EPD Environmental Covenant that will be required to construct Spaceport Camden facilities.\"</p><p>Copies of the EIS statement can be read at the following local libraries during regular hours:</p><p>\u2014Camden County Public Library at 1410 Georgia Highway 40, Kingsland, GA 31548</p><p>\u2014St. Marys Public Library at 100 Herb Bauer Drive, St. Marys, GA 31558,</p><p>\u2014Brunswick-Glynn County Library at 208 Gloucester Street, Brunswick, GA 31520,</p><p>\u2014St. Simons Island Public Library at 530A Beachview Drive, St. Simons Island, GA 31522.</p><p>The EIS report can be read online at faa.gov/space/environmental/nepa_docs/#SCEIS.</p><p>___ (c)2021 The Brunswick News (Brunswick, Ga.)

One person watching online, who asked to remain anonymous, told Climate Home News: 'The presenter could not [do] anything since the audio was somehow muted by the hacker. Later, [it] was quite shocking when the screen showed a porn scene. It took about five minutes then the presenter left the meeting.' </p><p><br/> In the chat column of the Zoom webcast, random names appeared writing nonsense and abuse of Indonesians, the viewer said. After about ten minutes, the organisers regained control and the seminar continued. <br/> At issue was whether palm oil, which is used in a wide variety of consumer goods, should be considered a forestry product - a question with high stakes for the multi billion dollar industry and the climate. Indonesia is the world's largest producer of palm oil; expansion threatens natural forest rich in carbon and wildlife. <br/> As the hackers did not say who they were or what they wanted, both sides of the debate sought to blame the incident on their opponents. Palm oil's defenders paint themselves as victims of a media offensive, while environmentalists see the hacking as consistent with a pattern of intimidation by the industry. <br/> [embedded content] <br/> The seminar's official organiser, Yanto Santosa, is a long-time defender[1] of palm oil from the forest department of Bogor Agricultural University (IPB), where the seminar was held. He told the Palm Oil Indonesia website[2] that he suspected the hackers disagreed with the seminar's proposal. <br/> His suspicions were echoed by Gulat Manarung, who chairs the Indonesian Palm Oil Farmers Association (Apkasindo) and has served a prison sentence[3] for bribing an official to reclassify land he had planted with oil palm. He attended the seminar and said the hacking was part of a 'social media war' against palm oil stoked by journalists. <br/> Boy Even Sembiring, an environmental lawyer and director of the WALHI Riau campaign group, disagreed. He told Climate Home News that the hackers were likely to be 'someone who disagree[d with] the academic information presented by the dean'. <br/> Europe conflicted over push to fast-track mining code for the ocean floor[4] <br/> While the seminar's proposal was that palm oil plantations should be considered as forest, the presenter who was interrupted was arguing the case against. Sigit Sunarta is the dean of the forestry department at Gadjah Mada university and is well known as a critic of the palm oil industry. <br/> In a blog post[5] after the event, he said he was about to argue that palm oil expansion had led to deforestation, reduced biodiversity, increased the frequency of floods, droughts and fires and hurt local communities. <br/> 'In the midst of various natural disasters (especially floods) that have occurred in various parts of Indonesia, most of which are considered to be due to the conversion of forests into oil palm plantations, this proposal is considered unethical,' he wrote. <br/> A Greenpeace forest fire prevention team walks through a burned-out area owned by a palm oil company (Photo: Jurnyasyanto Sukarno/Greenpeace[6]) <br/> The replacement of forests with palm oil plantations cuts the habitats[7] of animals like orangutans, tigers, rhinos and small elephants. This often forces them into contact with humans. A tiger killed a 16-year old boy[8] on a palm oil plantation in August. <br/> Fire is often used[9] to clear forest for palm oil and the fires can spread out of control. Palm oil is a thirsty crop and can worsen drought, while deforestation makes flooding[10] more common. <br/> Like all plants, oil palm absorbs carbon as it grows. But it absorbs less[11], in the long term, than the natural tropical forest or peatland it replaces. <br/> Kiki Taufik, the leader of Greenpeace's Indonesian forest campaign, said the palm oil industry has a history of using dirty tricks against critics, particularly against rural activists, journalists and indigenous people. <br/> Sumatran tigers are under threat from palm oil expansion (Photo: Paul Hilton/Greenpeace[12]) <br/> In November 2019, two Indonesian journalists who had opposed palm oil expansion were stabbed to death[13]. A police officer investigating the murder said[14] he suspected 'the motive is revenge over oil palm plantations'. <br/> In April 2021, a palm oil firm accused[15] a security guard of stealing palm oil fruit and police arrested him. The man was a member of an indigenous group who had opposed the company and his lawyers said there were irregularities in his arrest. <br/> The week before the hacked seminar, a local official was arrested[16] on suspicion of taking bribes from the palm oil industry. Andi Putra was accused of taking a $141,000 bribe to extend a palm oil permit. <br/> On a national level, palm oil producers are represented by Apkasindo and the Indonesian PalmOil Producers Association (Gapki). With the Indonesian government under pressure[17] to halt and reverse deforestation, much of which is caused by forests being razed and replaced with palm oil plantations, they have been pushing for oil palm to be reclassified as a forestry product. <br/>Indonesia and Malaysia's palm oil concessions (top, pink) are in the same areas as much of their commodity-driven deforestation (bottom, red) (Pic: Global Forest Watch/Screenshot[18]) <br/> Aida Greenbury, an Indonesian sustainability expert, said: 'Creating vague definitions for 'forest' is a common tactic by policy makers and corporations. In this case, it could be used to change the perception of deforestation being associated with palm oil.' <br/> She added: 'Categorising oil palm plantations as 'forest' could be used to lower the country's official deforestation rate, as well as make them eligible for carbon offsets It would probably even legalise oil palm plantation development in protected forest areas.' <br/> Campaigners fear they may be successful. '[The industry association] Gapki have a lot of money,' said Greenpeace's Taufik. 'They can influence the government <br/> 'That's why it's important for us as civil society to fight this because otherwise, five years from now, then it's become part of the forest and that would be a disaster for us,' he added. <br/> Campaigners seek to curb UK oil production through the high court[19] <br/> At last month's Cop26 climate summit, Indonesia was one of 141 countries to agree[20] to collectively 'halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030'. <br/> But on her return from Glasgow, environment minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar wrote on Facebook[21] that this commitment should not be interpreted as a pledge to end deforestation. <br/> 'Massive development under way under President Jokowi's era must not stop in name of carbon emissions or in the name of deforestation,' she said. <br/> Siti did not respond to a request for comment on the proposal to reclassify palm oil. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://tsegroup.co.id/indonesian-palm-oil-community-maksi-supports-the-research-results-of-ipb-stated-that-palm-oil-is-not-the-cause-of-deforestation\">https://tsegroup.co.id/indonesian-palm-oil-community-maksi-supports-the-research-results-of-ipb-stated-that-palm-oil-is-not-the-cause-of-deforestation</url>/ [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://sawitindonesia.com/webinar-ipb-bahas-sawit-dalam-kawasan-hutan-diserang-hacker-anti-sawit\">https://sawitindonesia.com/webinar-ipb-bahas-sawit-dalam-kawasan-hutan-diserang-hacker-anti-sawit</url>/ [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://nasional.kompas.com/read/2015/02/23/18341331/Suap.Gubernur.Riau.Rp.2.Miliar.Gulat.Manurung.Divonis.Tiga.Tahun.Penjara\">https://nasional.kompas.com/read/2015/02/23/18341331/Suap.Gubernur.Riau.Rp.2.Miliar.Gulat.Manurung.Divonis.Tiga.Tahun.Penjara</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://climatechangenews.com/2021/12/09/europe-conflicted-push-fast-track-mining-code-ocean-floor/\">https://climatechangenews.com/2021/12/09/europe-conflicted-push-fast-track-mining-code-ocean-floor/</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://fkt.ugm.ac.id/id/2021/11/29/perlukah-sawit-dimasukkan-sebagai-tanaman-hutan-untuk-solusi-keterlanjuran-kebun-sawit-di-dalam-kawasan-hutan/\">https://fkt.ugm.ac.id/id/2021/11/29/perlukah-sawit-dimasukkan-sebagai-tanaman-hutan-untuk-solusi-keterlanjuran-kebun-sawit-di-dalam-kawasan-hutan/</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.climatechangenews.com/2021/12/10/hackers-throw-indonesian-palm-oil-seminar-chaos-fuelling-heated-debate/\">https://www.climatechangenews.com/2021/12/10/hackers-throw-indonesian-palm-oil-seminar-chaos-fuelling-heated-debate/</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-briefs/palm-oil-and-biodiversity\">https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-briefs/palm-oil-and-biodiversity</url> [ 8]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://peoplenewschronicle.com/sumatran-tiger-kills-youth-in-indonesia\">https://peoplenewschronicle.com/sumatran-tiger-kills-youth-in-indonesia</url>/ [ 9]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://qz.com/1711172/the-global-demand-for-palm-oil-is-driving-the-fires-in-indonesia/\">https://qz.com/1711172/the-global-demand-for-palm-oil-is-driving-the-fires-in-indonesia/</url> [ 10]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2020/07/scientists-measure-amazon-drought-and-deforestation-feedback-loop-study/#:~:text=It's%20a%20phenomenon%20scientists%20call,rain%20in%20the%20Amazon%20biome\">https://news.mongabay.com/2020/07/scientists-measure-amazon-drought-and-deforestation-feedback-loop-study/#:~:text=It's%20a%20phenomenon%20scientists%20call,rain%20in%20the%20Amazon%20biome</url>.

Most of these houses have been deserted since February after artillery fire prompted fearful residents to abandon their homes and seek refuge in Paletwa town and as far away as Yangon.</p><p>The sources, however, were reluctant to assign blame for the village torching to Myanmar or Arakan soldiers, who seek greater autonomy for ethnic Rakhine people in Rakhine state, which abuts Paletwa township.</p><p>One local villager who requested anonymity of out of fear for his safety said some area residents tried to extinguish the flames, but they fled when unknown assailants fired guns at them.</p><p>\"It must have been caused by arson [because] no one lives in the village,\" the man told RFA, adding that his home was among those burned down.</p><p>\"Yesterday, some people went there and had to flee when assailants fired guns at them,\" he said. \"Now, no one dares to go to the site.\"</p><p>Chin state lawmaker Salai Myo Htike said the cause of the fire in the village is unknown.</p><p>\"It's hard to say how many out of about 100 houses were burned down, but I can confirm the fire\" he said. \"We cannot tell if it was caused by armed groups or a forest fire.\"</p><p>Chin state government spokesman Soe Htet was not available for comment.</p><p>Nearly 700 people lived in Meelatwa village, located on the east bank of Kaladan River across from Paletwa town.</p><p>Salai Tay Ya, director of the Chin Human Rights Organization, said that burning the abandoned village was violation of human rights.</p><p>\"This is a very horrible human rights violation, no matter who the arsonists are,\" he told RFA. \"The villagers have plans to resettle in their former homes.

Forest fire fighters preparing to take to the skies to battle the thousands of fires raging across the Parana Delta marshes Photo: AFP / Marcelo MANERA  Environment Minister Juan Cabandie accuses livestock producers of using fire to clear dry pastureland and regenerate it for their livestock.Cabandie has filed a criminal complaint against producers and land tenants.But those producers deny the accusations and claim the fires undermine their activities, in turn blaming authorities for \"lack of control and neglect.\" An aerial view of livestock on the parched marshland of the Parana Delta Photo: AFP / Marcelo MANERA Jorge Postma, from Rosario University, says this year's exceptional conditions have caused the catastrophe.The Parana River -- whose name means little sea in the local Guarani language -- is much lower than normal.\"Right now the level of the Parana River in the Rosario port hydrometer is 80 centimeters. Normally in this area at this time of year it's three or four meters,\" said Postma. Authorities and livestock producers blame each other for the thousands of forest fires ravaging the Parana Delta, one of the most biodiverse in the world Photo: ARGENTINE FEDERAL POLICE / Gustavo SAITA Javier Torres belongs to a family in the city of Entre Rios that has produced honey for decades.This year, 270 bee hives in the Delta's island areas were devoured by fire.\"It took years to build and will take me years to rebuild. I'm heart- broken. I haven't received any help from anyone so far,\" Torres told AFP.Depending on the direction of the wind, the largest coastal cities on the western bank of the Parana, such as Rosario, San Lorenzo and Villa Constitucion, are engulfed by a dense cloud of smoke that causes breathing problems and allergies.It's made all the worse by the coronavirus pandemic.In June, Rosario University researchers found that the city's air had five times the allowed level of pollution.\"This is very serious in the context of a pandemic, with breathing issues,\" the researchers wrote.While livestock rearing is the main activity in the Delta area, it also attracts poachers, fishermen and real estate speculators.A group of universities and environmental organizations is clamoring for Congress to urgently pass a bill aimed at protecting the marshland.They say the new law would create greater regulations regarding the use of the land and protect the Delta.However, it has already failed twice to win passage in the legislature.\"It's the most important marsh system in Argentina. Here we call it our little Amazon,\" said Laura Prol, from the Ecologist Workshop, who is demanding action by authorities. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767159676837658475776100174</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HY-7F51-JCMN-Y3V1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484255</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"715\"/><timeReceived>2:46 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 7, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002EZM</classCode><className>RIO DE LA PLATA BANK</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>SIC6029 COMMERCIAL BANKS, NEC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Criminal Law &amp;

Like most domestic programs in Biden's overall $1.5 trillion budget proposal for fiscal 2022, the recommendations for increased spending on conservation and climate goals are a dramatic turnaround following four years of cutbacks during the Trump administration. The administration is requesting[2]$17.4 billion for the Interior Department, a $2.4 billion increase from what's now in effect for the current budget year, which is fiscal 2021. The proposed 16% increase is in line with the overall increase the administration is asking for all non-defense discretionary programs. Interior would also see $1.7 billion for high-priority hazardous fuels and forest fire resilience programs, a nearly $500 million boost from fiscal 2021. A news release from the Interior Department highlighted the request's proposed increases for tribal programs. </p><p>'President Biden's funding request provides much-needed resources to Tribal Nations, prioritizes racial justice and equity, and invests in healthy lands, waters, and a clean energy economy that will create good-paying jobs,' Interior Secretary Debra Haaland said in a written statement. Biden pitches big boosts in education and health spending in budget request[3]The request calls for $4 billion for tribal programs, a roughly 17% increase from fiscal 2021, to be used for tribal schools, law enforcement and clean energy development. It would increase funding for climate mitigation, resilience and environmental justice programs in Native American communities by $450 million. The funding would 'strengthen self-determination and self-governance programs to bolster Tribal sovereignty,' theInterior release[4]said. Friday's document is a preliminary budget from the administration, which is usual in a new presidency. A more detailed budget plan, which will include revenue estimates, is expected later this spring. Congress never adopts a presidential budget request in its entirety, but Biden's is more likely to succeed at least in part in a Congress controlled by Democrats.Climate goals across the governmentFriday's request reflects the administration's prioritization of climate change and its whole-of-government approach to addressing it. The administration requested a $14 billion increase for 'major new climate' spending 'across nearly every agency.' The word 'climate' appears 151 times in the 61-page document. Several federal departments would see additional funding for climate science and research. The administration asked for $4 billion 'to fund a broad portfolio of research across multiple agencies.' It would spend $1 billion to create an Advanced Research Projects Agency for Climate and in the existing Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy to fund clean energy and climate resilience research. As part of its climate agenda, the administration has pledged to protect 30 percent of U.S. land and water by 2030. The request offers few new details on that initiative. It calls for 'significant investment' for conservation efforts on public and private lands through the U.S. Forest Service and the Natural Resources Conservation Service, both agencies within the Department of Agriculture. Part of the funding 'would encourage voluntary conservation across the Nation's forests, farms, and ranches, while allowing land owners to continue to work their land,' the request says. The administration didn't provide details on how it would encourage voluntary conservation on private lands. Sarah Greenberger, the senior vice president for conservation policy at the conservation and bird advocacy group National Audubon Society, said the USDA could help farmers and ranchers adopt best practices and provide financial assistance. The proposal would provide $6.5 billion in lending for 'additional clean energy, energy storage, and transmission projects in rural communities.' In addition to climate action, several sections of the request refer to environmental justice, and programs to address the disproportionate impacts of pollution and climate change on disadvantaged communities.Abandoned wells, displaced workersParts of the request mirrors items in the administration'sinfrastructure and jobs agenda[5]it laid out last week, though at lower spending levels. The Interior section includes $550 million to cap orphaned oil and gas wells and reclaim abandoned mineral mines. That figure is more than triple the fiscal 2021 funding, but below the average yearly target for such efforts that the administration laid out in its proposed infrastructure and jobs legislation last week. The infrastructure framework calls for $16 billion over 10 years for abandoned wells and mines cleanup. Friday's request is intended to be seen as a separate but complementary document, an administration official said Friday. The request also calls for funding a new Civilian Climate Corps, another item in the infrastructure proposal. Friday's request asked for $200 million for Interior programs that promote science-driven conservation, including for the new jobs program. The infrastructure proposal asked for about $1 billion per year for the Civilian Climate Corps alone. The lower annual spending levels in the budget request likely reflect that the proposals would grow over time, not that the administration was lowering its spending goals. The request would fund a new multiagency program to help displaced workers in the oil and gas industry transition to jobs in cleaner forms of energy. Greenberger praised the request's focus on economic factors as part of its approach to climate. 'The budget is a demonstration of commitment to conservation, to climate action\u2014which obviously we care deeply about\u2014but also to people,' Greenberger said. 'For conservation to be successful, communities need to be successful.'

Doctors said patients for whom that's the case often spend several days in the hospital in the best-case scenario.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Why the next few days could be so crucial</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With COVID-19, body's immune system must make a key pivot. 3A</p><p>At a news conference Sunday morning, one of the physicians treating the president said he had begun a course of the steroid dexamethasone Saturday after a drop in his oxygen levels. The president will receive that \"for the time being,\" Dr. Sean Dooley said.</p><p>The president's physician, Navy Cmdr. Sean Conley, said that if Trump continued to look and feel well, \"our hope is that we can plan for a discharge as early as (Monday) to the White House, where he can continue his treatment course.\"</p><p>That would not be the typical plan for most COVID-19 patients who have required oxygen and have been placed on steroids, said doctors who care for patients with the illness.</p><p>\"I will say that I've never started someone with COVID-19 on steroids and then thought I'd be discharging the patient home the next day,\" said Russell Buhr, a professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine at the University of California-Los Angeles.</p><p>Oxygen is typically given to patients when the level of oxygen saturation in their blood is below 92%, he said.</p><p>\"Generally, once a patient is on oxygen, they stay in the hospital for four or five days, if everything goes well,\" said J.Randall Curtis, a professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle.</p><p>\"If a patient is off oxygen and then goes back on oxygen, that would suggest they've gotten a little bit worse. If they've started on dexamethasone, that suggests to me he's gotten a little bit worse,\" Curtis said. \"If he's requiring oxygen, then he has COVID pneumonia.\"</p><p>Though that might sound dire, it simply means there is an infection in the lung causing inflammation in the alveoli, the tiny air sacs in the lungs that transfer oxygen from the lungs to the bloodstream. COVID-19 pneumonia can range from mild to dangerously severe.</p><p>In Curtis' experience treating more than 100  COVID-19 patients in Seattle, people who require oxygen and get dexamethasone \"would generally have some abnormality on their chest X-ray. Typically, it's what we call the 'ground glass' pattern that's seen with COVID pneumonia,\" he said. The ground glass pattern refers to a hazy white area in a lung X-ray or CT scan showing infection or inflammation. Typical lung tissue shows up as gray.</p><p>A  patient with mild pneumonia and on oxygen could recover within two to five days and return home, Curtis said. But it could also go the other way.</p><p>\"The concern is that in that window of time, it's still possible that the pneumonia would continue to get worse,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, we don't have any great ways of stopping that. Dexamethasone helps a little bit. Remdesivir helps a little but only a little.\"</p><p>Dexamethasone treatment generally indicates more severe disease, they said. Recommendations for dexamethasone are that it be given to patients who require supplemental oxygen or who are on  ventilation, Buhr said. It is not typically given prophylactically as an early defense against such an inflammatory response.</p><p>\"The reason we don't is that steroids are not totally benign. They increase your risk of other infections, and they increase your risks of delirium,\" he said.</p><p>\"The Infectious Diseases Society of America's guidelines for steroids in COVID-19 patients say that they should always be given to people with critical illness,\" said George Rutherford, a professor of epidemiology at the University of California School of Medicine. \"You don't want to give steroids if they're not needed.\"</p><p>Dexamethasone is a steroid given to tamp down an overactive immune response in the body. This comes when the virus provokes an immune response that sends cells into the lungs to clean up the damage, which causes inflammation.</p><p>\"That inflammation in and of itself can make it more difficult for oxygen to pass from the lung into the bloodstream\" and tends to occur later in the course of the disease, Buhr said, and the inflammatory reaction can break down the lung tissue itself, \"like a forest fire generating its own fuel.\"</p><p>Though he didn't want to play armchair physician to the president, Buhr said, the treatments reported by the president's doctors and the rosy picture given in Sunday's news conference \"don't line up.\" <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USATDY-120204511</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USATDY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:610J-5WP1-JC8N-K2YJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8213</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"747\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Gannett Company, Inc.

We will continue to support our employees during this challenging time.\"</p><p>These temporary curtailments will reduce production by approximately 35 million board feet of stud lumber.</p><p>\"High log costs and weak lumber markets continue to impact our operating footprint in the province,\" says Connolly. \"While we strive to ensure consistency and stability for all of our operations, the upward cost pressures in the province combined with the notable decline in lumber demand make the decision necessary.\"</p><p>Pino Pucci, Vice President, Tolko Marketing and Sales, added, \"Tolko's Marketing and Sales team will continue to support our customers and do our best to minimize any impacts. Our customers are understanding of current market conditions and aware of our ongoing commitment to serve them.\"</p><p>As an additional update on Tolko facilities, operations will resume this week at White Valley and Armstrong Plywood Divisions. These locations were forced to take downtime due to a December 28 substation fire, which caused an ongoing power outage at Armstrong Plywood and Armstrong Lumber. Temporary repairs to the substation are complete, and teams are working through the process of restarting.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://tolko.com/tolkocpt_news/bc-update-jan2023/\">https://tolko.com/tolkocpt_news/bc-update-jan2023/</url></p><p>Mercer International (NASDAQ: MERC) - Harvesting Burnt Stands with Mercer Forestry Services - 20/1/2023</p><p>In the forest industry, global warming and climate change are topics of concern as they directly impact the nature of the forests we work in. Globally, in all Mercer operating areas, we've experienced unseasonably warm temperatures, extreme drought conditions, and wildfires increasing in both number and severity.</p><p>Mercer Forestry Services (MFS) has worked with the BC Wildfire Service to help fight wildfires by using logging equipment to build fire breaks and douse flames. After devastating fire seasons rush through British Columbia, some of our forests which were once lush and green are sometimes left lifeless and uninhabited. These natural disturbances can have a major effect on the environment, including the carbon balance.</p><p>The impacts of wildfire risk on British Columbia's forest stands are affecting the wood supply for many forest-based companies in the province. Depending on the severity of a wildfire, however, burnt trees within the stand are not wasted. Beneath the charcoal layer often hides quality timber which can still be used. Time is of the essence to harvest this timber, as the longer a tree sits after a forest fire, the less moisture it will contain.</p><p>Therefore, MFS aims to harvest approved stands as soon as safely possible after it's burnt so that we can salvage as much of the tree as we can. Many companies can come together after a wildfire to work on the safe harvest and reforestation of the area, bringing some positive results and economic benefits to what was once a frightening situation.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://mercerint.com/news/2023/harvesting-burnt-stands-with-mercer-forestry-services/\">https://mercerint.com/news/2023/harvesting-burnt-stands-with-mercer-forestry-services/</url></p><p>Latest Research</p><p>Reduced cellulose accessibility slows down enzyme-mediated hydrolysis of cellulose</p><p>Jie Wu, Yintian Dong, Huaiyu Zhang, Jingyun Liu, Scott Renneckar and Jack Saddler</p><p>Abstract</p><p>Enzyme-mediated hydrolysis of cellulose always starts with an initial rapid phase, which gradually slows down, sometimes resulting in incomplete cellulose hydrolysis even after prolonged incubation. Although mechanisms such as end-product inhibition are known to play a role, the predominant mechanism appears to be reduced cellulose accessibility to the enzymes. When using Simon's stain to quantify accessibility, the accessibility of mechanically disintegrated and phosphoric acid-swollen cellulose substrates decreased as hydrolysis proceeded. In contrast, the poor initial accessibility of Avicel remained low throughout hydrolysis. However, washing the residual cellulose increased cellulose accessibility, likely due to the removal of tightly bound but non-productive enzymes which blocked access to more active enzymes in solution. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis of the initial and residual cellulose collected when the hydrolysis plateaued, showed an increase in the roughness of the cellulose surface, possibly resulting in the tighter binding of less active cellulases.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960852423000731\">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960852423000731</url></p><p>The Industry</p><p>Forest products and applications</p><p>The U.S. and Western Europe have long been the major markets for Canadian forest products. In recent years, however, Canada has been transforming its export markets by building on the strength of the sector's traditional high quality wood fibre products. Today, for example, China and other Asian countries have become increasingly significant new markets for these products. This has helped offset the declines seen in traditional markets over recent years.</p><p>Natural Resources Canada, through its Expanding Market Opportunities Program, is helping the country's producers diversify and expand into emerging markets in Asia and Europe as well as into non-traditional markets in North America</p><p>Key exports</p><p>Canada's forest products exports contribute $17.1 billion in net trade. Approximately 47% of total forest product export value is from the following three key products, each of which faces a different set of challenges and opportunities in today's global markets.</p><p>Northern bleached softwood kraft pulp (NBSK)</p><p>Canada has the largest share of the global NBSK market. That share represents almost one-third of world production and three-quarters of total NBSK capacity in North America.</p><p>This is a healthy position to have within the pulp market, as NBSK is an increasingly important pulp grade for paper and tissue production. However, the value of the Canadian dollar has a major impact on performance, given the global nature of this market.</p><p>Newsprint</p><p>World production of newsprint is approximately 32 million tonnes, and Canada is the single largest producer. It has a current production capacity of about 4 million tonnes, or 12% of the world total. However, demand for newsprint in North America has fallen by 65% since 2000. This collapse is the result of major structural changes in the marketplace, with electronic media having drastically reduced the demand for print advertising.</p><p>At the same time, the rising dollar has shifted Canadian mills from being the lowest cost producers in North America to being among the highest cost producers. Demand is not expected to recover to its previous high levels, but instead will likely stabilize over time at lower levels.</p><p>Softwood lumber</p><p>Canada is one of the world's largest producers and exporters of softwood lumber. Softwood lumber accounts for 20% of the value of Canada's forest product exports.</p><p>The largest export market for Canada is the U.S., where softwood lumber is used to build houses. When the U.S. housing bubble burst in 2006, demand for softwood lumber plummeted. High housing inventories, foreclosures and unemployment will continue to depress U.S. housing starts, and softwood lumber demand may not return to the normal levels of the past until 2015.</p><p>Source: Government of Canada</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/our-natural-resources/forests-forestry/forest-industry-trade/softwood-lumber/19601\">https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/our-natural-resources/forests-forestry/forest-industry-trade/softwood-lumber/19601</url></p><p>Leading Companies</p><p>Alberta-Pacific Forest Industries Inc.</p><p>People  - Alberta-Pacific is comprised of over 400 team members who are committed to helping the company and each other achieve success.

After taking account of adjusting items, largely comprised of asset impairments in the previous quarter, the Company's adjusted operating income for the current quarter of $740.8 million was $524.5 million higher than adjusted operating income of $216.3 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily reflecting a significant increase in lumber segment earnings, and to a much lesser extent, improved pulp and paper segment results.</p><p>Commenting on the Company's first quarter results, Canfor's President and Chief Executive Officer, Don Kayne, said,</p><p>\"We are very pleased to see the sustained strength in global lumber markets continuing into 2022 and while our pulp business continued to face challenges, we also saw improved results in the quarter. A solid operating performance across all of our lumber operating regions allowed us to capitalize on these favourable market fundamentals and execute on our diversification strategy with the recent acquisition of Millar Western. Despite these factors, the global supply chain crisis continues to negatively impact our operations and has resulted in curtailed and reduced lumber and pulp operating schedules. We will continue to assess the effects of this crisis and will make adjustments to our operating schedules as conditions evolve. We greatly appreciate our employees' ongoing resilience in managing through the supply chain challenges.\"</p><p>In the lumber segment, adjusted earnings increased $509.7 million quarter-over-quarter principally reflecting an extensive uplift in Western Spruce/Pine/Fir (\"SPF\") and Southern Yellow Pine (\"SYP\") US-dollar benchmark pricing in the current period, with the average North American Random Lengths Western SPF 2x4 #2&amp;Btr price up US$563 per Mfbm, or 79%, and the average SYP East 2x6 #2 up US$564 per Mfbm, or 105%. The near record-high benchmark lumber pricing in the current quarter was combined with higher production and shipment volumes for the Company's North American lumber operations, albeit moderated in part by the ongoing global supply chain challenges, especially in Western Canada. Current quarter results also reflected strong earnings for the Company's European operations principally attributable to moderately higher European lumber unit sales realizations and, to a lesser extent, lower unit manufacturing costs, offset in part by a 5% stronger Canadian dollar (versus the Swedish Krona (\"SEK\")).</p><p>North American market conditions remained very strong through much of the first quarter of 2022, primarily led by continued strength in new home construction activity. Significant demand against a backdrop of tight supply, largely stemming from supply chain disruptions, resulted in the aforementioned increase in North American benchmark lumber prices in the current quarter. Towards the end of the current quarter, however, elevated material costs, tied to the raised benchmark lumber prices, combined with growing concerns around housing affordability and higher interest rates, dampened consumer spending in the \"do-it-yourself\" sector.</p><p>Offshore lumber demand in Asia weakened somewhat in the first quarter of 2022, particularly in China. In addition, lumber inventories in the region were higher than seasonal norms due to delays in the prior quarter on inbound shipments.</p><p>After a modest decline in the prior quarter, Western Europe and Scandinavian lumber demand strengthened throughout the first quarter of 2022 supported by increased activity in the repair and remodeling sector and relatively stable residential construction activity.</p><p>Results in the pulp and paper segment principally reflected supply-driven increases in Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft (\"NBSK\") pulp US-dollar prices that were significantly moderated by the ongoing impacts of global supply chain challenges and transportation disruptions in British Columbia (\"BC\") on Canfor Pulp Products Inc.'s (\"CPPI\") operations and shipments. As a result, CPPI's NBSK pulp and Bleached Chemi-Thermo Mechanical Pulp (\"BCTMP\") unit sales realizations were broadly in line with the previous quarter. In addition, current quarter results included the impact of capital-related downtime at CPPI's Northwood NBSK pulp mill (\"Northwood\") related to the rebuild of the lower furnace of recovery boiler number one (\"RB1\"). The lower furnace replacement was completed mid-April, with a total capital cost of approximately $30.0 million and total reduction in NBSK pulp production of 90,000 tonnes (10,000 tonnes in the fourth quarter of 2021, 70,000 tonnes in the current quarter and a further 10,000 tonnes in April 2022).</p><p>Looking ahead, global lumber market fundamentals are anticipated to remain strong through the second quarter of 2022. New home construction in North America is projected to show continued strength in the near term, supported by lean home inventory, an aging housing stock and high levels of homeowner equity. As the year progresses, however, new home construction activity is estimated to face increased headwinds due to high inflation, rising interest rates and decreasing housing affordability. Demand in the repair and remodeling sector is anticipated to soften somewhat, principally reflecting inflationary cost pressures and competing uses for discretionary spending. Offshore lumber demand in Asia is forecast to experience some downward pressure in the second quarter of 2022 before improving through the balance of the year as inventories in the region move back into balance. The outlook for European markets remains positive moving into the second quarter but is anticipated to face increasing challenges associated with rising inflation and Russia's recent invasion of the Ukraine which has disrupted regional supply networks.</p><p>Results in the second quarter will reflect reduced operating schedules across the Company's Western Canadian lumber operations as a result of the cumulative effects of the supply chain crisis that has been ongoing for several months. The Company will continue to closely monitor the supply chain situation and will adjust future lumber operating schedules, as appropriate, through the balance of the second quarter and into latter half of 2022.</p><p>In addition, the permanent reduction of 150 million board feet of production capacity at the Company's Plateau sawmill in BC is anticipated to take effect at the end of the second quarter of 2022. The resizing will align the facility with the reduction in available, sustainable timber supply in the region following the Mountain Pine Beetle infestation and other constraints on the timber harvesting land base.</p><p>For the pulp and paper segment, results in the second quarter of 2022 are anticipated to reflect in part, the near record-high US-dollar pulp list pricing seen in the first quarter of 2022. However, the intermittent and limited rail service experienced in BC in the first quarter of 2022 is projected to continue well into the second quarter, putting sustained pressure on CPPI's operations and shipments through the coming months, including, as previously announced, the extension of a transportation-related curtailment at CPPI's Taylor BCTMP mill (\"Taylor\") by at least a further six-weeks, with a projected 25,000 tonnes of reduced BCTMP production. CPPI will continue to closely monitor the ongoing supply chain challenges and will adjust future operating plans accordingly, through the balance of the second quarter and 2022.</p><p>In addition, CPPI's results in the second quarter of 2022 will reflect the impact of the RB1 capital-related outage at Northwood into mid-April (approximately 10,000 tonnes), as well as a scheduled maintenance outage at Northwood in the latter part of the second quarter, with a projected 25,000 tonnes of reduced NBSK pulp production. With the RB1 rebuild now complete, a key focus of CPPI's kraft pulp mills for the balance of 2022 will be on improving operational reliability and closely managing manufacturing and fibre costs.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.canfor.com/docs/default-source/news-2022/2022_q1_cfp_press_release_tsx.pdf?sfvrsn=8255e091_2\">https://www.canfor.com/docs/default-source/news-2022/2022_q1_cfp_press_release_tsx.pdf?sfvrsn=8255e091_2</url></p><p>Conifex (TSX: CFF)</p><p>Established in 2008, Conifex Timber Inc. is a growth oriented publicly traded Canadian company operating in British Columbia's northern interior, with a focus is on forestry, sawmilling, and power generation.</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    We manufacture structural grade SPF dimension lumber and produce clean, renewable energy from our sawmill   </p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>residuals.</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    We practice safety and sustainability in everything we do.   </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    Our strong fibre basket supports lumber production increases and our bioeconomy footprint.   </p></bodyText></listItem></list><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://conifex.com/about\">http://conifex.com/about</url>/</p><p>Conifex Announces First Quarter 2022 Results</p><p>10/5/2022</p><p>Conifex Timber Inc. (\"Conifex\", \"we\" or \"us\") (TSX: CFF) today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2022. EBITDA* from continuing operations was $20.1 million for the quarter compared to EBITDA of $9.7 million in the first quarter of 2021. Net income was $11.4 million or $0.28 per share for the year versus $4.5 million or $0.10 per share in the year-earlier quarter. The results reflect higher lumber prices, partially offset by reduced shipments reflecting ongoing transportation challenges.</p><p>Summary of First Quarter 2022 Results</p><p>Consolidated Net Earnings</p><p>During the first quarter of 2022, we generated net income from continuing operations of $11.4 million or $0.28 per share compared to a net loss of $2.5 million or $0.06 per share in the previous quarter and net income of $4.5 million or $0.10 per share in the first quarter of 2021.</p><p>Lumber Operations</p><p>North American lumber market prices rose steadily in the first quarter of 2022. Canadian dollar-denominated benchmark Western Spruce/Pine/Fir (\"WSPF\") prices, which averaged $1,631 in the first quarter of 2022, increased by 75% or $700 from the previous quarter and by 31% or $387 from the first quarter of 2021  1  . The market price increase was fueled by steady demand from repair and remodelling activities, strong new home construction activity in the US and continuing industry supply chain challenges driven by rail and truck service disruptions. US housing starts on a seasonally adjusted annual basis remained steady, averaging 1,683,000 in the first quarter of 2022, up 2% from the previous quarter and up 5% from the first quarter of 2021  2  .</p><p>Our lumber production in the first quarter of 2022 totalled approximately 47.1 million board feet, representing operating rates of approximately 78% of annualized capacity. In the previous quarter, 44.0 million board feet of lumber was produced. Lumber production in the first quarter of this year increased as COVID-19 shift reductions and severe winter weather that affected operations in the prior quarter and continued through the first half of this quarter gradually eased towards the end of the quarter.</p><p>Shipments of Conifex produced lumber totaled 42.5 million board feet in the first quarter of 2022, representing a decrease of 5% from the 44.7 million board feet shipped in the previous quarter and an increase of 12% from the 37.8 million board feet of lumber shipped in the first quarter of 2021. Shipments of Conifex produced lumber in the first quarter of 2022 was challenged by ongoing railcar and truck supply constraints. Railcar supply continued to persist at lower levels than before the November 2021 heavy rains and floods in the Province of British Columbia.</p><p>Our wholesale lumber program shipped 4.9 million board feet in the first quarter of 2022, representing a decrease of 20% from the 6.1 million board feet shipped in the fourth quarter of 2021 and an increase of 600% from the 0.7 million board feet shipped in the first quarter of 2021.</p><p>Revenues from lumber products were $61.0 million in the first quarter of 2022 representing an increase of 24% from the previous quarter and 51% from the first quarter of 2021. Compared to the previous quarter, higher mill net realizations on stronger lumber market prices offset the lower shipment volumes. The revenue increase in the current quarter over the same period in the prior year was largely the result of both higher benchmark lumber prices and increased lumber shipments.</p><p>Cost of goods sold in the first quarter of 2022 decreased by 22% from the previous quarter and increased by 41% from the first quarter of 2021. The decrease in cost of goods sold from the prior quarter is largely related to a reduction in overall costs on lower Conifex produced lumber and wholesale lumber program shipments. Unit manufacturing costs increased in comparison to the previous quarter and the first quarter of 2021 due to increased fixed costs as a result of the severe winter weather experienced in the first half of the quarter.</p><p>We expensed countervailing (\"CV\") and anti-dumping (\"AD\") duty deposits of $5.0 million in the first quarter of 2022, $2.5 million in the previous quarter and $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2021. The duty deposits were based on a combined rate of 8.99% until December 1, 2021 and 17.91% thereafter. The export taxes during the first quarter of 2022 were significantly higher than the previous quarter and the first quarter of 2021 largely due to the increased cash deposit rate in effect on lumber shipment volumes made to the US market.</p><p>Bioenergy Operations</p><p>Our Mackenzie power plant sold 53.9 gigawatt hours of electricity under our Electricity Purchase Agreement (\"EPA\") with BC Hydro and Power Authority (\"BC Hydro\") in the first quarter of 2022 representing approximately 99% of targeted operating rates. Our Mackenzie power plant sold 54.9 and 25.0 gigawatt hours of electricity in the previous quarter and first quarter of 2021, respectively.</p><p>Our EPA with BC Hydro, similar to other electricity purchase agreements, provides BC Hydro with the option to \"turn down\" electricity purchased from us during periods of low demand by issuing a \"dispatch order\". In April 2022, BC Hydro issued a dispatch order for 61 days, from May 5 to July 4, 2022. In 2021, our power plant was dispatched for 61 days, from May 1 to June 30, 2021. We continue to be paid revenues under the EPA based upon a reduced rate and on volumes that are generally reflective of contracted amounts. During any dispatch period, we continue to produce electricity to fulfill volume commitments under our Load Displacement Agreement (\"LDA\") with BC Hydro.</p><p>Electricity production contributed revenues of $8.0 million in the first quarter of 2022, unchanged from the previous quarter and an increase of 116% from the first quarter of 2021. In comparison to the comparable quarter of 2021, revenues were higher as a result of 49 days of unplanned downtime during the first quarter of 2021 arising from a disruption caused by damage to the plant's generator, which has since been replaced.</p><p>An insurance claim was submitted for physical damage to our equipment and for loss of revenues from the interruption of operations from December 2020 to February 2021. We expect to be fully reimbursed for capital expenditures related to the replacement of our generator, subject to deductible amounts, and for lost income for the period covered under our business interruption policy, being the period between the expiry of the waiting period and the recommencement of the power plant. We recognized $3.5 million as other income on our statement of net income and comprehensive income in 2021 to reflect the estimated settlement for lost income under our business interruption policy. Final settlement of the physical damage and business interruption claim is anticipated to be completed in the first half of 2022.</p><p>Selling, General and Administrative Costs</p><p>Selling, general and administrative (\"SG&amp;A\") costs were $3.3 million in the first quarter of 2022, $2.4 million in the previous quarter and $2.2 million in the first quarter of 2021. The higher SG&amp;A costs are primarily attributable to increased selling costs on wholesale lumber shipments and higher overall compensation costs, including equity-based compensation.</p><p>Finance Costs and Accretion</p><p>Finance costs and accretion totaled $1.1 million in the first quarter of 2022, $1.2 million in the previous quarter and $1.1 million in the first quarter of 2021. Finance costs and accretion relate primarily to our term loan supporting our bioenergy operations (the \"Power Term Loan\").</p><p>Gain or Loss on Derivative Financial Instruments</p><p>We enter into lumber future contracts at times to manage our commodity lumber price exposures. Gains or losses on lumber derivative instruments are recognized as they are settled or as they are marked to market for each reporting period.</p><p>There were no outstanding futures contracts in place as at March 31, 2022.</p><p>Foreign Exchange Translation Gain or Loss</p><p>The foreign exchange translation gain or loss recorded for each period on our statement of net income results from the revaluation of US dollar-denominated cash and working capital balances to reflect the change in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the value of the US dollar. US dollar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated using the period end rate.</p><p>The US dollar averaged US$0.790 for each Canadian dollar during the first quarter of 2022, a level which represented a weakening of the Canadian dollar over the previous quarter  3  .</p><p>The foreign exchange translation impacts arising from the variability in exchange rates at each measurement period on cash and working capital balances resulted in a foreign exchange translation loss of $0.2 million in the first quarter of 2022, compared to a foreign exchange translation gain of $0.1 million in the previous quarter and a loss of $0.3 million in the first quarter of 2021.</p><p>Income Tax</p><p>Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities on our balance sheet and the amounts used for income tax purposes. We recorded deferred income tax expense of $4.3 million in the first quarter of 2022 and deferred income tax recovery of $0.8 million in the previous quarter and deferred tax expense of $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2021. As at March 31, 2022, we have recognized a deferred income tax liability of $3.7 million.</p><p>Financial Position and Liquidity</p><p>Overall debt was $64.4 million at March 31, 2022 compared to $59.4 million at December 31, 2021, with the change mainly driven by the $6.5 million drawn against our secured revolving credit facility with Wells Fargo Finance Corporation Canada (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\") in the quarter to bolster operating working capital. The increase in debt was partially offset by net lease repayments of $0.3 million and Power Term Loan payments of $1.2 million. Our Power Term Loan, which is largely non-recourse to our lumber operations, represents substantially all of our outstanding long-term debt. At March 31, 2022, we had $56.0 million outstanding on our Power Term Loan, while our remaining long-term debt, consisting of leases, was $1.9 million.</p><p>At March 31, 2022, we had total liquidity of $23.3 million, compared to $16.4 million at December 31, 2021 and $16.4 million at March 31, 2021. Liquidity at March 31, 2022 was comprised of unrestricted cash of $14.8 million and unused availability of $8.5 million under the Revolving Credit Facility.</p><p>Like other Canadian lumber producers, we were required to begin depositing cash on account of softwood lumber duties imposed by the United States government in April 2017. Cumulative duties of US$23.3 million paid by us, net of sales of the right to refunds, since the inception of the current trade dispute remain held in trust by the US pending the administrative reviews and conclusion of all appeals of US decisions. We expect future cash flow will continue to be adversely impacted by the CV and AD duty deposits to the extent additional costs on US destined shipments are not mitigated by higher lumber prices.</p><p>Outlook</p><p>We expect lumber prices to remain elevated through 2022, despite recent lumber market price volatility in the past month, supported by steady demand from US housing starts as home demand continues to outpace supply despite recent mortgage rate hikes. At our Mackenzie sawmill, we expect to see an increase in lumber production over the first quarter of 2022, with the expectation of achieving annualized operating rates in excess of 90% for the remainder of the year. Our Mackenzie power plant is forecasted to operate at full capacity and continue to generate a steady and diversified source of cash flow, subject to the \"turn down\" notice received from BC Hydro for the latter half of the second quarter of 2022.</p><p>We anticipate a quarter-over-quarter increase in lumber shipments in the second quarter of 2022, as we unwind lumber inventory accumulated, as transportation challenges related to rail and truck supply shortages improve. While we are unable to estimate when full transportation service will resume, we continue to utilize alternative transportation routes and methods to facilitate shipments to our customers. While we expect more moderate mill net realizations, the anticipated increase in the volume of lumber shipments indicate that the second quarter operating results are expected to be at least comparable to the results achieved in the first quarter of 2022. Since lumber prices have firmed and held steady in recent weeks, we could realize stronger results for the second quarter than anticipated.</p><p>Our liquidity and financial position are forecasted to continue to remain strong throughout 2022. We continue to prioritize funding quick payback sawmill upgrades and exploring potential allocations of capital to enhance shareholder value as we believe that the market price of our common shares does not reflect the underlying value of our business and future prospects. We believe that our strong liquidity position will allow us to manage market volatility, if any that may arise in the remainder of 2022.</p><p>Revenue Diversification Opportunity</p><p>Over the past two years, our management and board of directors have been exploring opportunities to utilize the unique attributes of our power generation asset base to strengthen Conifex. Given the Mackenzie site's location in a relatively cool climate, the availability of affordable and renewable power from BC Hydro, our large property relative to the size of our power generation facility and our highly flexible and technical work force at the power generation facility, we concluded that our site was ideally suited to host a data center or other high-performance computing (\"HPC\") operations, such as digital asset mining. The electrical expertise of our existing power plant engineers and employee base, combined with familiarity of continuous operations are important components to providing hosting services for HPC operators.</p><p>In November 2021, we announced our intention to host 3 megawatts of digital asset mining capacity on a trial basis. In partnership with the TsayKeh Dene First Nations, we commenced hosting an initial 1.5 megawatts of capacity in December 2021 and an additional 1.5 megawatts of capacity in early March 2022. Through the trial, we have gained valuable experience operating an HPC data center. The results from the 3 megawatt trial have been encouraging and we continue to monitor and evaluate this opportunity.</p><p>As we review the results of our trial program, we are continuing to develop plans to host additional data center operation capacity at our Mackenzie site. We expect the capital outlays for this phase of HPC operations will be relatively modest as we plan to redeploy the legacy power infrastructure at our site. We have identified partners with relevant industry experience who may utilize our Mackenzie hosting services for digital asset mining. The potential exists to build out our hosting business in phases and utilize cash flow generated from the initial phases to fund the development of additional hosting capacity. There is no assurance that we will establish any data center operation in the time contemplated by our management or at all.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://conifex.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Conifex-NR.First-Quarter-2022-Results-1.pdf\">https://conifex.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Conifex-NR.First-Quarter-2022-Results-1.pdf</url></p><p>Fortress Global Enterprises Inc. (TSX: FGE)</p><p>Fortress Global Enterprises is focused on the expanding global market for innovative high value biomass-based products. The Canadian forest industry is in a period of transformation and Fortress intends to be a leader in developing new products from sustainable biomass. Fortress operates the Fortress Specialty Cellulose Mill in ThursoQuebec, which has a production capacity of 173,500 ADMT/yr of dissolving pulp utilized as a feedstock for the growing viscose/rayon industry in Asia, and operates a cogeneration plant where it produces green energy from waste products. Fortress recently announced plans to extract C5 and C6 sugars from hemicellulose to produce xylitol and other biochemicals. In January, 2018 Fortress Paper announced it had changed its name to \"Fortress Global Enterprises Inc.\" in order to better reflect its existing business and future prospects. The company's core strengths involve identifying and capitalizing on investment opportunities and divestitures. In relation to these core strengths, the company may pursue opportunities outside of the company's existing business segments that would diversify the asset base or monetize existing assets. Background Fortress Global Enterprises Inc. began its story 12 years ago in Vancouver Canada as Fortress Paper Ltd, incorporated in May 2006. Fortress purchased two paper assets from Mercer International, the Dresden mill, a wallpaper manufacturer in Germany and Landqart Mill, a supplier of security paper products based in Switzerland. Fortress completed a $46 million initial public offering and was listed on the TSX in July 2007. Fortress subsequently began a strategic and capital improvement process to transform the formerly underutilized Mills to market leaders. Dresden mill's production was shifted to a higher percentage of non-woven wall paper base where it evolved to become a world leader in the segment with ~60% market share in 2012. Landqart mill's banknote production was upgraded from 2,500 t/yr. to over 10,000t/yr. and the innovative banknote substrate Durasafe\u00ae was launched in 2012. In 2010 Fortress purchased a shuttered NBHK mill in Quebec from Fraser Papers and announced plans to enter the specialty cellulose and clean energy market with the conversion of the mill from commodity paper pulp to dissolving pulp. The conversion included the construction of a 24 MWH cogeneration plant and an agreement for green energy sales to Hydro Quebec. Fortress Specialty Cellulose mill (FSC) commenced production of dissolving pulp in 2011 followed by the completion of the cogeneration plant in 2013. With the focus now on the dissolving pulp business, Fortress divested of its wall paper business in 2013, Fortress Optical Features in 2014, followed by its security papers business in 2017. Fortress Specialty Cellulose recently completed construction and commissioning of the 5th digester project which was first announced in November 2016. The fifth digester will incrementally increase dissolving pulp production by 8,500 ADMT in 2018 and 17,000 ADMT in 2019 which will result in a material improvement of the mills cost structure. As a strategic supplement to the fifth digester project, Fortress intends to install a new accumulator at the FSC mill with the aim of extracting hemicellulose for use in the development of high value-added by-products feedstock for use in the growing biomaterials, bioproducts industry. In Feb 2018, Fortress acquired S2G BiochemicalsInc, a global leading chemical conversion company and intents to commission the construction of a demonstration plant to produce xylitol at its FSC Mill, utilizing C5 sugars extracted from hemicellulose.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fortressge.com\">https://www.fortressge.com</url>/</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fortressge.com/about\">https://www.fortressge.com/about</url>/</p><p>FORTRESS GLOBAL ENTERPRISES REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2019 RESULTS.</p><p>8/11/2019</p><p>Third Quarter 2019 Consolidated Results.</p><p>Fortress Global Enterprises Inc. (\"Fortress Global Enterprises\" or the \"Company\") (TSX:FGE) (OTCQX:FTPLF) reported 2019 third quarter operating EBITDA loss of $7.2 million compared to operating EBITDA loss of $9.5 million in the previous quarter and operating EBITDA of $7.5 million in the prior year comparative period. The Dissolving Pulp Segment incurred operating EBITDA loss of $6.4 million. Development costs incurred in the Bioproducts Segment were $0.3 million which was offset by $0.1 million of grants and funding. Corporate costs were $0.6 million in the third quarter of 2019.</p><p>Third Quarter 2019 Segment Results and Outlook.</p><p>As a result of a lower realized sales price resulting from a softened demand for dissolving pulp, an inventory write-down and significantly reduced sales volumes due to unusually low demand for dissolving pulp, operating results in the third quarter of 2019 were well below management expectations. Despite the significant headwinds in the dissolving pulp market, the Fortress Specialty Cellulose (\"FSC\") mill realized one of its better operational quarters from a dissolving pulp production and power generation perspective.</p><p>As a result of a thorough evaluation of the operating economics at the FSC mill and the prevailing market conditions, the Company determined to take market downtime on October 8, 2019. This market curtailment strategy will enable the Company to focus its efforts on executing on the previously announced strategic initiative, which includes the consideration of various strategic and financing alternatives potentially available to the Company including a recapitalization, restructuring and/or business combination transaction (the \"Strategic Initiative\"), as well as planning the optimized restart of the mill when dissolving pulp prices normalize. The Company has also proactively allocated resources to enable it to restart the FSC mill on an expedited basis in order to take advantage of any significant rebound in dissolving pulp pricing. Based on historic trends, the Company continues to believe in the future pricing recovery and prospects for dissolving pulp as the market adjusts to currently volatile conditions.</p><p>A total of 42,074 air dried metric tonnes (\"ADMT\") of dissolving pulp was produced in the third quarter of 2019 and the FSC mill sold 16,517 ADMT of dissolving pulp in the same period, compared to sales of 33,585 ADMT and 38,433 ADMT of dissolving pulp in the previous quarter and prior year comparative period, respectively.</p><p>In accordance with the Company's accounting policy, each asset or cash generating unit is evaluated at each reporting date to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment. Management's impairment evaluation resulted in the identification of an impairment loss of $31.7 million and $76.6 million at the FSC mill operations, during the three and nine months periods ended September 30, 2019.</p><p>Going Concern.</p><p>The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for certain classes of property, plant and equipment. The financial statements have also been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.</p><p>Subsequent to the quarter ended September 30, 2019, the Company determined after conducting an impairment analysis that it was not in compliance with one of its financial covenants as at September 30, 2019. Accordingly, $119.9 million was recorded in current liabilities for the period ended September 30, 2019. However, a waiver from compliance with the applicable covenant through to the period ended December 31, 2019 was subsequently obtained from the lender which reclassifies the $119.9 million as long term debt after receipt of the waiver. In addition, approvals for compliance with the terms and conditions from the lender of the $31.7 million secured loan have not been formally finalized in writing as at September 30, 2019. Accordingly, $31.7 million was recorded in current debt for the period ended September 30, 2019.</p><p>Cash flows from operations, primarily based on operating results, have historically been the Company's primary source of liquidity and capital resources. Management anticipates that, based upon current dissolving pulp market prices, the market downtime being taken by the FSC mill, and the working capital as at September 30, 2019, the forecasted cash flows will not be sufficient to meet the Company's obligations, commitments and budgeted expenditures through September 30, 2020. As a result, there is significant uncertainty whether the Company will continue as a going concern and, therefore, whether it will realize the stated value of its assets and settle its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business and at the amounts stated in the financial statements. No adjustments have been made to the financial statements relating to the recoverability and classification of the asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the consolidated entity not continue as a going concern.</p><p>These adjustments could be material.</p><p>The Company has implemented measures to mitigate against the impact of the decline in dissolving pulp prices. On September 3, 2019, the Company announced that its subsidiaries entered into had entered into a financing agreement with their secured lenders or their affiliates providing for a senior secured credit facility in the amount of up to $15.0 million (the \"Facility\"). The Facility provided the Company with supplemental liquidity to initially allow for uninterrupted operations in order to execute on its Strategic Initiative. To-date, the borrowers have drawn down an aggregate of $7.0 million under the Facility.</p><p>Management of the Company continues its active discussions with its financial partners, including its senior lenders, to secure the long-term financial viability of the Company's business. While management is continuing to execute on its Strategic Initiative, no assurance can be provided that it will be successful, or that the amounts realized for its assets will be equal to the amounts reflected in the interim consolidated financial statements. There is also no assurance that the Company will not be required, or will not determine, that it is in its best interests to file for any form of creditor protection proceeding imminently or in the near future whether or not in connection with any transaction.</p><p>The Company's ability to continue future operations and fund its planned activities is dependent on the Company's ability to seek out proposals from existing and potential new stakeholders and to execute the Strategic Initiative.</p><p>Corporate and Cash.</p><p>Corporate expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2019 were $0.6 million, compared to $0.9 million in the previous quarter. Cash and restricted cash at September 30, 2019 was $4.1 million compared to $8.8 million at June 30, 2019.</p><p>For a summary of significant developments please refer to the Management's Discussion and Analysis for the three and nine month period ended September 30, 2019 (available on SEDAR at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url>).</p><p>Selected Financial Information.</p><p>The selected financial information presented herein is qualified in its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as at and for the three and nine month period ended September 30, 2019 and the related notes thereto and Management's Discussion and Analysis, which are available on SEDAR.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fortressge.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Fortress-Global-Enterprises-Reports-Third-Quarter-2019-Results.pdf\">https://www.fortressge.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Fortress-Global-Enterprises-Reports-Third-Quarter-2019-Results.pdf</url></p><p>Howe Sound Pulp and Paper Corporation</p><p>Howe Sound Pulp and Paper is one of the finest, most efficient paper and kraft pulp producers in the world.

The improvement reflects higher selling prices in all segments ($206 million) and the net favorable impact of the indefinite idling of pulp and paper operations at the Calhoun (Tennessee) mill ($7 million). This was partially offset by lower shipments as a result of logistics constraints ($29 million), as well as higher fiber ($25 million) and freight expenses ($8 million). The company recorded lower selling, general and administrative expenses ($7 million), mainly due to lower share-based compensation expenses in the quarter. The prior quarter results were unfavorably affected by charges related to the indefinite idling of pulp and paper operations at the Calhoun mill ($171 million).</p><p>Segment Operating Income Variance</p><p>Wood Products</p><p>The wood products segment generated operating income of $219 million in the quarter, a $137 million improvement from the previous quarter. The average transaction price rose to $1,022 per thousand board feet, an increase of $410 per thousand board feet, or 67%, from the previous quarter. Production increased by nearly 50 million board feet in the quarter, including improved productivity and the new I-joist capacity, but shipments were 86 million board feet lower as a result of limited rail car and truck availability. This pushed finished goods inventory up by 97 million board feet, to 223 million board feet. The operating cost per unit (or, the \"delivered cost\") rose by $77 per thousand board feet, or 17%, mainly reflecting higher log costs due to stumpage fees and harvesting expenses. EBITDA in the segment improved by $138 million, to $230 million.</p><p>Market Pulp</p><p>The market pulp segment recorded operating income of $22 million in the first quarter, $3 million higher than in the prior quarter. The average transaction price increased by $9 per metric ton, or 1%, and the delivered cost fell by $8 per metric ton. Shipments were 28,000 metric tons lower, due to the capacity curtailment at the Calhoun mill and logistics constraints, which resulted in an increase in finished goods inventory of 23,000 metric tons. EBITDA in the segment improved by $1 million, to $26 million.</p><p>Tissue</p><p>The tissue segment incurred an operating loss of $9 million in the quarter, compared to an operating loss of $6 million in the fourth quarter. The average transaction price increased by $47 per short ton, or 2%, due to better product mix, and shipments rose by 1,000 short tons. The delivered cost increased by $141 per short ton, or 7%, mostly due to higher pulp prices, including the loss of pulp integration with the pulp capacity curtailment at the Calhoun mill. Finished goods inventory was unchanged at 6,000 short tons. EBITDA in the segment fell by $3 million, to negative $4 million.</p><p>Paper</p><p>The paper segment recorded operating income of $25 million in the quarter, an improvement of $29 million over the previous quarter. The average transaction price rose by $37 per metric ton, or 5%, due to favorable market conditions in all grades. Shipments slipped by 22,000 metric tons with the capacity curtailment at the Calhoun mill. The delivered cost decreased by $47 per metric ton, or 6%, due to lower overall operating costs following the curtailment in Calhoun, partly offset by higher freight costs. Finished goods inventory remained elevated at 85,000 metric tons, as a result of limited rail car and truck availability. Quarter-over-quarter segment EBITDA improved by $22 million, to $34 million.</p><p>Consolidated Quarterly Operating Income Variance Against Year-Ago Period</p><p>The operating income in the first quarter was $58 million higher than in the first quarter of 2021. The improvement reflects higher selling prices in all segments ($163 million) and the net favorable impact of the indefinite idling of pulp and paper operations at the Calhoun mill ($13 million), partly offset by lower shipments as a result of logistics constraints ($33 million).</p><p>The variance also reflects an increase in manufacturing costs ($85 million) due to higher fiber costs ($45 million), mainly due to stumpage and harvesting expenses, as well as higher power, chemical and maintenance expenses ($34 million). Freight costs increased by $16 million due to continued logistics constraints, higher shipping rates and fuel costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $9 million on lower share-based compensation expenses.</p><p>Corporate, Cash and Liquidity</p><p>The company generated $147 million of cash from operating activities in the quarter and built $67 million of inventory, mainly as a result of logistics constraints and the seasonal build-up of logs ahead of the spring break-up. It invested $13 million, net, in fixed assets.</p><p>In the quarter, the company expanded its presence in the growing and attractive wood products segment by acquiring the 50% equity interests it did not already own in Resolute-LP Engineered Wood Larouche Inc. and Resolute-LP Engineered Wood St-Prime Limited Partnership located in Quebec. Consideration for the transaction was $50 million in cash, net of cash acquired and working capital adjustments.</p><p>The company's liquidity at quarter-end was $1.1 billion, and the leverage ratio fell to 0.1x on a net debt to last-twelve-months adjusted EBITDA basis.</p><p>On April 6, Moody's announced a credit rating upgrade to Ba3 from B1 with a stable outlook, as a result of the company's improved financial performance and leverage.</p><p>By quarter-end, the company recorded cumulative softwood lumber duty deposits of $440 million on the balance sheet, including $43 million paid in the quarter.</p><p>Outlook</p><p>\"The underlying fundamentals for building materials remain positive, but we are mindful of inflationary pressure and rising interest rates, which could affect pricing and margins. With our network of high-quality pulp and paper assets and structural advantages, such as fiber integration and embedded power generation, we are well-positioned to grow margins in a rising price environment. We continue to work hard to adapt to challenges in the transportation network, and we expect to gradually normalize inventory levels in the second half of the year,\" added Mr. Lalonde.</p><p>Earnings Conference Call</p><p>The company will hold a conference call to discuss the financial results at 9:00 a.m. (ET) today.

These near-term constraints to North American supply were offset by continued strong demand for our products.\"</p><p>\"While we continue to monitor rising mortgage rates and the potential risk to demand for new home construction and our wood building products, fundamentals for housing and repair and remodelling activity appear favourable. I expect our team will continue to be agile and creative as we navigate our supply challenges and the evolving requirements of our customers.\"</p><p>Results Summary</p><p>First quarter sales were $3.110 billion, compared to $2.038 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. First quarter earnings were $1,090 million, or $10.25 per diluted share, compared to $334 million, or $3.13 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2021. First quarter Adjusted EBITDA1 was $1,592 million compared to $615 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.</p><p>Liquidity and Capital Allocation</p><p>Cash and short-term investments increased to $1.816 billion at March 31, 2022 from $1.568 billion at December 31, 2021.</p><p>Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $93 million.</p><p>We paid $21 million of dividends in the first quarter and announced an increase to our quarterly dividend for the dividend to be paid in the second quarter, raising it to $0.25 per share from $0.20 per share.</p><p>In the first quarter of 2022, we repurchased approximately 2.574 million shares under our Normal Course Issuer Bids (\"NCIB\") for aggregate consideration of $233 million. As of April 28, 2022, approximately 3.994 million shares have been repurchased under the current NCIB, leaving approximately 6.200 million shares available to purchase at our discretion until the expiry of the NCIB.</p><p>On April 26, 2022, we commenced a substantial issuer bid (\"SIB\") pursuant to which the Company has offered to purchase from shareholders for cancellation up to $1.25 billion of its outstanding common shares. The SIB will proceed by way of a \"modified Dutch auction\" procedure with a tender price range from $80.00 to $95.00 per share. The SIB will expire on June 2, 2022, unless extended or withdrawn.</p><p>Outlook</p><p>Markets</p><p>The most significant uses for our North America lumber, OSB and wood panel products are residential construction, repair and remodelling and industrial applications. Historically low mortgage rates, low volumes of homes available for resale and increased acceptance and practice of remote working appear to be positively influencing the demand for new home construction in North America. However, interest rates have been trending higher in early 2022 and should they continue to do so, housing affordability may be impacted, which could reduce demand for new home construction and our wood building products. An aging housing stock and repair and renovation spending is expected to continue to support lumber, plywood and OSB demand. Over the medium to long term, growing market penetration of mass timber in industrial and commercial applications is also expected to support demand growth for wood building products.</p><p>The demand for our European products is expected to remain robust as demand for OSB as an alternative to plywood in Europe continues to grow. An aging European housing stock is also expected to support repair and renovation spending, supporting growing demand for our wood building products. Recent geopolitical developments in Ukraine have caused inflationary price pressures in regional energy markets, which are expected to raise the cost of production within our European operations.</p><p>Operations</p><p>Given the extent of the transportation challenges experienced in Western Canada thus far in 2022, which have been more acute and of longer duration than anticipated, we are reducing our SPF lumber shipment expectations for 2022. We now anticipate SPF shipments to be approximately 2.8 to 3.0 billion board feet, down from our original outlook of 3.0 to 3.2 billion board feet. We reiterate expectations for our 2022 SYP shipments to be approximately 3.0 to 3.2 billion board feet.</p><p>In our NA EWP segment, while transportation and logistics constraints in western Canada and Ontario have been more challenging than previously anticipated, we still expect OSB shipments in 2022 to be approximately 6.1 to 6.4 billion square feet (3/8-inch basis). However, we now expect input costs for the NA EWP business to increase more significantly than originally anticipated, due to higher energy costs and Canadian pulp log costs that are linked to the price of OSB.</p><p>In our Europe EWP segment we reiterate expectations for OSB shipments to be approximately 1.1 to 1.3 billion square feet (3/8-inch basis) in 2022. However, input costs for the Europe EWP business are now expected to increase more significantly, due primarily to higher energy costs.</p><p>Inflationary cost pressures and availability constraints for labour, transportation, raw materials such as resin and chemicals, and energy are expected to remain elevated for the balance of 2022.</p><p>Based on our current outlook, assuming no deterioration in market conditions during the year and that there is no additional lengthening of lead times for projects underway or planned, we continue to anticipate that we will incur capital expenditures of approximately $500 to $600 million in 2022.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westfraser.com/sites/default/files/Q1%202022%20News%20Release.pdf\">https://www.westfraser.com/sites/default/files/Q1%202022%20News%20Release.pdf</url></p><p>Weyerhaeuser Company Limited.

Log costs were significantly higher, primarily for western logs. Production volumes for oriented strand board were slightly higher due to less planned maintenance, sales volumes were moderately higher, and fiber costs were significantly higher.

When I first became paralyzed, I thought resilience was a built-in mental state you either had it or didn't. I'm still not sure that there isn't a genetic factor involved, but even so, you have to use it, so to speak, or lose it. You could have the muscular potential of Arnold Schwarzenegger, but if you just sit around watching Arnold Schwarzenegger movies your whole life, no one will ever know it.</p><p>One way to build resilience is through other people's real-life stories. The strongest reference in my early days of paralysis was my own mother's life story. She was dealt a terrible hand when my father died of a freak accident at 36, leaving her to raise four children, ages nine to two, on her own. She never flinched. She had a ferocious resolve to do right by her kids, often at the expense of her own personal happiness. It was only during my own life crisis that I realized how fearlessly she had dealt with hers. Other paralysis stories also had a profound effect: Christopher Reeve, the cartoonist John Callahan, the journalist John Hockenberry.</p><p>To this day, finding pertinent first-person stories is the advice I give anyone going through something like this. Rarely will you read about or talk to another paralyzed person full of hopelessness and despair. I did read a novel recently, very well-written, where the protagonist, an architect who became a quad in adulthood, worked for three hundred pages to rebalance his life and, in the end, committed suicide. I'm sure there are millions out there in that state, but they are rarely written. Most disability stories convey some pathway to hope.</p><p>A second road to resilience is to develop some emotional scar tissue. The demographic of middle-class baby boomers, and certainly the generations after us, have not had to fight for food and shelter, not run a family farm, not going to war, in other words, have not been truly tested. We don't experience evil; we watch it on TV. Look how many English majors came out of the 1960s and '70s. Not a life fraught with adversity. I was an English major, thank you, and I had personally never been tested for resilience or emotional strength until I became paralyzed at 51. I had had the experience of growing up without a father, which probably left some mark, but had never encountered real hardship like facing mortal danger, losing everything in a forest fire, or driving drunk where someone else dies. If you have some of that scar tissue from misfortunes in the past, you are, ironically, ahead of the game. You are better prepared for the next blow.</p><p>Only recently did I come across a third way to increase your resilience active learning. In a New York Times article entitled \"Expand Your Brain To Build Up Emotional Strength,\" they argue that learning a new skill or body of knowledge, at any age, is great preparation for an unexpected trauma. It demands risk-taking and determination and promotes self-confidence and the ability to change. To quote the article, you move from a \"fixed mindset\" to a \"growth mindset.\" It's not what you set out to learn, but the passion and commitment you put into it. As one expert says, \"Something I learned over here helps me over there.\"</p><p>I realize that I've known this all along, just not in so many words. When I was first paralyzed, I, like most people, threw myself into learning the rudiments of living with this condition. I had to learn how to sit up without falling over, transfer from one surface to another without fear, do all sorts of things with half a body. That effort to master small, everyday tasks gave me the confidence to tackle much bigger tasks in my life. It gave me a positive charge, the will to engage in a difficult activity instead of trying to avoid it. For others, learning to ballroom dance or studying French philosophy might have the same effect.</p><p>There are probably fifty other ways to enhance your preparedness for emotional blows of one kind or another. Physical exercise, for instance, is a classic method of putting yourself in a positive state of mind. Since you don't know what might happen, it's good to pursue one kind of conditioning or another. Ideally, it will help if you stay flexible, ready to adapt to a difficult challenge, ready to confront your fears, not run from them.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123995491</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:610C-Y1S1-JCBF-S2ST-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"750\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 2, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DMYZ</classCode><className>EMOTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp; DYING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DIF5</classCode><className>ADULTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000199</classCode><className>BOOK REVIEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009UAK</classCode><className>NOVELS &amp; SHORT STORIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DN5W</classCode><className>SCARS &amp; SCARRING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DLBO</classCode><className>CARTOONS &amp; COMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0008XAA</classCode><className>VISUAL ARTISTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp; TEENS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX000525</classCode><className>DRIVING WHILE INTOXICATED</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX000152</classCode><className>BABY BOOMERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>STX001647</classCode><className>SUICIDE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000199</classCode><className>BOOK REVIEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DLBO</classCode><className>CARTOONS &amp; COMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0008XAA</classCode><className>VISUAL ARTISTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST0009F8J</classCode><className>FAMILY FARMS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>PE0009U5H</classCode><className>ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

It not only covers the cost of repairing or replacing damaged property in home, but also covers the costs of accommodations for the houses that are vacant or not in usable form. Fire insurance is a type of insurance which is used to cover the residence and most of the household belongings against fire and natural calamities like forest fire, thunderstorm, and others. Furthermore, the IRDAI Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India has mandated all fire insurance companies to introduce 3 standardized products namely, Bharat Griha Raksha Bharat, Sookshma Udyam, and Suraksha, and Bharat Laghu Udyam Suraksha against SFSP i.e. Standard Fire and Special Perils for homeowners and enterprise from April 1, 2021. This policy will cover home building, home content, plant, machinery, stocks, and other assets, and can apply as per risk perception.</p><p><br/><br/>Increased demand for insurance policies, rise in need for financial safety in case of increase in uncertainties, and surge in number of properties are the major factors that drive the growth of the global fire insurance market.

According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, currently 11% of the state is in \"extreme drought (D3)\", 84% is in \"severe drought (D2)\" and 5% is in \"moderate drought (D1)\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">State Climatologist Mary Stampone provided an overview on the latest drought conditions and forecasts, which indicated that drought will likely persist across southeastern New Hampshire through the fall. According to Stampone, the well-below average precipitation received in September caused drought conditions to deteriorate. She also indicated that recent rainfall and the precipitation forecast for the next week will not be enough to make up for the substantial precipitation deficit for the year.</p><p>Leadership and staff from New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) updated the team on water resource impacts and management efforts. Lake levels continue to fall and some are below levels experienced in decades. While water supply reservoirs are low, they currently have enough water to meet demands. Boaters and swimmers should take caution on recreation lakes, as hazards have increased due to submerged obstructions that are now closer to the surface.</p><p>Flow conditions are very low in NH's rivers and streams. Recent small storms provided only brief relief in some parts of the state, however most of the state is experiencing flows below the lowest 10% recorded for this time of year. Water management actions, such as reduced outdoor water use and switching to groundwater sources, continue to be implemented in the Lamprey and Souhegan River watersheds as a part of the Instream Flow Program. NHDES has conducted three releases of water from dams in the Lamprey River watershed to provide relief to aquatic organisms and is currently in the process of a final pulse release for the year. These releases provide a significant, but brief, increase in Lamprey River flow to support stressed aquatic life, but have little effect on lake levels.</p><p>For groundwater, of the 31 monitoring wells across the state, the majority are much lower than normal, with water levels that dropped between August and September in all wells. Large groundwater permit holders are being held to permit conditions related to reducing withdrawals during drought, and community water systems have been urged to implement outdoor water use restrictions. To date, 165 community systems and 7 municipalities have implemented restrictions.</p><p>The well drilling and pump industry is busy keeping up with water demands. Southern portions of the state are experiencing an increase in the installation of bedrock wells to replace existing bedrock wells that have little to no well yield; this is predominantly due to shallow bedrock fractures supplying less water to the well. The northern portions of the state are experiencing a high volume of dug wells going dry due to the water table dropping below the bottom of the well. There is an increased demand to replace dry shallow (20 feet deep) dug wells with new bedrock wells. No matter where you are in the state, homeowners should expect to wait more than six weeks to get a new well drilled. For those in wait, conserve, space out water use, no outdoor watering, buy water for drinking and if necessary for dishwashing and flushing toilets. Homeowners can explore options to use auxiliary tanks or connect to neighbor's water system in order to supply water to the home. NHDES does not encourage delivering bulk water to wells, but if you do, see our website for cautions.</p><p>NHDES urges the public to stop using water for non-essential purposes such as lawn watering, hosing down or power washing outdoor surfaces, or car washing. To view the latest drought conditions, the presentation slides, and the recording from Thursday's meeting, and information related to saving water and managing residential wells during drought, are available. Go to <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.des.nh.gov\">www.des.nh.gov</url> and use the \"A-Z list\" and scroll down to Drought Management.</p><p>The NH Division of Forest and Lands gave a comprehensive update on the increasing forest fire danger and reviewed the Statewide restriction on smoking and outdoor fires. The Agriculture organizations reviewed the impact to crops statewide, and reminded all agencies that New Hampshire farmers are heavily impactd, but still have many products for sale and encouraged all to continue to support local farmers.</p><p>The Drought Management Team is led by NHDES and is comprised of key representatives across state government, academia, industry and other organizations.

Seventeen individual fire departments have received 30 grant awards.</p><p>The highest award was a $2.6 million SAFER grant to the North Little Rock Fire Department and the smallest award was an $8,000 AFG grant to the Shaw Fire Department.</p><p>This shows that even the smallest award changes the lives of those living in the community. With a small $19,000 AFG award received by the Burnt Ridge Fire Department, they were able to purchase thermal cameras, which is a game changer when responding to serious calls.</p><p>Burnt Ridge, a small town of less than 300 people, was also able to purchase a new brush truck, which allows the fire department to go off road to fight forest fire. Before they received grant funding, they were using a converted 1965 military truck.</p><p>In Arkansas's Second Congressional District, our departments need new self-contained breathing apparatuses (SCBAs) desperately. Especially in our smaller departments where they are old and outdated and are no longer certifiable under operational standards.</p><p>Our departments also need turnout cabinets. Fire fighters are putting their lives on the line not just in the immediate risk of bodily harm, but in the increased risks of harmful contaminates. Compliant washer/extractors cost over $12,000 per unit and forced ambient air gear dryers, needed to extend the life of the gear cost over $10,000 per unit.</p><p>This is well over the budget for most of the departments in my district. They need these units to clean their turnout gear after runs in order to remove harmful contaminates.</p><p>In central Arkansas, we have a strong community spirit and the firefighters know that if one department is able to purchase one of these turnout cabinets, then the area departments, especially volunteers, will be able to keep their turnout gear safe and well maintained.</p><p>Assistance to Firefighter and SAFER grant funding is necessary for fire departments in my district.</p><p>The needs are too great for them to do it alone and we are proud to support them in their applications. These grants have changed communities and makes the area exponentially and unmeasurably safer.</p><p>TOTALS Received in AR-2 since 2015:</p><p>AFG: $3,628,900.41</p><p>SAFER: $3,968,272.00</p><p>BY THE NUMBERS:</p><p>* 17 Fire Departments have received funding</p><p>* 30 awards</p><p>* 15 Thermal cameras</p><p>* 2 Fire station exhaust systems (to filter the diesel fumes that comes out of the fire trucks)</p><p>* 190 Self-contained breathing apparatuses (SCBA's)</p><p>* 339 masks</p><p>* 414 Air cylinders</p><p>* 1 Rescue unit fire truck</p><p>* 1 Brush truck</p><p>* 1 ladder truck</p><p>* 1 Water tanker truck</p><p>* 1 Turnout cabinet/ washing unit</p><p>* Numerous Supply hose/attack-lines</p><p>* 53 Turnout gear</p><p>* 2 SCBA testing unit</p><p>* 30 Voice amps</p><p>* Numerous Laptops for emergency vehicles and programing</p><p>* 1 RIT (Rapid Intervention) pack</p><p>* 148 Wildland Fire fighting gear</p><p>* 2,500 tamper proof smoke alarms</p><p>* 130 hearing impaired smoke alarms</p><p>* 20 Automated External Defibrillators</p><p>* 3 Cardiac Monitor/Defibrillators</p><p>This data shows how far this grant money, which keeps our communities safer, can go.</p><p>Thank you, and I appreciate your consideration.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"http://docs.house.gov/meetings/AP/AP15/20200226/110523/HHRG-116-AP15-Wstate-H001072-20200226.pdf\">http://docs.house.gov/meetings/AP/AP15/20200226/110523/HHRG-116-AP15-Wstate-H001072-20200226.pdf</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOVPUB-COSHC226015E6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y9P-F451-JCCP-034W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"630\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 26, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In the opinion, the court ruled that the order, which was in the form of a rule issued by the Secretary of the State Department of Health, failed to follow the proper, legislatively prescribed process for promulgating emergency rules.</p><p><br/>The decision is the first time the highest court in a state has pushed back against what some argue are unconstitutional tactics employed in response to COVID-19. Yet, in Wisconsin, the court based its decision less on the state constitution and more on statutory interpretation.<br/>Wisconsin\u2019s Secretary of the Department of Health, which is an unelected position, issued Emergency Order 28, which she entitled \u201cSafer at Home.\u201d Similar to orders issued in other states, the Safer at Home Order prohibited all forms of travel, except for essential services, ordered all non-essential businesses to \u201ccease all activities,\u201d prohibited public gatherings and more.<br/>The Wisconsin Legislature challenged the Safer at Home Order but not Governor Evers\u2019 Declaration of Emergency. In its petition, the Legislature asked the Wisconsin Supreme Court to decide if the Secretary \u201cbroke the law when she issued [the \u2018Safer at Home\u2019] order after failing to follow emergency rule procedures\u201d required by law.<br/>The Legislature argued that the order was, according to statute, a \u201crule,\u201d while the Secretary argued that the order was not a rule. Applying a precedent from 1979, the court sided with the Legislature because \u201cthe class\u201d to which it applied was \u201cdescribed in general terms and new members [could] be added.\u201d<br/>According to the court, the Secretary\u2019s emergency order usurped the authority of the Legislature. The purpose for vesting emergency power in the governor is to provide the ability \u201cto respond to emergencies without the need for legislative approval\u2026 [T]he Governor\u2019s emergency powers are premised on the inability to secure legislative approval given the nature of the emergency.\u201d<br/>A pandemic, though, differs substantially from other types of emergencies, as recognized by the court. \u201cFor example, if a forest fire breaks out, there is no time for debate. Action is needed\u2026 But in the case of a pandemic, which lasts month after month, the Governor cannot rely on emergency powers indefinitely.\u201d Concluding that the Secretary must follow rulemaking procedures (yet failed to do so), the court opined that the process \u201cexists precisely to ensure that kind of controlling, subjective judgment asserted by one unelected official\u2026 is not imposed in Wisconsin.\u201d<br/>The Legislature also requires agencies to jump through additional hoops if an emergency rule imposes criminal sanctions upon violations. As is the case with many other, similar orders, the Secretary tried to attach statutory criminal violations. In the eyes of the court, this was particularly troubling, as it did not provide \u201cdefiniteness\u201d or fair notice to the public. These factors weighed strongly toward considering the order an emergency rule, for which the Legislature required a specific procedure. Since the Secretary failed to follow the procedure, the court ruled that the government could not enforce it.<br/>Not content to rest the decision on this ground alone, the Supreme Court next analyzed the state\u2019s communicable disease law. The Secretary claimed she had the authority to issue the Safer at Home Order consistent with her authority to \u201ccontrol communicable diseases.\u201d The court dismissed her arguments, noting that the text of the law allowed only the quarantine or isolation of \u201cpersons infected or suspected of being infected\u201d with the communicable disease. In trying to restrict the movement of the entire state, the Secretary exceeded her statutory authority, and the order was unenforceable.<br/>Executive authority across the states has exploded in response to the COVID-19 crisis. Some of the powers exercised are certainly within the scope of the executive\u2019s authority, while others exceed it. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has taken an important step in reigning in the Governor\u2019s assertion of authority and, in doing so, exercised its constitutional check on authority for the benefit of hard-working Wisconsin residents.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-101077</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YYB-F5V1-DY1R-B366-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-01-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"713\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 ALEC, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>American Legislative Exchange Council</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 20, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>WISCONSIN SUPREME COURT</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Article</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Public Health &amp;

More than 4.1 million acres of Californian land burned as a result of wildfires in 2020, doubling the previous record. Over 2.2 million acres have already been burned in California this year, but the fire season is far from over.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the past two years, California has had six of its seven single largest wildfires on record. The largest single wildfire in California history, the Dixie fire, is currently roaring across five counties, two national forests and a national park just east of Chico.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As fires get larger, so does the amount of tax dollars Californians pay to fight them. California's 1982 budget for fighting wildfires was $8.6 million. The budget has ballooned to $1.3 billion in 2020, according to the\u00a0California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. This is\u00a0a 16,150% increase to match the realities of larger and more frequent wildfires.</p><p>To add to the severity, these wildfires aren't simply getting larger and more frequent, they are burning for longer. In a new study published in August from the scientific organization Climate Central, more than two months of fire season has been added in the San Joaquin Valley - a 269% increase since 1973.</p><p>Today, more than 9,900 personnel remain assigned to 12 active large wildfires. To date, more than 2.29 million acres have burned statewide.

Emily Ros (sophomore, Psychology) was planning on taking a trip that was in the works since last year before fires derailed her plans.</p><p>\"I was going to take a trip to Lake Tahoe, but then I found out about all the fires,\" Ros said.\u00a0</p><p>She said the news was devastating and that, combined with the issues of Covid-19, it felt like the disasters would never end.\u00a0</p><p>A new wildfire, the KNP Complex Fire, is knocking on the door of Sequoia National Park, home to the largest trees in the world. At 0% containment as of September 18, the uncontrolled fire could very well destroy parts of the ancient forest in the near future.\u00a0</p><p>Firefighters Protect Largest Tree in the World, the General Sherman Tree, With Fire Resistant Tin Foil in Anticipation of the Advance of the KNP Complex Fire. (Courtesy of San Francisco Chronicle's Twitter - @sfchronicle)</p><p>The wildfires have wreaked devastation on the people who live in the foothills and mountains, as seen in the Caldor Fire\u00a0today and in the near complete destruction of the town of Paradise by the Camp Fire in 2018. While this devastation of the foothills is easily visible, a more sinister danger threatens the Central Valley.</p><p>Complications arise when wildfires burn more than just forests. In recent times expansive wildfires have encroached into urban and suburban areas. The burning of building materials, plastics, and man-made chemical compounds lead to deadly concoctions of toxic gasses and metals that have the ability to travel large distances.</p><p>Toxic levels of lead found in wildfire smoke from the Camp Fire of 2018 were found as far away as 150 miles from the source in Modesto, according to a recent study by The California Air Resources Board. Chico had the highest levels of lead measured 50 times higher than the average reading while the Modesto area also had very high levels, according to the study.\u00a0</p><p>Deadly Amounts of Lead Found in Central Valley After Smoke Contamination From the Camp Fire in 2018. (Courtesy of California Air Resources Board, CA.gov)</p><p>Exposure to lead has been found to cause cancer in adults and severely impact the development of children, even in very small levels of exposure. The children of the Central Valley are well within range of the fires that encircle them. Therefore, Californians may want to be mindful of not just how large the fires are, but what materials they are burning.\u00a0</p><p>Dr. Alison McNally is a professor and researcher of geography at Stan State and is an expert in the field of changing environments in California. As a Warrior alumna herself and growing up in the foothill town of Sonora, McNally became fascinated with human-environmental relationships at an early age.\u00a0</p><p>The professor attributes the drastic change in the condition of wildfires to the unique environmental conditions the Central Valley finds itself in.\u00a0</p><p>For starters, California is situated right in the middle of a high pressure atmospheric system.</p><p>\"As we get warmer temperatures, our atmosphere warms, and the capacity for it to hold moisture increases... it's going to be a thirsty atmosphere, which means it's going to pull water out of vegetation,\" explained McNally. \"This increases the conditions that are really ripe for a catastrophic forest fire.\"</p><p>Thanks to #ClimateChange, a dry future is likely unavoidable for the U.S. Southwest - but reducing greenhouse gases can still help, according to a recent @NASAEarth study sponsored by @NOAA_MAPP and @DroughtGov. <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/cwNJWUHEqS\">https://t.co/cwNJWUHEqS</url> pic.twitter.com/v19e7QsJT8 - NOAA Research (@NOAAResearch) September 16, 2021</p><p>California's thirsty atmosphere has sapped the Central Valley. The United States Drought Monitor has labeled the entirety of the Central Valley region to be facing exceptional drought conditions, the highest categorical level, compared to only 3% of California experiencing the same conditions in 2020.\u00a0</p><p>This drastic rise in extreme and exceptional drought conditions will only add fuel to the wildfires that ravage the state. Therefore, it is expected that the rate and size of wildfires to not only continue to increase over the near future, but to increase dramatically.</p><p>Correlation between exceptional drought conditions and wildfires. (Courtesy of National Integrated Drought Information System, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.drought.gov\">www.drought.gov</url>)</p><p>Dr. David Colnic is the department chair of the political science department at Stan State and an expert in the field of environmental policy in the western United States. Colnic suggested that we must be realistic regarding the limitations to the United State's current policy making procedures because it is \"dominated\" by gridlock.\u00a0</p><p>Colnic stated that the most effective way to limit the effects of climate change would be more state level measures.</p><p>\"More states should act like California with more administrative rules, more attention from executive orders, and a tax policy that begins to move away from fossil fuels to other sources,\" Colnic said. \"It's patchwork, but it's our best hope. It's incremental, but that's how we've made policy for the last 30 years.\"</p><p>California's state government is a prime example to the rest of the country on how patchwork measures can be successful in the absence of national climate change legislation. For example, Governor Gavin Newsom issued an executive order in 2020 to transition to zero emission vehicles by 2035 and the state legislature has passed SB 350 and SB100 in 2018, which aims to transition all electricity production to carbon-free sources by 2045.</p><p>However, the success that California's state government has had passing laws to eliminate the carbon footprint from industry will hardly have an effect in reducing temperatures short to mid term. This is because carbon bio-emissions from continuously increasing wildfires are expected to increase by 46-70% in California by the mid-21st century.</p><p>Chart Displaying the Correlation Between Rise in CO2 Levels and Temperature In the Last Century. (Courtesy of ClimateCentral.org)</p><p>Also, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report this year detailing how global temperatures are slated to continue to rise until 2050; a direct result of the damage to the atmosphere that has already been done. Climate change on a global scale has effectively become a car with faulty brakes rolling down the side of a cliff.</p><p>The only question left: Is humanity going to reduce emissions enough to eventually stop the rise of temperatures? Or are we forever doomed to endure the political tribalism of the present?\u00a0</p><p>The answer will determine whether the people of the Central Valley will continue to experience the deadly consequences of wildfires.</p><p>To better protect you and your family in the short-term, refer to Steven Gaxiola's story on how to monitor air quality warnings and what preventative measures you can take before air quality becomes more unhealthy from wildfire smoke.

As per the President's instructions, the Government reimburses parents for half of the cost of vouchers for their children's trip to a summer camp. Following a hard year for children, this is an excellent opportunity for them to improve their health, to enjoy many experiences and to find new friends.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In May, we already spent five billion roubles on this. Today, we will allocate an additional 4.5 billion. This will make it possible to reimburse parents who bought vouchers for their children before the children's leisure cashback programme was officially launched. Over 220,000 children will be able to relax this summer, with the state's support, on favourable terms, to gain strength and have a good time.</p><p>As per the President's instructions, the Government is also continuing to support families receiving their third child or more. They get 450,000 roubles each, and they can use the money for repaying their mortgages. People are actively using this option. It is therefore necessary to supplement the amount that was originally provided for in the federal budget. We are supplying more than 27 billion roubles today. This will make it possible to provide housing for at least 60,000 families with many children.</p><p>People with disabilities require special attention, too. Today, we will review amendments that will allow people with impaired eyesight to access additional works of fiction, academic and periodical publications. For this purpose, it is necessary to lift certain restrictions in copyright law, so that it will be possible to print special-format books and materials for these readers without the prior consent of the authors and without paying the relevant royalties to them. At the same time, it will, of course, be impossible to do this under commercial profit-oriented plans. This literature will be delivered to libraries and special organisations, and people with impaired eyesight will be able to use it free of charge and without any restrictions. This will allow them to obtain more information in a readily accessible format.</p><p>And now, a few words about the Government meeting's economic agenda. We will review the federal budget's implementation in the first quarter of 2021. The Government has implemented an unprecedented package of support measures. This has had a positive impact on economic development, and this in turn has expanded consumer demand and employment.</p><p>Business activity is resuming, including in those sectors that had ground to a halt. The number of unemployed persons, registered by the relevant service, has plunged almost two-fold since December 2020. Housing construction rates have accelerated, including through large-scale mortgage support.</p><p>Enterprises have resumed their investment programmes. The relatively low interest rates that served as an effective incentive for this process are now about 30 percent lower than two years ago.</p><p>All this also affected the budget, with revenues considerably exceeding specific forecasts. Budget revenues reached almost 5.3 trillion roubles. Incidentally, the share of oil and gas revenues has dwindled to 30.5 percent, and this means that Russia is becoming increasingly less dependent on raw materials.</p><p>Despite the pandemic, a substantial budget surplus was posted. At the same time, public debt volumes remain at safe and comfortable levels.</p><p>We have picked up momentum. It is necessary to consolidate positive trends while unconditionally financing the state's social and other high-priority obligations.</p><p>Here is another issue. The Government is adjusting legislation to simplify the export procedure for Russian livestock companies.</p><p>The demand for foods from Russia is growing. The demand for meat and dairy imports from Russia increased by over one-third last year. The geography of our export deliveries is expanding as well. Last year, Rosselkhoznadzor coordinated 40 veterinary certificates with 25 countries. Foreign countries gladly buy our dairy products and semi-finished goods, pork, poultry meat and many other products.</p><p>To be able to export their products, Russian agricultural businesses must have a certificate of compliance with the requirements of importing countries. To accelerate the procedure, we are amending our veterinary laws. The document sets out a procedure for the inspection of land, buildings and other facilities.</p><p>Rosselkhoznadzor will not charge for its inspections of compliance with the importing countries' veterinary requirements if the owner files a requisite application. The results of these inspections will be added to the Federal State Information System for electronic processing of veterinary documents. Information about the facilities that do not comply with the requirements will be available on the system's website as well.</p><p>I have no doubt that the adoption of this law will simplify the development of solid ties with our partners and emergence on new markets for honest companies.</p><p>Our agenda also includes a package of issues on environmental protection.</p><p>The current priority is the fight against forest fires. The situation in several regions is complicated. We will allocate over 2.5 billion roubles to help them put out fires as soon as possible. The bulk of these funds will be spent directly on firefighting in 25 regions of Russia. Other funds will be spent on additional forest fire monitoring measures in approximately 50 regions. We have organised monitoring on the ground and in the air with the help of aircraft, so that we not just fight fires but do our best to stop them from spreading.</p><p>Two other hot-button issues concern everyone and have to do with reducing environmental pollution. First of all, we must clear away unauthorised urban dumps. To do this more effectively, we will redistribute funds stipulated for this purpose under the Environment national project. Thanks to this, five more regions, specifically, the republics of Mordovia and Udmurtia and the Voronezh, Kaliningrad and Kirov regions, will receive nearly 900 million roubles within three years for clearing away dumps. Allocations for the reclamation of seven landfills in the Moscow Region will be increased by over 1.3 billion roubles as soon as this year.</p><p>The quality of life also depends on the air we breathe. We discussed this subject during my trip to Kuzbass. Air pollution is a major environmental problem for the residents of large industrial centres. We will additionally distribute 4.8 billion roubles for events held within the framework of the Clean Air federal project this year. Funds will be provided to four industrial regions with the largest number of industrial facilities, specifically, the Trans-Baikal Territory and the Vologda, Kemerovo and Chelyabinsk regions.</p><p>The Government will also continue to support the development of transport infrastructure throughout the country. We will additionally allocate approximately 7 billion roubles to complete or accelerate the construction of bridge crossings and motorway sections and to improve regional roads. This is what the people who live there and, of course, businesses need. We must get rid of bottlenecks and enhance road safety. The funds will be allocated to six regions. Nearly all the related facilities are in the final stages of completion. We hope that these transfers will help us to accelerate the completion of these construction projects.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124514668</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62WM-6XN1-DYTH-G2PX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1290\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"06\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>June 10, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

I`m Judy Woodruff.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On the \"NewsHour\" tonight: a precipitous plunge. Stock markets take a deep dive, as inflation hits ordinary Americans and eyes are on the Federal Reserve for its next steps.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then: the hearings day two. A congressional committee makes the case that President Trump spread lies about vote count fraud in the weeks before the attack on the Capitol, despite his own advisers repeatedly telling him he lost the election.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And guns in America. Congress moves forward on a firearm safety deal, with a focus on mental and emotional health. What the research says about identifying people who might commit mass shootings.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DR. JAMES DENSLEY, Co-Founder and President, The Violence Project: About half of the individuals that went on to perpetrate a mass shooting were communicating that intent to do harm in advance.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more on tonight`s \"PBS NewsHour.\"</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Wall Street has gone into meltdown mode tonight over fears of inflation and the possibility that higher interest rates are imminent.</p><p>The Dow Jones industrial average lost 876 points today to close at 30516, nearly 3 percent. The Nasdaq fell 4.7 percent. And the S&amp;P 500 dropped nearly 4 percent. It is now officially in a bear market. That`s down more than 20 percent from its high in January.</p><p>The sell-off has been broad. All three major indexes have finished lower nearly every week since mid-March. And cryptocurrencies have lost nearly $2 trillion of their value since November.</p><p>Some insights and perspective on all of this now from economist Julia Coronado. She`s the founder of her own firm for economic analysis and a former economist for the Fed.</p><p>Julia Coronado, welcome back to the \"NewsHour.\"</p><p>So, tell us, what are the forces driving this plunge?</p><p>JULIA CORONADO, University of Texas at Austin: The catalyst really came on Friday. We got higher-than-expected inflation ratings again.</p><p>And one of the major gauges that the Fed watches of consumers` inflation expectations rose to the highest level since 2008. So, the combination of those two things really led the markets to start speculating that the Fed would raise rates much faster than it has already signaled. And that has in turn hurt risky assets like stocks.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: So, I think some people look at this and they know, OK, the Fed is going to have to raise rates, to an extent, to put the brakes on this inflation.</p><p>People know that is going to happen. And so how do they -- how are they watching this and then worrying about it at the same time?</p><p>JULIA CORONADO: Well, we`re really in uncharted territory in terms of, what are the drivers of inflation, how high will it go, how long will it last?</p><p>And, therefore, that translates into uncertainty about how high the Fed will have to raise interest rates, how much they will need to take the punchbowl away.</p><p>So, this was an incremental data point that told us they`re going to have to go further, faster. And that`s going to hurt all kinds of sectors. It`s already hurting housing. Mortgage rates are poised to go above 6 percent, the highest in a very long time. And that`s already starting to dampen enthusiasm for -- in home sales, and probably will eventually hurt valuations to some extent.</p><p>So that`s the leading edge. And, obviously, stocks are also feeling the pinch too.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And so if the Fed were to raise rates in the next few days, say, three-quarters of a point, rather than half-a-point, which had been expected, how much of a difference could that make in these markets?</p><p>JULIA CORONADO: It`s a great question, because it`s not just about -- as you say, we all know that the Fed is raising rates. We all know the direction of travel here.</p><p>And it`s not even really about whether they go 50 basis points or 75 basis points on Wednesday. It`s really, what does that signal for the whole path? Does that tell us that, instead of -- that we might see them raise rates much higher than we previously thought?</p><p>And I think that`s the line of thinking here, is that not only are they going to raise rates 75 basis points on Wednesday, after signaling they were going to go 50. That might be followed by another 75-basis-point hike in July, and maybe even in September. So we`re going to end up with rates higher than we saw last -- during the last expansion.</p><p>And we really don`t know where that stopping point is yet.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Julia Coronado, I have to ask you, how much of this is counterintuitive?</p><p>Because we look at other economic indicators. The economy is still growing. Unemployment is at -- still at a very low level. Consumers are still spending.</p><p>JULIA CORONADO: Yes.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: So, square the circle or however you want to describe what you`re doing to explain it for us.</p><p>JULIA CORONADO: Yes, you`re highlighting the tensions we see in the data.</p><p>In some ways, this economy is extremely strong. We have got a very strong labor market, low unemployment. Workers have been coming back to the labor market. We have been generating really an unprecedented number of jobs every month consistently for more than a year now.</p><p>So, in some ways, it`s very strong. And, in some senses, that leads the Fed to have greater confidence that they can and should raise interest rates higher to cool off the economy and bring it into better balance. The strength and the resilience of the job market and the consumers has kept inflation higher than it would otherwise be.</p><p>And so we do need to bring that, cool that dynamic down a little bit in order to bring inflation down.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And just finally, the dreaded R-word.</p><p>Who and what determines whether we do end up in a recession?</p><p>JULIA CORONADO: You know, every recession is different.</p><p>The one thing that is the same with every recession is that it comes usually with job losses and rising unemployment. We`re a long way from that. So, we`re still starting from a low point on interest rates and a very strong job market. We have got a long distance to travel before we really are looking at an imminent recession.</p><p>So, if -- can the Fed get this balance right? Can they nail that what we call soft landing, where inflation comes down without unemployment rising significantly? I think there`s still some hope for that. It`s just that landing strip for the Fed has gotten narrower and narrower with each of these inflation trends.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, that helps us think about what they`re facing, even if we`re still full of questions.</p><p>Julia Coronado, thanks so much.</p><p>JULIA CORONADO: My pleasure.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: For nearly a year, the House committee investigating the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol has worked mostly behind closed doors, gathering more than 140,000 documents and talking to more than 1,000 witnesses.</p><p>Today, the committee continued the public phase of its investigation, sharing new details from some of former President Trump`s inner circle about the spread of a false narrative that the 2020 election was stolen.</p><p>Amna Nawaz begins our coverage.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Day two of the January 6 Committee`s public hearings zeroed in on what President Trump knew and when he knew it.</p><p>BEN GINSBERG, Former Bush-Cheney Campaign Attorney: The 2020 election was not close.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Featuring a slate of Republican voices who said they told him repeatedly for months his claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election were baseless.</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, Former U.S. Attorney General: He`s become detached from reality if he really believes this stuff.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Among those voices, Bill Stepien, former Trump campaign manager, who bowed out of testifying in person just this morning after his wife went into labor, but who told the committee in previous interviews that he warned Trump multiple times, including on election night, results could take a while.</p><p>BILL STEPIEN, Trump 2020 Campaign Manager: My recommendation was to say that votes were still being counted. It`s too early to tell, too early to call the race.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: The committee says Trump ignored Stepien and instead listened to Rudy Giuliani.</p><p>REP. LIZ CHENEY (R-WY): You will also hear testimony that President Trump rejected the advice of his campaign experts on election night and instead followed the course recommended by an apparently inebriated Rudy Giuliani.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Here is Trump attorney Jason Miller describing Giuliani that night.</p><p>JASON MILLER, Former Trump 2020 Campaign Senior Adviser: I think the mayor was definitely intoxicated, but I did not know his level of intoxication when he spoke with the president, for example.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Adding to the committees`s election night narrative, former FOX political editor Chris Stirewalt, who was overseeing the conservative network`s election night coverage, including when they accurately break the news that Joe Biden would win Arizona.</p><p>BRET BAIER, FOX News Anchor: OK, time out, this is a big development.</p><p>MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX News Anchor: Yes.</p><p>BRET BAIER: The FOX News Decision Desk is calling Arizona for Joe Biden. That is a big get for the Biden campaign.</p><p>REP. ZOE LOFGREN (D-CA): After the election as of November 7, in your judgment, what were the chances of President Trump winning the election?</p><p>CHRIS STIREWALT, Former FOX NEWS Digital Politics Editor: After that point?</p><p>REP. ZOE LOFGREN: Yes.</p><p>CHRIS STIREWALT: None.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Despite advisers` warnings, and the electoral math not in his favor, Trump took the stage in the early morning hours of November the 4th and said this:</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, Former President of the United States: Frankly, we did win this election.</p><p>(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP: So our goal now is to ensure the integrity for the good of this nation. This is a very big moment. This is a major fraud in our nation.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: That night, according to witness testimony, launched a split within team Trump, those who continued to push the big lie he had won the 2020 election and those who didn`t.</p><p>Here is former Attorney General Bill Barr.</p><p>WILLIAM BARR: I felt that, before the election, it was possible to talk sense to the president and, while you sometimes had to engage in a big wrestling match with him, that it was possible to keep things on track. But I was -- felt that, after the election, he didn`t seem to be listening.</p><p>BILL STEPIEN: We called them kind of my team and Rudy`s team. I didn`t mind the characterized as being part of team normal.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: The committee`s second panel told the story of just how far Trump went in the weeks after the election to dig up voter fraud where there was none, even as allegation after allegation, more than 60 cases in all, were dismissed or found to be without merit by judges.</p><p>Former U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia BJay Pak, appointed by Trump, said he was asked to look into an allegation about a suspicious suitcase filled with fake ballots.</p><p>BYUNG JIN \"BJAY\" PAK, Former U.S. Attorney: We found that the suitcase full of ballots, the alleged black suitcase being pulled from under the table, was actually an official lockbox, where ballots were kept safe.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Pak resigned on January 4th of 2021, after details of Trump pressuring Georgia`s secretary of state to -- quote, unquote -- \"find more votes\" became public.</p><p>Al Schmidt, the loan Republican on Philadelphia`s election board, was asked to probe other voter fraud allegations.</p><p>AL SCHMIDT, Former Philadelphia City Commissioner: Not only was there not evidence of 8,000 dead voters voting in Pennsylvania. There wasn`t evidence of eight.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: Even for these Republican officials, Trump`s repeated lie led his supporters, echoing those lies, to make very real threats.</p><p>AL SCHMIDT: After the president tweeted at me by name, calling me out the way that he did, the threats became much more specific, much more graphic, and included not just me by name, but included members of my family by name, their ages, our address, pictures of our home.</p><p>AMNA NAWAZ: The committee will once again pick up on the effect of the big lie on Wednesday during a hearing that will focus on Trump`s attempts to replace the U.S. attorney general in the final days of his presidency.</p><p>For the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I`m Amna Nawaz.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Joining me now to discuss today`s events is Ben Ginsberg, who was one of this morning`s witnesses. He`s a longtime Republican elections attorney who has worked with the Republican National Committee, or RNC, and multiple presidential campaigns, and Cynthia Miller-Idriss, who runs the Polarization and Extremism Research &amp; Innovation Lab at American University.</p><p>Welcome to the \"NewsHour\" to both of you. I should say, welcome back.</p><p>I want to ask you both, what stood out for you at these two hours of testimony and presentation by the committee?</p><p>Cynthia Miller-Idriss?</p><p>CYNTHIA MILLER-IDRISS, American University: Well, I think it was really clear again, as it was on Thursday, that the election fraud claims were baseless, that this was massive disinformation, and that we are going to move forward with a very common narrative from many, many witnesses that that is the case.</p><p>So, I think what`s -- what really stands out is that that is absolutely the case, and that the American public should feel confident in that bipartisan set of witnesses deciding that.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Ben Ginsberg, you were there. You testified from your own experience.</p><p>Why did you want to be there today?</p><p>BEN GINSBERG: Because this is so important.</p><p>What today`s testimony brought out was that people in Donald Trump`s campaign, his most trusted campaign workers, told him the charges of fraud and rigged election was not correct, that they couldn`t prove that, that there wasn`t evidence.</p><p>And so a president of the United States sort of ripping the fabric of what holds our country and the election system together is tremendously important to get out that story.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And you -- and at one point in your -- in the question-and- answer period, you were asked about the fact that you have worked with campaigns that have challenged aspects of election results, but that this one was taken to a different level.</p><p>BEN GINSBERG: It was taken to a different level.</p><p>When folks like me get called in to do elections, it`s because the elections really are close. This election was not really close; 2000 in Florida, it was 537 votes. That`s close. Donald Trump`s most narrow margin in all of the key states was over 10,000 votes. You don`t make up that many votes in any recount.</p><p>And so now the country continues to go through the trauma of basically the fake allegations of our elections being rigged. That comes at a cost to the country.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Cynthia Miller-Idriss, you talked about what the committee was trying to do, this methodical presentation of witness after witness, many of them right in the White House, the president, former president`s attorney general.</p><p>How good a job are they doing of getting that story, the narrative out there?</p><p>CYNTHIA MILLER-IDRISS: I think they`re doing a very good job of getting the story out.</p><p>The question is, is anybody listening who wasn`t already convinced of that story? And I think, with midterm elections coming up, with another presidential election right around the corner after that, I think we really have to be thinking -- as much as we are about the story that we`re telling, we need to be thinking just that much about, how do we prevent people from being persuaded by that kind of disinformation again in future elections?</p><p>And how do we restore the trust in the election system that has been so irrevocably, if possibly irrevocably damaged at this point by people who no longer trust the system?</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And we know that`s what the committee would like to have happen as a result. We will see how much -- what their work that they are doing leads to that.</p><p>Ben Ginsberg, as someone who`s, again, worked with the Republican Party for many years, you obviously know a lot of Republicans .Are they likely to be persuaded by this case the committee is making?</p><p>BEN GINSBERG: I believe that the committee`s case may eventually persuade Republicans that it is in their own self-interest to put faith back in elections.</p><p>What I think some Republicans are losing sight of is that, once the voters, the people don`t have faith in elections, that`s going to hurt them when they win elections as well. For example, the mind -- the imaginary game to play is, suppose Donald Trump runs for reelection and wins?</p><p>Do we really think the Democrats are not going to behave in a similar fashion, now that the playbook has been written, to protest that election? And so you have now got a situation where 30 percent of the country doesn`t have faith in our elections, but that really does rub both ways and impacts and poisons the well for both parties.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And is that something, Cynthia Miller-Idriss, that this committee`s work can address ahead of time to head it off?</p><p>CYNTHIA MILLER-IDRISS: I think it`s one part of a bigger -- a bigger set of things that need to happen.</p><p>And we have to remember the people who are watching this are not just voters whose minds are made up, but kids in history classes and civics classes, kids who are going to be voting in the 2022, 2024 elections, who want to understand what this older generation has done and want to believe, I think, in very optimistic ways that they can make a difference.</p><p>And so I think it`s really important to document it. Even if this doesn`t persuade people, it has to be done for the record, for the museums that will document it in the future, and for teenagers who are watching in college students watching today who are going to be tomorrow`s voters and hopefully make some different decisions.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: It matters for history.</p><p>And I -- but I hear you, Ben Ginsberg, saying it also matters right now, in the immediate future of our elections in this country. We hold them every few years. We owe them every year in some parts of the country, but the major elections, or the presidential elections every four years, congressional elections every two years.</p><p>BEN GINSBERG: Yes, it really is important.</p><p>Look, Donald Trump sort of broke the fabric, violated a really important norm in our country in this election. Any candidate has the right to bring contests and recounts and litigation, as allowed by the different states` laws.</p><p>But what`s important to remember is that Donald Trump availed himself of that, filed more than 60 cases with more than 180 separate counts. When that was adjudicated, any candidate has an obligation to accept the decisions of the courts that they went to in the first place.</p><p>And so the committee`s work can help point out that particular situation, and people of both parties should realize it can`t be repeated.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And remind everyone that this has never happened before.</p><p>BEN GINSBERG: Never happened before.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: This is a first.</p><p>I keep coming back, Cynthia Miller-Idriss, to how is it that so many people can accept what is demonstrably false?</p><p>CYNTHIA MILLER-IDRISS: Yes.</p><p>That is the million-dollar question. And I say million-dollar because we also have invested since January 6 billions of dollars already in just added security for the Capitol alone. So what we`re investing in the securitization of this country, in the militarization of our bridges every time we have an inauguration now, we need to be investing that scale at the level of civic education, media literacy, digital literacy to help the public understand at every level how to understand source integrity and how to recognize this disinformation and not be persuaded by it.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, Ben Ginsberg, what do you think it is that the committee needs to do in coming days to complete this case?</p><p>BEN GINSBERG: The part of the picture that they have to draw that I think they`re trying to draw is the exact role of Donald J. Trump and how involved he was in the insurrection.</p><p>Congresswoman Cheney laid out the seven-point plan that they believe Donald Trump was carrying out. They need to fill in the dots.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will see in coming days, four more hearings to go.</p><p>Ben Ginsberg, Cynthia Miller-Idriss, we thank you both.</p><p>BEN GINSBERG: Thank you.</p><p>CYNTHIA MILLER-IDRISS: Thank you.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And a reminder that day three of the January 6 hearing is this Wednesday. That begins at 10:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>We will have live coverage here on PBS. That`s on air and online.</p><p>In the day`s other news: Thirty-one members of a white supremacist group are free on bail in Idaho and charged with planning violent disruptions at an LGBTQ event. Members of the Patriot Front were arrested Saturday in Coeur d`Alene. Police said today they found equipment and documents detailing plans for violence in the city center.</p><p>LEE WHITE, Coeur d`Alene, Idaho, Police Chief: That level of preparation is not something you see every day. It was very clear to us immediately that this was a riotous group that had prepared in advance to come downtown and disrupt either the Pride event or the Prayer in the Park event or just riot downtown on Sherman.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: The charges against the Patriot Front members are misdemeanor counts.

Tell us what is in this.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: There is a framework; 20 senators, including, notably, 10 Republicans, have signed on, as we reported yesterday.</p><p>Let`s talk about what`s in this with a little bit more depth. First of all, let`s talk about the gun portions of this bill. In this bill, there would be a statement -- there`s a statement to encourage state red flag laws. Currently, 19 states and the District of Columbia have those laws. Senators would like to see them in most states.</p><p>They also would have -- they would close the what`s called the boyfriend loophole. That is a situation where now, if someone is found convicted of domestic violence, but is not married to the person they have abused, they could still continue to own a firearm. This would change that for any kind of domestic abuse allegation like that.</p><p>Then also, there would be deeper background checks for those who are 18 to 21 years old in buying assault-style weapons. Notably, I think many of our viewers will recognize there is not a change in the age limit to buy those kinds of weapons.</p><p>But, instead, what these senators would like to do is to make available, in fact, require that records, criminal juvenile records, mental health records for juveniles, be included in that background search, which is not happening now. That`s one portion.</p><p>The other portion of this bill deals with mental health and larger kind of societal problems that might lead to some of the people that commit this kind of violence. Let`s talk about those portions of this bill.</p><p>In the framework, a major investment in mental health and suicide prevention across this country. Something notable, this bill aims to expand, or this framework, 24/7 community mental health centers across the country, increased access to mental health care, also specifically mental health care and trauma counseling in schools. And it would also add a large boost of school safety funding.</p><p>Now, we don`t have details on this. That`s why it`s a framework. It`s not a bill yet. We`re going to have to pay close attention. But why so much emphasis on things like mental health? Not only because it`s a bipartisan issue that most Americans agree on, but also because the players here.</p><p>Kyrsten Sinema, she is one of the core four who`s helping usher this through. Her first job, a social worker in schools, and she still teaches social work. So she`s someone who`s really pushing for these mental health ideas. Also, two important figures, Roy Blunt, a Republican who has signed on to this framework, and Debbie Stabenow, it`s their mental health framework that really it looks like they have been preparing for years, and now it`s being adopted in this proposal.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: So, rather than a huge, ambitious approach, this has been described as a more pragmatic one. Help us understand why that is.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: Something that is helping these senators reach consensus is the fact that they`re looking at the profile of a certain kind of American who has been committing some of this most reprehensible violence, young men.</p><p>And when you look at the data -- in fact, we looked at some of it today -- you see what why senators have their attention that profile. You look at 18-to-21-year-old perpetrators of gun violence, according to The Violence Project, that is -- that accounts for two-thirds of the largest mass shootings since 2018.</p><p>If you look more broadly -- this according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence,-- they are responsible for 17 percent of all homicides. So it`s helping that senators can aim this conversation in a focused way at one particular kind of perpetrator that we know is responsible for outsized amounts of gun violence.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: So we know a lot of people are waiting to see what they do, Lisa.</p><p>What about the timing? What happens next time, and when?</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: This is the question we all have, of course, because everyone knows the midterms are coming. The clock is not helpful to the U.S. Senate at this time.</p><p>However, this is delicate. This is a difficult situation. They don`t have legislative text yet. I`m going to show you what they do have, this background proposal we`re talking about. If you take a look at what it actually looks like here, it`s not a large document. There are just 300 words in it. We can scroll through it.</p><p>That`s it right now. This is what we`re talking about, just 300 words. So what these senators still have to do is to write this into text. Essentially, Judy, think of it this way. If a group of people is trying to build a house together, they have agreed now on a photograph of a house. They have not decided things like how many bedrooms, how big should the bedrooms be, what kind of appliances in the kitchen, who should use them?</p><p>Those are all difficult questions that can add to any problems in a deal. Most of the Senate wants a deal here. But they have to figure out those tough details. I think what where we`re at is, they`re going to try to write this legislative text in the next two weeks. If they do it, it would be remarkable.</p><p>Here`s what Chuck Schumer says about where they`re at.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): For the first time in a long time, the Senate has a path forward on legislation that will save lives, reduce gun violence and keep our communities safe.</p><p>Make no mistake about it. We have a lot of work left to do before we actually pass a bill, but yesterday`s announcement was a positive and necessary step in the right direction.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: I can imagine viewers saying, we have heard this before. We have heard positive steps before.</p><p>This is different in one way, that we did not hear from Senator McConnell on this issue today. The fact that he`s not saying anything is actually a reason for hope. He is not putting a hand on the scale yet. He is not against this.</p><p>Everyone knows Republicans have been pretty quick in the past to say no to anything related to gun legislation. He`s leaving an opening. But the main question, Judy, is the momentum that the Senate has now, those calls are getting from constituents, will that keep up long enough for them to finish this deal? And that, we don`t know.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And when you say, as long as it takes to agree on how to build a house, it makes me think it could go on for a long time. But we will see.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: That`s why we are gainfully employed.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: For sure. And you certainly are.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Lisa Desjardins, thank you very much.</p><p>LISA DESJARDINS: You`re welcome.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Even if the proposed framework that Lisa just described is signed into law, the U.S. will still struggle with far too many mass shootings.</p><p>Researchers are trying to better understand what`s behind these shootings.</p><p>William Brangham picks up on that part of the story.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: After mass shootings like those in Buffalo, Uvalde, Tulsa, and elsewhere, there are so many questions about the perpetrators.</p><p>What was their motive? How did they obtain the gun? Were there warning signs? Could something have been done to avert these massacres?</p><p>Two professors in Minnesota, Jillian Peterson and James Densley, set out years ago to answer some of those questions, with the hope of ultimately preventing the next tragedy.</p><p>I spoke with them both earlier.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Jillian Peterson and James Densley, thank you both so much for being here.</p><p>Jillian, to you first.</p><p>Your research has focused on the characteristics that are shared by many of these mass shooters and some of the seeming striking commonalities between them. Can you explain a little bit about what you found?</p><p>DR. JILLIAN PETERSON, Co-Founder and President, The Violence Project: Sure.</p><p>So, we studied the life histories of 180 perpetrators who killed four or more people in a public setting. We built a database using publicly available data, and then also did about 50 interviews with perpetrators themselves and people who knew them, their victims, and first responders.</p><p>And we identified this common pathway to violence that we saw over and over again. It often started with kind of serious violence in childhood, abuse, neglect. Different forms of trauma kind of laid the foundation. Then you see, over time, a build where they become isolated, depressed, hopeless.</p><p>Oftentimes, this is a crisis that is kind of -- they`re actively suicidal or have attempted suicide previously .Then that self-hate kind of turned outward, and you see perpetrators finding who it is that they blame for how awful they feel. A lot of times, they study other mass shooters. They see themselves in these previous mass shooters. Or they`re online and chat rooms or dark corners of the Internet getting radicalized towards violence.</p><p>And these mass shootings are meant to be watched and witnessed. They kind of want their anger to go viral. They want their message to get out there. And they`re also designed to be their final act. So, they go into it knowing they`re not going to come out. And then, of course, they have access to the weapons that they need to do the shooting.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You mentioned before that many of these cases end up as suicides, and that there were not longer-term plans for the rest of the day or the day after. What does that help us learn?</p><p>DR. JAMES DENSLEY, Co-Founder and President, The Violence Project: I think that`s a really, really important point and something which, for us doing this research, was a bit of an aha moment.</p><p>Because, if you think about a mass shooting as being a final act, and that somebody who perpetrates this doesn`t intend to ever get away with it, that`s never why they go into this to begin with, many mass shooters are suicidal prior to the act. So they even have suicidal attempts in their histories, or they 100 percent intend to die in the act, and they write this in their diaries or manifestos and other things.</p><p>It changes the way we think about prevention. What can we learn from suicide prevention techniques which would then apply to mass shooters? If mass shooters intend to die in the act, if they no longer care if they live or die, these are people who are in a really true crisis in their lives. What we learn from suicide prevention can be applied to get them out of that crisis to begin with, but also in how we talk about mass shootings.</p><p>So, we have protocols in place in the media, for instance, that, when we talk about suicide, we often will offer resources. We will say, here`s the telephone number for the national suicide prevention hot line. We won`t dwell on certain details, because we`re worried about copycats and contagion.</p><p>Those same rules apply with mass shooters as well. Mass shooters are studying other mass shooters. So, if we can adhere by those same rules when we think about these events, that could also help stop the next mass shooting. And I think that`s really what`s the most important piece here.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Jillian, are there other parts of your research that -- within these commonalities that you all found, that help us figure out how to prevent, how to identify, how to see these before they end up in the newspaper?</p><p>DR. JILLIAN PETERSON: Yes, so in identifying this pathway to violence, we thought about, how could you build off-ramps at different locations along this pathway?</p><p>Because we haven`t understood where these perpetrators are coming from, our typical response has been to try to minimize casualties once they occur, sadly. So we go through lockdown drills or we place armed guards, really, really kind of late-end stuff.</p><p>But what we realized through this research is that mass shooters, they`re not outsiders. They`re not these kind of scary bad guys coming in. They`re kids who go to that school. They`re our classmates. They`re our neighbors. They`re our co-workers. In some ways, that makes prevention easier.</p><p>I think it makes you -- it requires a shift in thinking. But then it becomes noticing when people around you have a change in their behavior, and having systems in place where we can report that and it will be met with a response that`s one of kind of care and concern and hooking you up to resources, rather than punishment or pushing you out.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Is it true that there are red flags, to use the term of art in this conversation, that there are signals that even laypeople can be aware of and to see clearly?</p><p>DR. JAMES DENSLEY: Absolutely, there is.</p><p>In fact, if you look at the numbers in our database, about half of the individuals that went on to perpetrate a mass shooting were communicating that intent to do harm in advance. And in the case of school shooters in particular, that number is actually about 80 percent.</p><p>So it`s very common for people to be telegraphing that violence is coming. They are often talking about it with friends and family, which is then dismissed as, ah, you know, this is just that casual conversation. Don`t worry about it. They would never actually do it.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It`s a disgruntled teen.</p><p>DR. JAMES DENSLEY: Yes, exactly. Boys will be boys, that type of a mentality.</p><p>Or they`re posting things on social media, which perhaps just we are not putting those pieces of the puzzle together. And that`s actually the most critical thing here is, time and time again, we see a very consistent pattern after these mass shootings, when we can go back and retrospectively look at them, which is to say that law enforcement knew something, a parent knew something, a teacher knew something, a classmate or a peer knew something.</p><p>They`d spotted things on social media. They`d seen drawings, conversations, whatever it had been. But none of those individuals were necessarily talking to one another or sharing that information. And so it wasn`t ever rising to the level where there would be an intervention.</p><p>And that`s usually the problem here, is that the systems are not necessarily in place or fully functioning to intervene at the crucial moment to prevent the tragedy from happening. So that`s really then on us. The onus is on us now to build those systems, resource them, fund them, make sure people no longer fall through the cracks, so we can get ahead of this problem, and so we`re not looking back on it and saying these were again missed opportunities.</p><p>WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Jillian Peterson and James Densley.</p><p>The research and the book is called \"The Violence Project: How to Stop a Mass Shooting Epidemic.\"</p><p>Thank you both so much for your time.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: The high-profile congressional investigation into the January 6 attack on the Capitol and how to address gun violence in America are two of the issues taking center stage in this midterm election year.</p><p>To discuss the political stakes, I`m joined by Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report With Amy Walter and Tamara Keith of NPR.</p><p>Hello to both of you. Welcome to the program on this Monday.</p><p>Let`s pick up with the story we have just been hearing from William and Lisa`s reporting on this framework for a deal.</p><p>Tam, you have been watching this as its unfolded the last few weeks. Does this look like it has a chance to become law, pass the Senate, and then be agreed on and signed by the president?</p><p>TAMARA KEITH, National Public Radio: There is a magical number, and that number is 10 Republicans. And there are 10 Republicans who are signed on to this.</p><p>So, in that respect, it has a much better chance than anything that`s been discussed over the last several years. What`s interesting is who those Republicans are. They are Republicans who are not up until 2026. They are several who are retiring. And then there`s Mitt Romney, who has nothing to lose and has proven his independence in a number of ways on a number of matters.</p><p>The -- this does not go nearly as far as President Biden has been calling for, as he did in his prime-time address, as Democrats have wanted, but it goes further than Democrats have feared that they might have to accept.</p><p>And so the rush from President Biden, from Speaker Pelosi to come out and say right away, great, we will take that, it`s something, it`s a step..</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.</p><p>TAMARA KEITH: ... indicates that there is motivation.</p><p>Of course, they are now working out the fine details of what`s in the legislation, in the legislative language. They are hurrying to do that. But the fine details can get into trouble. Also, the NRA and others can sort of rally while those details are being worked out.</p><p>AMY WALTER, The Cook Political Report: That`s right.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And the more days we get away from that shooting, the more -- the less maybe this pressure is felt.</p><p>AMY WALTER: That`s right. That`s right.</p><p>Yes, I think there are a couple of ways to look at this. There can be the cynical way or the not cynical way. I don`t know where you want me to start. But the not cynical way is, guess what? There actually is a center- left in the United States Congress. It doesn`t look like it very often. It looks like the two sides are never going to come together even on the most obvious, tremendous problems.</p><p>But here we find 10 Republicans willing to go along with Democrats on legislation that -- Tam is right -- nobody`s going to be totally happy with this. But it`s significant, in the same way we saw a center for the infrastructure bill, right? So things can get done in Congress.</p><p>The cynical side goes to what Tam brought up as well is, everybody who is part of this center is -- not everybody, but either is not up for reelection or they are not coming back in 2023.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: So, those -- but you need 10 votes.</p><p>AMY WALTER: You do. That`s right. That`s right.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: If all the Democrats are on board, and you have got 10 Republicans...</p><p>AMY WALTER: You have got it done.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: ... you have got 60 votes.</p><p>AMY WALTER: But that`s the...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: If that holds, if that group -- this could actually happen.</p><p>AMY WALTER: This actually -- this gets to the president`s desk.</p><p>TAMARA KEITH: This is the math that we talk about almost every week.</p><p>This math works, as long as it doesn`t fall apart when they get into the fine details.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Big, big if.</p><p>TAMARA KEITH: Yes.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: So, let`s talk about the other big thing that we have been watching over the last few days, certainly the two of you, seasoned Washington observers, have been watching these hearings this morning and then last Thursday night.</p><p>Tam, what is -- what are you taking away from this? I mean, we are -- the committee is presenting an organized story, narrative.</p><p>TAMARA KEITH: Right.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: What are you taking away from it?</p><p>TAMARA KEITH: A lot of this is not new to those of us who`ve been following it very closely. But most people have not been following it very closely.</p><p>And a lot of this reflects reporting that I did in those months, between the election and January 6, then immediately following it. But my sources were unnamed sources. They were people who would not go on the record. And now you have people on the record, in depositions, on video saying these things that they were saying behind closed doors, like the campaign manager talking about being part of the normal -- team normal vs. team Rudy.</p><p>All of that is stuff that was being discussed on background and unwilling to say it publicly. And now, with a subpoena, they have said it publicly.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes. Yes, and not to mention the former attorney general of the United States, who`s been very blunt.</p><p>TAMARA KEITH: Right.</p><p>AMY WALTER: That`s right.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>AMY WALTER: That`s right. That`s right.</p><p>And I think that Ben Ginsberg laid this out pretty well earlier in the show, which is, these aren`t Democrats that are coming and sitting in front of the committee and saying Donald Trump was misleading people willingly, or he was told these things, and he refused to believe them, or we laid out scenario after scenario which he refused to abide by.</p><p>This is his attorney general. These are the people who are closest to him, in his orbit, his campaign manager. They were telling him this all along, and they knew that this was an issue all along.</p><p>But what we also know is, there were many people, as Tam points out, who knew all along who were in Congress or who are Republican operatives that this also was not true. And they were willing to continue to go along with it, because it was more dangerous for them and still more dangerous for them to speak out against the president and call out what is true than it is to be quiet and hold on to your seat in Congress.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: But how do you -- I`m going to ask you the same questions that I was asking Ben Ginsberg and Cynthia Miller-Idriss, in a way</p><p>And that is, how do you -- how long do they continue to say what isn`t true was true, is true? It mean, how do you -- how long does that last?</p><p>TAMARA KEITH: I think that the concern here is that whether this committee proves that Donald Trump should have ever returned to the Oval Office or not, or whatever the committee aims to prove, the president -- the former president has made it OK to not concede.</p><p>The former president has created a norm where you can be a candidate who denies reality to the bitter end, and will have people follow along and believe you and produce documentaries to prove -- or \"documentaries\" in quotes -- to prove that it`s right.</p><p>And our system relies on people accepting the results of the elections.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.</p><p>TAMARA KEITH: And now there is a norm that is being established by the former president and his acolytes who are running for office right now that it`s OK to just not like the result and refuse to accept it.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And my question is, is that going to be -- is that a norm that`s going to survive?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>AMY WALTER: I think we`re going to see.</p><p>It works until it doesn`t, Judy. And that`s really the answer mostly in politics, right? Politicians are looking at what is working at this moment. And, right now, at this moment, there is no repercussion to saying this election was irregular, was stolen, that there are integrity issues, whatever it is. There is absolutely no penalty for saying that, especially since most of the people running for election are running in districts that are overwhelmingly Republican.</p><p>What we will find out is whether the people can go and make these claims and still win election. And we`re going to have very good opportunities to see whether this works or not when it`s not Donald Trump making these claims, but when it`s others who are parroting his claims and saying that they`re going to do similar things, the governor -- potential gubernatorial candidate in Arizona, the gubernatorial candidate in Pennsylvania.</p><p>So, it will work until it doesn`t work.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will see whether the committee, Tam, is able to call into question enough of what president, former President Trump has said to in any way diminish the credibility that he has with his followers.</p><p>TAMARA KEITH: Right.</p><p>And that first night, at least, 20 million people watched. I don`t know what share of them were persuaded. And there were more watching on C-SPAN that aren`t part of that number.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: That`s right.</p><p>AMY WALTER: That`s right.</p><p>And, remember, when we`re talking about 2024, how people feel about Donald Trump when we get all of these hearings distilled into campaign ad after campaign after campaign ad that go over and over again, that also could be a -- it could be a very different response than even what we`re seeing today from voters.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: We will be watching.</p><p>AMY WALTER: We will.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: I know the two of you will be watching.</p><p>TAMARA KEITH: Yes.</p><p>AMY WALTER: Thank you.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy Walter, Tamara Keith, thank you both.</p><p>TAMARA KEITH: You`re welcome.</p><p>AMY WALTER: You`re welcome.</p><p>JUDY WOODRUFF: Broadway attempted to stage a big comeback at last night`s 75th annual Tony Awards. There were some very familiar works being honored, as well as innovations showcasing inclusion.</p><p>Nicole Ellis has a look for our arts and culture series, Canvas.</p><p>WOMAN: And the Tony goes to \"A Strange Loop.\"</p><p>(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>NICOLE ELLIS: Taking home the coveted best musical award was \"A Strange Loop,\" Michael R.

Thank you, America.</p><p>NICOLE ELLIS: Joaquina Kalukango won leading actress for her performance in \"Paradise Square.\"</p><p>Representation seemed to be the theme of the night. Host and recent Oscar winner Ariana DeBose reinforced that sentiment.</p><p>ARIANA DEBOSE, Host: And I am so proud that the theater is becoming more reflective of the community who adores it.</p><p>NICOLE ELLIS: Jesse Green is the chief theater critic at The New York Times.</p><p>JESSE GREEN, The New York Times: Broadway has always said it loved diversity, but didn`t do very much about it.</p><p>In recent years, and especially this year, there has been a notable jump, not just in the number of works by Black authors and other people who formerly couldn`t get to Broadway, but also in the casting and staffing and in the naming of new theaters for great Black performers of the past, James Earl Jones and Lena Horne.</p><p>And that seems to me to be an actual change, not just lip service. Now, will it continue to build or just stay there as a plateau? It`s going to take several years to find the answer to that.</p><p>NICOLE ELLIS: Broadway is still reeling from the pandemic, with attendance at roughly half of what it was in 2019. Green says it will be a long road to recovery.</p><p>JESSE GREEN: It`s way too soon to say Broadway got its groove back. Broadway survived a forest fire.</p><p>And there are some things that bizarrely turned out to be useful about that forest fire, as there can be in nature too, in allowing new things to grow. And that`s part of why we saw such an unusual array of works and artists on Broadway this year that in previous years we wouldn`t have seen.</p><p>Whether you can count on that to continue when there isn`t a forest fire going on, I`m not so sure, but I`m hoping that the movements that have produced these changes will not relax in their requests and requirements of Broadway, and we will continue to see at least a healthy mix of kinds of material and a diversity of artists.</p><p>MARIANNE ELLIOTT, Director: Thank you first and foremost to Stephen Sondheim.</p><p>NICOLE ELLIS: A special tribute honored the famed composer, songwriter and lyricist Stephen Sondheim, who died in November.</p><p>His production company won best revival for a musical. Other highlights of the night included a shout-out to understudies and others not often recognized publicly.</p><p>Angela Lansbury received a lifetime achievement award. And Jennifer Hudson`s win as producer for \"A Strange Loop\" propelled her to EGOT status, having now won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony.</p><p>But will the spirit of last nights awards help spur better times on Broadway?</p><p>JESSE GREEN: I`m really interested in maintaining a balance between traditional shows that are enjoyable for everybody and that draw tourists and shows that are more challenging.</p><p>I don`t think the business works if it`s only one or only the other.

On October 7, the Turkish parliament approved[5] the bill unanimously. The decision comes ahead of the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP26[6], taking place in Glasgow this year, between October 31 and November 12. <br/>Turkey also announced its goal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2053. But signing the agreement is not enough[7]. According to Climate Action Tracker, the country's efforts to reach the Paris accord's goals are 'critically insufficient[8].' <br/><br/>Meanwhile, this summer, Turkey experienced the worst series of natural disasters and environmental crises[9] to date. <br/> Drought in Lake Van caused thousands of flamingoes to die[10] in July, while a substance called 'sea snot' covered the coasts[11] of the Marmara Sea for months, making the seashore unusable. In August, some 240 wildfires raged through Turkey's southern coast[12]. Shortly after the fires, Turkey's Black Sea region was hit by[13] flash floods and mudslides because of torrential rain. Local experts have also voiced criticism over the government's lack of a comprehensive and holistic climate change policy and excessive construction projects[14] which disregard environmental damage. According to Climate Action Tracker[15], 'Turkey's climate policies and commitments reflect minimal to no action and are not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement. Under Turkey's current targets and policies, emissions will continue to rise and are consistent with more than 4C warming.' <br/>The Paris Climate Accords <br/>The agreement was initially adopted by 196 Parties at COP21 in Paris in December 2015. Known also as the Paris Accords or the Paris Climate Accords, it came into effect in November 2016. Its goal[16] is to limit global warmingto well below 2,preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels. <br/> The indicators estimated by the Climate Action Tracker for Turkey call for immediate action, which authorities are struggling to ignore. In an interview with Politico in August 2021, Levent Kurnaz, director of Istanbul's Bo\u011fazii University Climate Change and Policies Research Center, said[17], 'They will change because they have to change now. They have seen how serious this issue is and how much harm can come out of these problems in the future, as well.' <br/> Speaking to Al-Monitor, co-spokesperson for Turkey's Green Party, Emin Ozkan agrees, adding[18] that floods and wildfires from this summer, and the country's economic crisis 'are pressing the government from every angle.' <br/> Though President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan delivered[19] an environment and climate-focused speech at the UN General Assembly in New York last month, where he also announced Turkey's decision to ratify the Paris Agreement, critics say the threat of climate change was not what spurred the ratification. The decision came shortly after Erdo\u011fan received guarantees of financial support from France, Germany, the World Bank's International Finance Corporation, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, according to reports[20] by Politico and Reuters[21]. <br/> Previously, Ankara said the reason it had not signed the agreement was because of unfair classification. Turkey was ranked as an Annex I group country \u2014 a 'developed' or 'industrialized' country \u2014 which prevented it from seeking funding, unlike nations ranked as 'developing.' After sending a request to the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to have its name removed from that list, the country expects to finalize[22] its ranking at the upcoming summit in Glasgow. <br/>Turkey's environmental plan <br/>In January this year, 37 local non-governmental organizations signed a petition[23] calling on the government to ratify the Paris Agreement. Now that the government finally approved the document, all eyes are on the ruling government and the implementation process. <br/> On October 7, 15 local environmental groups released a statement[24], recommending the government adopt short-term targets if it wants to meet its goals to reduce emissions by 2053: <br/>Turkey ranks 16th among the countries that cause the most greenhouse gas emissions in the world and its per capita emission level is increasing every day. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Turkey must first set short-term climate targets that will cover the period until 2053. <br/> In an interview with Al-Monitor, Onder Algedik, a mechanical engineer and independent climate consultant, said[25], 'the Turkish government should 'urgently' shut down coal-fired power plants, stop subsidizing fossil fuel investments and redirect funds to advance energy-efficiency projects under a plan to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.' How exactly the ruling government will carry out its plans is yet to be seen. <br/> According to the Climate Transparency Turkey report,[26] Turkey draws 38 percent of its energy from coal and continues to invest[27] in new coal-fired power plants.In May this year, the energy ministry announced that it would award around 500 coal mines to investors in public tenders. <br/> On October 12, speaking after the Presidential cabinet meeting, President Erdo\u011fan announced[28] plans to establish a 'Climate Change and Compliance Coordination Board' within the renamed 'Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change Ministry' (previously the Environment and Urbanization Ministry). A council meeting is set to take place in January 2022[29], where the rebranded government body will determine a long-term strategic action plan to combat the climate crisis, according to Environment and Urbanization Minister Murat Kurum. <br/><br/>Written byArzu Geybullayeva[30] <br/> [ 1]: <url

If you remember, he's actually serving on that investigation of the January 6 riot. Lots of links between what the House Oversight Committee is doing, as well as what the investigation for the January 6 riot is doing -- that House Select Committee also.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Also, Gerry Connolly of Virginia has put his name forward for that spot, as well as Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So, of course, remember this is important, Christine because that committee is going to be incredibly important. That spot -- that top Democratic sport will be incredibly important should Republicans take the majority in the November -- the 2022 midterms. That would mean that it would be a top Republican on that spot. So, Democrats would not have subpoena power but would be the top messenger for that committee with whatever investigations Republicans proceed with should they take the majority in the November 2022 midterms, Christine.</p><p>So that is why this committee is so important and why it's going to be interesting to see who takes that spot. But, of course, I really want to emphasize still a lot of time until that next Congress begins -- Christine.</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN ANCHOR: Yes, for sure. All right, Daniella Diaz. Nice to see you this morning. Thank you.</p><p>OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN ANCHOR: President Biden fulfilling a campaign promise spelling relief for millions of Americans burdened with student loan debt.</p><p>The president's sweeping plan calls for forgiving $10,000 in federal loans for those who didn't receive Pell Grants. Borrowers who did receive Pell Grants are eligible for up to $20,000 in student loan relief. It applies only to those earning less than $125,000 a year.</p><p>Also, the freeze on student loan payments was extended one final time through the end of the year. Borrowers will have to begin making payments again in January.</p><p>ROMANS: The Biden plan drawing criticism from Republicans and some Democrats. The president responding to questions about whether the forgiveness plan is fair.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REPORTER: Is this unfair to people who paid their student loans or chose not to take out loans?</p><p>JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Is it fair to people who, in fact, do not own multi-billion-dollar businesses if they see one of these guys getting all the tax breaks? Is that fair? What do you think?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Let's bring in CNN White House correspondent John Harwood. Hi, John.</p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Christine. President Biden was bristling there, wasn't he?</p><p>ROMANS: He sure was. He sure was. He gave it right back at them.</p><p>Look, to that criticism in a moment. But first, this -- bottom line, this is a promise kept from Joe Biden.</p><p>HARWOOD: Joe Biden had a bunch of conflicting pressures Christine, as you know, in trying to fulfill this promise.</p><p>Of course, his number one political problem right now is inflation. Economists -- for some of the reasons that you mentioned -- generally speaking, Democrats and Republicans don't like this plan because they say, among other things, that it would tend to be -- not hugely, but intend to be inflationary over time. So it cuts against Biden's attempts to solve that problem.</p><p>On the other hand, the Democratic coalition, right now, is chock full of young people, college graduates, middle-class people, African Americans. And representatives of all of those groups -- progressive -- have been pushing very hard for more fulsome relief of student debt obligations. The president was trying to balance those things.</p><p>Some people wanted him to wipe out $50,000 --</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>HARWOOD: -- in debt. The president decided he wasn't or couldn't do that. But this is a pretty expansive plan nevertheless.</p><p>JIMENEZ: Well, and John, obviously, not everybody was on President Biden's side here. Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell says it's just not fair -- listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): I think it's a bad idea. An awful lot of Americans choose not to go to college, And then there are those Americans who borrowed money to pay for school and paid it back. In what way is it fair to those taxpayers?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIMENEZ: And Democrat Tim Ryan says that loan forgiveness sends the wrong message.</p><p>So this is all coming at a critical midterm for Democrats. So, mainly, the question is that I'm sure is on everyone's mind is how is this going to play out politically?</p><p>HARWOOD: Well, I think Democrats are counting on the idea that the people who are gratified and pleased by having their debt wiped out -- and millions and millions of people had less than $10,000 in debt and they were qualified by income. And so, many people will no longer have to write those checks. Those people may be more motivated rather than the people who are angry about it. You know, people who say well, I took out a loan. I paid my loan back, or I didn't go to college.</p><p>Those are all valid points. The question is what does it translate into in terms of political energy?</p><p>[05:35:00]</p><p>And I think Biden was doing two things. One, he thinks on net (PH) he's going to come out ahead as Democrats look to this midterm -- very challenging, trying to hold the Congress. But he's also making a larger point about many things in the society and in the tax code that may not be fair. And so, economists may look at this and say well, it rewards too many people at too high of an income level.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>HARWOOD: And Biden says well, you may not like it but there's a whole lot in our tax code, including breaks for wealthy people and corporations, that I don't like either. So come at me with the fairness argument.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes. You know, when he made this promise we had, basically, inflation that was nil, too. So he's -- you know, the inflation part of that argument -- when he made this promise we didn't have an inflation problem.</p><p>Also, John --</p><p>HARWOOD: That's right.</p><p>ROMANS: -- this does not address the high cost of college. This doesn't fix what is a really terrible higher education situation. Tuition inflation is insane. This doesn't -- this doesn't fix that. It's taxpayers here, not the colleges, that are held accountable. So that -- that's one problem. And then there's this. The CEO of the NAACP says that canceling $10,000 is like pouring a bucket of ice water on a -- on a forest fire. And that Biden must recognize and disregard -- and regard, rather, student debt as a racial and economic justice issue.</p><p>Is that a valid criticism, do you think?</p><p>HARWOOD: Well, sure, they're both valid criticisms and that's why it's such a difficult --</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>HARWOOD: -- problem.</p><p>Tremendous cross-pressures on the White House here. You've got a strong constituency saying we need more help, and then you've got these larger economic concerns, as you said. The inflation ground has moved under the feet of the administration since the beginning of Joe Biden's term in office. Now, the inflation problem seems to be getting a little bit better now -- it may have peaked -- but it's still a concern. And that's the basis of a lot of the criticism from Republicans as well as some Democratic economists like Larry Summers, as you know.</p><p>ROMANS: You know, I would -- I would just caution young people -- and this is -- I don't think you'll ever see this again -- this student loan debt wiped out like this. It's amazing. It'll be a game changer for so many families. But, you know, anybody sending a kid to college right now, we still have to keep telling people you've got to really be careful on how much you borrow and where you go to school because the whole system is just rigged to keep you in debt, it feels like, John.</p><p>HARWOOD: Well, and Christine, that whole issue of moral hazard, which those of us who follow economics are familiar with, is the idea that the fact that this has taken place might encourage other people to pay more debt in the belief that down the road they may get some kind of relief of this magnitude. That may not happen. So, it's a very dicey issue.</p><p>And tuition has skyrocketed as public support for higher education has diminished over the last couple of decades. So, certainly, the financing of education is a systemic problem that is much deeper than anything that could be addressed by loan relief.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes, John Harwood. Nice to see you, John. Thank you.</p><p>HARWOOD: You bet.</p><p>JIMENEZ: First lady Jill Biden testing positive for a rebound case of COVID. She's currently in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware -- not a bad place to quarantine for a bit. Dr. Biden doesn't have any symptoms and a small number of recent close contacts have been notified.</p><p>The first lady originally tested positive 10 days ago while vacationing in South Carolina. She was prescribed the antiviral drug Paxlovid, which can trigger a rebound case of COVID several days after a negative test result.</p><p>She's isolating, but not alone, tweeting she is grateful to have her cat Willow at her side during her recovery.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Yes, we wish her well.</p><p>All right, several high-water rescues in Mississippi as record rainfall creates life-threatening flash flooding. More than 100 children had to be rescued from rising floodwaters at a daycare center Wednesday -- terrifying. Thirty-one people had to be evacuated from a nursing home and school buses as up to three feet of water rushed through that facility.</p><p>The rising waters have also washed away roads, they derailed a train, and caused widespread damage to many homes and businesses.</p><p>JIMENEZ: And the southeast is just not done being hammered by relentless rain. More storms are expected today, creating a very dangerous flood threat.</p><p>Meteorologist Pedram Javaheri joins us live. It feels like deja vu every time I come to you. We're talking about more flooding, more rain pounding the southeast and creating these dangerous conditions.</p><p>PEDRAM JAVAHERI, AMS METEOROLOGIST: Yes, I think that there's some light at the end of the tunnel here, Omar, at least going into Friday -- possibly getting a break across this region.</p><p>And we're talking about the wetting single day on record and having the wettest month on record across Jackson, Mississippi -- all of it culminating here in the past couple of days. And you see the damage left behind across central portions of Mississippi as well. Rainfall amounts as much as six, even 10 inches in a few spots scattered about this region. And the concern is that moving forward again, additional thunderstorms later on this afternoon could bring in heavy rainfall.</p><p>You notice the widespread coverage of what we saw here the last couple of days when it comes to the heavy rains. Around the southern tier of the United States, the frontal boundary in place there that's prompted all this wet weather -- it's still there. It's weakening rather quickly here as we go into this afternoon. And then, yes, we expect the flood coverage to really diminish as well.</p><p>[05:40:00]</p><p>Right now, we're seeing some heavy storms pop up around central portions and the southern areas of Georgia, eventually making its way across north Georgia as well, and crossing into the Carolinas. But notice back around the areas that are hardest hit there, across Mississippi into Louisiana and Texas, conditions are generally quiet right now.</p><p>Now, you take a look -- the forecast does bring in heavy rains across this region into the afternoon hours as well. And the flood alerts, again, are in place here for another possibly two to four inches before it's all said and done, Omar. JIMENEZ: Pedram Javaheri, thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up, a controversial plan to address the homeless crisis in Los Angeles. Will hotels be forced to offer vacant rooms to those living on the street?</p><p>ROMANS: And this mega yacht once owned by a Russian oligarch, the first to be sold off due to Western sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL)</p><p>[05:45:00]</p><p>JIMENEZ: Los Angeles is now debating whether to begin requiring hotels to offer rooms to the homeless. The controversial initiative is being backed by a hospitality worker union and will go before voters in 2024. But local and national hotel and tourism leaders say the measure could put hotel workers and guests in danger.</p><p>CNN's Nick Watt has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NICK WATT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In Los Angeles County, more than 60,000 people are homeless on the average night, and more than 20,000 hotel rooms lie empty on the average night. See where this might be going?</p><p>STUART WALDMAN, PRESIDENT, VALLEY INDUSTRY &amp; COMMERCE ASSOCIATION: It's insane. It isn't going to solve the problem.</p><p>KURT PETERSEN, CO-PRESIDENT, UNITE HERE LOCAL 11: We think this is one part of the solution. By no means do we think this solves the homelessness crisis. But do hotels have a role to play? Of course, they do.</p><p>WATT (voice-over): So, the union he leads, which reps hotel workers, gathered enough signatures, and Angelinos will vote on a bill that would force every hotel in town to report vacancies at 2 pm every day, then welcome homeless people into those vacant rooms.</p><p>MANOJ PATEL, MANAGER, MOTEL 6: Honestly, would you check into a hotel knowing that the chance of your neighbor to the left or right is a homeless individual?</p><p>WATT (voice-over): Manoj Patel voluntarily rents some rooms to homeless people who are vetted and paid for by a local church, but he's against this bill that would make that mandatory.</p><p>PATEL: We barely are surviving, number one. Number two, we have to think of the safety of our staff. And number three, we're not professionally or any other way equipped with any of the supporting mechanisms that the homeless guest would require.</p><p>WATT (voice-over): What services would be provided remains unclear. Also unclear, the funding. And hotels would be paid fair market rate.</p><p>PETERSEN: It's up the city. I mean, they did it during Project Room Key.</p><p>WATT (voice-over): The pandemic-era program now winding down that inspired this bill by placing more than 10,000 people in hotels that volunteered -- Shawn Bigdeli among them.</p><p>SHAWN BIGDELI, RECIPIENT, PROJECT ROOMKEY: Well, first of all, it's a blessing. It's a -- it's a great room. The technology is not up to par but what technology did you have in a tent?</p><p>WATT (voice-over): This bill would also force developers to replace housing demolished to make way for new hotels and hotel permits would be introduced, as well as making every hotel from a Super 8 to the Biltmore accept homeless people as guests.</p><p>BIGDELI: I don't think that's a good idea.</p><p>WATT (on camera): Why not?</p><p>BIGDELI: Maybe for some, but there's a lot of people with untreated mental health and some people do some damage to these poor buildings, man.</p><p>WATT (voice-over): This happened in Manoj Patel's hotel.</p><p>PATEL: And she marked all walls. Curtain, she burnt. Thank God there was no fire. Even marked the ceiling.</p><p>WATT (voice-over): Opponents of housing the homeless in hotels fear this and fear tourists could be put off from even coming to L.A.</p><p>WALDMAN: I wouldn't want my kids around people that I'm not sure about. I wouldn't want to be in an elevator with somebody who is clearly having a mental break. The idea that you can intermingle homeless folks with paying, normal guests -- it just doesn't work out.</p><p>PETERSEN: We don't want to head backwards into the segregated south, but that's kind of the language that they're talking about. There's a certain class of people less than humans -- animals, they almost describe them as, to be honest with you. They don't seem to understand who the unhoused are. We're talking about seniors, students, working people. That's who the voucher program would benefit the most.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS: All right, Nick Watt. Thank you so much for that reporting.</p><p>Let's get a check on CNN Business this Thursday morning.</p><p>Looking at markets around the world, you can see Asian shares have closed higher. Europe has opened -- I'd call that mixed. And on Wall Street, stock index futures are leaning up just a little bit after stocks closed higher on Wednesday after a 3-day slide. Investors appear to be in a holding pattern waiting for Fed chief Jerome Powell's speech tomorrow morning in Wyoming. Other potential market movers -- jobless claims are due out today. A key inflation gauge for the Fed. Something called the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index -- that comes out tomorrow.</p><p>More fodder due soon for the recession guessing game. A second-quarter GDP revision due out later this morning. This could update -- this update could either tamp down or ramp up fears of a recession.</p><p>Look, the economic picture is complicated. The economy is showing huge improvement following the COVID-19 economic downturn. The job market is strong. Payrolls have returned to their February 2020 levels. The jobless rate is at levels not seen in five decades. And the American consumer is showing resilience in the face of months of biting inflation.</p><p>And gas prices still sliding, down sharply from the record set in June -- down again overnight.</p><p>But around every corner, danger. We've seen two quarters of negative GDP growth. The housing market -- it's turning lousy, actually, as mortgage rates rise and demand plummets. Those interest rate hikes are now becoming routine as the Fed tries to cool runaway inflation.</p><p>[05:50:00]</p><p>Further clarity comes Friday when Fed chair Jerome Powell speaks in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.</p><p>All right, Peloton has a new partnership with Amazon. The company is now selling a selection of its connected fitness equipment and accessories on Amazon's website in the U.S. Peloton is trying to broaden its customer base and win back investor confidence. Its revenue growth has slowed dramatically from pandemic highs. Investors like the deal. Peloton stock rallied to end the day up more than 20 percent.</p><p>And this -- a $75 million superyacht once owned by a Russian oligarch auctioned this week in Gibraltar. The Axioma was seized in March after JPMorgan said its owner defaulted on the terms of a $20 million loan. He was sanctioned by Britain and the European Union following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>Other superyachts owned by Russian oligarchs have been detained under the sanctions but this one, the Axioma, the first one to be sold off.</p><p>The financial screws -- putting the financial screws to the Russian economy.</p><p>JIMENEZ: I was going to say --</p><p>ROMANS: At least the richest in the Russian economy.</p><p>JIMENEZ: Well, I was going to say you only said $75 million, right? That's a -- ROMANS: Seventy-five million.</p><p>JIMENEZ: OK. So, on sale?</p><p>ROMANS: We could -- we could go together.</p><p>JIMENEZ: Yes, we could combine -- we could combine everything.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes, OK, -- sure.</p><p>JIMENEZ: Cool -- amazing.</p><p>Well, people who look alike -- sorry, that's not us -- often share DNA. The new study that says you might be distantly related to your doppelganger, next.</p><p>And --</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TAYLOR SWIFT, SINGER-SONGWRITER: Singing \"I Bet You Think About Me.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Some Texas college students are about to have the chance to study Taylor Swift. What's included in this new class, ahead.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SWIFT: Singing \"I Bet You Think About Me.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL)</p><p>[05:56:00]</p><p>ROMANS: All right, folks, your doppelganger is out there. People who look just like each other but aren't directly related -- they still seem to have genetic similarities. That's according to this really cool new study.</p><p>Researchers in Spain recruited 32 people with doppelgangers or lookalikes and asked them to take DNA tests and answer questions about their lives. Facial recognition software tests were also done and 16 pairs -- half had outcomes similar to actual identical twins. So you might actually be related to your lookalike.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because over the years we've been mistaken for each other all over the place -- all over Atlanta. And there's been some really interesting situations that have come out just because people thought we were the other person.</p><p>And so, for us, it's just been a lot of fun and another way since we're already good friends -- another way for us to be even better friends and to bond more. We've got this thing between us that not everybody else has. I mean, everybody has a doppelganger, probably, but we actually know ours.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Wow, those guys look exactly alike --</p><p>JIMENEZ: That's so weird.</p><p>ROMANS: -- and not -- and they're related.</p><p>Do you have a doppelganger?</p><p>JIMENEZ: Well, not specifically, but I feel like when I was playing basketball at Northwestern, everybody sent me this screenshot of me standing next to one of the referees and said hey, here's your long- lost brother. And I was like, you know, I could -- I could kind of see it but I think it hits other people's eyes differently than me. It's not exact but, you know, there's something there.</p><p>ROMANS: Close enough.</p><p>JIMENEZ: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: Close enough.</p><p>JIMENEZ: Yes. What about you? Anybody?</p><p>ROMANS: I don't know. I mean, sometimes when I'm in an airport people will say oh, yes, Savannah Guthrie. I'm like, I'm not -- no. She's -- we're not the same person. Sometimes people mistake me for her but not very often. We'll see.</p><p>JIMENEZ: Well, your doppelganger is out there somewhere. If you -- if you guys think of anyone send it to her. Tweet it to her.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes. If you think I look like someone.</p><p>JIMENEZ: We're going to find your doppelganger. That's so cool.</p><p>Well, Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy are teaming up to launch a new tech-infused golf league.</p><p>Andy Scholes has this morning's Bleacher Report. A lot of -- a lot of golf leagues being talked about these days.</p><p>ANDY SCHOLES, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, a lot -- a lot of new ones coming up these days, right? Omar, good morning to you.</p><p>But this one sounds pretty cool. Think of the best players in the world playing in a top golf-like arena. Now, this new league, called TGL, is going to feature 2-hour, 18-hole matches on a virtual course with players hitting into a simulator before putting on an actual green. The players will compete on six 3-man teams. Now, there's going to be 15 regular season matches on Monday nights in primetime and then a playoff. It's all going to get started in January of 2024.</p><p>And this is going to be for PGA Tour players only. It's a further incentive to those guys to not leave for the Saudi-backed LIV Golf series.</p><p>Tiger Woods saying in a statement, \"Embracing technology to create this unique environment gives us the ability to move our sport into prime time on a consistent basis alongside so many of sport's biggest events.\"</p><p>All right, Ukraine's top soccer league, meanwhile, was back on the pits yesterday. All of the games are being played behind closed doors and stadiums have bunkers in case of air raids. And yesterday's match in the western city of Lviv played on Ukraine's Independence Day -- it was stopped four times after those sirens sounded. Because of those delays, the match lasted nearly 4 1/2 hours instead of the normal 90 minutes. Thankfully, there were no strikes reported in the area.</p><p>All right, and finally, linebacker Shaquem Griffin officially announcing his retirement from the NFL. Griffin was the first player ever to be drafted to the league with just one hand. He had to have his left hand amputated at age four because of a rare birth defect. Griffin played three seasons with the Seahawks.</p><p>He said, guys, he's now on to plan A because football was always plan B. And Omar, the Seahawks and the NFL both saying Griffin, a true inspiration. He certainly was and is.</p><p>JIMENEZ: What a legend. What a legend. Griffin and to you, as well, Andy Scholes. Thanks for being with us.</p><p>SCHOLES: All right.</p><p>ROMANS: All right, to another legend. This fall, students at the University of Texas at Austin getting the chance to take a course on pop songstress Taylor Swift.</p><p>You're listening to Taylor Swift. This course is called Literary Contests and Contexts -- the Taylor Swift songbook.</p><p>[06:00:00]</p><p>ROMANS: Yes, you get college credit for listening to Taylor Swift. This course is called Literary Contests and Contexts. The Taylor Swift Songbook, the school says it'll use her songs to introduce literary critical reading and research methods.</p><p>JIMENEZ: If I took that class, I'll be a better man.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Thanks for joining us. I'm Christine Romans.</p><p>JIMENEZ: And I'm Omar Jimenez. \"NEW DAY\" starts right now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Here we describe an engineered protein fiber that incorporates diverse fluorescent marks during its growth to store a ticker tape-like history. An embedded HaloTag reporter incorporates user-supplied dyes, leading to colored stripes that map the growth of each individual fiber to wall clock time. A co-expressed eGFP tag driven by a promoter of interest records a history of transcriptional activation. High-resolution multi-spectral imaging on fixed samples reads the cellular histories, and interpolation of eGFP marks relative to HaloTag timestamps provides accurate absolute timing. We demonstrate recordings of doxycycline-induced transcription in HEK cells and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">cFos</emphasis> promoter activation in cultured neurons, with a single-cell absolute accuracy of 30\u201340 minutes over a 12-hour recording. The protein-based ticker tape design we present here could be generalized to achieve massively parallel single-cell recordings of diverse physiological modalities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Reporter gene expression history in cells is recorded with engineered fluorescent protein fibers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Main</emphasis>A longstanding goal in biology is to map the dynamics of gene expression throughout a tissue or organism. Such maps could reveal mechanisms of spatial and temporal patterning, for example in brain activity, embryonic development or disease progression. Fluorescent protein-based markers are a powerful tool for mapping gene expression. However, optical imaging of fluorescent reporters faces a tradeoff between temporal and spatial information. Imaging in fixed tissue can report organ-wide patterns of gene expression but typically at only one1,2 or, at most, two3 timepoints. Time-lapse in vivo microscopy can report longitudinal gene expression dynamics4 but only in a small optically accessible region, limited by light-scatter and optical instrumentation, and in vivo imaging typically requires surgery and/or immobilization of the animal. Theoretical analyses have explored the possibility of encoding organ-wide dynamics in DNA or RNA sequences5,6, but, despite progress7, such ideas have not yet been realized. Tools to record the dynamics of large numbers of cells, without constraints from in vivo imaging, could transform our ability to study ensemble dynamics in the nervous system and in other tissues.</p><p>Natural histories are written in the patterns of tooth enamel, the structures of pearls and the thickness of tree rings. The annual bands in tree rings mark the passage of time in a manner that is independent of variations in growth rate between trees or over years. These bands permit one to identify the timing of other events (for example, a forest fire) with absolute chronological accuracy. Inspired by these natural phenomena, we sought to encode cellular histories in protein microcrystals within individual cells. Protein assemblies can last for months or years and offer a wide array of functionalities, which could serve as the basis for recording schemes.</p><p>In this study, we developed a protein-based recording scheme that consists of three elements (Fig. 1a,b). First, a protein scaffold, which grows over time and which can incorporate fluorescent marks. Second, a means to impart fiducial timestamps to relate scaffold growth to the timing of events in the outside world. By marking known timepoints on the fiber, one can correct for inevitable variations in fiber growth rate over time and between cells. Third, a fluorescent reporter of transcriptional activity, which can be stably incorporated into the scaffold. By measuring the position of the activity-driven marks relative to the fiducial timestamps, one can infer the timing of the transcriptional events with a precision substantially better than the timing between the timestamps and insensitive to cell-to-cell variations in growth rate. This procedure could enable recording of transcriptional activity with high absolute timing accuracy on a cell-by-cell basis.Fig. 1</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">iPAK4 forms intracellular protein fibers.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>, Scheme for intracellular recording of cFos activity with fiducial timestamps. iPAK4 forms the fiber scaffold.

All data points are displayed. aa, amino acid.</p><p>For the protein scaffold, our selection criteria were that it should express in mammalian cells, assemble into a growing structure from a single polypeptide, have a known crystal structure, be unlikely to interfere with cellular physiology and accommodate decoration with a fluorescent tag without disrupting the structure of the assembly. We considered many possibilities, including endogenous microtubules, bacterial R-bodies8, plant forisomes9, amyloid fibrils10, prions11, filamentous viruses12, crystals of the fluorescent protein XpA (ref. 13), engineered fiber-forming peptides14 and other proteins that spontaneously crystallize in cells15.</p><p>A fusion of the catalytic domain of the Pak4 kinase and the 38 amino acid iBox domain of its inhibitor Inka1 (hereafter called iPAK4) largely satisfied the selection criteria. This construct has been shown to stably assemble in cells into rod-shaped crystals16. Remarkably, the crystal structure has a hexagonal array of internal pores large enough to accommodate eGFP or a HaloTag (HT), suggesting the possibility of linear encoding of information via patterned fluorescence (Fig. 1c).</p><p>We sought to use a fusion of the HT to iPAK4 to provide fiducial timestamps. We reasoned that washes with different colored HT ligand dyes could create color boundaries whose positions would correspond to known times. Even though HT dye washout in vivo occurs over hours, HT dye injection and labeling have fast onset (&lt;10 minutes in vivo)17, permitting precise demarcation of timestamps by the location of a color transition. A broad palette of bright, photostable and brain-penetrant Janelia Fluor (JF) HT ligand dyes are available, permitting diverse spectral encodings of fiducial timestamps18\u201320.</p><p>The activity reporter should store a stable mark of cellular activity or physiology upon incorporation into the growing fiber. Here we focus on markers of transcriptional activation, although other modalities are conceivable. First, we mapped the kinetics of activation of a synthetic drug-inducible promoter, the Tet-ON system. Then, we mapped the dynamics of an activity-responsive immediate early gene (IEG) in cultured neurons. IEG reporters are a powerful tool for identifying the brain regions and neuronal subtypes activated in a particular context21. For example, the IEG <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">cFos</emphasis> has been used to map neurons activated during feeding22, sleep23, parenting24, aggression25 and memory encoding26. IEG activation is a good target for a ticker tape recording because the relevant dynamics are often broadly distributed throughout the brain26. Motivated by potential applications toward brain-wide activity mapping, we used the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">cFos</emphasis> promoter to drive expression of eGFP-iPAK4 and, thereby, record time series of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">cFos</emphasis> activity.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Results</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">iPAK4 fibers grow linearly in HEK cells</emphasis></p><p>In HEK cells co-transfected with CMV::iPAK4 (95%) and CMV::HT-iPAK4 (5%), fibers began to grow 14\u201320 hours after transfection. Incubation with an HT ligand dye made the fibers brightly fluorescent (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Fig. 1 and Methods). When the fibers grew longer than the cell diameter, the membrane deformed, forming a sheath around the fiber (Supplementary Fig. 1).</p><p>To assess the suitability of iPAK4 fibers as a recording medium, we performed a detailed characterization of their nucleation and growth. We co-expressed CMV::iPAK4 (90%), CMV::eGFP-iPAK4 (5%) and CMV::HT-iPAK4 (5%) in HEK cells using lentiviral transduction and added JF669 to the medium to label the HT. We recorded time-lapse video microscopy over 43 hours, starting 20 hours after transfection (Methods and Supplementary Movie 1), and tracked the growth of individual fibers (Methods and Supplementary Movie 2). Initially, green (eGFP) and red (HT-JF669) fluorescence accumulated in the cytoplasm. Upon nucleation, the fiber growth exhibited two clearly distinct phases. (1) Initially, fibers grew quickly (~0.5 \u03bcm min\u22121) while the cytoplasmic fluorescence dropped. This phase typically lasted ~1 hour. (2) The fibers then transitioned to slower linear growth (Fig. 1e). Although there was substantial cell-to-cell variability in the rate of linear growth, the population-average growth rate did not change over 24 hours after nucleation (Fig. 1f). A simple mass action kinetic model predicted the two-phase growth profiles and quantitatively reproduced the observed growth profiles (Supplementary Calculation 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2).</p><p>We quantified the distribution of fiber growth parameters across the population. The length of fibers at the end of the nucleation phase was 26 \u00b1 7 \u03bcm (mean \u00b1 s.d., <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 46 fibers; Fig. 1g). During the linear growth phase, the growth rate was 1.46 \u00b1 0.64 \u03bcm h\u22121 (mean \u00b1 s.d.; Fig. 1h). Within each cell, the fiber growth rate remained remarkably constant during the linear growth phase. During 24 hours, the fits of the growth profiles to straight lines yielded a population-average R<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">2</emphasis> = 0.97 \u00b1 0.02 (mean \u00b1 s.d.; Fig. 1i). Of the cells that had any fibers, most contained only one (of 333 fiber-containing cells, 288 (86%) contained only one fiber). We ascribe the rarity of multiple fibers per cell to the fact that a single growing fiber maintained the soluble iPAK4 concentration below the nucleation threshold. Anecdotally, multi-fiber cells seemed to arise from cells where a fiber broke, leading to two nuclei.</p><p>Within the population, we observed cell-to-cell variations in the intensities of the eGFP and HT fluorescence signals, presumably due to variations in gene dosage. We did not observe any correlation between the growth rates and these fluorescence levels, indicating that, at the low mole fractions of fluorescent tags used here (approximately 5% for each fluorescent tag), the fluorescent tags did not affect the growth rate (Supplementary Fig. 3).</p><p>We then asked if the iPAK4 fibers affected cell survival, as the fibers often grew longer than the cell diameters (Supplementary Fig. 1). In a live/dead assay, we did not observe a difference in survival between HEK cells expressing iPAK4 fibers and control untransfected HEK cells (iPAK4+: 0.267 \u00b1 0.139% dead cells, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 24 fields of view comprising 89,341 cells; iPAK4\u2212: 0.262 \u00b1 0.107% dead cells, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 24 fields of view comprising 94,202 cells; <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> = 0.90, Student\u2019s <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis>-test; Supplementary Fig. 4). Alhough the stiff fibers deforming the cell membranes looked unusual, simple geometrical estimates showed that the fibers perturbed HEK cell surface area by &lt;15% and volume by &lt;2%, and the predicted fractional perturbations for neurons were even smaller (Supplementary Calculation 2).</p><p>We then tested whether cells containing iPAK4 fibers could divide. In taking time-lapse movies of HEK cells labeled with Hoechst 33342 nuclear stain, we observed occasional cell divisions. The formation of mitotic chromosomes and the process of cell division appeared qualitatively similar in cells with iPAK4 fibers, in cells expressing iPAK4 but without fibers and in non-expressing cells (Supplementary Fig. 5), although the number of mitotic events captured (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 8 divisions in cells containing fibers) was too small for statistical analysis. Possible perturbations to cell division should be assessed separately in any cell type where iPAK4 fibers are used. We note that, for applications in neurons, cell division is not a concern. Together, these results established that iPAK4 fiber growth during the linear growth phase formed a suitable substrate for cellular recordings, provided one could correct for cell-to-cell variations in growth rate.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HT timestamps enable accurate timing in iPAK4 fibers</emphasis></p><p>To test whether fibers could encode HT dye timestamps, we successively washed HEK cells growing HT-iPAK4 fibers with different colors of HT ligand dyes at \u0394<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> = 2-hour intervals in the sequence JF503, JF669, JFX608, JF503 and JF669 (Fig. 2a; see Supplementary Fig. 6 for dye structures, photophysical properties and synthesis of JFX608). We then fixed the cells and imaged them with spectrally resolved confocal microscopy (Methods). We observed clear progression of colored bands matching the sequence of dye additions. The bands followed mirror-image patterns on opposite sides of the fibers, indicating that the fibers grew from both ends (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 7).Fig. 2</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">iPAK4 fibers can be sequentially labeled with different dyes.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>, Scheme for multi-color labeling of intracellular iPAK4 fibers. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>, Images of iPAK4 fibers labeled with four dye transitions on each end.

Scale bar, 5 \u03bcm. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">e</emphasis>, Comparison of dye transition points on the faster-growing and slower-growing fiber ends. The scatter plot shows the positions of the JFX608, JF503 and JF669 transitions normalized relative to the first JF669 addition (at position 0) and the end of the fiber (at position 1). The plots show the mean fluorescence profiles of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 17 fibers. Here, the number of fibers was set by the requirement for in-focus, unobstructed views of both ends of the fibers. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">f</emphasis>, Mean fluorescence profiles of fibers exposed to the same sequence of dyes and then grown for different amounts of time (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 22 fixed at 8 hours, 12 fixed at 30 hours). The overlap of these profiles indicates negligible monomer exchange over 22 hours.</p><p>To test the limits of how fast we could encode dye transitions, we made fibers with seven dye switches at \u0394<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> = 1 hour. Although peaks were still visible at this short interval, their amplitude was suppressed relative to the parts of the fiber with no dye switches, indicating incomplete transitions in dye labeling (Supplementary Fig. 7e). Analysis of the dye profiles for more widely spaced dye transitions indicated a half-life of soluble HT-iPAK4 of 4.5 hours (Supplementary Fig. 8a), explaining the loss of signal at faster dye switches. These results indicated that fiducial timestamps should be separated by at least \u0394<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> = 2 hours.</p><p>Dye additions appeared as upward-going kinks in the fluorescence profiles (Supplementary Fig. 8a), which we located as peaks in the second derivative of fluorescence version position (Methods). By dividing the transition zone widths (full-width at half-maximum of the peak in the second derivative) by the fiber-specific growth rates, we calculated a mean transition zone duration of 7.5 minutes (Supplementary Fig. 8a).</p><p>To determine the influence of HT dye labeling kinetics on the widths of these transitions, we measured the labeling of intracellular HT receptors with different HT dyes (Methods). These measurements probed the combined effects of membrane permeation and the HT reaction. The effective time constants at 1 \u03bcM dye were: 43 minutes (JF503), 3.5 minutes (JF525), 2.0 minutes (JF552), 12 minutes (JFX608) and 17 minutes (JF669) (Supplementary Fig. 8). The precision of localizing a dye transition in a fiber is not equal to the labeling time constant but, rather, the precision with which one can identify the onset of the labeling reaction. For all the JF dyes, this time was much less than 10 minutes. Together, these results established that HT dye transitions provided a means to timestamp iPAK4 fiber growth with a local precision (that is, around the time of a timestamp) of ~10 minutes or better.</p><p>Due to the P63 symmetry of the iPAK4 crystal structure16, the two ends are not chemically equivalent and need not have the same growth rate. However, the asymmetry in growth rate was modest: the growth rate on the slower-growing end was 0.77 \u00b1 0.05 (95% confidence interval (CI)) of the growth rate on the faster-growing end (Fig. 2c). We then compared the fluorescence profiles on the two ends. To account for the difference in growth rate between the fiber ends, we mapped the first dye addition (JF669 at <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> = 0) to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">x</emphasis> = 0 and the end of the fiber (fixation at <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> = 8 hours) to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">x</emphasis> = 1. After normalizing the spatial scales, the fast-growing and slow-growing fiber ends showed very similar profiles (Fig. 2d).</p><p>To test whether both fiber ends could be useful for recording fiducial timestamps, we analyzed the locations of the dye transitions on both ends of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 17 fibers. For both the faster-growing and slower-growing ends, the normalized locations of dye transitions at <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> = 2, 4 and 6 hours mapped linearly onto position between the first dye addition (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> = 0) and the end of the fiber (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> = 8 hours) (Fig. 2e). The standard deviations in the inferred timing (averaging over the three transitions) were 18.3 minutes on the fast end and 24.8 minutes on the slow end. Together, these results established that both ends of the fibers could record fiducial timestamps with an absolute accuracy of better than 25 minutes over an 8-hour baseline.</p><p>If the residual errors in timing were driven by a factor shared by the two fiber ends (for example, variations in iPAK4 expression level), then these errors would lie primarily along the diagonal line Position 1 = Position 2 in Fig. 2e. We calculated the cross-correlation in the timing errors between the two fiber ends and averaged over all transitions (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> = 2, 4 and 6 hours) and all fibers. This cross-correlation was only 0.32, implying that dynamic fluctuations in growth rate were primarily driven by factors local to each end. In principle, timing precision could be improved by averaging measurements on the two fiber ends, but we found that, often, the image quality was better on one end than the other because of differences in the focal plane or the presence of out-of-focus fibers. Consequently, we typically analyzed only one fiber end per cell, and we did not attempt to distinguish between the faster-growing and slower-growing ends.</p><p>A protein ticker tape should stably store its information for extended times. Because the iPAK4 fibers were held together by non-covalent interactions, we tested whether monomer exchange blurred the HT dye boundaries over time. Two dishes were exposed to the same sequence of dye switches at intervals of \u0394<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> = 2 hours. One dish was fixed at <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> = 8 hours, and the other was returned to the incubator and fixed 1 day later at <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> = 30 hours. We then compared the fluorescence profiles for the section of the fibers that grew concurrently (from <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> = 0 to 8 hours). The mean profiles were nearly indistinguishable between the early dish (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 22 fibers) and the late dish (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 12 fibers) (Fig. 2f). Thus, monomer exchange was negligible over 1 day.</p><p>We next studied the precision with which the timing of cellular events could be identified. If each fiber end grew at a constant rate, the timing of cellular events could be linearly interpolated between timestamps with a precision far greater than the interval between the timestamps. However, fluctuations in the growth rate might degrade the precision. To determine the precision empirically, we incubated fibers in JF525 and then switched to JF669 at <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> = 0. In different dishes, we doped in the dye JFX608 at <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> = 2, 4, 6, 7, 8 or 9 hours to simulate the onset of a cellular event. Finally, we switched back to JF525 at <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> = 10 hours, grew the fibers for another 10 hours and fixed the dishes at <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> = 20 hours (Fig. 3a). Low-magnification images showed clear stripes in most fibers, corresponding to the timestamps and the addition of JFX608 (Fig. 3b).Fig. 3</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">iPAK4 fibers report timing of intracellular events.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>, Experimental design for testing the precision with which addition of JFX608 could be determined relative to timestamps from addition of JF669 (at <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> = 0) and JF525 (at <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> = 10 hours). <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>, Low-magnification (left) and magnified (right) images of iPAK4 fibers in HEK cells.

All data points are displayed.</p><p>Visual inspection of the fibers with JFX608 addition at different timepoints showed clear onset of yellow staining at the corresponding positions along the red band (Fig. 3c). We quantified the three-color fluorescence profiles of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 223 fibers (20\u201351 fibers per timepoint of JFX608 addition) and identified the locations of the three dye additions (JF669, JFX608 and JF525). As above, we mapped each fluorescence trace so that the first and third dye additions occurred at <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">x</emphasis> = 0 and 1, respectively (Fig. 3d).</p><p>The mean traces clearly showed the time-dependent onset of JFX608 fluorescence, which was also evident in low-magnification images of the fiber population (Supplementary Fig. 9). We then quantified the distributions of JFX608 onset. The distribution linearly mapped dye addition time to normalized position between 0 and 1 (Fig. 3e). Mapping the standard deviation of JFX608 labeling onset onto the 10-hour time axis yielded single-fiber precisions between 25 and 51 minutes (Fig. 3e). The precision was greatest near the fiducial points at <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> = 0 and 10 hours and lowest in the middle of the trajectory. This observation established that the uncertainty in JFX608 timing was dominated by intracellular fluctuations in the fiber growth rate, as opposed to errors in locating the JFX608 transition points, because localization errors would be statistically similar anywhere along the fiber. Thus, to achieve the greatest temporal precision for detecting an event, one should deposit a fiducial timestamp near the candidate event.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Time-tagged iPAK4 fibers record dynamics of gene expression</emphasis></p><p>As the first test of a physiological recording, we used iPAK4 fibers to report on a transcriptional activator, the tetracycline-mediated Tet-ON transcription system27.

After fibers had nucleated (24 hours after lentiviral infection), we added JF552 to label the initial nuclei and then switched to JF669 at <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> = 0. In different dishes, we added doxycycline (DOX, 2 \u03bcg ml\u22121) at <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> = 2, 4 or 6 hours to activate expression of eGFP-iPAK4. Then, we switched back to JF552 at <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> = 8 hours and grew the fibers for another 8\u201314 hours before fixation and imaging (Fig. 4b).Fig. 4</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Protein ticker tape recordings of DOX activation of the Tet-ON system in HEK cells.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>, Genetic constructs for recording time-tagged transcription activation. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>, Experimental protocol for recording time-tagged transcription activation.

All data points are displayed.</p><p>DOX addition led to formation of green bands in the fibers, with onset at positions linearly related to DOX addition time (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 191 fibers; Fig. 4c,d). Based on the fiber-to-fiber variations in the positions of the green onsets, we inferred an absolute timing accuracy of 30\u201340 minutes over an 8-hour baseline. A linear fit to the band positions yielded an apparent offset of 1.2 hours between DOX addition and the start of the green stripe. We ascribe this delay to the time required for transcription, translation and protein folding. Similar experiments where cells were exposed to a 30-minute pulse of DOX caused eGFP-iPAK4 expression to rise for approximately 8 hours and then fall, leading to a ~14-hour window of protein expression (Supplementary Fig. 10). These experiments demonstrate that the iPAK4 ticker tape system can quantify the dynamics of promoter activity in single cells.</p><p>The Tet-ON system also provides a means to control the onset of iPAK4 nucleation, allowing a separation between gene delivery and the start of a recording. We co-expressed CMV::rtTA3 (30%), TRE::iPAK4 (65%) and TRE::eGFP-iPAK4 (5%) in HEK cells using lentiviral transduction and added DOX after 7 days (Supplementary Fig. 11). In the first 7 days, we observed negligible eGFP signal, indicating minimal background expression of the Tet-ON system. After DOX addition, iPAK4 fibers were observed starting on day 8, with clear elongation of the fibers over the following day. Inducible ticker tape expression could be a powerful tool for defining recording windows to coincide with specific experimental perturbations.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Time-tagged iPAK4 fibers record neural activation</emphasis></p><p>Finally, we tested the ability of iPAK4 ticker tapes to report activation of the IEG <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">cFos</emphasis> promoter in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. To establish iPAK4 fiber recordings in neurons, we first verified that (1) the fibers grew linearly in neurons; (2) a dye switch introduced fiducial timestamps in neurons; and (3) the fibers did not introduce cytotoxicity or changes to neuronal electrophysiology.</p><p>To characterize fiber growth in neurons, we performed time-lapse imaging over 33 hours in a primary neuron culture lentivirally infected with CMV::iPAK4 (90%) and CMV::HT-iPAK4 (10%) (Supplementary Movie 4). Fibers of iPAK4 nucleated and grew in neurons following a similar trajectory to in HEK cells, comprising a fast-growing nucleation phase followed by slower linear growth (Supplementary Fig. 12 and Supplementary Movie 5). We occasionally observed fibers stall for a few hours or sometimes stop growing altogether. Stalled fibers were flagged by requiring a mean growth rate of &gt;0.8 \u00b5m h\u22121. This excluded 11 of 33 tracked fibers (33%). A key point is that the growth rate threshold could be applied based on a single terminal measurement of fiber length and, thus, did not require time-lapse imaging.</p><p>Of the fibers that passed the growth rate criterion, the fiber length at onset of linear growth was 31 \u00b1 12 \u03bcm (mean \u00b1 s.d., <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 22 fibers). The growth rate in the linear phase was 2.5 \u00b1 1.5 \u03bcm h\u22121. During the linear growth phase, the fit to a straight-line growth profile had a mean R2 = 0.95 \u00b1 0.04, over a 24-hour interval. Of the neurons that had fibers, most (73%) had only one fiber, although many neurons did not have fibers nucleated at the time of the recording (Supplementary Fig. 13). We also performed dye switch experiments in neurons and confirmed the ability of switches in HT dye labeling to impart fiducial timestamps on HT-iPAK4 fibers in neurons (Supplementary Figs. 14 and 15).</p><p>To test for effects of iPAK4 fibers on neuronal survival, we lentivirally expressed iPAK4 (95%) and HT-iPAK4 (5%) in cultured neurons, allowed the fibers to grow for 6 days and then performed a live/dead assay (Supplementary Fig. 16). There was no significant difference in the fraction of dead cells between dishes expressing iPAK4 fibers and dishes not infected with any lentivirus. The iPAK4-expressing neurons had typical soma and neurite structures, similar to those observed in healthy neurons.</p><p>We then tested whether iPAK4 fibers affected neuronal electrophysiology. Neurons infected with lentivirus containing payloads CMV::iPAK4 (90%) and CMV::eGFP-iPAK4 (10%) grew single straight fibers (Fig. 5a). We used patch-clamp recordings to compare the electrophysiology of neurons with and without fibers. Although, in many cases, the fiber length was several times longer than the soma diameter, neurons with fibers spiked normally (Fig. 5b) and had membrane resistance, membrane capacitance, resting potential and rheobase, which were statistically indistinguishable from neurons without fibers (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 11 neurons with fibers and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 12 neurons without, two-sided Student\u2019s <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis>-test; Fig. 5c).Fig. 5</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Protein ticker tape recordings of cFos activation in neurons.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>, Image of a cultured neuron expressing lentiviral CMV::iPAK4 (90%) and CMV::eGFP-iPAK4 (10%).

NS, not significant.</p><p>In neurons co-expressing CMV::iPAK4 (90%) and cFos::eGFP-iPAK4 (10%), fibers initially grew with little green fluorescence. Addition of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 1 \u03bcM), an activator of cFos expression28, led to bands of bright green fluorescence (Supplementary Fig. 8). Sequential additions of PMA to a single dish led to distinct bands of eGFP fluorescence, clearly resolved by sharp eGFP boundaries (Fig. 5d).</p><p>To measure timing of cFos activation relative to fiducial timestamps, we co-expressed CMV::iPAK4 (80%), CMV::HT-iPAK4 (10%), and cFos::eGFP-iPAK4 (10%) (Fig. 5e). We stained the neurons with JF552 and then switched to JF669 at <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> = 0. We then added PMA (1 \u03bcM) at <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> = 3, 6 or 9 hours and introduced a second fiducial timestamp by switching back to JF552 at <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> = 12 hours. Fibers were grown until <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> = 22 hours and then fixed and imaged (Fig. 5f).</p><p>We observed clear green bands, indicating cFos-driven expression of eGFP-iPAK4. To infer an onset time for each band, we mapped the onset of eGFP fluorescence relative to the two dye switches. The slope of the plot of inferred eGFP onset time versus nominal PMA addition time was 0.98 \u00b1 0.10 (mean \u00b1 95% CI, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 34 fibers at 3 hours, 32 fibers at 6 hours and 40 fibers at 9 hours). Extrapolating this fit to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> = 0 implied that eGFP onset was delayed by 53 minutes relative to the timing of PMA addition (Fig. 5h). We interpret this delay as the time for PMA to activate the cFos promoter plus delays of transcription, translation and protein folding of eGFP-iPAK4. The standard deviations in the inferred eGFP onset times were 34 minutes (3 hours), 50 minutes (6 hours) and 34 minutes (9 hours), implying an average absolute timing accuracy of 39 minutes over a measurement with 12 hours between fiducial timestamps.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Discussion</emphasis></p><p>Slowly growing protein assemblies are a promising substrate for massively parallel cellular recordings. Our recording strategy relies on three key elements: a protein scaffold, a means to impart fiducial timestamps and a fluorescent reporter of cellular activity, which is irreversibly incorporated into the scaffold during growth. Here, we validated the system with externally applied perturbations (drug-induced gene expression), which led to synchronous population-wide responses; but, in principle, the system is also capable of recording spontaneous or asynchronous activation of reporter genes.</p><p>The fiducial timestamps are a particularly important conceptual and practical aspect of our approach. Timestamps permit detection, and in some cases correction, of many sources of variability that could otherwise confound the recordings. Here, we used the timestamps to correct for cell-to-cell variations in the linear-phase growth rate via a simple linear interpolation scheme. The timestamps could also flag individual cells in which there were substantial fluctuations in growth rate during a recording. These would manifest as distinct stripes having widths out of proportion to the corresponding dye incubation times. The timestamps could also flag fibers that nucleated after the first dye switch: such fibers would have their central portion tagged with a mixture of dyes instead of solely with the first dye. Fibers that fractured or aggregated would have timestamps that deviated from the anticipated color order. Thus, the timestamps provide a robust means of calibration and quality control within each cell.</p><p>There are opportunities to broaden and improve upon our approach regarding each of the three key elements: the scaffold, the timestamps and the physiological signal. For applications in vivo, the most critical need is to modify the scaffold so that it does not deform the cells. One approach is to engineer thinner fibers, either by modifying the iPAK4 scaffold to enhance the ratio of axial to radial growth or by using a different fiber-forming protein scaffold14. Thinner fibers would undergo Euler buckling at the cell membrane rather than deforming the cell, although, if the fiber becomes so thin that the thermal persistence length is smaller than a few microns, optical tracking of the fiber backbone could be difficult. Alternatively, one could explore alternate ticker tape geometries, such as helical aggregates (thereby achieving a ratio of contour length to axial length that exceeds 1) or spherical onion-type aggregates.</p><p>A second improvement to the scaffolds would be to decrease the ratio between the soluble iPAK4 concentration at fiber nucleation, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">C</emphasis>nuc, and the concentration during steady-state growth, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">C</emphasis>SS. Fits to the simple kinetic model of fiber growth (Supplementary Fig. 2) suggest that this ratio is currently ~100. Consequences of this high ratio are that (1) there is a highly variable delay of approximately 12 hours between onset of iPAK4 transcription and fiber nucleation, and (2) the fibers undergo a period of fast and non-linear growth during the first ~hour after nucleation (Fig. 1e). On the other hand, to ensure that most cells contain only a single fiber, one wants <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">C</emphasis>nuc/<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">C</emphasis>SS &gt; 1. Thus, a protein engineering goal is to make this ratio slightly larger than 1.</p><p>Cultured neurons could sustain iPAK4 fiber growth for at least 6 days (Supplementary Fig. 16), suggesting the possibility of multi-day recordings. To tune the dynamic range of ticker tape recordings, one would like small-molecule or light-induced control over the onset and rate of ticker tape scaffold growth. Putting the iPAK4 scaffold under control of the Tet-ON system gave control over the onset of fiber growth (Supplementary Fig. 11). However, the slow transcriptional response to changes in DOX concentration (Supplementary Fig. 10), together with the high ratio of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">C</emphasis>nuc/<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">C</emphasis>SS, meant that subsequent tuning of the growth rate by DOX concentration was not feasible by this approach. Achieving control over the rate of fiber growth would require either lowering <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">C</emphasis>nuc/<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">C</emphasis>SS or developing alternate means of regulating protein assembly into the fiber, for example by pharmacological or optical regulation of protein stability29 or of protein\u2013protein interactions. Finally, one may want to express both the iPAK4 and the HT-iPAK4 from a single vector, either by making use of endogenous RNA splicing machinery or by applying a partially effective self-cleaving peptide.</p><p>At present, the spacing of the fiducial timestamps is constrained to ~2 hours by the ~4.5-hour half-life of soluble HT-iPAK4. If one could shorten this half-life, one could place timestamps closer together and, thereby, achieve greater absolute timing accuracy. One might shorten the half-life of the soluble HT-iPAK4 by attaching ubiquitination domains or other tags to facilitate proteolytic turnover of the soluble subunits30. Alternatively, one might consider a variety of optogenetic caging strategies to reversibly control the availability of timestamp monomers31. Optogenetic modulation of protein availability can occur over seconds, suggesting the possibility to introduce extremely precise fiducial timestamps.</p><p>Finally, the modular design of iPAK4 fibers could be adapted to accommodate diverse recording modalities. A simple generalization of the present results would be to record the simultaneous dynamics of multiple promoters by using each to drive expression of iPAK4 fused to a spectrally distinct fluorescent protein. There also exist diverse fluorescent reporters of covalent enzymatic modifications, for example of kinase, phosphatase or protease activity32,33. Such reporters are likely protected from enzymatic modification within the fiber and, thereby, might be a means to record the state of the cell at the moment of incorporation into the fiber.</p><p>A related protein-based recording technique was introduced concurrent with our work, termed expression recording islands (XRIs)34. The primary conceptual difference between the XRIs and our time-tagged ticker tapes is that our HT-based timestamps give our ticker tapes an absolute time base in each single cell.</p><p>Despite the broad scope for improvements on the existing ticker tape system, we think that these tools are already suitable for applications in vitro. For instance, they could be used to map transcriptional dynamics during stem cell differentiation, in in vitro tumor models or in diverse organoid models. In each new cellular preparation, it will be critical to test whether expression of iPAK4 fibers perturbs the physiological dynamics of interest. The introduction of protein-based ticker tapes in our work and the XRIs in the companion paper34 should spur diverse efforts on improving and applying these tools.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methods</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cloning and molecular biology</emphasis></p><p>All iPAK4 constructs were cloned into a second-generation lentiviral backbone (Addgene, 136636) with either a cytomegalovirus (CMV) or a cFos promoter (Addgene, 47907) using standard Gibson assembly36.

Lambda scan mode was used to image fibers with multi-color labeling. The excitation laser wavelengths were 488 nm (eGFP, JF503 and JF525), 561 nm (JF552 and JFX608) and 639 nm (JF669). In each Lambda scan, 32 channels in the range of 414\u2013688 nm were simultaneously acquired to obtain a hyper-spectral stack of images.

Images of individual fibers were rotated to align the long axis to the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">x</emphasis>-axis. Fluorescence profiles were then calculated as the median fluorescence in each spectral channel across the width of the fiber. Fibers that were not in focus or where two or more fibers crossed each other near a dye transition were excluded from analysis. Dye transitions were identified as local maxima in the second derivative of the dye fluorescence as a function of position. To avoid spurious peaks due to noise, the second derivative signal was smoothed with a kernel of typically 10 minutes, although this smoothing was omitted when calculating the width of the dye transition (Supplementary Fig. 3a).</p><p>For tracking fibers during time-lapse recordings, a region of interest (ROI) was manually defined on a maximum intensity projection of the image stack, to select individual fibers and to encompass the entire fiber in all frames of the movie. A Radon transform was then calculated on the selected ROI for each video frame. The peak of the Radon transform was associated with the fiber. The corresponding line in the real-space movie was used to calculate the fiber intensity profile. Nearby parallel lines on either side of the fiber were averaged and used for background subtraction. The fiber ends were then found by applying a simple threshold to the plot of fluorescence versus position. The fluorescence of the cytoplasm was determined by summing the intensity from pixels that were on-cell but off-fiber. Fiber length trajectories were median filtered (kernel = 1 hour) to suppress small, high-frequency fluctuations caused by segmentation noise.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Statistics and reproducibility</emphasis></p><p>All statistical tests performed are specified in the figure legends.
