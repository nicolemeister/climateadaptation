These airports also provide essential air services, more so during this Covid-19 pandemic, including community resupply, air ambulance, search and rescue, and forest fire response.</p><p>The Honourable Jim Carr, Minister and Special Representative for the Prairies, on behalf of the Minister of Transport, the Honourable Omar Alghabra, today announced that the Government of Canada is making important safety investments at airports in Alberta.</p><p>Through Transport Canada's Airports Capital Assistance Program (ACAP), the Government of Canada will provide over $20 million to the following Alberta airports for safety-related projects:</p><p>Fort Chipewyan</p><p>* Rehabilitation of airside pavement - $11,021,416</p><p>Grande Prairie</p><p>* Replacement of generator and airport signage - $612,871</p><p>* Replacement of sand storage shed - $134,680</p><p>Lethbridge</p><p>* Rehabilitation of airfield pavement - $7,379,719</p><p>Lloydminster</p><p>* Purchase of a de-icing trailer - $105,000</p><p>Medicine Hat</p><p>* Rehabilitation of airfield electrical system - $957,241</p><p>For 2021-2022, Transport Canada has allocated ACAP funding to 63 airports for 86 safety-related projects, including runway and taxiway repairs/rehabilitation, lighting enhancements, purchasing snow clearing equipment and firefighting vehicles and installing wildlife fencing.</p><p>Since the Airports Capital Assistance Program started in 1995, the Government of Canada has invested over $1.1 billion for 1,088 projects at 199 airports across the country.</p><p>Quotes</p><p>\"We know how vital airports are to urban centres and remote communities. The investment our government is making will help ensure continued safe and reliable airport operations for residents, many of whom depend on their local airports not only for personal travel and business, but also for community resupply of essential goods and access to routine and emergency medical care in larger centres. This is part of how we build stronger more resilient and inclusive communities across Canada.\"</p><p>The Honourable Jim Carr, Minister and Special Representative for the Prairies</p><p>\"Our Government recognizes that airports are major contributors to the economic growth and social well-being of smaller communities, and local airport workers. In addition to supporting personal travel, local airports are key connectors for business, health care, social services, and emerging resource development sectors. These investments will improve access to safe, reliable and efficient air transportation options, and will help us deliver our promise to build safer, healthier and stronger communities across Canada. This is more important than ever as we work towards reopening our economies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\"</p><p>The Honourable Omar Alghabra, Minister of Transport</p><p>Quick facts</p><p>* As announced in the Fall Economic Statement (FES) 2020, the Airports Capital Assistance Program received a one-time funding top-up of $186 million over two years.</p><p>* As well, the FES announced the temporary expansion of eligibility for the Airports Capital Assistance Program to allow National Airport System (NAS) airports with less than one million annual passengers in 2019 to apply for funding under the Program in 2021-2022 and 2022-2023.</p><p>* The eligible NAS airports are: Gander; Charlottetown; Saint John; Fredericton; Moncton; Thunder Bay; London; and Prince George.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7488059 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7488059</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62R0-MS21-DYG2-R18R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"603\"/><timeReceived>9:20 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 20, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Firefighters start a back burn. When the raging forest fire reaches the burned over forest, it peters out because there is nothing left to burn. This is all well and good, except: Would I be willing to have trees that I own sacrificed to protect a forest owned by others? Would I be willing to let my mother die so that strangers I do not know could be spared from being infected during a pandemic? It is one thing to think of sacrificing property for the greater good; it is another to consider sacrificing human lives. In the case of controlling a forest fire, the loss of a few trees to preserve many trees seems reasonable. When the same reasoning is applied to human lives, it seems cold, calculating and cynical. When a pandemic can be prevented by wearing masks and practicing social distancing, resorting to herd immunity is unconscionable.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Charles Chamberlain,</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Spring Hill</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thanks Rudy</emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2020/12/07/lawmakers-who-met-with-giuliani-scramble-after-coronavirus-diagnosis/\">Lawmakers who met with Giuliani scramble after coronavirus diagnosis | Dec. 7</url></p><p>I'd like to thank Rudy Giuliani, his team, and the gang of Republican lawmakers who have fought so hard in the courts, for proving beyond a shadow of doubt that Joe Biden won the election.

All these have been proven deceitful.</p><p>Democrat Stacey Abrams claimed the state of Georgia stole her gubernatorial effort by a rigged election in 2018. Progressive minded people support that accusation and continue to speak of Ms. Abrams as the wrongfully ignored \"Governor\" of Georgia. Progressives have verbally attacked President Trump for being authoritarian and even likened him to a Nazi. These same people are outraged that Gov. Ron DeSantis and the state legislature haven't instituted a police state with draconian, unconstitutional measures to counter the COVID-19 virus.

In the last 50 years, human activity has killed off two-thirds of the planet's wildlife. Let's not pretend upbeat newspaper columns will turn this around.

For $234 million, we get an additional 1.3 miles of track and modernization of the existing 2.7 miles for a total of 5 miles of public transportation on a failed project that does not service people that need public transportation the most.</p><p>We are going to spend this ridiculous amount of money on transportation that benefit a few, while our roads are flooding, filled with pot holes and traffic is terrible due to lack of infrastructure.

The 2019-2020 disaster was unprecedented in scale. The Gospers Mountain fire north of Sydney was the largest forest fire ever recorded in Australia, burning more than 500,000 hectares.</p><p>More aggressive hazard reduction, or controlled burn-offs that can reduce the severity of future bushfires, would make Australia safer, according to an independent panel.</p><p>However, previous research has shown that as conditions get hotter and drier, it becomes less effective. But the report wants landowners in high-risk areas to increase prescribed burning. It also said that climate change was one of many factors that made last summer \"so extraordinary\". The fires were fueled by record-breaking temperatures and a long drought across southern and eastern Australia.</p><p>New South Wales state premier Gladys Berejiklian says global warming is making the country more vulnerable.</p><p>\"The next fire season is already upon us, so the government has taken every action we can already in response to the recommendations that we received. We do also have to also accept that in addition to the issues that have been canvassed this morning, our climate is changing and those who wrote the report actually acknowledge that our climate is changing,\" Berejiklian said.</p><p>The New South Wales state government has accepted each of the panel's 76 recommendations.</p><p>The report has called for more scientific research into fighting fires, including the use of artificial intelligence and drones to help put them out quickly. It said the answer was not more fire trucks or firefighters.</p><p>Critics of the inquiry have reportedly said it was lackluster and contained no significant recommendations.</p><p>The Black Summer fires killed more than 30 people and destroyed thousands of homes.</p><p>For the first time ever catastrophic fire conditions had been forecast for Australia's biggest city, Sydney.</p><p>Ominously, the panel warned that Australia should expect to see similar conditions, or worse, to happen again.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123906608</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60P3-3K51-JCBF-S286-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"379\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 25, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

I believe my big brother. <br/><br/>In March 2020, as the Covid-19 pandemic was spreading and lockdowns were being imposed, I asked Steven to join me on the Vermont Conversation to share publicly what he was telling me privately about this novel virus. While President Trump assured us that the coronavirus would'miraculously go away'[5]with the arrival of warm weather, Steven warned that what was coming would be'an impending catastrophe.'[6]He explained the cold calculus of exponential growth and accurately predicted the calamity that soon unfolded. <br/><br/>Steven Goodman, M.D., MHS, Ph.D., is an associate dean at Stanford Medical School, where he is also a professor of epidemiology and population health and of medicine. <br/><br/>Today, a fourth wave of Covid-19 is sweeping the country, driven by the highly transmissible Delta variant. While vaccinated Americans are cautiously savoring a return to normalcy, a'pandemic of the unvaccinated'[7]is raging, as nearly all new deaths are among the unvaccinated. Yet Republican leaders and right-wing media are churning out vaccine disinformation, resulting invaccination rates of under 35 percent[8]in some states. This large reservoir of unvaccinated people will inevitably become everyone's problem. <br/><br/>'We're all connected,' Steven says on The Vermont Conversation. 'As large portions of major states go unvaccinated, they will become the factory for infections even among vaccinated people. We're not immune to the effects of other states and other people who've chosen not to be vaccinated.' Unvaccinated communities 'turn into virtual waterfalls of mutations and spread of the virus. We're going to see far less virus in the highly vaccinated populations than if they weren't vaccinated but at the same time we'll see far higher rates in those areas than if there weren't states that were producing this waterfall of cases.' <br/><br/>Covid-19 remains a major threat around the country and the world, Steven insists. 'This is still very much a pandemic \u2014 the phrase 'post-pandemic' should be banned. [Covid-19] is raging like an intense forest fire across this globe. There are whole countries and whole continents that are absolutely unprepared for the devastation that is about to be wrought.' <br/><br/> Read the story on VTDigger here: Vermont Conversation: We're not done with Covid-19[9]. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://vtdigger.org/tag/vermont-conversation/\">https://vtdigger.org/tag/vermont-conversation/</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-vermont-conversation-with-david-goodman-podcast/id1182144448\">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-vermont-conversation-with-david-goodman-podcast/id1182144448</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly92ZXJtb250Y29udmVyc2F0aW9uLmNvbS9mZWVkLw\">https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly92ZXJtb250Y29udmVyc2F0aW9uLmNvbS9mZWVkLw</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/5DDHyNnmYe1BPg78T0Lfac?si=4Mt71pDTRee856Wcmx_LPQ\">https://open.spotify.com/show/5DDHyNnmYe1BPg78T0Lfac?si=4Mt71pDTRee856Wcmx_LPQ</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/02/donald-trump-coronavirus-warm-weather\">https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/02/donald-trump-coronavirus-warm-weather</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://vtdigger.org/2020/07/22/david-goodman-a-qa-with-epidemiologist-dr-steven-goodman/\">https://vtdigger.org/2020/07/22/david-goodman-a-qa-with-epidemiologist-dr-steven-goodman/</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-cases-deaths-infections-vaccines-abbce96a-3e31-459e-a09f-41d88bb0f749.html\">https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-cases-deaths-infections-vaccines-abbce96a-3e31-459e-a09f-41d88bb0f749.html</url> [ 8]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/12/health/us-coronavirus-monday/index.html\">https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/12/health/us-coronavirus-monday/index.html</url> [ 9]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://vtdigger.org/2021/07/21/vermont-conversation-were-not-done-with-covid-19/\">https://vtdigger.org/2021/07/21/vermont-conversation-were-not-done-with-covid-19/</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-VTDG127906162690154624325879100225</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IVNN-127906</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:636C-3RR1-F03R-N18R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484298</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"633\"/><timeReceived>9:05 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>VTDigger</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 21, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The tower is a 59-foot, three-inch tall International Derrick tower, originally erected in 1934 by the Civilian Conservation Corps for fire protection. The viewshed from the fire tower stretches across Broome, Cortland, Delaware, Madison, Oneida, Onondaga, Otsego, and Tioga counties.</p><p>The upgrades were supported by $125,000 from NY Works and include projects to improve accessibility and restore the tower to enhance safety and recreation opportunities. Site upgrades include resurfaced driveway and parking areas; accessible stone dust path from the upper parking area to the base of the tower; accessible picnic table, bench, and informational kiosk; new roof and renovated porch and siding on the observer cabin; and removal of all communications equipment. Upgrades to the tower's exterior include new stairwell safety fencing, new metal grate treads and wooden landings on the stairwell, and new paint on the entire tower. Interior tower cab upgrades include a new entrance hatch and wooden floor, renovated map table, and all new windows.</p><p>For nearly a century, observers watched the forests of New York State from more than 100 fire towers perched atop the highest peaks, searching for the first signs of fire to report to Forest Rangers by phone. In the early 1970s, the state began using air surveillance to monitor fires. Fire towers were phased out beginning in the 1980s, and over time, the towers and their associated observers' cabins began to deteriorate. The towers were either dismantled or closed to the public for safety. Today, volunteer-based initiatives across the state are working to help protect New York's fire towers. These initiatives recognize that the towers represent the state's history and heritage of forest protection and are a resource with the potential to attract visitors.</p><p>Berry Hill fire tower served as an active fire look-out station until the end of the 1988 season. In 1993, it was placed on the National Historic Lookout Register (US#54). The 1999 McDonough State Forest Unit Management Plan identified an objective of rehabilitating the fire tower to allow for public access. Before making the structural improvements, it was necessary to remove and relocate communications equipment from the fire tower.</p><p>Through an agreement with DEC, the New York State Chapter of the Forest Fire Lookout Association will provide volunteer stewardship services at Berry Hill. Volunteers will help maintain the facility and provide educational information to visitors. On days when a steward is on-site, motor vehicle access to the upper parking area may be permitted and the observer cabin will be open for visitation. The site also features an information kiosk, bench, and picnic table for visitors to enjoy. Off-road parking is available for approximately eight vehicles at the base of the fire tower's driveway. The driveway is about 1,000 feet long and open for pedestrian access with a moderate uphill climb.

Forest Service has lifted a ban on all open burning for the following counties in western North Carolina: Alexander, Alleghany, Ashe, Avery, Buncombe, Burke, Cabarrus, Caldwell, Catawba, Cherokee, Clay, Cleveland, Gaston, Graham, Haywood, Henderson, Iredell, Jackson, Lincoln, Macon, Madison, McDowell, Mecklenburg, Mitchell, Polk, Rutherford, Swain, Transylvania, Union, Watauga, Wilkes and Yancey. The burn ban went into effect on April 3 due to hazardous forest fire conditions in the area.</p><p>While burn permits are now available in those counties, N.C. Forest Service officials continue to urge residents to reconsider burning yard debris through the end of May as careless debris burning is the leading cause of wildfires in North Carolina.</p><p>Recent rainfall across the state, especially in our western counties, has helped with dry conditions, but it is important to remember that we are still in the midst of spring wildfire season and the COVID-19 pandemic, said Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler. Preventing escaped debris burns is something each of us can do to protect our communities and our first responders.</p><p>At this time, burn permits are being issued online only while NCFS office locations remain temporarily closed to the public due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The online burn permit system is available statewide. All burn permits previously granted for the 32 counties affected by this burn ban were canceled when the ban became effective. New burn permit applications must be submitted online at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ncforestservice.gov/burnpermit\">www.ncforestservice.gov/burnpermit</url>.</p><p>Residents with questions regarding their specific county can contact their county ranger with the N.C.

She made only a brief reference to lingering questions about the next steps on student loan debt. 'As a nation, we have a lot more work to do on these issues,' she said. <br/>Biden, as a candidate, promised to address the matter if elected, and he hasexpressed interest in canceling $10,000 per borrower. There's been no word on how Biden will handle the issue, even with pressure building on him. The White House has suggested there would be some kind of income criteria that would prevent high earners from benefitting. <br/>Debt payments were paused by President Donald Trump near the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, andBiden has kept the freezein place while considering a more permanent solution. <br/>Any decision carries political risks. Republicans accuse Biden of plotting an election-year giveaway. Activists are pushing him to cancel at least $50,000 per borrower, and anything less could disappoint them. <br/>'President Biden, canceling $10,000 in student debt is like pouring a bucket of ice water on a forest fire,' NAACP President Derrick Johnson said in a statement. Black students and other students of colour are more likely to take out loans to pay for college. <br/>The announcement about Corinthian, which operated from 1995 to 2015, sought to close the books on one of the most notorious cases of fraud in American higher education. At its peak, Corinthian was one of the largest for-profit college companies, with more than 100 campuses and more than 110,000 students at its Everest, WyoTech and Heald schools. <br/>When Harris was California's attorney general, she worked with the Obama administration to uncover how campuses were falsifying data on the success of their graduates. In some cases, schools reported that students had found jobs in their fields of study even though they were working at grocery stores or fast-food chains. <br/>Students told investigators they were often pressured to enrol with promises of lucrative employment, only to end up with huge sums of debt and few job prospects. Federal officials found that the company falsely told students their course credits could be transferred to other colleges. <br/>Harris said Corinthian tried to attract students who were single parents or unemployed and looking to improve their lives. <br/>'The company believed they could get away with it because, as predators are wont to do, they targeted people who they assumed wouldn't fight back,' she said. <br/>Tens of thousands of former Corinthian students were already eligible for debt cancellation, but they had to file paperwork and navigate an application process that advocates have said is confusing. Now, the relief will be made automatic and extended to additional borrowers. <br/>Those with a remaining balance on their Corinthian debt will also get refunds on payments already made, department officials said. But the action does not apply to loans paid in full. A spokesperson for the Department of Education did not respond to a question about why that decision was made. <br/>The Corinthian scandal led to a federal crackdown on for-profit colleges, and the Obama administration promised to forgive loans for Corinthian students whose programmes lied about job placement rates. That administration went on to expand a process known as borrower defence to repayment, which allows any defrauded student to apply for debt cancellation. <br/>The Trump administration drew criticism when it started granting only partial loan cancellation to defrauded students, giving lower levels of relief to those with higher incomes. Former Corinthian students sued, and a federal judge halted the policy and ordered the Department of Education to stop collecting payments on Corinthian debt. <br/>The Biden administration later announced full cancellation for all Corinthian students who had been given only partial forgiveness, but thousands of others were left waiting for the department to process their relief applications. <br/>As of December, the department reported it had more than 109,000 pending applications from students alleging fraud by their colleges, mostly in the for-profit industry. <br/>Libby DeBlasio Webster, senior counsel for the advocacy group Student Defense, called it a 'fresh start' for former Corinthian students, but she noted that many defrauded students from other for-profit colleges are awaiting help. <br/>She said she hopes the news 'is a sign that other decisions are on the horizon for thousands of similarly situated students who are waiting for this kind of relief'. <br/>Former Corinthian student Nathan Hornes had his debt forgiven in 2017 through the borrower defence process, but his sister Natasha is among the 560,000 former Corinthian students now getting cancellation. <br/>'My sister and all the others who went through the same experience of being cheated by Corinthian finally get to experience the same relief of having the financial burden lifted,' he said in a statement. 'They deserve that, too, and I'm so glad that today they finally get to feel that freedom.' <br/>A for-profit college trade group said students who are deceived by their colleges deserve relief, but that Corinthian's actions 'do not represent all private career schools'. <br/>'The Department [of Education] and others should not conflate the actions of one organization with an entire sector that has provided opportunities for millions of students and contributed to our nation's workforce,' said Jason Altmire, president and CEO of Career Education Colleges and Universities. <br/></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

As he began seeding the yard, the son spotted flames shooting from the lawnmower and immediately called 911.</p><p>By the time firefighters arrived, flames had made their way up the deck and into the home.</p><p>Firefighters saw heavy smoke and flames engulfing the side of the single-family home and attached deck. Second, third and fourth alarms were struck and fire departments from numerous surrounding communities responded.</p><p>Members of the Boxford, Merrimac, Groveland, Georgetown, Newburyport, Amesbury and Newbury fire departments responded to assist. The South Hampton Air Trailer, Atlantic Ambulance and West Newbury Police Department also responded. The Haverhill, Salisbury, and Newton and Plaistow, New Hampshire, fire departments  provided station coverage.</p><p>National Grid shut off power to the home.</p><p>No injuries were reported and the residents were able to safely escape before fire crews arrived.</p><p>Because of extensive damage, the home was deemed uninhabitable and the family had to find other housing.</p><p>Firefighters cleared the scene by 3:35 p.m.</p><p>Because the house is not on the town's water system, firefighters had to contend with a limited water supply made possible by water tanker trucks. Wind was not a factor, according to Dwyer.</p><p>\"Hell of a response from everyone as usual,\" Dwyer said.</p><p>Dwyer said he and fellow West Newbury native Amesbury Fire Chief Ken Berkenbush were at a COVID-19 vaccine clinic at Amesbury High School when the call was received.</p><p>\"I want to thank him for his assistance, being a West Newbury guy,\" Dwyer said.</p><p>The contemporary home was built in 1987 and last assessed at $450,200, according to the town's online assessor's database</p><p>Dave Rogers is a staff writer with The Daily News.

The tower is a 59-foot, three-inch tall International Derrick tower, originally erected in 1934 by the Civilian Conservation Corps for fire protection. The viewshed from the fire tower stretches across Broome, Cortland, Delaware, Madison, Oneida, Onondaga, Otsego, and Tioga counties.</p><p>The upgrades were supported by $125,000 from NY Works and include projects to improve accessibility and restore the tower to enhance safety and recreation opportunities. Site upgrades include resurfaced driveway and parking areas; accessible stone dust path from the upper parking area to the base of the tower; accessible picnic table, bench, and informational kiosk; new roof and renovated porch and siding on the observer cabin; and removal of all communications equipment. Upgrades to the tower's exterior include new stairwell safety fencing, new metal grate treads and wooden landings on the stairwell, and new paint on the entire tower. Interior tower cab upgrades include a new entrance hatch and wooden floor, renovated map table, and all new windows.</p><p>For nearly a century, observers watched the forests of New York State from more than 100 fire towers perched atop the highest peaks, searching for the first signs of fire to report to Forest Rangers by phone. In the early 1970s, the state began using air surveillance to monitor fires. Fire towers were phased out beginning in the 1980s, and over time, the towers and their associated observers' cabins began to deteriorate. The towers were either dismantled or closed to the public for safety. Today, volunteer-based initiatives across the state are working to help protect New York's fire towers. These initiatives recognize that the towers represent the state's history and heritage of forest protection and are a resource with the potential to attract visitors.</p><p>Berry Hill fire tower served as an active fire look-out station until the end of the 1988 season. In 1993, it was placed on the National Historic Lookout Register (US#54). The 1999 McDonough State Forest Unit Management Plan identified an objective of rehabilitating the fire tower to allow for public access. Before making the structural improvements, it was necessary to remove and relocate communications equipment from the fire tower.</p><p>Through an agreement with DEC, the New York State Chapter of the Forest Fire Lookout Association will provide volunteer stewardship services at Berry Hill. Volunteers will help maintain the facility and provide educational information to visitors. On days when a steward is on-site, motor vehicle access to the upper parking area may be permitted and the observer cabin will be open for visitation. The site also features an information kiosk, bench, and picnic table for visitors to enjoy. Off-road parking is available for approximately eight vehicles at the base of the fire tower's driveway. The driveway is about 1,000 feet long and open for pedestrian access with a moderate uphill climb.

The potential for more \"dry lightning[2]\" has left the Oregon officials concerned that more wildfires could ignite. So they've turned to authorities in Arkansas, Nevada and Alaska for equipment including fire engines, according to a statement[3] by Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest officials Monday.In California, the massive Beckwourth Complex fire, comprising two blazes in the Plumas National Forest, was 88% contained Monday, so firefighters were \"recovering equipment\" from burn areas and preparing for the potential of new wildfires, officials told the Los Angeles Times[4].In Canada, evacuees from fires in British Colombia's interior were struggling to find[5] vacant accommodation. Currently we have a competition over evacuee accommodation in the interior of BC. Too many fires impacting too many communities.

Canadian firefighters are battling hundreds of wildfires in British Columbia \u2014 including 150 new fires that erupted over the weekend, Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center[10] data shows.Hundreds of new evacuation orders were issued in the province, as theInkaneep Creek Fire swelled to more than 1,700 acres Monday night, CBC notes.[11] Driving the news: Many of the wildfires started[12] amid an unprecedented heat wave that scientists say was driven by human-caused climate change[13]. <br/>Go deeper: FEMA chief heads West as large wildfires rage, heat wave peaks[14] <br/>

If that doesn't sound like a full-throated endorsement, it's because the reforms have to be made via executive order and agency rulemaking because Congress refuses to do its job. Without legislation, the scope of the reform is limited and can be reversed with a pen stroke by a future president. But given the refusal of congressional Republicans to budge on an issue upon which large majorities of Americans agree, there was no other way to do it.</p><p>No one should view these worthy but modest steps as the final word. Several more-sweeping measures that have passed the Democrat-controlled House and are being held up by Senate Republicans may not make it into law any time soon, but they should serve as a rallying cry for a nation that has had enough of bloodshed and mass killings.</p><p>In unveiling the package of reforms, Biden correctly termed America's gun violence an \"epidemic.\" The U.S. has higher rates of per-capita gun deaths than any other advanced country in the world, more guns in civilian hands than any other country, and a patchwork of state laws that, in red states like Missouri, amount to almost no law at all. Mass shootings have become routine, with the shooters generally using legalized weapons of war that would be unthinkable in civilian settings in most countries but are ubiquitous here. Epidemic is the right word.</p><p>Biden's plan nibbles around the edges out of necessity, as there is only so much any president can do alone on this issue. The administration will expand the existing National Firearms Act to regulate \"ghost guns\" - weapons made by individuals from kits, with no serial numbers or background checks - and \"stabilizing braces\" of the kind used in last month's Boulder, Colorado, spa killings, which transform semiautomatic pistols into firearms that function more like rifles.</p><p>The administration will also issue a comprehensive new report on firearms trafficking (police and policymakers have been relying on the same outdated data for two decades) and will encourage states to pass \"red flag\" laws allowing relatives or police to petition to temporarily keep firearms away from people in crisis.</p><p>These are entirely reasonable ideas, but they're a garden hose fighting a forest fire. Biden also has vowed to continue pushing Congress on more significant reforms like mandating universal background checks nationwide - the absence of which allows criminals to buy what they want at gun shows or online - and banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.</p><p>As long as an intransigent GOP has the Senate filibuster, none of that will pass. But it's important nonetheless for the administration and any Americans who understand the stakes to continue highlighting the crisis and pressing for reform. As the nation is tragically reminded on a regular basis, it's a matter of life and death.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SLPD-1003590675</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SLPD2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62DP-W961-JBM5-C1HT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11810</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"486\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Inc.

Officials said Thursday that more than 500,000 acres have been burned by the flames. Over the past three days,California had over 11,000 lightning strikes.In November 2018, Trump made similar comments as California dealt with wildfires. 'I was with the president of Finland and he said, 'We have a much different \u2014 we're a forest nation.' He called it a forest nation, and they spent a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things,' Trump said at the time. 'And they don't have any problem.'Trump's remarks were mocked by Finns on social media.Finnish President Sauli Niinistosaid[3] he did not remember discussing raking the forest floors with Trump as a means to prevent wildfires.'I mentioned [to] him that Finland is a land covered by forests and we also have a good monitoring system and network,' Niinistotold Finland's second-largest newspaper, Ilta-Sanomat. 'We take care of our forests.'

Over the last several decades, however, climate change has altered the character of western wildfires. There are many ways to measure the growing toll these extreme wildfires are taking across the region: human deaths, homes reduced to ash, towns erased, acres scorched, days of smoke-choked air, and dollars spent preparing for fires, putting them out, and rebuilding in their wake.</p><p>The question of who bears responsibility for climate change and its impacts is being actively explored in both scientific and legal realms, along the same lines as discussions of corporations' responsibility for other damaging products. While nation-states and individuals shoulder some responsibility, corporations have historically been held accountable for at least some of the damages caused by their products, like asbestos and tobacco. Similarly, corporate entities---particularly fossil fuel companies---can and should be held accountable for climate harms.</p><p>Wildfires in Western North America</p><p>Over the past several decades, almost all aspects of wildfires have worsened across the forests of western North America (Figure 1). Wildfires are burning larger areas, more severely, at higher elevations, and over a longer fire season (Table 2). Historically, low- and mixed-severity fires, set carefully and intentionally by Indigenous peoples or ignited by lightning, occurred frequently and shaped the ecology of these forests (Hill et al. 2023). However, more than a century of aggressive, widespread fire suppression has led to a buildup of vegetation that normally would have burned in those regularly occurring fires. At the same time, human development in fire-prone areas has increased the number of accidental human-caused ignitions of fires and put more people and property in harm's way (Syphard et al. 2017). Given this confluence of factors, federal fire suppression costs have also skyrocketed, surpassing $4 billion in the United States in 2021 and more than doubling in Canada since 1985 (NIFC 2022; NRC 2021).</p><p>Climate change is causing hotter, drier conditions that are also fueling these increasingly large and severe wildfires. In particular, vapor pressure deficit (VPD), a measure of atmospheric \"thirst,\" has emerged as a key way of tracking how climate change is amplifying wildfires because of its role in regulating water dynamics in ecosystems and, together with rising temperatures, contributing to increasing dryness (Box 1). Since the mid-1980s, these increases in aridity have contributed to a near doubling of the area burned by forest fires in western North America (Abatzoglou and Williams 2016), while the length of wildfire season has increased by nearly two months (Westerling 2016; Westerling et al. 2006).</p><p>Wildfires have profound impacts on the health and well-being of people, communities, and ecosystems. In an average year, dozens of civilians and firefighters lose their lives or livelihoods in wildfires across western North America, and millions more suffer indirect health impacts from harmful air quality and pollution from wildfire smoke (Haynes et al. 2020; Childs et al. 2022). Homes, schools, and infrastructure are lost to fires and mudslides, which can occur after fires when rain falls on burned soils that have lost the stabilizing effect of roots and become more water repellant. Wildfires can also compromise water quality, making it even more challenging for people to access clean water in drought-stricken areas and rural, disadvantaged communities (Phillips and Dahl 2022). As with many other climate impacts, longstanding racism and marginalization exacerbate wildfire and health risks for individuals and families with low incomes.</p><p>Findings</p><p>UCS used a combination of data and modeling to determine how much the carbon emissions associated with 88 major carbon producers (hereafter, the \"big 88\") have historically contributed to increases in VPD and burned forest area across the western United States and southwestern Canada (see Methodology). UCS modeling shows that emissions tied to the big 88 are responsible for increasing global average temperature by 0.5C since the start of the 20th century, which is nearly half of the total observed warming since that time. The total increase in global average temperature has contributed to an 11 percent rise in VPD across western North America over the same time period. In turn, the rise in VPD has enabled a steep increase in the forest area that has burned across the region since the mid-1980s.</p><p>Observational data show that 57 percent of the observed rise in VPD since 1901 is attributable to emissions traced back to the big 88 (Figures 3 and 4). Climate model data indicate a slightly smaller contribution---48 percent with an interquartile range (IQR) of 32 to 63 percent---but the two datasets are in broad agreement that roughly half of the rise in VPD since the early 20th century is attributable to emissions associated with the big 88.</p><p>Across western North America, the area burned by forest fires increases exponentially as VPD increases, which means that relatively small changes in VPD result in large changes in burned forest area. The observed rise in VPD has enabled a steep increase in the forest area that has burned across the region since the mid-1980s. Since 1986,1 a cumulative 53.0 million acres of forest area has burned across western North America as VPD has risen. Without emissions tied to the big 88, the rise in VPD would have been much smaller, and 33.3 million acres (IQR 27.7 million--38.5 million) would have burned (Figure 4). That means that 37 percent (IQR 26--47 percent) of the cumulative burned forest area from 1986 to 2021 is attributable to emissions from the big 88. This represents nearly 19.8 million acres of burned forest area, or an area roughly the size of Maine.</p><p>In California alone, crop revenue losses due to drought totaled $3 billion over the 2021--2022 period (Medelln-Azuara et al. 2022). Meanwhile, more than 1 million Californians lack access to clean, affordable drinking water, a number that grows higher during drought periods as overpumping of groundwater causes its levels to fall (Perrone and Jasechko 2017; Stokstad 2020). Reductions in water access affect people's health and finances as they are forced to purchase bottled water or interim tanks, fix pumps, or drill new wells.</p><p>Without emissions traced back to 88 major fossil fuel producers and cement manufacturers, the rise in VPD, a measure of fire-danger conditions, across western North America since 1901 would not have been as large. Climate models (left) indicate that, on average, those emissions are responsible for 48 percent of the total change in VPD since 1901, with the contribution of the big 88 becoming perceptible around 1950 (the interquartile range of the models is shaded). Observations (right) suggest the contribution was even higher---57 percent of the total change since 1901---which means the two datasets are in broad agreement that roughly half of the rise in VPD since the early 20th century is attributable to emissions associated with the big 88. Source: Dahl et al. 2023.</p><p>Note: The data shown here are relative to the 1901--1950 average and are smoothed to reflect a 21-year moving average.</p><p>Holding Fossil Fuel Producers and Cement Manufacturers Accountable</p><p>Emissions traced to major fossil fuel producers and cement manufacturers around the world have contributed to a dangerous and worsening fire regime in forests across western North America. Holding these companies accountable for the harms they have caused through both their emissions and their decades-long disinformation campaigns is critical to supporting and advancing efforts to build wildfire resilience (Frumhoff, Heede, and Oreskes 2015; Pinko et al. 2018; Shue 2017).</p><p>All companies operate with a social license, and companies that fail to act responsibly can lose the public's trust. The federal government and public officials at all levels have important roles to play in establishing corporate climate accountability. For example:</p><p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission should finalize, implement, and enforce strong rules mandating standardized corporate climate disclosure.</p><p>Congress and the Department of Justice should investigate past and ongoing climate disinformation by fossil fuel companies and their surrogates.</p><p>Public prosecutors should hold fossil fuel polluters accountable for climate deception and damages.</p><p>The Biden administration should follow through on its pledge to \"strategically support\" climate-related lawsuits against polluters.2</p><p>Congress should deny fossil fuel polluters immunity from liability for climate deception or damages, the latter of which disproportionately harm Black and Brown communities and low-income communities.</p><p>Federal and state governments should preserve access to justice through the courts for those experiencing climate impacts.</p><p>True accountability to the global climate and to communities affected by climate impacts will also require fossil fuel companies and their investors to commit to and implement major changes in their practices. These changes include:</p><p>Renouncing disinformation on climate science and policy by ending greenwashing campaigns that downplay the climate crisis and make misleading or outright false claims about their own corporate environmental performance---for example, by exaggerating their investments in clean energy. These companies must also cut ties and funding to trade associations and other affiliated third parties that promote climate disinformation.</p><p>Reducing heat-trapping emissions associated with their products and operations at a pace and scale consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement.3</p><p>Fully disclosing the climate impacts and economic risks of their businesses, including all scopes of global warming emissions associated with their operations and the use of their products, physical risks to their operations, and financial risks related to climate liability lawsuits.4</p><p>Ceasing to fund or participate in efforts to delay or block climate policy.</p><p>Paying their fair share of the costs of climate-related damages and climate change adaptation---including the costs associated with wildfire prevention, suppression, and recovery.</p><p>Additional Policies to Limit Harms from Wildfires</p><p>Even with improved corporate accountability, wildfire resilience-building needs are vast and must be better supported by existing programs and policies, as well as new ones in each of the categories below.</p><p>Rapidly Reducing Heat-Trapping Emissions. Robust action to reduce global heat-trapping emissions will both lower future wildfire risk and deliver numerous public health and economic benefits. The United States must implement just and equitable solutions that fulfill its commitments to, at a minimum, reduce its heat-trapping emissions to 50 to 52 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, and to achieve net-zero emissions no later than 2050.5 Implementing the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and enacting strong carbon pollution and methane standards will be critical to meeting those commitments, as will enacting additional policies to reduce emissions.6</p><p>Reducing Human-Ignited Wildfires. The majority of wildfires in western North America are ignited by people and by electricity infrastructure (Balch et al. 2017; Coogan et al. 2020). Congress and states should pass legislation directing utility companies to plan and implement measures that prevent energy infrastructure from sparking fires while also engaging communities, protecting ecosystems, and ensuring the continued functioning of critical equipment. Federal, state, and local governments should also incentivize upgrades to existing properties in fire-risk zones---such as the creation of defensible space,7 the use of fireproof materials, and the adoption of the latest building codes.</p><p>Increasing Resources for Forest Health. To help restore the health of western forests after a century of aggressive fire suppression, Congress must allocate and sustain funding for identifying at-risk forests and scaling up forest treatments, such as thinning and prescribed burning, that can reduce the spread and severity of fires.8 Moreover, federal and state agencies should work to reduce barriers to the use of prescribed fire, including by Indigenous communities that have long used such fires for cultural and ecological purposes. As part of these efforts, government agencies and officials responsible for developing and implementing forest management strategies must respect tribal sovereignty, traditional ecological knowledge, cultural traditions, and local input (Clark, Miller, and Hankins 2022).</p><p>Protecting Community Health and Safety. Public health campaigns, programs, and policies are critical to addressing the direct and indirect threats wildfires pose to human safety and well-being, particularly for people who are young, elderly, or pregnant; who work outdoors; or who have pre-existing health conditions. To reduce potential exposure to wildfire and smoke, Congress should pass legislation directing agencies to improve wildfire behavior and smoke models as well as improve real-time safety communications to the public, local officials, and wildland firefighters.9 Local and state governments should also create robust water-monitoring systems and subsidize at-home water testing and treatment to ensure post-wildfire water safety.</p><p>State and local laws and zoning regulations are critical to reducing these dangers by placing limits on further development in the wildland-urban interface and investing in safe, affordable housing elsewhere. Lawmakers must ensure that fire insurance policies are transparent and affordable and should educate consumers on reducing insurance costs by adopting wildfire mitigation measures. In places where fire risks are increasingly untenable, public officials should engage communities directly in planning for their future, which, if they choose, could include just, equitable relocation to safer places.</p><p>Advancing, Tracking, and Coordinating Equitable Investments. Wildfire impacts often fall most heavily on people, households, and communities with the fewest resources to cope. In line with the Biden administration's Justice40 initiative,10 both pre- and post-fire federal investments must prioritize these communities as well as others that have long been marginalized. Federal agencies should also ensure that low-resourced communities are not burdened by difficult federal funding matches or reporting requirements. At the same time, states should prioritize these communities while building capacity to receive and distribute funding and to execute programs. Both federal and state agencies must ensure adequate funding for full tribal participation in planning, policymaking, and implementation when it comes to wildfire resilience investments. To ensure the efficacy of resilience investments, the federal Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management Commission must swiftly develop and implement a comprehensive framework for coordinating fire-risk reduction measures across jurisdictions.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>While countries and consumers have some responsibility for climate change and its impacts, fossil fuel companies can and should be held accountable for climate harms. Beginning in the 1960s, major fossil fuel companies and industry associations knew that the use of fossil fuels would negatively affect Earth's climate (Franta 2018). Despite this knowledge, companies have operated campaigns of disinformation and deception about the causes and science of climate change and worked hard to block meaningful climate action.</p><p>Communities around the world are taking to the courts to hold fossil fuel producers accountable for their deliberate deception and for harms that were foreseen and preventable. This accountability is particularly important in cases where those who have contributed least to the world's rising heat-trapping emissions are bearing the brunt of the consequences. The quantification of the fossil fuel industry's contributions to increasing fire-danger conditions and burned forest area described in this paper suggests that there may be legal grounds for pursuing accountability from the fossil fuel industry for wildfire impacts, risk reduction, resilience building, and hazard mitigation.</p><p>Emissions from the products of fossil fuel companies have fundamentally reshaped the climate of western North America and left behind a scarred, charred landscape in which people, their communities, and the ecosystems that enable their existence are suffering. To date, the general public has been footing the bills for preparing for, putting out, and rebuilding after wildfires, while fossil fuel producers rake in billions of dollars in profits (Halper 2023). Having long fanned the flames, the fossil fuel industry must start paying its fair share.</p><p>Methodology</p><p>This analysis used a combination of observational data and modeling to determine the contribution of the big 88 to observed changes in VPD and burned forest area in western North America. First, a global energy-balance carbon-cycle model was used to simulate the change in global average temperature since 1900 under two different scenarios, one including the carbon dioxide and methane emissions of the big 88 and one excluding those emissions. This yielded an estimate of how much the emissions associated with those producers contributed to the rise in global average temperature since 1900.Next, observational data and a suite of 28 global climate models were used to determine how increases in global average temperature were related to VPD in the forested lands of western North America.The contribution of the big 88 to regional VPD change since 1901 was then determined by multiplying their contribution to global average temperature change by the relationship between global average temperature and VPD.Finally, observational data from 1986 through 2021 were used to model the relationship between VPD and burned forest area. This relationship was then applied to the VPD change contributed by emissions from the big 88, which yielded an estimate of the contribution of these companies to cumulative burned forest area in western North America. Note that emissions data from the big 88 were only available through 2015 at the time of analysis. Emissions from the big 88 were therefore held constant over the period from 2015 to 2021. For the full methodology, see Dahl et al. (2023).</p><p>Limitations and Caveats</p><p>This analysis was limited to forested areas because the relationship between VPD and burned area is stronger for forested areas than for other ecosystems in the western United States and southwestern Canada. And while there have been many factors that have driven changes in wildfire behavior and risk in recent decades---including widespread fire suppression, the loss of Indigenous burning practices, and population growth in wildfire-prone areas---this study focused solely on the impact of warming temperatures on increases in VPD and burned forest area. Finally, the relationships between global average temperature, VPD, and burned forest area may not hold if one were to look at smaller subregions of the study area.</p><p>Authors</p><p>The authors are all in the UCS Climate and Energy Program.

All CMIP6 models also showed a positive relationship between global average temperature and regional March-September VPD, with a 28-model mean of 0.81 hPa/C (IQR 0.53--1.05 hPa/C) or 12.9%/C.</p><p>Vapor pressure deficit (VPD) is a measure of the ability of air to draw water out of plants and soils. Because dry vegetation ignites more easily than moist vegetation, VPD is also a measure of fire-danger conditions. VPD is calculated as the difference between the amount of moisture that is actually in the air and the amount of moisture the air would hold if saturated. It is similar to relative humidity, which uses a percentage to describe how much moisture is in the air. But unlike relative humidity, VPD calculations factor in temperature, which is important because warmer air has the potential to hold more moisture than cooler air.</p><p>Figure 2 illustrates how warming temperatures can increase VPD. The two circles on the left show air masses of different temperatures at 100 percent relative humidity. Both air masses are saturated, but the amount of moisture required to reach saturation at the warmer temperature is double that of the cooler one. The two center circles (\"ambient\") show air masses of different temperatures at 50 percent relative humidity. At both temperature levels they are holding half as much water as they would if they were saturated. In contrast, as shown on the right, the warmer air mass has a much higher VPD than the cooler air mass even at the same relative humidity because the warmer air mass could hold more water vapor.</p><p>Because warmer air can hold more water vapor, rising temperatures associated with climate change are causing VPD across western North America to rise as well. Both observational and climate model data show that for every 1.8F (1C) rise in global average temperature, VPD across western North America rises by approximately 13 percent.11</p><p>When VPD is high (meaning the air could hold a lot more moisture), plants lose water more quickly each time they open their pores when they perform photosynthesis. Over multiple weeks, months, and years, elevated VPD can lead to dried-out vegetation that can more easily ignite. The ability of VPD to reflect the dryness of vegetation makes it a better metric than the more familiar relative humidity for measuring the atmosphere's influence on the vegetation that spreads fire. Across western North America, years with high VPD are associated with greater forest fire area (Abatzoglou et al. 2018).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125903794</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:687V-98G1-JCBF-S45P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6114\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"05\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>May 16, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Despite the mixed showing, CEO Cedric Francois thinks the med's performance was strong enough to warrant an FDA nod.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Apellis studied pegcetacoplan, the active ingredient in rare disease drug Empaveli,in two phase 3 trials, known as Oaks and Derby, as a monthly and every-other-month treatment in 1,258 patients with geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). For the studies, investigators weighed efficacy by measuring change in the total area of GA lesions from baseline.</p><p>In Oaks, pegcetacoplan metits primary endpoint in both dosing groups, significantly reducing GA lesion growth by 22%in the monthly arm and 16% in the every-other-month group compared with sham injections after 12 months, Apellis said.</p><p>The drug failed to do the same in Derby, reducing lesions by just 12% and 11%, respectively. The drug didn't produce any significant safety concerns in both trials, although its use was associated withslightly higher rates of exudation, or emitted fluid.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RELATED:<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/giddy-up-apellis-empaveli-could-reap-4b-annual-sales-its-race-against-alexion-s-soliris\">Giddy up: Alexion challenger Apellis could race to $4B in annual sales with Empaveli, analysts say</url></emphasis></p><p>Despite the conflicting readouts, Apellis is \u201cunbelievably happy\u201d with the results given the totality of pegcetacoplan clinical trial performance, CEO Cedric Francois said in an interview. The company plans to file the med with the FDA in the first half of 2022.</p><p>There are no FDA-approved treatments for the condition, an advanced form of AMD that eventually leads to vision loss and blindness in older people.</p><p>\u201cThis is a drug that, in our opinion, has absolutely no doubt around its efficacy and comes out with a safety profile that I think exceeds our own and other people's expectations,\u201d Francois said.</p><p>Meanwhile, the drug posted another late-stage upside, Francois argued. In a prespecified analysis of the combined trials, pegcetacoplan was more effective in patients with extrafoveal lesions at the start of the trials, decreasing GA lesion growth in that group by as much as 26% in the monthly arm and 23% in the every-other-month group.</p><p>GA patients typically present first with extrafoveal lesions, which then progress toward the fovea where central vision is impacted, Apellis says.That's important because the disease is like a forest fire in the retina, continuously destroying photoreceptor cells until someone's blind with no way to turn it around, Francois said.</p><p>There are roughly 1 million Americans living with the condition and 5 million people globally. If Apellis is able to do what others have failed, it could be looking at $3 billion in peak sales, Jefferies analysts recently <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/giddy-up-apellis-empaveli-could-reap-4b-annual-sales-its-race-against-alexion-s-soliris\">predicted</url>.</p><p>Pharma has tried and failed to push GA treatments over the FDA's finish line in recent years, including an effortby Roche on itscomplement-inhibiting drug lampalizumab. That drug, however, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/phase-3-fail-puts-roche-blockbuster-to-be-critical-list\">crashed</url>out of two phase 3 trials in 2017.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RELATED:<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/apellis-soliris-rival-drug-empaveli-snags-fda-approval-for-pnh-patients\">Can a small biotech challenge Alexion's Soliris?

The increases were primarily due to higher commodity prices. Cash flow from operating activities was $530 million in Q2 2022, including the impact from asset retirement obligations settled and changes in non-cash operating working capital.Pro forma Q2 2022 FFO and FCF incorporating the incremental 36.5% ownership in Corrib was $536 million ($3.26/basic share) and $422 million ($2.56/basic share), respectively. As a reminder, all FCF from the Corrib acquisition accrues to Vermilion as at January 1, 2022 and will be netted off the approximate $600 million purchase price at the time of closing which we expect to occur in Q4 2022.With clear line of sight to achieving our next mid-cycle(5) debt target, we are pleased to outline our formal return of capital framework. We intend to return an increasing amount of capital to shareholders as debt levels decrease using a debt grid to guide near-term Return of Capital allocation decisions.In conjunction with our Q2 2022 release, we announced a 33% increase to our Q3 2022 quarterly cash dividend to $0.08 CDN per share which equates to an annual dividend of $0.32 CDN per share, or approximately $53 million. Dividends will remain a key component of our return of capital framework as we seek to provide shareholders with a resilient and increasing base dividend; however, we will limit the annual cash dividend to approximately 10% of our mid-cycle FFO.Based on our Return of Capital Allocation Grid, recent commodity strip(6) and internal estimates, we anticipate returning up to 25% of FCF in 2H 2022 and up to 50% - 75% of FCF in 2023. We will consider various options to return capital; including share buybacks, regular and special dividends and a potential substantial issuer bid. Based on our review of a number of valuation data points, we expect the majority of the incremental capital return to be in the form of share buybacks initially.In early July 2022, we announced the approval of a normal course issuer bid (\"NCIB\") for the purchase of up to 16,076,666 common shares, representing approximately 10% of Vermilion's public float as at June 22, 2022. To date, we have repurchased 1.25 million common shares for $35 million.Net earnings were $363 million in Q2 2022, an increase of 28% from the prior quarter due to higher commodity prices and net hedging gains.Cash flow used in investing activities totaled $613 million in the second quarter including exploration and development (\"E&amp;D\") capital expenditures(7) of $113 million and acquisition capital of $522 million.The Leucrotta acquisition closed on May 31, 2022 and the assets have been successfully integrated into Vermilion. We are now focused on completing the 6-well Montney pad that was drilled in Q2 2022. The Mica asset significantly increases the depth and quality of our North American inventory and is expected to add multiple decades of development that will enhance FCF to the business.Long-term debt in Q2 2022 was $1.5 billion and net debt(8) was $1.6 billion, resulting in our net debt to trailing FFO ratio decreasing to 1.1 times(9) compared to 1.2 times in the prior quarter.Production in Q2 2022 averaged 84,868 boe/d(10) a decrease of 2% from the previous quarter, primarily due to planned and unplanned downtime.Production from our North American operations averaged 58,027 boe/d(10) in Q2 2022, an increase of 3% from the prior quarter primarily due to the Leucrotta acquisition, which closed on May 31, 2022.Production from our International operations averaged 26,840 boe/d(10) in Q2 2022, a decrease of 9% from the prior quarter primarily due to natural decline, offshore drilling delays and unplanned downtime in Australia.As a result of forest fire related downtime in France, offshore drilling delays in Australia, combined with inflationary pressure, we are increasing our 2022 capital budget by $50 million to $550 million. Annual production guidance, excluding the Corrib acquisition volumes, remains unchanged at 86,000 to 88,000 boe/d. Our exit rate forecast of 95,000 to 100,000 boe/d, including the Corrib acquisitions volumes, also remains unchanged.We released the annual update to our online sustainability report in July 2022. Notable highlights include the decrease in our Scope 1 emission intensity to .018 tCO2e per throughput operated boe, in line with our target to reduce our 2019 baseline of .019 tCO2e per throughput operated boe by 15% to 20% by 2025, and coverage of our Corrib Biodiversity Action Plan achievements.</emphasis></p><p>Message to Shareholders</p><p>Global commodity prices continued to strengthen through the second quarter, driving another quarter of record fund flows from operations (\"FFO\") and free cash flow (\"FCF\") for Vermilion. FFO was $453 million (cash flows from operating activities of $530 million), representing a 16% increase over the prior quarter. Exploration and development (\"E&amp;D\") capital expenditures were $113 million in Q2 2022, resulting in quarterly FCF of $340 million. Free cash flow in Q2 2022 was used to partially fund the Leucrotta acquisition which closed on May 31, 2022. The remainder of the Leucrotta purchase price was funded with debt which resulted in a slight increase in Q2 2022 net debt to $1.6 billion; however, with the increase in FFO our net debt to trailing FFO ratio decreased to 1.1x.</p><p>We have successfully integrated the Leucrotta assets and assembled a Mica asset team which is now focused on completing the 6-well Montney pad that was drilled in Q2 2022. We are excited to have these assets in our portfolio and look forward to scaling up development in the years ahead. The Mica asset significantly increases the depth and quality of our North American inventory and is expected to add multiple decades of development and enhance FCF to the business.</p><p>Closing of the Corrib acquisition continues to progress as we move closer to obtaining all remaining partner and government approvals. We expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter with an estimated closing cash payment in the range of $100 to $150 million after adjusting for the FCF accrued throughout the year. Pro forma Q2 2022 FFO and FCF incorporating the incremental 36.5% ownership in Corrib was $536 million and $422 million, respectively.</p><p>We remain on track to achieve our next debt target of $1.2 billion by the end of 2022, and with this clear line of sight we are pleased to outline our formal return of capital framework which will see an increasing proportion of FCF returned to shareholders as debt levels decrease. Over the past two years we have been focused on balancing debt reduction and portfolio enhancement, all with the goal of maximizing value and the return of capital to our shareholders over the long term. Vermilion is in a very strong position from both an asset base and financial perspective. We announced two strategic acquisitions over the past year, funded with free cash flow, and will have reduced debt by approximately $1 billion, relative to Q2 2020 debt levels, by the end of this year(1). While we will continue to keep a close eye on debt and reduce it even further to ensure we maintain a strong balance sheet through all commodity cycles, we are now in a position to increase our return of capital to shareholders. We are confident that our globally diversified asset base combined with our disciplined approach to capital allocation will generate value for our shareholders over the long-term. Further details on our return of capital framework is outlined below.</p><p>Return of Capital</p><p>Vermilion declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 CDN per share in Q2 2022 which was paid on July 15, 2022. With two strong quarters now behind us and a clear line of sight to achieving our next mid-cycle(2) debt target of $1.2 billion, we are now in a position to return a greater proportion of free cash flow to our shareholders. Vermilion has a long history of returning capital to its shareholders primarily through dividends. Dividends will remain a key component of our return of capital framework as we seek to provide shareholders with a resilient and increasing base dividend; however, we will limit the annual cash dividend outlay to approximately 10% of our mid-cycle FFO. In conjunction with our Q2 2022 release, we announced a 33% increase to our Q3 2022 quarterly cash dividend to $0.08 CDN per share which equates to an annual dividend of $0.32 CDN per share or approximately $53 million based on the current number of shares outstanding. At this dividend per share level, we have significant capacity to increase the base dividend and plan to provide ratable increases over time.</p><p>In addition to strengthening our balance sheet, Vermilion has made other structural improvements to its business by increasing our International production weighting through European natural gas exposure while also enhancing our North American inventory with a high quality long-life Montney asset. These structural improvements, combined with the strong fundamental outlook for global commodities will further underpin our ability to return capital to shareholders. The amount of FCF available for return of capital will increase as debt levels decrease based on the illustrative grid outlined below. This grid is not intended to be prescriptive quarter-to-quarter but will be used as a tool to guide near-term Return of Capital allocation decisions while taking into account other capital requirements such as further debt reduction, asset retirement obligations and acquisitions.</p><p>Based on our Return of Capital Allocation Grid, recent commodity strip(3) and internal estimates, we anticipate returning up to 25% of FCF in 2H 2022 and up to 50% - 75% of FCF in 2023 while reducing debt to a target of $850 million by the end of 2023, which implies an undrawn $1.6 billion credit facility. We will consider various options to return capital; including share buybacks, regular and special dividends and a potential substantial issuer bid. Based on a number of datapoints reviewed, we expect the majority of the incremental capital return to be in the form of share buybacks initially. In early July 2022, we announced the approval of a normal course issuer bid (\"NCIB\") for the purchase of up to 16,076,666 common shares, representing approximately 10% of Vermilion's public float as at June 22, 2022. To date, we have repurchased 1.25 million common shares for $35 million. We look forward to providing continued updates on our return of capital initiatives through the second half of this year and throughout 2023 as we carefully weigh capital allocation decisions against various uses of excess free cash flow with a view of acting in the long-term interests of shareholders.</p><p>Q2 2022 Operations Review</p><p>North America</p><p>Production from our North American operations averaged 58,027 boe/d(4) in Q2 2022, an increase of 3% from the prior quarter primarily due to the Leucrotta acquisition which closed on May 31, 2022. Drilling and completion activity in west-central Alberta and south-east Saskatchewan was limited during the second quarter due to spring breakup. During the second quarter, we completed one (1.0 net) well and brought on production one (0.6 net) condensate-rich Mannville natural gas well in west-central Alberta, and we drilled one (1.0 net) well and completed two (2.0 net) wells in south-east Saskatchewan. Following the announcement of the Leucrotta acquisition in late March 2022, we assembled our Mica asset team and focused on integrating the assets and working closely with the Leucrotta team in drilling the first six (6.0 net) well Montney pad. Drilling was successfully completed during the second quarter and the team is now focused on completion activities. While we remain optimistic that an agreement on natural resource activity reviews will be reached between the BC Government and the Blueberry River First Nations in due course, our team has a plan to continue drilling on the Alberta side of the Mica property in 2023 should we see further delays in permit approvals.</p><p>In the United States, we drilled four (3.8 net) wells of our planned six (5.8\u00a0net) operated Turner wells and completed two (2.0 net) wells during the second quarter. Three (2.8 net) wells are two-mile lateral wells which are significantly more economic than one-mile laterals. One (1.0 net) well was brought on production during the second quarter while the remaining wells will be completed and brought on production during the third quarter. In addition, one (0.4 net) two-mile non-operated Turner well is planned for drilling in Q4 2022.</p><p>International</p><p>Production from our International operations averaged 26,840 boe/d(4) in Q2 2022, a decrease of 9% from the prior quarter primarily due to natural decline and offshore drilling delays in Australia. In Australia, the drilling of our two-well program was delayed by approximately one month due to unexpected maintenance and repairs on the third-party contracted rig. Drilling commenced late in the second quarter and is expected to finish in early September with production to start shortly thereafter. In Europe, much of our activity during the second quarter was focused on preparing for our 2H 2022 drilling campaign which will include two (1.1 net) wells in Netherlands, three (3.0 net) wells in Hungary and two (2.0 net wells) in Croatia.</p><p>Outlook and Guidance Update</p><p>Our Q3 2022 capital program is well underway as we finish up the drilling program in Australia, complete and tie in the remaining Turner wells in the US, execute our south-east Saskatchewan drilling program and complete the 6-well Montney pad at Mica. In Europe, we are making final preparations for an active drilling campaign to commence in the third quarter and continue through the fourth quarter. Early in the third quarter, a forest fire near our Cazaux field in southern France resulted in approximately 1,500 bbl/d of production being temporarily shut-in which will impact Q3 production in France.</p><p>Our Q3 2022 production will include a full quarter contribution from the Leucrotta acquisition and new production from the US and south-east Saskatchewan drilling programs; however, these volumes will be partially offset by the Australia drilling delay and fire related downtime in France. Taking all this into account, we expect Q3 2022 production to be in-line with Q2 2022.</p><p>As a result of forest fire related downtime in France, offshore drilling delays in Australia, combined with inflationary pressure, we are increasing our 2022 capital budget by $50 million to $550 million. We are maintaining our annual production guidance of 86,000 to 88,000 boe/d, excluding the Corrib acquisition volumes. We plan to update our production guidance once we have greater certainty on timing of the Corrib close. Our exit rate forecast of 95,000 to 100,000\u00a0 boe/d, including Corrib acquisition volumes, remains unchanged.</p><p>Commodity Hedging</p><p>Vermilion hedges to manage commodity price exposures and increase the stability of our cash flows. In aggregate, as of August 9, 2022, we have 36% of our expected net-of-royalty production hedged for the remainder of 2022. With respect to individual commodity products, we have hedged 64% of our European natural gas production, 20% of our oil production, and 41% of our North American natural gas volumes for the remainder of 2022, respectively.

These financial measures include:</p><p>Fund flows from operations (FFO):\u00a0A total of segments measure most directly comparable to net earnings. FFO is comprised of sales excluding royalties, transportation, operating, G&amp;A, corporate income tax, PRRT, interest expense, realized loss on derivatives, realized foreign exchange gain (loss), and realized other income. The measure is used to assess the contribution of each business unit to Vermilion's ability to generate income necessary to pay dividends, repay debt, fund asset retirement obligations and make capital investments.</p><p>Free cash flow (FCF):\u00a0A non-GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to cash flows from operating activities. FCF is comprised of fund flows from operations less drilling and development costs and exploration and evaluation costs. The measure is used to determine the funding available for investing and financing activities including payment of dividends, repayment of long-term debt, reallocation into existing business units and deployment into new ventures.</p><p>2023+ FFO and FCF:A forward-looking total of segments measure and a forward-looking non-GAAP measure; the equivalent historical measures FFO and FCF have been disclosed above.</p><p>Capital expenditures:A non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated as the sum of drilling and development costs and exploration and evaluation costs from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and is most directly comparable to cash flows used in investing activities. We consider capital expenditures to be a useful measure of our investment in our existing asset base. Capital expenditures are also referred to as E&amp;D capital.</p><p>Net debt:\u00a0A capital management measure in accordance with IAS 1 \"Presentation of Financial Statements\" that is most directly comparable to long-term debt. Net debt is comprised of long-term debt (excluding unrealized foreign exchange on swapped USD borrowings) plus adjusted working, capital and represents Vermilion's net financing obligations after adjusting for the timing of working capital fluctuations.</p><p>Net debt to four quarter trailing fund flows from operations:A supplementary financial measure that is calculated as net debt (capital measure) over the FFO (total of segments measure) from the preceding four quarters. The measure is used to assess the ability to repay debt.</p><p>Adjusted working capital:\u00a0A non-GAAP financial measure defined as current assets less current liabilities, excluding current derivatives and current lease liabilities. The measure is used to calculate net debt, a capital measure disclosed above.</p><p>Payout and payout % of FFO:\u00a0A non-GAAP financial measure and non-GAAP ratio respectively most directly comparable to dividends declared. Payout is comprised of dividends declared plus drilling and development costs, exploration and evaluation costs, and asset retirement obligations settled. The measure is used to assess the amount of cash distributed back to shareholders and reinvested in the business for maintaining production and organic growth. The reconciliation of the measure to primary financial statement measure can be found below. Management uses payout and payout as a percentage of FFO (also referred to as the payout or sustainability ratio).</p><p>Dividends % of FFO:\u00a0A supplementary financial measure that is calculated as dividends declared divided by FFO (total of segments measure). The measure is used by management as a metric to assess the cash distributed to shareholders.</p><p>Operating netback:\u00a0Is a non-GAAP financial measure most comparable to primary financial measure net earnings and is calculated as sales less royalties, operating expense, transportation costs, PRRT, and realized hedging gains and losses presented on a per unit basis. Management assesses operating netback as a measure of the profitability and efficiency of our field operations.</p><p>Fund flows from operations per boe:\u00a0A supplementary financial measure that is calculated as FFO (total of segments measure) by boe production. Fund flows from operations per boe is used by management to assess the profitability of our business units and Vermilion as a whole.</p><p>Management's Discussion and Analysis and Consolidated Financial Statements</p><p>To view Vermilion's Management's Discussion and Analysis and Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and six months ended June\u00a030, 2022 and 2021, please refer to SEDAR (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">http://www.sedar.com</url>) or Vermilion's website at\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vermilionenergy.com/invest-with-us/reports-filings.cfm\">https://www.vermilionenergy.com/invest-with-us/reports-filings.cfm</url>.</p><p>About Vermilion</p><p>Vermilion is an international energy producer that seeks to create value through the acquisition, exploration, development and optimization of producing assets in North America, Europe and Australia.

In addition to any other assumptions identified in this document, assumptions have been made regarding, among other things: the ability of Vermilion to obtain equipment, services and supplies in a timely manner to carry out its activities in Canada and internationally; the ability of Vermilion to market crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas successfully to current and new customers; the timing and costs of pipeline and storage facility construction and expansion and the ability to secure adequate product transportation; the timely receipt of required regulatory approvals; the ability of Vermilion to obtain financing on acceptable terms; foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; future crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas prices; and management's expectations relating to the timing and results of exploration and development activities.</p><p>Although Vermilion believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements or information are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on forward looking statements because Vermilion can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Financial outlooks are provided for the purpose of understanding Vermilion's financial position and business objectives, and the information may not be appropriate for other purposes. Forward looking statements or information are based on current expectations, estimates, and projections that involve a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by Vermilion and described in the forward looking statements or information. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the ability of management to execute its business plan; the risks of the oil and gas industry, both domestically and internationally, such as operational risks in exploring for, developing and producing crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas; risks and uncertainties involving geology of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas deposits; risks inherent in Vermilion's marketing operations, including credit risk; the uncertainty of reserves estimates and reserves life and estimates of resources and associated expenditures; the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to production and associated expenditures; potential delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects; Vermilion's ability to enter into or renew leases on acceptable terms; fluctuations in crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; health, safety, and environmental risks; uncertainties as to the availability and cost of financing; the ability of Vermilion to add production and reserves through exploration and development activities; the possibility that government policies or laws may change or governmental approvals may be delayed or withheld; uncertainty and current evolutions with relation to sustainability/ESG reporting methodologies; uncertainty in amounts and timing of royalty payments; risks associated with existing and potential future law suits and regulatory actions against Vermilion; and other risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this document or in Vermilion's other filings with Canadian securities regulatory authorities.</p><p>The forward looking statements or information contained in this document are made as of the date hereof and Vermilion undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward looking statements or information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, unless required by applicable securities laws.</p><p>This document contains metrics commonly used in the oil and gas industry. These oil and gas metrics do not have any standardized meaning or standard methods of calculation and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies where similar terminology is used and should therefore not be used to make comparisons. Natural gas volumes have been converted on the basis of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent. Barrels of oil equivalent (boe) may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet to one barrel of oil is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.</p><p>This document may contain references to sustainability/ESG data and performance that reflect metrics and concepts that are commonly used in such frameworks as the Global Reporting Initiative, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, and the Value Reporting Foundation (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board). Vermilion has used best efforts to align with the most commonly accepted methodologies for ESG reporting, including with respect to climate data and information on potential future risks and opportunities, in order to provide a fuller context for our current and future operations. However, these methodologies are not yet standardized, are frequently based on calculation factors that change over time, and continue to evolve rapidly. Readers are particularly cautioned to evaluate the underlying definitions and measures used by other companies, as these may not be comparable to Vermilion's. While Vermilion will continue to monitor and adapt its reporting accordingly, the Company is not under any duty to update or revise the related sustainability/ESG data or statements except as required by applicable securities laws.</p><p>Financial data contained within this document are reported in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=CA42678&amp;sd=2022-08-11\"/> View original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vermilion-energy-inc-announces-results-for-the-three-and-six-months-ended-june-30-2022-33-dividend-increase-and-return-of-capital-framework-301604639.html</p><p>SOURCE Vermilion Energy Inc.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=CA42678&amp;Transmission_Id=202208111611PR_NEWS_USPR_____CA42678&amp;DateId=20220811\"/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRNEWS-CA4267820220811</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRNEWS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:664J-KSY1-JB72-105G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8054</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5331\"/><timeReceived>4:11 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>PR Newswire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 11, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Monday, according to incident update[12] from the L.A. County Fire Department. It has destroyed 12 structures and 21 outbuildings, damaged three structures and it threatens to destroy over 4,500 other structures in the Lake Hughes area in Los Angeles County, per the incident update[13]. Nearly 2,000 fire and emergency personnel have responded to Lake Fire, according to the incident update[14]. Assigned resources to combat the fire include 189 engines, 23 water tenders, 26 hand crews, 12 helicopters, and 25 dozers. The Red Cross of Los Angeles opened up an evacuation center at Highland High School where individuals can 'be assessed by Red Cross personnel,' the incident update[15] said. Due to coronavirus restrictions, individuals at the shelter 'must remain in vehicles and abide by Los Angeles County Health Orders.' Mandatory evacuations and several road closures have been ordered in three residential areas of Los Angeles County, including in the Lake Hughes and Pine Canyon communities, per the Lake Fire incident page[16].

The Angeles National Forest issued a directive[20] August 1 prohibiting campfires, smoking, and discharging firearms in the forest after they changed their forest fire danger level from 'VERY HIGH' to 'EXTREME.' The order applies from August 1, 2020 through February 1, 2021. The Unified Command for the Lake Fire is holding a public meeting at 6 pm on Monday to 'provide a fire operations overview' and will be live-streamed to the public on various social media accounts, per a statement[21] from the Angeles National Forest Service.|#LakeFire[22]| The Unified Command for the Lake Fire will hold a public meeting at 6pm on Monday, August 17 to provide a fire operations overview. pic.twitter .com/lHeVNvboEv[23]; \u2014 Angeles_NF (@Angeles_NF) August 17, 2020[24] The Angeles National Forest is situated between the San Gabriel and Sierra Leone mountain ranges and provides an open space for recreational activities, research, solitude, a haven for wildlife, and other activities, per the 'Lake Fire' incident page[25].Content  created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is availablewithout charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

(TSX \u2013 V: EMO; OTCQB: EMOTF) (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cEmerita\u201d) is pleased to announce that it continues to accelerate drilling at its wholly owned Iberia Belt West project (\u201cIBW\u201d or the \u201cProject\u201d). Presently there are 9 drills on the La Romanera deposit delineation and 1 rig continues to drill at Infanta. Assay results have been received from drill holes at the La Romanera deposit (3 drill holes) and the La Infanta deposit (2 drill holes) reported below. To date, 23 drill holes have been completed on the La Romanera deposit which is the main focus of the IBW program.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to Joaquin Merino, P.Geo., President of Emerita: \u201cThe additional drills will ensure the Company stays on track to meet our objectives with respect to delineating the La Romanera deposit. Restrictions on drilling between 2-8 PM, related to high temperatures and resulting forest fire index, are also expected to end by September 21 as temperatures moderate which will allow 24 hour operations to resume and boost productivity as well. Hunting season, which commences October 15, is not expected to impact the drill program at the La Romanera deposit.\u201d</p><p>David Gower, P.Geo., CEO of Emerita, points out, \u201cWe continue to intersect wide thicknesses of massive sulphide and are excited to see the results continue to build toward a maiden NI 43-101 resource estimate. The Company is in a strong financial position with more than $20 million in the treasury which is well above the budget for completing the campaign. Presently, there are 8 additional drill holes in the lab and 8 additional drill holes in progress at La Romanera (one rig is under repair). At La Infanta, there are 3 drill holes at the lab and one hole is in progress.\u201d</p><p>La Romanera: </p><p>Drill holes LR009, LR013 and LR015 intercepted massive sulphide mineralization between 200 and 450 meters below surface. Holes LR013 and LR009 are along section 6700, and about 250 m apart and returned excellent widths and grades. The deposit in this area is very continuous in thickness and grades including elevated grades of gold and silver. Hole LR015, located at the western edge of the historical drilling, intercepted 20.5 m of massive pyrite but no significant base or precious metal values metals were obtained in this drill hole. The sulphide lens is thick and it is characteristic of the sulphide deposits in the Iberian volcanic massive sulphide belt to have barren sulphide zones. Additional drilling will be required in this area given the thick sulphide intercept.</p><p>Hole LR009 intercepted two lenses. The Upper Lens occurs from 560.7 m with 6.7 m grading 0.3 % Cu; 1.4 % Pb; 4.2 % Zn; 0.8 g/t Au and 102.4 g/t Ag (including 1.2 m grading 0.2 % Cu; 3.8 % Pb; 6.3 % Zn; 2.5 g/t Au and 150.8 g/t Ag). The Lower Lens was intercepted at 581.3 m depth and comprises 16.5 m grading 0.2 % Cu; 3.1 % Pb; 3.6 % Zn; 2.3 g/t Au and 254.7 g/t Ag (including 2.7 m grading 0.5 % Cu; 5.1 % Pb; 0.4 % Zn; 6.0 g/t Au and 776.2 g/t Ag and a second including 2.4 m grading 0.1 % Cu; 4.2 % Pb; 10.5 % Zn; 1.0 g/t Au and 140.4 g/t Ag).</p><p>Hole LR013 intercepted two lenses. The Upper Lens occurs from 223.0 m (200 m below surface) with 4.2 m grading 0.1 % Cu; 1.5 % Pb; 1.1 % Zn; 0.9 g/t Au and 43.5 g/t Ag (including 1.3 m grading 0.1 % Cu; 4.1 % Pb; 3.3 % Zn; 2.7 g/t Au and 98.0 g/t Ag). The Lower Lens was intercepted at 267.0 m and comprises 20.6 m grading 0.9 % Cu; 0.5 % Pb; 0.8 % Zn; 0.5 g/t Au and 46.9 g/t Ag (including 2.0 m grading 0.3 % Cu; 2.0 % Pb; 2.9 % Zn; 2.4 g/t Au and 125.0 g/t Ag and a second including 2.1 m grading 2.6 % Cu; 0.2 % Pb; 1.1 % Zn; 0.3 g/t Au and 27.0 g/t Ag).</p><p>Figure 1:\u00a0 Location map showing drill holes LR009, LR013 and LR015 of the La Romanera Deposit.\u00a0Hole LR015 is the western-most hole drilled by the Company to date.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/bf8f111a-caca-4be0-8ef2-fb2177f7685d\">https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/bf8f111a-caca-4be0-8ef2-fb2177f7685d</url></p><p>La Infanta: </p><p>The 2 drill holes reported below are located on the eastern and western side respectively of the La Infanta deposit, and about 650 m apart along strike. Both holes are part of the delineation program used to demonstrate continuity of mineralization in support of a NI 43-101 mineral resource estimate.</p><p>Hole IN060 intercepted sulphide mineralization in the North Block. The deposit continues to the west in the North Block. The intercept occurs from 96.3 m comprising 1.6 m grading 1.7 % Cu; 3.5 % Pb; 7.3 % Zn; 1.0 g/t Au and 71.3 g/t Ag. The hole did not continue to intercept the South Block mineralization due to technical issues in the drill hole.</p><p>Hole IN061 intercepted mineralization in both the North and the South Block. The mineralization in the North Block occurs from 120.5 m with 2.1 m grading 0.4 % Cu; 1.5 % Pb; 2.2 % Zn; 0.4 g/t Au and 40.2 g/t Ag. The mineralized body in the South Block occurs from 191.7 m with 4.3 m grading 0.9 % Cu; 1.8 % Pb; 5.4 % Zn; 0.2 g/t Au and 55.4 g/t Ag.</p><p> Figure 2:\u00a0 Location map showing drill holes 060 and

Public can expect to see smoke and low to moderate fire activity in Murderers Creek 6, Soda Bear 4, and Galena 30 on the Blue Mountain Ranger District. Smoke will be visible from the Elk 16 units on the Prairie City district, and on the Emigrant Creek district, in Silvies units 7 and 12.</p><p>Murderers Creek unit 6 will continue to consume unburned fuel along the north aspects of the unit boundaries. This burn was ignited the week of May 9th. When a prescribed fire is initiated resources work from the outside of the unit to widen our control features to buffer these lines (roads and hand lines). This adds depth to our fire perimeter. Consuming fuels more completely in this manner makes it harder for a fire to move at high rates towards the perimeter, lessening the likelihood of the fire to escape (or exit) the unit. The intent is to let the fire consume the interior pockets of unburned fuels. It won't likely be put out and mopped up. The perimeters of the fire are patrolled daily by suppression resources and Flagtail lookout has a good view of the prescribed fire. Photos taken by the lookout will be uploaded daily on the Spring Prescribed Fire Operations Inciweb page: <url normalizedValue=\"https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7426/\">https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7426/</url> No new images had been added to the page in the past week due to the holiday and changes to Public Use Restrictions and Industrial Fire Precaution Levels taking precedent.</p><p>Smoldering fire is exposed to the sun and heat, this could increase activity. Potential for slight increases in flame length which would result in additional smoke creation is likely to occur. Individual and group tree torching inside the unit may occur under certain conditions. This may cause additional smoke and be visible from distances further away. The majority of unburned islands are well interior of the boundary of the unit. Mosaically burned areas along any boundaries (of all units) will be patrolled on a regular basis. Public can expect to see fire resources in the unit areas burned this spring.</p><p>For the safety of firefighters and the public, roads and areas of prescribed fire activity will be signed. Please avoid these areas so as not to interfere with ongoing operations. For safety, roads, trails and areas may need to close temporarily as firefighter operations are taking place. Smoky conditions may also reduce visibility to a level that would require additional temporary closures. During prescribed fire operations, there is potential for impacts to camping and hunting. Hunters are advised to plan ahead, for their safety they should not camp in or near an area of prescribed fire activity.</p><p>Spring operations reduce surface fuels, increase height of some canopy, reduce small tree densities, and help promote fire resilient trees, thereby improving our ability to protect communities from wildfire. Additionally, these prescribed fires improve wildlife habitat, promote long-term ecosystem integrity and sustainability by reducing the risk of high-severity wildland fire.</p><p>With the potential for smoke to settle in certain areas during active operations, the public can monitor the smoke and air quality in our area and across the state by visiting, <url normalizedValue=\"http://oregonsmoke.blogspot.com/\">http://oregonsmoke.blogspot.com/</url>.

The true number of infections is likely 10 times that number.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Local hospitals are overwhelmed, as are most other hospitals in the state. If you need emergency care for COVID or anything else, access to that care is no longer assured.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The current surge in COVID-19 cases is a self-inflicted wound.</p><p>We had the vaccine supply and delivery system in place to immunize 85 percent of residents 12 and older by mid-July. This effort faltered due to a toxic mix of disinformation and distrust.</p><p>To make matters worse, activity restrictions and masking requirements were prematurely ended in late spring just as the highly infectious delta variant spread through the state.</p><p>People returned to their pre-pandemic lives. And delta began to burn through the community, like a raging fire in a bone-dry forest.</p><p>We are now encircled by the blazing fire. Public health agencies are called upon to contain this fire, to coordinate a community response, and to protect the vulnerable.</p><p>And while many have mobilized to address this common threat, something else, both dangerous and perverse is going on.</p><p>As the fire rages, voices on social media decry the fire as a hoax. Others try to wrestle the fire hoses out of the hands of the firefighters. Still others insist on their constitutional right to start fires, pour gasoline on existing blazes, and rush into burning buildings.</p><p>This analogy tragically describes our current pandemic response. Some call for a ban on mask mandates, others loudly defend their right to infect others in the name of personal choice, and people absurdly equate vaccination requirements to the worst horrors of the WWII Holocaust.</p><p>This is no way to end a pandemic. There is another way. We start with what we have learned so far:</p><p>1) COVID is caused by an airborne virus, mostly spread in indoor spaces before people know they are infected.</p><p>2) The delta variant is highly transmissible. When one member of a household gets it, everyone else in the family is usually infected.</p><p>3) Vaccines are highly effective at preventing serious illness, hospitalization and death. They are incredibly safe \u2014 among the safest vaccines ever developed. They do not work for everyone \u2014 some individuals who are immunosuppressed may get reduced protection. Their effectiveness may diminish over time.</p><p>4) COVID-19 is not like influenza. After invading our bodies through the respiratory tract, it attacks our circulatory system causing kidney, heart and brain damage in addition to the life-threatening complication of COVID pneumonia. Survivors have a 10 to 30 percent chance of lingering symptoms, some disabling.</p><p>5) The amount of virus we are exposed to makes a difference. Masks, distancing, improved ventilation and moving social gatherings outdoors all reduce the exposure risk. None offer 100 percent protection but do dilute the virus concentration enough to prevent serious infection, even in the unvaccinated.</p><p>Embrace these facts and you can safely navigate the remaining months of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Ignore them and it is just a matter of time before you become infected and likely spread that infection to friends and family.</p><p>And the worst time to get infected is at the peak of a pandemic surge when medical systems are overwhelmed.</p><p>No forest fire burns forever and so too all pandemics eventually come to an end.</p><p>Globally, COVID-19 will burn for years. In the U.S., we have the technological capability to contain this pandemic in a matter of months but may lack the political will to do so.</p><p>\"Personal choice\" does not include the right to spread infection recklessly.</p><p>We need to support the brave firefighters who battle the COVID blaze.</p><p>The majority of Clallam County residents are sane, responsible and community-minded.

(Jacquelyn Martin / Getty) <br/><br/>On Tuesday, President Joe Biden delivered the annual State of the Union address, touting his accomplishments from the past two years and laying out the rest of his priorities as he, presumably, seeks a second term to 'finish the job.' But to do that, he will have to win the support of young people. According to estimates from the Center for American Progress, Gen Z and Millennials will make up 40 percent of the votes in 2024. To understand what young people thought about Biden's speech, we asked StudentNation writers from around the country to highlight the most important parts of his agenda\u2014as well as what was missing. From climate change and policing to labor rights and the pandemic, here's how young people see the president's agenda. 1  <br/>In this historic moment, there is a huge need for deliberate and coordinated action to address the crises our nation is facing, especially those related to our natural environment. Drawing upon themes of progress and resilience, President Biden's SOTU remarks seem to fit the bill.2 <br/>Biden has made undeniable progress on an array of environmental issues. </p><p>In his remarks[1], the president highlighted plans to remove lead service lines from toxic lead pipes servicing 10 million homes and 400,000 schools and child care centers. He recalled the success of the historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which has funded tens of thousands of meaningful environmental projects.3 <br/>This is all extraordinary progress and was rightly commended. However, Biden's recent actions on climate have contradicted this evident emphasis on progress and resilience. The Biden administration recently advanced the Willow Project[2], which would allow for the drilling of more than 200 wells in the 24 million-acre National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. Blocking Willow could prevent[2] over 285,000 million metric tons of carbon from being emitted over its 30-year lifespan\u2014roughly equal to the annual emissions of 75 coal-fired power plants. Further, the Alaska Native tribe of Nuiqsut has opposed[3] the proposal, as it will accelerate climate change and threaten their ancestral homelands, wildlife, and their subsistence lifestyle, demonstrating that this project is a matter of racial and environmental justice.4 <br/>In his speech, however, President Biden went off-script to concede that oil demand will last for at least a decade, evidently prioritizing oil costs over crucial climate action. But taking action[4] to prevent this project from coming to fruition is crucial for addressing the increasing impacts of climate change. After all, in President Biden's own words[1], 'The climate crisis doesn't care if your state is red or blue. We have an obligation to our children and grandchildren to confront it. there is much more to do.' For the president, the first step of this work is to start being consistent.5 <br/>-Hannah Reynolds6 <br/>Princeton University7  <br/>Current Issue <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-20-27-2023-issue/\">https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-20-27-2023-issue/</url><br/>When President Biden declared in his State of the Union Address that 'Covid no longer controls our lives,' he failed to call attention to the 'tripledemic' that has affected 40 percent of American households, the one in 13 adults who suffers from long Covid, and the millions of immunocompromised Americans at high risk of infection and death. Biden was, however, correct in identifying that public opinion has shifted on the Covid-19 pandemic, with only 31 percent of Americans reporting that they are worried about getting sick from Covid-19, the flu, or RSV. However, as the Biden administration recently decided to end the Covid national emergency, removing a host of protections including free and widespread access to testing, the White House is now quite limited in its options to mitigate possible future outbreaks.8 <br/>Biden, however, stressed that 'we still need to monitor dozens of variants and support new vaccines and treatments.' The White House has made its position clear: A circulating virus, even one that mutates, is not as much of a concern as the economic and political ramifications of public health precautions. And yet only 28 percent of Americans have received a dose of the updated bivalent booster. It looks increasingly clear that the administration's laissez-faire approach is leaving the most vulnerable behind, a price most of the public is willing to pay for a 'return to normal.' The little time Biden spent in his address on the continuing pandemic both illustrates and informs the current political reality.9 <br/>-Theia Chatelle10 <br/>Yale University11  <br/>There are few events in American politics more obscene than a president's State of the Union address. Although Trump heightened its absurdity\u2014giving the Medal of Freedom[5] to radio xenophobe Rush Limbaugh\u2014the SOTU has always been an exercise in spectacle. The 2023 address was especially disappointing not because of the things President Biden said but what he failed to say.12 <br/>Of course, few people thought Biden would make police reform a priority in his speech. Biden's rhetoric around race and policing is more empathetic than Trump's\u2014admittedly, a low bar. He quoted Tyre Nichols's mother in saying 'something good must come of this,' but then proceeded to give a standard issue response to the racist violence endemic in our society. As the militarized police apparatus only grows, with forests[6] demolished to accelerate its expansion, this moment requires more from public figures than condolences. The murder of Tortuguita and Nichols stains our collective conscience, and we must dedicate ourselves to overturning the modern law enforcement system.13  <br/>The president mentioned how he signed[7] an executive order fiddling at the issues' periphery, banning chokeholds, and limiting use of no-knock warrants, and called for Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act[8]. In an earlier time, those measures might be enough to placate the public, but the current moment is one defined by white supremacist violence\u2014shown in Buffalo[9] and Minneapolis[10]\u2014and any politician not advocating for a transformation of American policing isn't acknowledging the true state of the union.14 <br/>-Zurie Pope15 <br/>University of Cincinnati16 <br/>President Biden's focus on workers was appropriate for a political moment when the majority of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck amid a resurgent support of labor. Naturally, this emphasis connects with young people who predominantly hold minimum-wage jobs and are involved in union organizing.17 <br/>Biden referred to his presidency as a 'blue-collar blueprint' to rebuild America, railing against corporate abuse of the tax system and apathy towards American workers, saying that 'for too long, workers have been getting stiffed.' The president spoke about how 'we are beginning to restore the dignity of work,' and highlighted a Cincinnati ironworker of the Local 44 union who attended the speech. That dignity includes guaranteeing a living wage, the right to a union, and accessible education.18 <br/>Of course, these are all correct assessments. American workers deserve a far better deal. However, the lack of truly ambitious ideas made the calls feel lackluster at best and performative at worst. Biden acknowledged the struggles of the working class, but neglected to highlight concrete proposals beyond the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, instead opting to simply call for higher wages. The PRO Act would amend labor laws and the National Labor Relations Board to protect worker unionizing efforts, but the bill has languished in Congress since 2021.19 <br/>If Biden really is sick of union-busting and wants to strengthen the middle class, his party needs to fight tooth and nail, seeking court injunctions against labor law-breakers such as Starbucks and going beyond $10,000 of student debt relief.20 <br/>It is true that Biden is the most pro-union president in recent memory, and this State of the Union reflected that, marking a return\u2014at least rhetorically\u2014of politics concerned with workers' rights. Yet there is a lot of work to be done before Biden's rhetoric can become reality.21 <br/>-Porter Wheeler22 <br/>University of Oregon23 <br/>In what was arguably one of the most progressive of such speeches in recent decades, President Biden expressed his commitment to making sure the US 'at last' steps up to the existential threat that is the climate crisis. Simultaneously, he called out the billionaires[11] and the 'wealthiest and biggest corporations[12]' that have for years avoided paying billions of dollars in federal taxes. Climate change, which disproportionately harms the most marginalized communities in the US and elsewhere, is indeed the most pressing existential threat of our time, and it's true that billionaires and giant corporations, through their failure to pay taxes, are further undercutting the federal government's ability to respond. The system, as Biden said, 'is not fair.'24 <br/>It is important that Biden, at least outwardly, recognizes this. The problem is his proposed path forward. There is already research showing that the fossil fuel industry is the industry most responsible for driving the climate crisis; over 70 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions since 1988 can be traced to 100 fossil fuel companies, according to a 2017 report[13]. And yet, while experts[14] (and activists) have shown that the best path towards a livable future is a swift, just transition away from fossil fuels[15], the president only called out fossil fuel companies for not investing in more fossil fuel projects, a clear misdiagnoses of the problem. 'Last year, [Big Oil] made $200 billion in the midst of a global energy crisis,' he said. 'They invested too little of that profit to increase domestic production. Instead, they used the record profits to buy back their own stock.' The solution Biden laid out to raise the tax on stock buybacks only addressed half of the problem. The climate crisis is here, and calling for the expansion of and further investment in oil projects, as the president did publicly in his address, will only exacerbate it.25 <br/>-Sofia Andrade26 <br/>Harvard University27 <br/>Biden claimed that some Republicans are proposing to cut Social Security and Medicare, but failed to explain what these plans are or reveal the culprits behind the proposal. He received jeers and boos from Republicans, and in pictures captured by members of the media, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene can be seen giving him a thumbs down.28 <br/>This move from Biden, however, had a positive effect, causing an apparent consensus to protect both Medicare and Social Security. 'So folks, as we all apparently agree, Social Security and Medicare is off the books now,' said Biden. 'They're not to be touched? All right. We've got unanimity!'29 <br/>This came after Biden's opening remarks where he invited both Democrats and Republicans to work together. On Biden's part, this moment could be seen as a regression to his earlier attempt to unite a divided House of Representatives when his term first began. Of course, this divide can be seen in various scenes of the State of the Union. At times, only half the room would stand and cheer during Biden's address, while others would stay firmly seated. Many times, Vice President Kamala Harris could be seen standing and clapping, while House Speaker Kevin McCarthy remained silent.30 <br/>Although Biden was able to point to his administration's accomplishments as gears up for reelection in 2024, he has much more work to do if he wants to unite both a divided government and public.31 <br/>-Rania Soetirto32 <br/>University of California, Los Angeles33 <br/>With numerous[16] studies[17] suggesting that the world will careen past 1.5 degrees of warming within the next decade, the need for serious climate leadership from the world's largest historically emitting[18] nation is at an all-time high.34 <br/>Certainly, as he touted in his address, President Biden has advanced such leadership. Between the $369 billion[19] of clean energy spending in the Inflation Reduction Act, $67 billion[20] for zero-carbon industry development and climate-related research in the CHIPS and Science Act, and further funding in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Rocky Mountain Institute found[21], 2020-22 saw a historic level of federal investment in climate spending. That spending also accompanied ambitious new emissions reduction goals[22].35 <br/>Yet even while denouncing fossil fuel companies for massively profiting[23] off the energy crisis driven by Russia's war on Ukraine, and calling for wealthy corporations to pay their 'fair share' instead of lining shareholders' pockets, Biden failed to articulate a clear vision for holding oil and gas giants accountable. With his term half-over, a Republican House majority, and a slim Democratic Senate majority, Biden risks leaving the Oval Office a climate laggard\u2014and frontline communities and young people deeply vulnerable\u2014if he fails to go the distance.36 <br/>From his first day on the job, climate activists have called for Biden to realize the full potential of his executive powers, including by declaring a national climate emergency to unlock new climate spending streams; investigating and prosecuting the companies pursuing 'carbon bomb' projects[24]; and rejecting new fossil fuel infrastructure in accordance with IEA findings[25] of what a global net-zero by 2050 pathway requires. Americans don't need\u2014and young people won't vote for\u2014a president touting the industry line of a continued need for fossil fuel dependence; we need a president who sees the climate crisis as an imperative for a rapid, just energy transition and understands that we can't afford to wait for the next mega-drought, forest fire, or storm to hit before taking every measure to stop corporate greed from burning the planet.37 <br/>-Ilana Cohen38 <br/>Harvard University39 <br/> [ 1]: <url

She was admitted to the Royal Adelaide Hospital on July 5 where she passed away overnight. <br/>Emily Kirkpatrick, South Australia's Deputy Chief Public Health Officer, said the woman had been diagnosed with thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) prior to her death. The rare blood clotting syndrome had previously been linked to the AstraZeneca shot. <br/>\"[It's] very, very sad and our thoughts are with her family during this very difficult time,' Kirkpatrick added, according to ABC News.[1] <br/><br/>Despite the death, the chief public health officer continued to urge the public to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and encouraged people to seek medical help should they observe symptoms related to TTS. <br/>\"The symptoms are a headache, sudden onset headache that doesn't go away with the usual analgesia, abdominal pain, leg pain, feeling off, typically symptoms starting around day four, day five onwards,' she said. \"If you're unable to see your GP and you have symptoms then please go to the emergency department.' <br/>On Wednesday, a team of researchers from McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, published a study in the science journal Nature[2] that linked a handful of amino acids to the unusual vaccine-related blood clots. <br/>The Canadian study involved analyzing blood samples from five people, ages 35 to 72, who developed immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia or VITT after receiving a dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine. <br/>The researchers then compared the platelet and clotting responses of the five people to 10 people who had VITT as a result of a blood-thinning drug called heparin and 10 healthy people. The study found that key antibodies targeted eight surface amino acids, which led to VITT. <br/>The AstraZeneca shot uses altered cold viruses to trigger the human body's immune system to create antibodies and defensive white blood cells to fight against COVID-19. But in rare cases, some people may have an autoimmune reaction that leads the antibodies to bind with unusual strength to a blood component. This results in the formation of blood clots. <br/>\"That's where the forest fire starts.

View the full release here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201130005022/en/\">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201130005022/en/</url></p><p>Kymeta's next-generation solutions are built for mobility and designed to meet the needs of global defense agencies, government, first responders, and commercial customers. Kymeta's products and services have been field deployed for three years and the demand for the Kymeta u8 presales has already exceeded expectations. With the introduction of the Kymeta u8, the company has meaningfully increased antenna throughput and significantly reduced the total cost of ownership. Kymeta's new products and services offer a breakthrough in performance, ease of use, and affordability, and it anticipates that these solutions will further enhance its position in both commercial and government markets, further increasing its lead over competitive offerings.</p><p>\"Government and military need the most reliable and seamless connectivity to safely fulfill their missions,\" said Walter Berger, Kymeta President, and COO. \"These men and women often go to the most remote or disaster-stricken areas of the world, and they need reliable communications to rescue lives, keep property safe, and complete missions. Our government, military, and commercial customers trust Kymeta solutions. The enhanced performance of the u8 is helping our customers make fast, easy, and reliable mission-critical communications on the move a reality.\"</p><p>The launch of Kymeta's next-generation solutions builds on the successful deployment of our beta program earlier this year to facilitate real-world testing. The testing demonstrated throughputs of over 45Mbps in land mobile environment with large scan-off angles of over 50 degrees, which is a remarkable achievement for such a low power (&lt;150W) electronically steered antenna platform. The u8 was tested in regions around the world including North America, APAC, and Europe, in a variety of conditions confirming that the product can be operated with confidence even under the most trying scenarios.</p><p>\"My team works in some of the most densely populated, rugged, and steep forest terrain in the U.S.,\" said Tim Dunfee, Deputy Forest Fire Chief, U.S. Forest Service. \"There are places across our varied terrain that have been engulfed by fires and communications cell towers that have been destroyed, causing loss of all communications. When we tested Kymeta's solutions, we could use FaceTime and make voice calls for the first time. We now have a Kymeta antenna installed on one of our vehicles and deploy it to every forest fire because we know it has reliable communications wherever it goes.\"</p><p>The Kymeta u8 covers the full Ku-band and is designed to be LEO upgradeable. The u8 is available as an antenna, an ODU (with no modem), and a turnkey terminal with embedded satellite modem, cellular modem, and SD-WAN capabilities. The Kymeta terminals are easy to set up and they acquire service within minutes of being powered. Also coming soon is a transportable configuration called the u8 GO, which is ideal for rapid deployments. The u8 GO will enable safe transport with a hardened case for protection and provides a built-in car mount to support easy operations on the pause and on the move.</p><p>Combining the u8 with Kymeta's hybrid satellite-cellular connectivity services, Kymeta Connect transforms the purchase and consumption of mobile data delivering a complete end-to-end solution with a best-in-industry customer experience. The all-inclusive hybrid satellite-cellular connectivity, global support, and network services package start at $999 per month.</p><p>Kymeta Connect is powered by a virtual architecture consisting of an operational stack that connects remote terminals to managed satellite and cellular services, integrates a state-of-the-art digital back office for service and subscription management, and includes an operations and care element to deliver an excellent customer experience. These services are augmented with a unique application called Access which simplifies the control, management, and monitoring of all hardware and connectivity solutions. The newly announced app is available for download through the Apple and Google Play stores. Today, Kymeta Access can be used on a tablet or through a web-based portal to interact with hardware, data, customer care, and subscription services.</p><p>Kymeta expects to further <url normalizedValue=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kymetacorp.com%2Fnews%2Fkymeta-corporation-secures-approximately-85-million-financing-round-accelerate-growth-funding-bill-gates%2F&amp;esheet=52335596&amp;newsitemid=20201130005022&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=accelerate&amp;index=2&amp;md5=f883dd5b7f3e00e782b7dbb38ab96b69\">accelerate</url> its new product development and commercialization of its next-generation solutions and looks forward to sharing more in 2021.</p><p>About Kymeta</p><p>Kymeta is unlocking the potential of broadband satellite connectivity, combined with cellular networks, to satisfy the overwhelming demand for comms on the move and making mobile global.

Douglas Miner of the N.H. Forest Protection Bureau has been named a Smokey Bear Award winner, bronze category, by the National Association of State Foresters and the USDA Forest Service.</p><p>Smokey Bear Awards are the highest honor given to individuals, teams and organizations for outstanding service with significant and sustained program impact in wildfire prevention. The bronze award is for impact within a state over at least a two-year period; silver and gold awards are for regional and national impact, respectively.</p><p>Although as many as 18 awards may be distributed annually, only five winners were named in 2021.</p><p>During Smokey Bear's year-long 75th Birthday celebration in 2019, Miner coordinated dozens of events in New Hampshire, including visits by Smokey to public libraries and the N.H. Veterans Home, Smokey throwing out the first pitch at a New Hampshire Fisher Cats' game, tethered rides in the official Smokey Bear balloon for attendees at New Hampshire's official party for Smokey at Franconia Notch State Park and more.</p><p>An estimated 12,000 people attended 61 events, and posts on the Bureau's Twitter account, @NHForestRangers, had 81,699 impressions during the campaign.</p><p>Miner was nominated for the award by Brad Simpkins of the U.S. Forest Service. While New Hampshire State Forester and director of the N.H. Division of Forests and Lands, Simpkins observed Miner's wildfire prevention work firsthand.</p><p>In nominating Miner, Simpkins noted that \"Doug's efforts, while above and beyond his normally busy ranger duties, are equal to or rival those that could be accomplished with a fulltime prevention coordinator.\"</p><p>As was noted in a letter supporting Miner's nomination, \"Doug is a tremendous leader, [who] takes the time to educate people and will go out of his way to help them succeed. He leads with a humble nature that gives confidence and pride to those he guides, teaches and promotes.\"</p><p>Another letter of support stated his impact simply: \"He is such a credit to forest protection.\"</p><p>Miner will receive a bronze statue of Smokey Bear, special lapel pin and certificate noting his accomplishment. He and the other winners have been invited to attend the National Association of State Foresters meeting in Pittsburgh, Penn., in September.</p><p>The New Hampshire Forest Protection Bureau, part of the N.H. Division of Forests and Lands, is responsible for protecting 4.5 million acres of both public and private New Hampshire forestlands from the threat of wildland fire and crimes against the forest resource. This is accomplished by forest rangers, fire patrolmen, fire tower personnel and support staff as well as the forest fire wardens and deputy wardens serving in each community.</p><p>From 2016-2020, New Hampshire experienced an average of 119 wildfires, impacting 276 acres annually.</p><p>The N.H. Forest Protection Bureau is part of the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources' Division of Forests and Lands, which protects and promotes the value provided by trees, forests and natural communities.

The National Weather Service said, however, that the heat wave appeared to have peaked in many areas and excessive-heat warnings were largely expected to expire by Monday night or Tuesday.</p><p>The two largest fires were burning forests in northeastern California and southern Oregon, sending smoke across other states.</p><p>The Beckwourth Complex, two lightning-ignited blazes, covered about 140 square miles on Northern California's border with Nevada. Plumas National Forest officials said firefighters successfully contained almost a quarter of the blaze but still expected some extreme fire activity.</p><p>Evacuation orders and warnings were in effect for remote areas of California's Lassen and Plumas counties and Nevada's Washoe County. Some structures were destroyed over the weekend in Doyle, California, a town of about 600 residents.</p><p>\"A damage assessment team has arrived to validate and assess reports of structures damaged or destroyed,\" a forest statement said.</p><p>In Oregon, the Bootleg Fire covered 240 square miles in the Fremont-Winema National Forest, near the Klamath County town of Sprague River.</p><p>After doubling in size at least twice over the weekend, it grew only incrementally Sunday, a sign of some progress, said Rich Saalsaa, spokesman for the Oregon State Fire Marshal.</p><p>\"It's allowed firefighters to build more lines and go on the offensive,\" Saalsaa said.</p><p>Seven homes and 43 outbuildings have been destroyed in an area on the south end of the blaze, Saalsaa said.</p><p>\"Most of these places are not within a community per se. Maybe they're the same postal zone. But it's kind of scattered out there, very remote,\" Saalsaa said.</p><p>Some 1,926 homes were within the current evacuation zone, he said, but he didn't know how many people that includes.</p><p>Firefighters were contending with erratic winds, but temperatures were slightly lower.</p><p>The Bootleg Fire disrupted service on three transmission lines providing up to 5,500 megawatts of electricity to California, where the state's grid operator asked for voluntary power conservation from 4p.m. to 9p.m. to ease the strain. The timing coincides with decreasing generation from solar facilities as night falls.</p><p>Elsewhere, a forest fire started during lightning storms in southeast Washington grew to more than 86 square miles. It was 20% contained Monday.</p><p>In Idaho, Gov. Brad Little mobilized the National Guard to help fight twin lightning-sparked fires that have together charred nearly 24 square miles of dry timber in the remote, drought-stricken region.</p><p>A new fire broke out Sunday afternoon in the Sierra Nevada south of Yosemite National Park and by evening had exploded over more than 6 square miles, triggering evacuations in areas of two counties. The fire's size, however, remained unchanged early Monday and was 5% contained. A highway that leads to Yosemite's southern entrance remained open.</p><p>The July heat wave followed an unusual June siege of broiling temperatures in the West. A growing number of scientific studies are concluding that heat waves in some cases can be directly attributed to climate change.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELHLD-4693257</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELHLD2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:634N-65N1-JCDM-J4GK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">156396</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"618\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Woodward Communications, Inc.

In a second attempt, the aircrew picked up two Border Patrol agents and dropped them nearby the area to attempt the rescue on foot. The agents were able to locate and assist the distressed individual to reach the helicopter. The AMO helicopter crew then flew one agent and the individual to Hedglen Forward Operating Base, rescuing her from possible tragedy. There, a BP EMT treated her on scene before Douglas EMS transported her to a local hospital in fair condition.</p><p>\"The brave efforts of our AMO agents and our Border Patrol partners were paramount to bringing this person to safety,\" said Jose Muriente, Director Air Operation, National Air Security Operations Center-Sierra Vista, Arizona.</p><p>AMO safeguards our Nation by anticipating and confronting security threats through our aviation andmaritime law enforcement expertise, innovative capabilities, and partnerships at the border and beyond. With approximately 1,800 federal agents and mission support personnel, 240 aircraft, and 300 marine vessels operating throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, and U.S.Virgin Islands, AMO conducts its mission in the air and maritime environments at and beyond the border, and within the nation's interior.</p><p>-CBP-</p><p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection is the unified border agency within the Department of Homeland Security charged with management, control and protection of our nation's borders at and between official ports of entry.

What kind of picture does this paint for the future of climate policy?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A time not so long ago I was in the Boy Scouts. I will never forget one summer camp when my troop and I took a guided hike through the woods and the guide asked us what was wrong with this forest. We were confused by the question. The forest was big and green and beautiful, and from what I could tell, had plenty of wildlife. Racoons, deer, snakes and the occasional black bear would be frequent guests in our camp and we were far from town. What do you mean that there is something wrong with this forest? The trees were too close, the guide explained, and the ecosystem of the forest was very unhealthy. When trees grow too close together fires and disease spread faster.\u00a0</p><p>The typically iconic views of California's mountains and cities took a rather dystopian turn this summer when the smoke and flames of statewide wildfires devastated the landscape. This year, from Jan. 1 through Sept. 27, 6,000 forest fires burned through California leaving behind 3.7 million acres of damage. Some of the damage done to our forests will not recover within our lifetimes. If there was a literary foil to the coming climate crisis, the recent Californian wildfires should teach us a big lesson for the policies we enact today.</p><p>The great redwoods of the west aren't the same as the midwestern silver maple forests I'm familiar with. In large, carnivorous forests out west, the ecosystem is built to burn. Put simply, unburned forests create a buildup of underbrush that catches fire easily and spreads quickly. The more crowded a forest, the more likely it is to start and sustain a forest fire. The small needle-like leaves that wilt in the late summer dry season are very flammable. Most pine cones can only release their seeds if heat is applied to its shell. Almost as if fire is essential to the life cycle of these ecosystems.\u00a0</p><p>So if the fires are so important, why do they keep happening on the West Coast in such an apocalyptic manner? Well, climate change is certainly an easy culprit to blame but doesn't quite answer the whole story. Warm and dry conditions are the preferred medium for fires and are becoming only more common with each passing year. The real problem isn't the fires, it's actually the lack of them. In the forestry world, a prescribed burn is the best way to clean and control forest floors before they become a greater issue in the future.</p><p>According to the US Forest Service, prescribed fires refer to the controlled application of fire by a team of fire experts under specified weather conditions to restore health to ecosystems that depend on fire. The best part is, it works really well even if there isn't a climate catastrophe around the corner. The Native Americans were known to use controlled burns for thousands of years prior to European colonization. However, a more recent example, the Black Hills in South Dakota, goes through a detailed prescribed burn each fall to ensure an accidental forest fire does not endanger the millions of tourists who visit the region each year.\u00a0</p><p>It is no accident these fires burned so readily out of control this particularly chaotic year. In March, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many of the so called prescribed fires were cancelled or abbreviated to prevent the spread of the virus. In January, Nature Sustainability published another terrifying conclusion: California would need to burn 20 million acres to restabilize in terms of fire - a space roughly the size of South Carolina.\u00a0</p><p>The recurring pattern is almost insanity. Paranoid fire suppression is a short term solution to keeping large plumes of smoke from bothering residents and zealous infernos from damaging life and property. As a result these fuels, not too much unlike the Earth's temperature, are becoming larger in quantity at the SAME TIME! Then the inevitable happens, wind knocks over a powerline or some family wants to have a gender reveal party with explosives and the entire Pacific coast is engulfed in an inferno.\u00a0</p><p>It may be surprising that the West Coast foresters are not taking the threat more seriously. Although it's not like the state and federal government are unaware of these risks. Since the early days of the 20th century, the Pacific has been committed to keeping these fires from happening for economic and liability reasons. Since more and more West Coast residents move to the suburbs, and the line between developed areas and wilderness gets blurrier, it's time for the average citizens to look around and ask where all that government funding for wildfire management is actually going.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>It is clear that in order to take serious steps towards mitigating the effects of climate change, our policies must reflect a balance between written law and practice. Strangely, one of the easiest and most preventable ways to curb our impact on the planet is to make sure our forests stay healthy. Both the shortened control burning sessions and the exponentially increasing amount of land that needs to be cleared after decades of neglect are why 2020's fire season is only the beginning.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4778401</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6118-0K81-JBSN-34Y6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"872\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Journal: Webster University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 7, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Saint Louis</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>MO</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Most commonly known as drones, they have been used since the 1900s, initially by the US military for target practice.</p><p>Military applications still dominate the global UAV market, but the achievements of UAVs in military operations have boosted demand for drones in North America, Middle East and the Asia-Pacific. UAVs are becoming a key element in the intelligence and surveillance operations of military and fast expanding in other combative areas as well.</p><p>The fast development of the UAV global market is having a big impact on a range of mainstream industries. Apart from defense, applications also include environmental management, crisis management, agriculture, policing and crowd monitoring, civil engineering, fisheries protection, disaster management, telecommunications maintenance, oil and gas exploration, mineral exploration, mine safety, geophysical surveys and mapping.</p><p>The UAV market has traditionally been narrowly focused, but it is rapidly diversifying. Given the pace at which technology and the effectiveness of aircraft are improving, and as sensor and automation technologies mature, commercial applications will rapidly grow over the next ten years.</p><p>1.2 Market Scope</p><p>The UAV sector is set to be the sector with the most dynamic growth in the aerospace industry globally in this decade. According to the Teal Group, global spending on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) programs is expected to more than triple over the next decade in military, commercial, and consumer markets.</p><p>In light of solid growth rates, the Teal Group forecasts global spending is expected to touch $20.3 billion by 2025. The civil UAS market is expected to grow faster than the military market over the next decade. The worldwide military UAS spending over the next decade is estimated to be US$216.5 billion. Of which, procurement spending will amount to US$162.2 billion and research spending will amount to US$72.5 billion. The US is expected to account for about 81% of the total military R&amp;D spending and about 48% of military procurement through to 2030.</p><p>The high level of military R&amp;D spending is forecast to be due to the bigger and higher-value systems procured by the US. The military UAS market growth will be led by unmanned combat aerial vehicles and high-altitude long endurance UAVs. The largest market segment over the next decade will be High Altitude Long Endurance UAVs, which will account for a third of the period's sales.</p><p>The civil UAS will be the most attractive market this decade as commercial applications take off and governments adopt UAVs for new roles in border security and public safety. The worldwide civil UAS market is expected to reach US$19.8 billion by 2031, from US$7.2 billion in 2022, according to the Teal Group. Over the coming decade, the civil market will grow at a CAGR of 9.1% and will generate US$139 billion in revenues. Civil UAS promises to be the most dynamic growth sector with commercial segment expected to lead the growth.</p><p>The worldwide commercial UAS market is projected to reach $9.5 billion by 2028. Delivery is likely to emerge as the leading sector for commercial UAS market in the US by 2030. Teal Group predicts that Teal growth opportunities will be in middle-mile (e.g., factory to warehouse) transportation, rather than in the last-mile deliveries. This is primarily due to complexities involved in regulating the last-mile deliveries, while the regulatory framework for middle-mile transportation is already in place. Globally, Agriculture will be the largest sector by 2030 led by more affordable UAS and heavy Chinese investments. This is also supported by UN projections which suggest world's population to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, causing significant growth in agricultural consumption. Another key sector that will drive growth of the commercial UAS market is Industrial Inspection. Construction will be the largest portion of the Industrial Inspection market. All ten of the largest worldwide construction firms are deploying or experimenting with UAS fleets.</p><p>China has a clear leadership in the consumer UAS manufacturing and is now seeking to expand its capabilities to commercial UAS manufacturing. The aggressive growth of the UAV industry in China is attributable to the policy and regulatory support as well as significant investments from the Chinese government.</p><p>Currently, Sichuan, Hunan, Hainan and Jiangxi provinces in China are pushing forward the reform of low-altitude airspace management, giving support to the commercialization of drone application. China's civil drone market is estimated at $6.6 billion in 2022, according to Shenzhen-based research firm AskCI Consulting. The industrial drone market is also witnessing rapid growth. According to data from Shenzhen-based Qianzhan Industry Research Institute, the industrial drone sales is projected to increase from 27.3 billion yuan in 2020 to 265.8 billion yuan in 2026. Shenzhen has more than 1,500 drone companies with civilian UAV business licenses.</p><p>Data from the Civil Aviation Administration of China showed that by the end of 2021, there are 781,000 registered drone users, and the number of registered drones totaled 832,000 in China. The Civil Aviation Administration of China released a plan that outlined several targets for the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) business in China by the years 2025, 2030, and 2035. These goals included the enhancement of rules and the expansion of airspace capacity for civilian UAVs.</p><p>Europe has fallen behind in the civil UAS market. It is now trying to catch up by enacting standardized airspace rules that will create a single market. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has established rules for small UAS across the European Union.</p><p>The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has become the first air transport safety regulator in the world to offer technical design guidance to urban planners and eVTOL manufacturers looking to build drone taxi vertiports across Europe. Europe also adopted 'European Drone Strategy 2.0' late last year aimed for the further development of the European drone market. Further, the implementation of the 'U-space' in January 2023, a European system to manage drone traffic safely, will lay the ground for increased operations. According to European Commission, the drone services market in Europe could be worth \u20ac14.5 billion, and create 145,000 jobs, by 2030.</p><p>The increase in defense spending by various countries to strengthen their defense forces is leading to growth in the number of military UAV systems. These UAV systems are being used for applications such as surveying, mapping, transportation, combat operations and monitoring. The US and European governments have already begun new programs using UAVs for protecting land and sea borders. Many other international agencies including the UN and other peacekeeping agencies are also deploying unmanned aerial protection systems.</p><p>According to the US Presidential budget for fiscal 2024, the US Department of Defense aims to hasten the deployment of advanced combat drones as part of a broader push to modernize the force and pursue cutting-edge technology. The budget includes $547.8 million for modifying five US Air Force MQ-9 Reapers to meet the US Marine Corps' interim requirement for a Group 5 UAS. The United States is not the only nation that is increasing defense spending on unmanned aerial vehicles. Earlier this year, Germany approved major uptick in defense spending on armed drones. German military will purchase ammunitions worth EUR152 million to arm German drones. This will be the first deployment of weaponized UAVs in German military.</p><p>Ukraine has announced plans to double down on its deployment of drones in its efforts to counter Russian forces, pledging nearly $540 million of spending in 2023 for the production and procurement of UAVs.</p><p>Japan has announced a record $40.7 billion defense budget for fiscal 2023, which will include significant spending on armed drones. It intends to raise defense spending to 2 percent of GDP by 2027. The Japanese defense ministry aims to introduce unmanned vehicles that can be used directly in combat, rather than just for surveillance and intelligence gathering.</p><p>According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), military expenditures are on the rise around the globe. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has led to increase in defense funding especially for drones. Over the next decade, growth in military market will increasingly shift towards international markets as more militaries incorporate UAVs into their forces.</p><p>Major drone providers from China and Israel have increased the manufacture and export of defense drones for foreign militaries. Many counties from Saudi Arabia to Myanmar and Iraq to Ethiopia, are stockpiling Chinese combat drones and deploying them on the battlefield. Recently in August 2023, Indonesia announced plans to buy 12 Turkish military drones for $300 million.</p><p>The introduction of specially built unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) also promises to drive growth over the next decade. The emergence of the commercial UAS market, growing demand from governments to better patrol borders, and continued consumer drone growth all promise to drive more than a quadrupling of the non-military market over the next decade.</p><p>With increasing UAV installations across the globe, there is rising need to defend against such systems as well. In May 2022, South Korea approved a project to install uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) defense systems at 45 bases across the nation to neutralize hostile drones. South Korean government will spend NT$4.3 billion (US$144.45 million) to purchase the UAV defense systems.</p><p>Market Share</p><p>The world UAV sector is highly concentrated with a small number of companies holding most of the market share compared to other industries. Our estimates show there are more than 500 companies globally, with more than 200 commercial UAV companies, while the other 300 develop UAV for the military industry. AeroVironment, BAE Systems, Elbit Systems, Finmeccanica, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Navmar Applied Sciences, Northrop Grumman, Safran, Textron, Thales, Boeing, Tital Aerospace, TAI, AIA and Aviation Industry Corporation of China are among the biggest players in the UAV market.</p><p>A number of start-ups have made their mark on the market in recent years, however, and are challenging the dominance of the incumbent players. Technology companies like Intel, Qualcomm, Microsoft, Apple as well as venture capitalists have poured more millions of dollars into startup investments.</p><p>Impact of COVID-19 on the UAV Sector</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every industry, although not in an equal way. Some industries have felt the impact very differently to others. The effect on the UAV market especially commercial drones have been on the positive side. According to Drone Industry Insights, drone companies are on a path towards steady growth over the next many years. Global drone market size is forecast to reach US$55.8 billion by 2030, from US$30.6 billion in 2022, implying a CAGR of 7.8%. The services sector will remain the biggest segment, while hardware segment will be the fastest growing.</p><p>As the global economies were forced to shut down and implement strict shelter-in-place restrictions, the demand for unmanned aerial systems became higher. Further, the use of drones for transporting medical supplies proved a boon for the sector. Cargo, courier and warehousing are the sectors with the fastest adoption of drones. Many drone companies including Wingcopter, Zipline and Wing have been able to deliver and scale their solutions quicker than previously expected.</p><p>England's National Health Service (NHS) is among those trailing the vehicles to deliver fragile medicines to cancer patients living on the Isle of Wight. Chemotherapy drugs can have short shelf lives and thus quick delivery by drones is a boon for patients.</p><p>Walmart said that it completed 6,000 drone deliveries in 2022 from 36 US stores in seven states. These deliveries were done from drone delivery hubs operated by DroneUp, Flytrex and Zipline. Walmart has 4,700 stores located within 90% of the US population making it uniquely positioned to offer drone delivery at scale.</p><p>In June 2022, Zipline launched drone medical deliveries in Nigeria. Zipline will initially deliver over 200 different medical products, including medicines and vaccines, with plans to expand in the near future. This will enable Nigeria to create a strong and smart health system. In May 2022, Wingcopter announced a partnership with Continental Drones to develop a massive delivery network spanning 49 countries across Sub-Saharan Africa. The deal aims to deploy 12,000 of Wingcopter's 198 drone systems over the course of the next 5 years. In February 2022, Zipline announced launching operations in another African Nation with on-demand drone deliveries of medical supplies in Kenya. The company is already operating in Ghana, Nigeria, and Ivory Coast.</p><p>US-based Walgreens in partnership with Alphabet's Wing is targeting the drone delivery market. In April 2022, Walgreens announced that it will begin flying packages by drone to residents of Texas cities in partnership with Google's drone subsidiary, Wing.</p><p>US-based Matternet is another player targeting the medical delivery market. In September 2021, it launched the world's first city-wide drone delivery network for the rapid transport of medical goods in Abu Dhabi. The company will use drones to transport urgent, high-value goods such as COVID-19 vaccines, blood, and lab samples across the Abu Dhabi's health system.</p><p>LEK Consulting notes that drones could account for a large portion of package delivery market by 2040. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a rapid and more expansive testing of drone delivery systems. The technology has been able to accelerate its growth and development over the past 12 months or so.</p><p>To further assist the sector, the UK government announced new funding program for drone companies developing methods to deliver COVID-19 tests and personal protective equipment (PPE) to hospitals and rural communities. The government has announced ~\u00a37 million funding package for the sector.</p><p>According to research published in journal Patterns, drone deliveries could help reduce greenhouse emissions significantly. The paper states that greenhouse-gas emissions per parcel were 84% lower for drones than for diesel trucks. Companies such as Amazon have been testing the use of drones to deliver packages with an eye to reducing their environmental impact.</p><p>1.3 Market Trends</p><p>Start-ups Threaten Larger Incumbents</p><p>Over the past 20 years, the UAV sector has expanded and opened up to a whole new level of competition and innovation that had not been seen in the market. While large incumbents, especially the Big Three - Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman - have won a big slice of the available UAV deals, new and smaller entrants are increasingly winning against the big companies for UAV contracts, thus challenging their respective market positions.</p><p>A number of smaller start-up companies have burst onto the scene in recent years, threatening the market positions of the larger incumbents. Non-defense companies eager to diversify and get a slice of the fast-growing market have funded some start-ups.</p><p>The funding from Drone startups have started on a strong footing in 2023 after a robust 2022. In June 2023, defense and security UAV specialist group Red Cat Holdings raised $1.2 million in new funding to develop a new, portable UAV as standard issue equipment for soldiers. In April 2023, San Francisco-based Zipline raised $330 million at about $4.2 billion, a 55% increase from its $2.7 billion valuation reached two years ago. The funding will help the company to carry out its expansion activities. In March 2023, French advanced air mobility (AAM) startup Ascendance Flight Technology says it is aggressively pushing to finalize the prototype of its ATEA hybrid vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) plane, and has raised new investment of \u20ac21 million ($22.6 million). In February 2023, US-based drone manufacturer, Skydio raised $230 million in Series E funding at a valuation of $2.2 billion. The funding will be used to set up a new manufacturing facility in America. In January 2023, Japan-based Terra Drone raised $14 million from oil giant Saudi Aramco. The company says it will utilize the funding to set up a new subsidiary for inspection services in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>In November 2022, India-based drone delivery platform Skye Air Mobility raised $1.7 million. Skye Air Mobility is currently operating in eight cities across India and plans to expand to 16 cities in the next 24 months. In October 2022, Australian drone logistics service provider Swoop Aero landed a new investment round for its first and last mile airborne delivery network, bringing its total backing to $26 million to date. Swoop Aero plans to use the funds to enter new markets, scale its integrated logistics networks, and expand its manufacturing capabilities.</p><p>Regulatory Uncertainties Overshadow the Segment</p><p>UAV vehicles have evolved swiftly in recent years, particularly since making the leap from military technology to consumer gadgetry. The technology they use could be useful for myriad business opportunities. For example, UAVs are being used in many sectors, like the agriculture, construction, energy, mining and entertainment, as well as geological surveys and, utility safety and maintenance, thanks to their ability to shoot aerial photos and video, as well as collect other data cheaply.</p><p>The growth of the UAV market, however, has drawn considerable attention from regulators and legislators eager to mitigate the complexities involved in the growth of the number of aeronautical vehicles in the skies. For instance, in the US there has been delays and confusion regarding the rules set by FAA. With the courts and Congress getting involved in regulation, clarity around the regulatory landscape is yet to emerge.</p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued new rules for the commercial drone industry. Under the new rules, the FAA will allow small drones to operate at night and over people and will require remote identification of the drones. The new rules went into effect on 21 April 2021. Remote ID will be required for all drones weighing 0.55 lb (0.25 kg) or more. Remote ID requires identification of drones in flight as well as the location of their control stations or takeoff point.</p><p>Further, in 2022, the FAA will require every new produced drone weighing over 0.55 pounds to broadcast its location. In 2023, it will be illegal to fly drone without this broadcasting capability.</p><p>For fiscal FY 2022, FAA is requesting a total of over $100 million in funding for unmanned aircraft system (UAS) research, development, and integration. This includes $31.3 million for UAS implementation which incorporates FAA Drone Zone. The FAA Drone Zone is a cloud-based information technology platform that includes a UAS registration system, Part 107 authorizations and optional waivers, and UAS accident reporting.</p><p>FAA budget request also includes $24 million for UAS concept validation and requirements development, UAS flight information management, and urban air mobility.</p><p>The FAA plans to launch field tests of unmanned aircraft traffic management capabilities. The Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management (UTM) field test, which is set to launch in the spring 2022 and continue into 2023, is expected to lead to new policies and the development of updated industry standards for drones operating beyond visual line-of-sight (BVLOS).</p><p>The commercial potential of UAV continues to attract big investors and venture capital. For example, Amazon's is investing in its Amazon Prime Air program to create a delivery system utilizing UAVs.</p><p>Alphabet's drone-delivery subsidiary Wing launched a new mobile and web app, OpenSky, which is free to use and informs drone pilots about airspace restrictions, pre-plan flights, and get airspace approvals. Drone flyers can also use the app to check information on areas where they can and cannot fly.</p><p>This is just one of the many proposed uses for UAVs, however. Within the next ten years, it is expected that more than 32,000 drones will be flying for commercial operations worldwide. FAA projects that remote pilot certificates could grow almost 3x to 350,000 over the next five years.</p><p>For the US, the potential economic impact of UAVs, according to the Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, could reach approximately US$13.7 billion within the next three years and create more than 100,000 employment opportunities once the FAA drafts comprehensive drone regulations.</p><p>Despite some progress by FAA on establishing rules, it remains unclear. The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) delivered a report in January 2023 stating the need for FAA to more clearly communicate a strategy to integrate drones into the airspace. GAO notes that commercial drone use is likely to expand to 858,000 in 2026 from 622,000 in 2021.</p><p>The main conclusions of the report are that FAA needs to do better in both establishing and communicating a comprehensive strategy for broader UAV use, and in defining a uniform procedure for issuing waiver.</p><p>Wing's CEO Adam Woodwort in March 2023 reiterated the need to make drone regulations more pragmatic and predictable. He emphasized the need for drone regulations that support commercial operations. He noted that many of the current regulations make sense for passenger-carrying airplanes, but not for small aircraft with no people onboard.</p><p>In June 2023, China unveiled a list of new rules applying to drone flight by civilian users and these rules are set to come into force next year. The regulations ban people from using the devices to take pictures or video of military or defence industrial installations or secretive facilities. Drones cannot be used to gather and publish state secrets or unlawfully transfer information outside mainland China. It also bans non-Chinese drones and pilots who are not Chinese nationals from using the vehicles for surveying land. The country currently has a million registered civilian drones that fly around 20 million hours each year, according to data from China Daily.</p><p>The Buzz from Parcel-Toting Drones</p><p>In a few decades from now, we may look back and remember a time before flying robots delivered consumer orders. At least this might be the case if delivery drones turn out the way most retailers \u2014 as well as service providers - envision them. A delivery drone, or also known as a parcelcopter, is an UAV utilized to transport goods, packages, and foodstuffs, and recently, the delivery systems have been a hot future state plans among vendors.</p><p>By 2023, Statista projects global drone delivery market to touch $1.6 billion. Asia-Pacific will be the largest market accounting for nearly 39% of the total, followed by North America (31%) and Europe (22%).</p><p>The enthusiasm for drone delivery space is visible in the funding so far in 2023. In the first half of 2023, drone delivery startups have raised nearly $1.5 billion, almost equal to the figure for the full year 2022, according to data from Crunchbase. Zipline topped the list of drone delivery related companies with a total funding of $813 million in the first half of 2023.</p><p>Drone Industry Insights noted that services such as cargo, courier, intralogistics and warehousing were the fastest-growing drone market in 2021 and are likely to continue to remain so till 2026 with a CAGR of 24.3%. This is due to the increased popularity and demand of drone deliveries for both internal (intralogistics and warehousing) as well as external services.</p><p>Drone deliveries can cut emissions and reduce congestion on roads. According to Virginia Tech University, drone delivery could save the average consumer up to 56 hours per year, reduce vehicle traffic by 294 million miles per year and displace up to 113,900 tons of CO2 per year.</p><p>China-based ecommerce platform Meituan announced that it has completed more than 100,000 drone deliveries by 2022, an increase of more than 400% year-on-year. The company expects greater number of drone deliveries going forward.</p><p>Alphabet's drone delivery service Wing is adding complex route management and self-loading capability for its drone delivery fleet that will make it capable of handling tens of millions of deliveries for millions of consumers by mid 2024.</p><p>Given the large opportunity in the drone delivery market, the space is witnessing new entrants. In 2023, Japan Post announced its plans to expand and accelerate its mail drone delivery services in the country. It is now undertaking trials in populated zones in the country.</p><p>Singapore's civil aviation authority and transport ministry has chosen a private consortium of 13 members to develop the drone program. Under this program, the aim is to use drones for tasks that include delivering parcels, inspecting buildings and providing security. The companies involved in the project have carried our various pilots. These include drone parcel delivery as well as using drones to transport blood samples and specimens between hospitals and central laboratories. Drones are being tested for delivering parts and other materials to factories as well.</p><p>China is not too far behind in this race. DHL in partnership with China-based drone company EHang has launched drone delivery service in China. JD.com and Alibaba have tested the drone delivery system as well.</p><p>Putting the parcelcopter concept into service will take some time because of the many setbacks. The major setback for this concept in the US is that there is no specific flight system where there needs to be a specific path for the drone to travel and deliver in a populated area - and this needs to be solved. Once resolved, the big benefit should be that these delivery-by-drone systems could be commonplace within the next decade. Open season on the open skies could arrive sooner than expected.</p><p>The Obsession with Armed Flying Robots</p><p>The use of a UAV as a weapon first became known in World War II. After the war, little development occurred in drone technology and most remotely piloted vehicles were used for target practice. The US military's first major spending on UAVs began after the Vietnam War, and over the past two decades, the country has become the world's pre-eminent user and supplier.</p><p>Military UAVs in the US have gone through meteoric growth over the past decade. Development has taken a quantum leap \u2014 from lab concept to battle-tested proven technology. Today, America's comparative advantage in UAVs, however, is being battered as technological know-how disseminates throughout the international system. While existing technology has started to lag, global competitors are playing catch up in research and development for drone technology.</p><p>As such, the Pentagon is expected to ramp up its investment in unmanned aerial vehicles in the coming years. The US Defense Department budget request for fiscal year 2023 mentions that unmanned weapons systems, such as drone ships, planes, and ground vehicles, will play an increasing role in future US military planning. The president's fiscal year 2023 defense budget requests new spending on unmanned/autonomous systems technology.</p><p>The Air Force request includes $187 million for enhancements to the MQ-9 Reaper combat drone and $111 million for work on the MQ-4C Triton high-altitude surveillance drone. The Navy and Marine Corps have also requested additional funding for UAVs. The Navy requested $1.2 billion for the MQ-25 Stingray drone, which is to be deployed on carriers and perform aerial refueling and surveillance functions.</p><p>No country has ramped up its UAV research in recent years faster than China, where every major company for the Chinese military has a research and development center and funding allocations dedicated to drones. In recent years, the country has pumped considerable amounts of funds and engineering brainpower into the technology, a field previously dominated by the US and Israel.</p><p>Much of the work done, however, remains secret, but the large number of drones created underlines not only the country's willpower to catch up in the sector by building comparable combat and surveillance models like the Predator and the Global Hawk but also the desire to trade the technologies globally. Its armed UAV CH-4, Wing Loong I and Wing Loong II have been rapidly gaining market share especially in developing countries such as Nigeria, Jordan, Algeria and Middle Eastern countries.</p><p>Israel, second after the US in drone technology, has flown armed UAV models but few details are available. India has also revealed its intention to develop drones that will fire missiles and fly at 30,000 feet, followed by Russia, which has revealed models of UAVs with weapons (although there is little evidence that they are currently operational).</p><p>The Lucrative UAV Micro Segment</p><p>The new generation of UAVs is being developed to improve monitoring of many kinds of systems. From tracking bush fires in Australia to observing traffic in the US, infrared cameras to track missing people at night, and laser spectroscopy used to monitor air pollutions, UAVs are using a lot of the new up-to-date miniature sensor technology.</p><p>All of this requires more focus on the integration of sensor systems in an airborne device that is severely constrained in power and weight. Changing the sensor architecture or even take the control sensors out entirely, allowing the size of the UAV to reduce dramatically. This has created a new class of ultra-small UAV sensors.</p><p>Lockheed Martin's Lockheed Sanders MicroSTAR series of prototypes is one of the many examples of a mini-UAV. The battery-operated MicroSTAR designs resembled kid's toys. The device has winglets instead of the single vertical plane tail, and a nose mounted propeller. MicroSTAR featured a five-gram navigation system that could give directions by the ground station but could also automatically keep on a heading or orbit a target.</p><p>The US army has been using mini UAVs for mission in Afghanistan and other areas. These mini-UAVs provide near-real time video that allows soldiers to better survey their surroundings and detect enemies in combat. FLIR System's Black Hornet is one such mini-UAV which weighs less than two ounces, can be deployed in less than one minute and has a range of over a mile. It is intended to eliminate battlefield blind spots thereby saving lives.</p><p>French drone maker Parrot is also an established player in micro-UAV space. It has been selected by Swiss army to develop and supply micro-drones as part of the Swiss Mini UAV Program.</p><p>Despite the advancements, the current micro-UAV market remains constrained, largely due to regulatory frameworks on unmanned operations in airspace. But once regulatory restraints are loosened and clarified, the potential of this technology will be unlocked. Mini UAVs are set to become one of the major contributors to both the economy and technology. Market growth, however, still very much depends on the pace of UAV development in different countries, thanks to the wide range of applications and the added value related to these unmanned machines.</p><p>1.4 Applications</p><p>Defense</p><p>Defense will continue to the largest market for UAVs for the foreseeable future. UAVs can play an important role in counter terrorism and counter insurgency activities. They can be deployed in highly dangerous missions thereby saving personnel lives. The UAVs are also being used in difficult terrains for intelligence gathering and surveillance. They provide high resolution images and videos which can significantly help ground troops. Drones have been used by militaries of many countries to conduct strikes against terrorists.</p><p>Transport</p><p>UAVs are increasingly used in transport activities such as e-commerce parcel delivery, food delivery and medicine delivery. Of these, e-commerce delivery is getting the maximum attention with large companies such as Amazon already doing pilot tests.</p><p>Another promising area for UAVs is the delivery of food. It could be used in heavily populated urban areas for food delivery by restaurants and also could be used to deliver foods to difficult terrains including oil rigs and remote islands. Medical logistics is another area where UAVs can be used to transport medicines and can also be used as flying defibrillators.</p><p>Infrastructure</p><p>UAVs can assist in the management of various kinds of infrastructure, specifically construction sites. In the pre- construction phase, drones can survey the land and provide accurate field data and images. They are able to capture high-resolution videos and images, which can significantly improve the speed and quality of the design process. In the construction phase, drones can inspect the sites and provide accurate information regarding the progress of the construction.</p><p>The data received could be used by investors and property owners to monitor if the project is progressing as per original schedule or not. Abu Dhabi has launched the trial stage of implementing drones as aerial monitoring and inspection tools for the city's engineering projects and construction sites.</p><p>US state of Arizona is mulling the use drones to inspect roads, bridges and other infrastructure. The state has introduced Drone Infrastructure Inspection Grant Act, that would dispense about $200 million to purchase drones and the other half to train pilots to fly them.</p><p>The FAA's rollout of the Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC) has helped standardize and expand the use of drones in construction. LAANC automates the application and approval process for airspace authorizations and is currently available near 500 airports across the country. LAANC is currently in beta and will be tested further before nationwide rollout.</p><p>An increasing number of construction firms and real estate developers in the Middle East are turning to drones amid the COVID-19 crisis. Drones are being used for progress monitoring and site mapping as companies try to speed up delivery of projects. In November 2020, New York's Department of Finance's property division said that it is looking into the use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems for tasks such as surveying tax lots, geographic information system (GIS) mapping and aerial photography.</p><p>Agriculture</p><p>One of the largest projected applications of UAVs in in agriculture. Drones can be used by farmers to monitor their crops. UAVs can survey farmland faster and at a lower cost than airplanes/satellites and also provide better data and images to farmers. The current altitude restrictions for UAVs limit the area that it can survey, but if the altitude restrictions ease a little, the area could expand and provide greater benefits to farmers.</p><p>Japan has been using UAVs for crop dusting for more than 20 years now and drones account for more than 90% of crop dusters. In the US as well, the adoption of drones in agriculture is increasing due to exemption from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) under the part 107 rule.</p><p>China's largest agriculture drone maker XAG is trying to automate rice farming in China with the launch of its drone-based direct seeding system called JetSeed. It could replace manual seed planting and raise efficiency amid a labor shortage due to COVID-19.</p><p>In January 2023, the United Kingdom's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has given operational authorization to China-based XAG's agricultural spraying aircraft P40 and V40. This is the first-time drone spraying and spreading has been legalized for use on UK farms.</p><p>Public Safety</p><p>This area again presents huge opportunities for UAVs. Drones can be used for law enforcement, search and rescue missions, firefighting and medical services. Civil governments are deploying an increasing number of unmanned systems.</p><p>The US and European governments have launched many new pilot programs to deploy UAV systems to protect borders. The United Nations and other peacekeepers are also deploying unmanned aerial systems to provide protection.</p><p>In the US, many agencies have acquired drones. Most of these agencies are police/sheriff departments followed by fire departments. In October 2022, the sheriff department of Las Vegas announced plans to deploy 400 drones as responders to rising gun violence. In Indiana and Maryland, police have successfully used drones to catch suspects and thieves. In Oakland, the fire department used drones to hot spots, which were not extinguished during a firefighting mission. The Los Angeles Fire Department has been using drones to make hot-spot identification and aerial mapping for wildfire response, as well as incident response for other search and rescue missions.</p><p>Further, drones can collect information, data and images on natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes and wildfires. UAVs have great potential for surveying storm damage and locating people after natural disasters. The US National Guard is using AI-powered drones to track wildfires in real time. The AI-backed drones can predict the area where fire is most likely to spread based on previous fires.</p><p>The US is using drones for border security as well. The drones support the border patrol team by providing enhanced intelligence, surveillance capabilities and reducing the risk to human operators on the ground.</p><p>Inspections</p><p>UAVs can be used for inspections in areas such as wind turbines, oil pipelines, power lines, railroads and more. Oil and gas companies can use a drone to conduct the required monthly inspection of their pipelines. Instead of hiring a helicopter, which is costly, companies can use drones to do the same at lower cost. Drone inspections can survey hundreds of miles of pipeline and pinpoint the location of the leaks, thereby reducing traditional surveilling costs by nearly 90%.</p><p>In November 2021, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines announced plans to use of drones for passenger aircraft inspection. The drones can inspect the aircraft for minor damage inflicted by events like hailstorms and lightning strikes.</p><p>Similarly, UAVs can inspect wind turbines, several hundred feet in the air, removing the need for an individual to physically reach the place. Netherlands-based wind energy company Vestas is using drones to conduct inspection of its 1,250 wind turbines. Archaeologists can use UAVs to inspect the sites and also patrol for looters. The city of London is using drones for surveys which are used for repairing and maintaining assets across the underground rail network.</p><p>1.5 Regulatory Environment</p><p>Drones are taking off in a big way. Once the preserve of the military, UAVs are now widely popular in the commercial sector, thanks to consumer-grade UAVs that become increasingly sophisticated and cheaper. Though regulatory obstacles could hinder growth prospects.</p><p>Currently, there are different sets of rules governing the uses of commercial UAVs around the world. In December 2020, the US FAA approved a new set of regulations governing commercial UAVs. The FAA will allow small drones to operate at night and over people and will require remote identification of the drones. This new regulation will bring a step closer to commercial drone use for agriculture, infrastructure repair, and eventually, even deliveries from companies such as Amazon.</p><p>Canada has had safety regulations in place that govern the use of UAVs. A recreational pilot operating a drone weighing less than 35kgs does not currently require either a license or a special flying permit. It, however, must follow a list of Transport Canada safety guidelines, such as staying nine kilometers from an airport, flying under 90 meters and always keeping the craft within eyesight.</p><p>Australia requires no registration of recreational drones. Recreational drone operators must comply with Civil Aviation and Safety Authority (CASA) rules that allow drones to be flown only within a visual line of sight. There are other restrictions on the maximum altitude, vicinity near airports and flying over crowded places.</p><p>The regulations allow commercial operators to fly drones weighing less than 2kg without a license. Operators must still adhere to all the existing rules for recreational drone use such as not to fly within 5.5km of an airport, above 400 feet or within 30m of buildings, railways or vehicles, and always to have line of sight of the drone.</p><p>Drones that weigh less than 20kgs in the UK can fly in normal airspace for private use as long as the operator is not planning to use data or images from the flight acquired by flying close to people or objects. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) requires all UAVs to remain 150 meters from crowded events or large assemblies, 50m from an individual or building, and stay within line of sight, which is 500m horizontally and 122m vertically. Drones that weigh more than 20kgs are currently banned from flying in civilian airspace.</p><p>The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has established new rules on drones. Under the rules, drone operators will have to be registered with their national authority and the drones will need to have a direct remote identification system in place. The regulatory framework will ensure the protection of citizens' privacy rights while addressing security issues as well.</p><p>China is moving rapidly to establish regulatory framework for drones. In October 2020, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) announced the first Unmanned Civil Aviation Experimental Zones (UCAEZs) to help accelerate the drone industry in China. The new experimental zones are designed to not only offer the airspace for testing innovative drone applications, but to ease the process of developing drone businesses.</p><p>1.6 Challenges and Opportunities</p><p>Opportunities</p><p>UAV industry presents tremendous opportunities for investors, companies as well as government. UAV technology has reached a maturity point that has placed it at the forefront of aerospace manufacturing. As UAV companies around the world make drones more accessible, the UAV sector despite the undeveloped regulatory framework, is set to develop into one of the most dynamic growth industries this decade. There are some 450 UAV companies worldwide behind this growing multibillion-dollar industry, with the number growing.</p><p>Both the military and commercial markets are set to grow rapidly in the next few years, as the US economy continues to recover, technology continues to diffuse around the world, as designs become more streamlined and efficient and as more industries adopt existing business processes for UAV use.</p><p>The non-military, especially the commercial drone segment, is set to grow the fastest with projections of mid to high teens growth over the next the next decade. The latest developments in computer vision, machine learning, cloud and data analytics are expected to push drone deployment in the mainstream commercial sector. In the US and many other places around the world, the regulations either remain too restrictive or are yet to be given a final shape, which has been a deterrent in the pace of UAV adoption.</p><p>With the explosion of interest in building and operating unmanned aircraft systems, the use of UAV technology is set to generate more high-tech jobs, with millions in tax revenues and tens of billions in economic impact.</p><p>UAV technology is moving ever faster forward as the market continues to flourish. Industry will need to consider how to best integrate UAVs into their businesses.</p><p>Challenges</p><p>Safety, privacy and regulatory barriers remain key challenges for the rapid adoption of UAVs. The most urgent challenge for the governments is to ensure that the drone operations remain safe.</p><p>Privacy is another key concern that needs to be addressed. UAVs collect massive amounts of data including video and images, which sometimes could result in the invasion of personal privacy. A livestream or a recording of individuals or buildings can easily be captured without consent. Also, even if the data collected is with consent, the transmission of data itself remains vulnerable to hack. The growth and evolution of the UAV industry has outpaced the development of rules and systems to govern their use. This uncertainty weighs on innovation and commercial adoption, unless there is more clarity on the rules.</p><p>Illegal use of UAVs for criminal activities is another big challenge. For instance, drug cartels have used drones to transfer illegal drugs in the US. These vehicles tend to fly for short periods at very low altitudes. This makes it very difficult to detect using conventional sensor systems. Also, UASs or drones could be a source of public nuisance. If a drone flying over a public place loses control and falls, it could cause substantial damage to the property as well as endanger lives.</p><p>In conclusion, the UAVs have raised a lot of concerns and it is up to policymakers to design and create laws that facilitate the good use of the technology while discouraging its harmful use.</p><p>2.

Welcome to CNN this morning. It is Saturday, June 10. I'm Amara Walker.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">VICTOR BLACKWELL, CNN ANCHOR: I'm Victor Blackwell. It is good to be with you. As you know, there's a lot going on so let's just get to it. Here's what we're watching for you this morning. Former President Trump launched a series of attacks on the Special Counsel after the unsealing of the indictment and the classified documents investigation. The reaction coming in following the indictment and what we expect to hear from the former President today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WALKER: Nearly 2 million people remain under air quality alerts due to smoke from those wildfires in Canada. We're going to talk to a doctor about how to protect yourself as scientists warn that we could see more of these wildfires in the future.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BLACKWELL: This story is remarkable. It's out of Columbia. Four children are found alive after spending 40 days alone in the Amazon. How they were located and the reaction we're getting from their family. You want to see that one.</p><p>WALKER: But we begin this morning with Donald Trump lashing out as we learn new details about the indictment against him. Trump took aim at Jack Smith, the prosecutor, the Special Counsel overseeing the investigation into the mishandling of classified documents. He called Smith a Trump hater and a deranged lunatic.</p><p>BLACKWELL: Trump is the first former President to be charged with crimes in Federal Court. He faces 37 counts, including 31 counts of willful retention of national defense information. Trump is due in court in Miami at 03:00 p.m. Tuesday to hear the charges against him.</p><p>WALKER: And the indictment contains new details about Trump's handling of top-secret documents. It includes photos of boxes containing such documents in various locations at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, including in a bathroom, a ballroom, a shower, an office space, his bedroom, and a storage room. BLACKWELL: We are covering the Trump indictment from the nation's Capitol to the campaign trail. We'll check in with our reporters throughout the hour.</p><p>WALKER: Let's start with CNN's Zach Cohen. All right, Zach, among the charges Trump is facing, his obstruction of justice. Just break down these allegations for us.</p><p>ZACHARY COHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Amara and Victor, prosecutors are alleging that Trump knowingly and intentionally retained hundreds of classified documents and really layout in very specific detail the evidence that they say underpins these 37 different counts. Now 31 of those counts involve the retention of national defense information. That kind of information includes things like details about U.S. Nuclear programs, about defense and weapons capabilities, about potential vulnerabilities to attacks, and potential response options should that happen.</p><p>Now, it really speaks to the level of sensitivity about these documents that were found. And U.S. Officials that I've talked to since this indictment was unsealed, really agree with prosecutors that these are exactly the kind of materials that could put human sources at risk. And also, the way that these documents were found at Trump's resort in Mar-a-Lago could erode trust from allies who really depend on the U.S. to keep these kinds of things secret.</p><p>Now, you mentioned earlier these documents were found in a variety of different places, in some cases, a ballroom at Mar-a-Lago, a bathroom, a bedroom, even a shower. And there's one photo in the indictment itself that really puts a finer point on the sensitive documents and how -- I mean, if you look right there, that's a five-eyes intelligence document, something that's reserved only to be shared with the U.S.'s closest allies, spilled out on the floor in a storage room at Mar-a-Lago. So this indictment really does, more broadly speaking paint a narrative or really detail out what investigators have found as they've been probing Trump's handling of classified documents. And frankly, the indictment itself is pretty damning.</p><p>BLACKWELL: Zach Cohen for us. Thank you so much, Zach. Joining me now, Shan Wu, Defense Attorney, former federal prosecutor and Andrew McCabe, CNN Senior Law Enforcement analyst and former Deputy Director of the FBI. Gentlemen, good morning to you.</p><p>Andy, let me start with you. And -- and the question for months now has been why? When you get looked at, the list of what was in these files, all of these documents, and the reporting was during the Trump administration that he didn't even read these documents, that they had to put his name in certain documents to make him pay attention, put pictures into the daily briefing. Does the why matter, considering what we've learned from this indictment?</p><p>[08:05:15]</p><p>ANDREW MCCABE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, technically, Victor, it does not matter. The prosecutors don't have to prove the why to convince the jury that -- to -- to convict the President beyond a reasonable doubt. Its -- why is not an element of the offense. However, effectively, it's hard to get juries to be convinced until you can sow a kind of comprehensive and understandable narrative. As human beings, we just want to know why other people do the things that they do.</p><p>Now looking at the material that's referred to in the indictment, it's really not very easy to figure out why he took this stuff. Its -- and it covers a broad range of material, at least in the way that it's described across those 31 documents. The best hint that we have in the -- in the indictment as to why are the two episodes that it refers to, the one which we've reported heavily on here at CNN about the conversation that the former President had with Mark Meadows, co- authors of his memoir, where he allegedly referred to a classified document about Iran.</p><p>There is a second episode referred to in the indictment in which he has a conversation with a member of one of his PACs in which he shows that person allegedly a classified map about U.S. Military presence in some part of the world in conflict zone. So, you know, I guess one of the answers to that question of why is to impress others, show people what he has access to, to maybe use that information in his interactions with other people in some -- in some way. But at the end of the day, we're really left wondering what the answer to that question is.</p><p>BLACKWELL: Mere trophies in some of these examples that we read from the indictment. Shan, on the question of looking forward in this case. We saw that two attorneys, Jim Trustee, John Riley, they resigned yesterday morning, and Trump will be in Court on Tuesday at 3 o'clock. We kind of expect, you know, know what will happen on Tuesday.</p><p>Is that damaging to his defense at this point, to have those two attorneys leave and now having to bring in other people? We know that Todd Blanche who's part of the legal team representing him in New York will be joining this defense as well.</p><p>SHAN WU, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, generally Victor, the kind of disarray that's been in Trump's legal team is certainly a disadvantage to him. It's like a revolving door and people will keep leaving all the time. Some of them end up having to testify, and having, you know, their attorney-client privilege, his attorney-client privilege pierced.</p><p>I think here, there could be some benefit for Trump because it's a tried and true tactic of delay for a defendant to get rid of their counsel. They don't like them, they can't get along with them, and you bring in new counsel and they need time to get up to speed. So this is an old trick that I've seen as a prosecutor. I wouldn't say I've played it as defense counsel. But if you're under a deadline, you're trying to slow things down, changing counsel can slow things down, so that might be of some benefit to him.</p><p>BLACKWELL: There were references in the indictment to Trump as a candidate talking about the importance of protecting classified information in 2016. Of course, he was very critical of former Secretary Clinton during the campaign. What was the legal relevance of that? Did that strengthen this indictment, Shan? WU: I think it does. So much of the focus that we've discussed previously has been about trying to prove his state of mind. And, you know, the question that you and Andrew were discussing about the why. I mean, prosecutors have to be careful of not falling into a speculation type of situation that could cause an appellate issue if they convicted.</p><p>But they do have to prove that his retention was willful, that he knew what he was doing. It wasn't an accident. The documents ended up in the shower, for example. So evidence like that he'd spoken about this, that he was cognizant of it, the evidence in the indictment where, you know, the audio tape saying he can't show this document because he knows he can't declassify it, those things all go to the willful aspect of the retention.</p><p>BLACKWELL: Andy was it a mistake not to search Bedminster?</p><p>MCCABE: You know, Victor I would -- I strongly suspect that the prosecutors very much wanted to get into Bedminster and search it. There's been a number of signals over the course of this investigation that tell us that they are not comfortable, that they've actually recovered all of the classified and sensitive material. However, my guess and this is purely speculation, is that they never felt they had probable cause to be able to convince a judge to give them a search warrant.</p><p>The information that we know, particularly about the episode we were discussing earlier about the conversation at Bedminster in which he referred to and maybe had in his possession a document about Iran that occurred about a year before prosecutors discovered it. So when you're applying for a search warrant and one of the aspects of the information you use to base the request on is it has to be fresh, it has to be recent because ultimately you're trying to convince the judge that there is probable cause to believe that there is evidence of a crime in that location now. That's why you have to go get it.</p><p>So my guess is they never had enough current, recent, fresh information to go back into court and get a search warrant, which is what would have been required to search Bedminster.</p><p>BLACKWELL: Shan, Judge Aileen Cannon is over this case now and she's a Trump appointee, which is less important. What's more important, though, is that she was criticized even by some conservatives for her decision to appoint a Special Master early, in this case, to determine which documents could and could not be included. It's part of the investigation or what Trump would be able to keep, that was overturned later. Are you concerned about her role in -- in this case?</p><p>WU: Oh, very much so. I mean, she's a terrible pick for the case, not just for the prosecution but just in terms of her ability to oversee it properly. She really was heavily criticized by the Federal Court of Appeals in that attempt of hers to basically interfere in the criminal investigation by appointing the Special Master. I have to say, I was surprised that the case was brought in Florida versus Washington D.C. since the focus seemed to be in D.C. Not privy, obviously, to what went on there in terms of internal deliberations. The Justice Department might have been trying to head off arguments about whether venue was proper in D.C. or not. They perhaps wanted to show that they weren't venue shopping themselves, not looking for a more liberal type of jury pool, which would be found in D.C.</p><p>If there was some element of discretion there, it was a calculated risk, and certainly drawing Cannon would be the worst outcome of that calculated risk.</p><p>BLACKWELL: So she'll stay -- she'll oversee this throughout?</p><p>WU: It seems that way. At the moment, it's a little bit hard to figure out until we get to Court for the arraignment. And it doesn't seem like she's merely been picked to kind of oversee the arraignment. It seems like it has been assigned to her and from the reporting, it seems like it's random. It is possible the Justice Department prosecutors could move to disqualify her based on what she had done in the other case. That's an uphill battle, though.</p><p>BLACKWELL: So, Andy, President Trump will not be remanded into custody on Tuesday. He's a former President. This is -- he's a presidential candidate. And I'm not even suggesting that he should be. However, there was a 21-year-old Jack Teixeira, who was arrested for leaking classified information on discord who was not afforded bail. He is -- is behind bars. What is the national security difference between Teixeira and Trump. When the government doesn't believe that they even have all of the documents, or they're not sure that they have all of the documents from -- from Trump's properties, and he's going back to the alleged scene of these alleged crimes?</p><p>MCCABE: There's no question, Victor that, you know, you've hit on a -- a very relevant issue there in terms of is there a continuing national security threat. However, in the context of incarceration and pretrial, what the Court looks at is primarily two factors risk of flight and danger to the community.</p><p>The former President has a lot going for him in that analysis, right? He has absolutely no history of prior criminal convictions. There's certainly no threat of violence or danger to the community here. You know, he -- -obviously, he has the resources to travel and passports and those sorts of things so that you could make an argument on risk of flight. But his -- his high profile makes that almost impossible, right -- right? People pretty much know where he is and what he's doing. He's got the Secret Service around him all the time. So there's a very, very remote argument for incarceration.</p><p>In the case of Mr. Teixeira, he's a young man. He also was heavily armed, I think. There was also evidence of communications about violence-related and shootings and things like that. None of that is he certainly hasn't been convicted of a violent offense. But the -- but the elements that the Court looks at to make that determination very different in those two cases.</p><p>[08:15:14]</p><p>BLACKWELL: All right. Shan Wu, Andy McCabe, thank you. WALKER: So former President Trump expected to be on the campaign trail today. What we expect to hear from him as some of his 2024 rivals weigh in on the indictment. Plus, four children survive alone in the Amazon jungle for 40 days. One of the children as young as one. The methods rescuers use to find them.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALKER: Donald Trump is keeping his schedule as planned following his Federal indictment. The GOP frontrunner is expected to hold campaign rallies in Georgia and North Carolina today.</p><p>BLACKWELL: And it will be the first time Trump will give live remarks on the new charges he's facing. CNN's Alayna Treene is joining us now. Safe to expect, he'll be talking about the indictment. What do we know about the preps for the President's -- former President's events today?</p><p>[08:20:11]</p><p>ALAYNA TREENE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, good morning. I am here in Bedminster, New Jersey, just outside where the President will be leaving shortly for those campaign stops at his golf club here in Bedminster. And I spoke with some of his aides yesterday and following news of the indictment and they told me that they spent yesterday working on Donald Trump's speeches, as well as said that he remains \"defiant\". Now, that is the image that they're trying to portray to the media. And I do think that you should expect to see some of that bravado from Donald Trump during his campaign stops. But I should add, Victor and Amara, that behind the scenes, I'm told the mood had shifted in Bedminster. Unlike Thursday night, when some of his allies and his team was really focusing on the political implications of these Federal charges, they felt emboldened by the show of force from Republicans and Conservatives issuing statements of support and defending Donald Trump.</p><p>They were feeling good about it on Thursday night, or at least not too worried. But that did change Friday afternoon after learning of the Federal charges and seeing them that the indictment was unsealed. Now, I'm told that concern had really begun to settle in among some of Donald Trump's allies and those with him at the club. And that really now they're concerned about the legal implications here and how that could play out moving forward.</p><p>WALKER: And what are we hearing from his Republican allies in Congress and also from his GOP challengers for 2024?</p><p>TREENE: Well, it's interesting. We did see a lot of his allies in Congress coming out and defending him immediately after learning that Donald Trump had been indicted by the Justice Department. People like House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and other Republican leaders on Capitol Hill issuing statements of support. But notably, we didn't see that same type of reaction after the indictment was unsealed. We also, though, did see some straw of support from his presidential rivals, people like Ron DeSantis and others. And we did also hear from Governor Asa Hutchinson yesterday as well, who said that even though he's been a big critic of Donald Trump, he did think that this could be a distraction in the 2024 Presidential race.</p><p>BLACKWELL: Alayna Treene for us there near Bedminster. Thanks so much.</p><p>President Biden was repeatedly asked for his reaction to Trump's Federal indictment yesterday. Every time, he gave the same answer no comment. He's trying to distance himself from the Special Counsel's investigation into Trump's handling of classified documents.</p><p>WALKER: And CNN's Jasmine Wright is at the Whitehouse with more. So how long, I guess, we will expect Biden to stay quiet on this issue till the very end, right?</p><p>JASMINE WRIGHT, CNN WHITEHOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Well, we certainly saw it yesterday when President Biden was in North Carolina, really carrying on his schedule, business as usual in a trip that was focused on both jobs and military families. And I think that we'll see him adopt that strategy, which is basically to say nothing for quite some time.</p><p>Now, it's there for two reasons. First, it's because the President wants to project an air of normalcy and calm amongst his predecessor who's really engulfed in this chaos. And then secondly, President Biden and his aides have talked about the fact that they don't want to add any fuel to President -- former President Trump's claim that he is a victim of a political witch hunt by President Biden's Justice Department. So, of course, President Biden has been really saying that he will not comment. Repeatedly, we saw that in North Carolina on that official agenda trip that he took, where he was repeatedly asked about his reaction to former President Trump's indictment by reporters and he continued to say no comment including when CNN asked him, take a listen here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: President Biden, have you spoken to Attorney General Merrick Garland yet?</p><p>JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I have not spoken to them at all. Not going to speak to him, and no comment on what happened.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WRIGHT: So I expect that we will hear a no comment from the President going forward, at least for the next few days. We will see him today at the Whitehouse when he hosts a Pride celebration on the South Lawn, another opportunity for reporters again to ask him for a reaction. Though to be frank with you, Victor, and Amara, I don't think as of today he will answer.</p><p>WALKER: Jasmine Wright, appreciate it. Thank you very much. Here now to discuss this further is Larry Sabato, Director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. Good morning, Larry. So we've heard a lot of this, right?</p><p>LARRY SABATO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Amara. WALKER: This is the weaponization of the DOJ, a political witch hunt, interference in 2024. I'm sure you saw the fierce reaction and, of course, tweets from Republican lawmakers before the indictment was unsealed. After the fact, it's been a bit quieter, as our correspondents have been reporting. But look, I mean, we can expect Trump loyalists to continue the same line of attacks, right? What do you say, Larry to -- to those attacks especially when they're making these false equivalencies about Biden and saying, what about Clinton? Hillary Clinton, I should specify.</p><p>[08:25:03]</p><p>SABATO: Well, the attacks -- the attacks are ridiculous s and they're comparing apples and oranges, but they always do that. Trump is famous for doing that. So you can expect more of that.</p><p>Remember, it's not just the MAGA people, the very enthusiastic Trump people who are backing him. It's also most of his opponents. They're -- they're trying to get on the record early. And the reason is obvious. They think that the legal difficulties that Trump is going to be facing, not just in these documents case but in other cases that will be arising. They think that Trump will be knocked out of the game one way or another. And then they will not have alienated Trump and his backers. And they'll have a better chance, if they're the nominee to win the general election. It's a political calculus.</p><p>If they thought they could get ahead by going after Trump now, that's exactly what they'd do. It isn't exactly a profile in courage, but you can understand what they're doing and why.</p><p>WALKER: Yes. Do you think Trump will get knocked out of the game and if so, when? Because the expectation seems to be that Trump will get a boost in the polls and fundraising at least in the short term.</p><p>SABATO: Well, that's been the -- that's been the practice, hasn't it? It's been the past pattern that he has actually gone up when attacked. But I would add this.</p><p>First, you're going to see a cumulative effect if there are indeed additional indictments plus new information coming out about the indictments we just saw. A cumulative effect in the sense that voters, particularly in the first contest where Trump isn't that strong in Iowa and New Hampshire, they're going to be thinking, is this the strongest candidate we can put up to defeat President Biden? So I don't think Trump is out of the woods by any means. He certainly isn't out of the woods legally. But he's not out of the woods politically and I don't think he's as strong as he may appear in the early polls.</p><p>WALKER: You know what I found fascinating, as I was just researching and just reading several papers and articles, a convicted felon or someone behind bars does not face any legal barriers to run for the U.S. Presidency. But a convicted felon or someone who's incarcerated cannot vote, right? So let's talk theoretically here, because let's say Trump is convicted in connection with the mishandling of these classified documents. He's behind bars, yet he runs for the 2024 presidency. He wins the -- wins the nomination, and he wins while he's incarcerated. What would happen then?</p><p>SABATO: Probably a self-pardon during his first minute in office. You know, we're stretching the possibilities here. I'd like to think the American public is more rational than -- than we've just suggested, and they wouldn't do that. But, you know, people don't believe that this is true but it is for a very good reason. The Founders did not write any qualifications regarding criminality into the Constitution.</p><p>And so for a very long time, it's been clear, I mean, decades and decades, a century plus, it's been clear that people can serve in the Presidency or in Congress even if they're behind bars. That may not make sense, but, you know, I kind of think the Founders expected the Electoral College or eventually the people when the popular vote spread out to the country, they would have more sense than to elect someone who was in serious legal difficulties. Well, I guess they may have overestimated us.</p><p>WALKER: Yes. Well, you know what? I bring up this wild theory, you know, because we've seen some wild things happen since 2016 that we never thought would. You know, but can you just speak to this moment, Larry? Because it really is an extraordinary time for the nation. It's the first time a former President has been indicted on federal charges. You have a former President. You have the front-runner for the 2024 nomination who will or may face President Biden, whose administration is seeking to get a conviction on these charges. This is just monumental.</p><p>SABATO: It is. And we're so polarized and divided anyway. Imagine what this would do to the embers that exist in various parts of the country that CNN easily become a major forest fire and pollute the atmosphere. We've recently had experience with that. So we have to be concerned. We should be concerned. But again, you have to hope that voters will be more rational once they have a chance to think about it.</p><p>WALKER: My last question to you is Judge Aileen Trump -- excuse me, Judge Aileen Cannon, excuse me, a Trump appointee will be overseeing the criminal case against former President Trump, at least initially. And we've talked a lot of people who are more concerned about her lack of national security experience than the political angle here. How do you feel about her overseeing this?</p><p>[08:30:00]</p><p>SABATO: I think it's completely inappropriate, especially given her prior actions. She is clearly or has clearly let her partisanship interfere with her decision in the past. So I would hope one way or the other, and there are ways to do it, she would be removed and would not be the judge in this case. We'll see what happens, but it's going to taint the process if she remains the judge handling this.</p><p>WALKER: Larry Sabato, great to talk to you as always. Thank you.</p><p>BLACKWELL: Still ahead, relief. Relief for some major U.S. cities trapped under the thick smoke and smog of the Canadian wildfires this week. We'll speak to an expert about some of the health concerns. Next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BLACKWELL: A lot of that wildfire smoke that blanketed some of the major U.S. cities along the east coast that's now lifted a lot of it. Not all of it. The reprieve is partly due to cooling temperatures across Canada and those have lessened fire activity and intensity.</p><p>[08:35:00]</p><p>WALKER: But experts warn that Canada's wildfire season is off to an unprecedented start. This video shows a massive fire in British Columbia. It is one of 78 active wildfires in that province alone. CNN's Paula Newton with more Canadian officials.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PAULA NEWTON, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Say that there are fewer fires burning now than there were earlier this week. Having said that, you have to keep in mind there are fires burning right across this country, from the west to the east. It is on track already to be the second worst fire season ever in this country. And it will likely be surpassed given the fact that this is still early in that wildfire season.</p><p>Now, having said all of this, what is going to help the most is some cooler, wetter weather moving through some critical regions like Quebec, hopefully in the next few days. This will continue to be a problem though, and I want you to see why.</p><p>Have a look at this map. This is Canada. In fact, North America. That includes Alaska, the boreal zone. It includes millions of hectares of boreal forest. Those places have been susceptible to more wildfires given climate change. It's not a clear pattern, it is incredibly complex. But the fact remains that there have been more wildfires and they emit carbon of their own. That also adds to the climate crisis.</p><p>Given what you see there, officials in the United States and Canada are trying to see if they come up with some kind of joint fire management system that includes better ways to try and manage wildfires in the future. And also obviously trying to pool resources, trying to really not just prevent the fires, but when they see hotspots, get on top of it right away. Having said that, officials say to prepare for what unfortunately will be a very severe wildfire season in the months to come. Paula Newton, CNN, Ottawa.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALKER: Nearly 2 million people remain under air quality alerts related to those fires, including the greater Cleveland area. Joining me now to talk about the health risks is Dr. David Hill, a pulmonologist and chair of the American Lung Association's Public Policy Committee.</p><p>Doctor, really appreciate you joining us. So first off, can you tell us how dangerous or how toxic wildfire smoke is? DR. DAVID HILL, CHAIR, AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION'S PUBLIC POLICY COMMITTEE: So wildfire smoke, particularly at high intensity can be very irritating and cause inflammation in our lungs. The levels we saw on the east coast this past week were unprecedented and really severe air quality that affects particularly at risk groups, but at the levels we saw in New York and the mid-Atlantic states can affect anyone who breathes.</p><p>WALKER: In terms of the symptoms, should people be concerned about just the short-term symptoms or are there going to be long term effects for those who've been exposed?</p><p>HILL: So there are both short term effects that can cause disease and be deadly, and long term effects related to exposure. We know when we have acute events like we saw this week that we see increased disease and death over a period of days to weeks. And we know that long term exposure to particulate pollution, such as wildfire smoke, causes increased lung heart disease and is associated with lung cancer.</p><p>WALKER: So we said, Doctor, that nearly 2 million people are still under air quality alerts. Yes, the air is getting better, but what do you advise for these people in these areas? Should they still be wearing N-95 masks? What kind of precautions should people be taking?</p><p>HILL: So I think, given the degree of wildfires we're seeing, people need to get used to checking air quality along with other factors in the weather report. And if the air quality is bad in the red or purple zones, taking action to avoid exposure, higher risk populations need to be even more aware and be concerned when pollution levels are lower.</p><p>So it's better at the end of this week. But we're still seeing high levels of pollution. Some of it has moved towards the Midwest as opposed to the East Coast. In terms of staying safe, staying indoors and avoiding outside exposures is best. When air pollution is bad, avoiding exercising outdoors is important.</p><p>WALKER: Yes. Some good advice, don't exercise. You could be breathing much heavier and obviously, staying indoors. All right. Dr. David Hill. Appreciate you joining us. Thank you so much.</p><p>HILL: I'm sorry. And it's important to avoid outdoor exposures --</p><p>BLACKWELL: Thank you, Doctor. All right, up next, this is the best story of the day. And we need something to make us feel good, don't we? Amazing story of survival. Four children who'd been missing in the ColombianAmazon rainforest for weeks after a plane crash have been found alive. That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[08:44:17]</p><p>BLACKWELL: Good news alert.</p><p>WALKER: Yes. BLACKWELL: Now this extraordinary rescue. All right. That's a lot of pause in my thought. All right.</p><p>WALKER: Did you want a better reaction?</p><p>BLACKWELL: I was expecting more. Four young children missing in the ColombianAmazon rainforest for 40 days they've been found. Hours ago, they arrived in Colombia's capital city. They were on a military ambulance that airlifted them from the jungle.</p><p>Colombian president Gustavo Petro, says that the children appeared weak when they were rescued and they received medical treatment before they boarded the plane.</p><p>WALKER: The four siblings were found yesterday after a small plane they were traveling on crashed in the jungle. Their mother and two other adult passengers, including the pilot, were killed in the crash.</p><p>[08:45:04]</p><p>Stefano Pozzebon is live in Bogota. Stefano, of course everyone wants to know how the children are doing. I don't know if you have that information, but also tell us how young these children are.</p><p>STEFANO POZZEBON, JOURNALIST: Yes, Amara. This is a story that takes your brain away, and we hear so little good news, just as Victor was saying in these days, and it's frankly something that we should rejoice.</p><p>The children are extremely young. Think, Amara, that one of them, the youngest, she passed her first birthday in the thick of the jungle. She turned one only a couple of weeks ago, and she was only 11 months old when the plane crashed on May the first. This is really a story that has captured this county's imagination. And everybody that has been involved with it is now just rejoicing this moment that it's truly historic.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>POZZEBON (voiceover): A rescue mission successful against all odds. Four children found alive after spending 40 days in the thick of the Amazon jungle, bringing their relatives to tears.</p><p>NARCIZO MUCUTUY, CHILDREN'S GRANDFATHER (through translator): Let them come here to their grandparents, to their aunt and their uncle, their grandmother.</p><p>POZZEBON: Colombian President Gustavo Petro sharing the good news with reporters.</p><p>GUSTAVO PETRO, COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Indigenous, the indigenous and the military together found the kids after 40 days. They were alone. A historical statement of survival today. These are the children of peace and the children of Columbia.</p><p>POZZEBON: The rescue on Friday night caps an all-round effort by hundreds of soldiers and indigenous scouts to locate the little ones who had gone missing since the small plane they were traveling on with their mother crashed in the forest on the 1st May.</p><p>The bodies of their mother and two other adults were soon recovered, but hope never faded to find them alive, the Colombian military finding footprint and scattered relics to keep the search going day after day until finally a photo emerged from the depth of the forest. We have them. They're coming home.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>POZZEBON: And Amara, Victor, in terms of the latest updates, a spokesperson for the Indigenous organization that the children are part of told us just a few minutes ago that the father and the grandparents of the four kids also traveled to Bogota overnight and are now together, reunited finally, in the Central Military hospital just a few miles away from where I am now. And we can imagine just how joyful this moment is for the entire family. Amara, Victor.</p><p>BLACKWEL: Absolutely. 40 days and they held on to hope and faith. How do officials think that these children survive for more than a month there?</p><p>POZZEBON: Yes, Petro -- yesterday, the Colombian president, Gustavo Petro spoke a little bit about that, saying that he thanked the indigenous, brought up the indigenous education. We need to understand that these, forever young as they are also indigenous kids who are used to that type of terrain. They are used to the Amazon rainforest.</p><p>And moreover, the Colombian military has airdropped hundreds of survival kits in the last few weeks to try and make contact with them. We don't know exactly what kept them alive. However, you see, it is just an astonishing result, an astonishing achievement, frankly. Amara. Victor.</p><p>WALKER: Yes. Perhaps, survival kits played quite a critical role for them. Stefano Pozzebon, thank you very much.</p><p>Still ahead, a teenager rescues a baby deer that decided to take a dip in the family pool.

The fox mascot was named after holding a contest that received over 500 submissions from across the country. Arlene S. from Swansea Point, BC submitted the winning name, Ember.</p><p>\u201cMy choice of Ember as the FireSmart fox came from the fact that it only takes an ember to start a fire,\u201d said Arlene, who is a FireSmart representative for her community. \u201cAn ember can turn from a smoldering ground fire to a forest fire in moments.\u201d</p><p>Ember, of the red fox species, will serve as an effective messenger because of her unique characteristics, which include alertness, adaptability, intelligence and community mindedness. Her primary job is to teach people how to apply FireSmart principles to homes, properties, neighbourhoods, communities and the wider landscape. As wildfire season approaches, Ember will become a key part of FireSmart messages, activities and events throughout BC.</p><p>With the introduction of Ember, FireSmart BC will retire Smokey Bear, the U.S. wildfire prevention icon.

Researchers have now quantified the contribution of deadwood to the global carbon cycle.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Living trees absorb a considerable amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and therefore play an important role in the protection of our climate. Little is known about the role of dead trees in the global carbon cycle, though. The decomposition of wood and the recycling of the nutrients it contains are among the most important processes to take place in forests.</p><p>How much carbon is released from decaying wood worldwide? What role do insects play in this process? These questions have now been studied in a global research project established by the Bavarian Forest National Park and coordinated by Julius-Maximilians-Universitat Wurzburg (JMU) and the TUM, both in Bavaria, Germany.</p><p>An experiment at 55 different locations provides the basis</p><p>At 55 forest locations on six continents, researchers laid out wood from more than 140 tree species to assess the influence of the climate on the rate of decomposition. Half of the wood was placed in mesh cages. These cages prevented insects from being involved in the decomposition and allowed quantifying their contribution to wood decomposition..</p><p>The collected data demonstrates that the rate of decomposition and the contribution of insects are highly dependent on the climate, and increase as the temperature rises. Higher levels of precipitation accelerate the decomposition in warmer regions and slow it down in regions where the temperatures are lower.</p><p>50 research groups worldwide completed the three year experiment, sometimes under exceptionally difficult conditions. It was necessary to use elaborate measures to protect some areas from elephants. One area was lost to a forest fire and reconstructed, while another area was flooded.</p><p>Global carbon cycling</p><p>\"On the basis of the experiment, we were able to model the role that deadwood plays in the global carbon cycle,\" explains Rupert Seidl, Professor of Ecosystem Dynamics and Forest Management at the Technical University of Munich (TUM).</p><p>\"According to the report, some 10.9 giga-tons of carbon are released from deadwood worldwide every year. In this context, part of the carbon is absorbed into the soil, while another part is released into the atmosphere. The amount of carbon released from deadwood is equivalent to roughly 115 percent of the emissions from fossil fuels,\" adds Dr. Werner Rammer, a scientist at TUM who played the leading role in the global calculations.</p><p>\"At 93 percent, tropical forests contribute disproportionately to this result due to their high wood mass combined with their rapid decomposition processes. Decomposition in temperate and boreal forests is considerably slower indicating that deadwood stores carbon over long time periods in these regions. Insects account for almost one third of wood decomposition, although this is mostly confined to the tropics. In boreal and temperate forests, the contributions made by insects are small, though,\" explains PD Dr. Sebastian Seibold, lead author of the study.</p><p>The effects of global change</p><p>\"The study highlights the role played by deadwood in the global carbon cycle and the functional importance of insects in the decomposition of wood. In this way, we are closing another gap in the global modelling of carbon cycles,\" explains Professor Jorg Muller, Head of Research at the Bavarian Forest National Park and the Ecological Station at JMU Wurzburg.</p><p>\"At a time of global change, we can see some dramatic declines in biodiversity and changes in climate.

The innovative program, which uses a collaborative approach with federal and local partners, is delivering results in three important ways:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Supporting federal forest collaboratives.</p><p>Delivering current scientific finding to improve understanding of forest restoration.</p><p>Using the state's workforce to reduce the risk of wildfire and restore resiliency to federal forests.</p><p>Researchers from the Ecosystem Workforce Program at the University of Oregon, Oregon State University, and the USDA Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station pored over numbers in the report to determine the program's impact. According to the monitoring report, the program invested $4.41 million of state funds and leveraged an additional $3.5 million from the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) through projects under Good Neighbor Authority (GNA), which allows ODF to sell federal timber to offset the cost of needed restoration projects.</p><p>These investments resulted in:</p><p>Grants to 12 collaborative groups that helped prepare project-level restoration plans totaling 859,174 acres of federal forestland across 32 different planning areas resulting in:</p><p>40,000 acres of forest restoration, timber sales, pre-commercial thinning, and piling of fuels;</p><p>25,000 acres of pile burning and about 3,800 acres of broadcast burning;</p><p>Approximately 210 million board feet of timber sales that supported 486 jobs harvesting or processing timber and 610 jobs in other sectors.</p><p>Technical assistance and scientific analysis projects including:</p><p>Three studies examining historic forest fire and ecological conditions;</p><p>Outreach, communications, and storytelling support for three forest collaboratives.</p><p>Investments in Forest Service and BLM projects that resulted in:</p><p>2 million acres surveyed by LiDAR;</p><p>9,759 acres of NEPA surveys (heritage and botany);</p><p>2,550 acres of non-commercial fuels and prescribed fire treatments;</p><p>Two contracted NEPA Categorical Exclusion projects covering 9,093 acres.</p><p>Why a state program to restore federal forests? During Governor Kitzhaber's administration, state and federal land management officials recognized that the status quo was not working. Citing increasing wildfires, stagnant rural economies and declining forest health, the Oregon Legislature created ODF's Federal Forest Restoration program to pioneer new ways of getting things done. Rather than lawsuits and bureaucratic silos, the program employs a collaborative \"all lands, all hands\" approach.</p><p>The program takes aim at a very large problem. Wildfires are getting bigger and fire season is lasting longer. According to the Governor's Council on Wildfire Response, an estimated 5.6 million acres of Oregon's forests and rangelands need some form of active restoration, such as prescribed burning, fuels reduction, and restoration thinning. These treatments can slow fire's spread and provide important jobs for rural communities.</p><p>These investments also created longer duration jobs for both ODF seasonal employees and local forest contractors. Each year ODF hires hundreds of seasonal firefighters. The program uses ODF crews during the winter and spring months to conduct fuels reduction and restoration work thereby decreasing fire risk and lengthening employment for seasonal employees. These ODF crews accomplished an additional 3,370 acres of thinning and prescribed burning as well as 6,370 acres of commercial and non-commercial project preparation work including layout and tree marking.</p><p>Lastly, the report highlights the benefits of state and federal agencies working together on forest restoration.</p><p>\"The Federal Forest Restoration Program is a model for inter-agency cooperation.

We bent over backwards for three Republican votes,\u201d Messina answered. \u201cWhat is the single most important thing Joe Biden has to do? He has to get his arms around this coronavirus and he has to help the economy rebound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they should just do exactly what the smart people around them, the experts, are saying they have to do. If that means going it alone and passing a $1.9 trillion bill, that's exactly what we should do. We had growth that wasn't as robust as it could have been had we gone big. And so he's not going to make that mistake again,\u201d he continued.</p><p>Biden released the details of his <url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2021/01/14/joe-biden-coronavirus-relief-plan-minimum-wage-payment/\">proposed package</url> in January and has received criticism from Republicans, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2021/02/12/arizona-kyrsten-sinema-opposes-15-minimum-wage-coronavirus-relief/\">some Democrats</url>, over certain aspects, as well as the high cost of the bill. Republicans counter-offered with their own <url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2021/02/01/joe-biden-senate-republicans-stimulus-packages-compare/\">scaled down version</url> of the bill, but negotiations are still ongoing.</p><p>Harlow went on to ask Messina how Democrats going it alone over the package doesn't \u201cbreak a really important promise\u201d that <url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2021/01/20/president-joe-biden-inaugural-address-unity-coronavirus-supporters/\">Biden made</url> to be the \u201cuniter in chief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn't promise to work with the Republicans on every single bill. He said he was going to pull the country together and go forward. And if the Republicans don't want to be there on this bill, he'll work with them on the next one,\u201d Messina responded.</p><p>\u201cIt's not about partisanship. It's not about politics. Unity doesn't mean cutting deals on every single bill. Unity means doing what he did last night and being very clear about where he's going to go. There's a bunch of Republican ideas in that bill and the bill is better for it, but the one thing he's got to do is get this recovery right, and if it takes $1.9 trillion, then go do it,\u201d he concluded.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Jim Messina and Poppy Harlow (Screenshot/CNN)</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYCLR-7123815</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYCLR2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:621H-R1K1-JBFB-H329-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470729</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"405\"/><timeReceived>09:54 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Daily Caller, Inc.

Honoring Dallas and Nathanael Our hearts go out to the Judson College family as they mourn the loss of students Dallas Colburn and Nathanael Madison, killed in a four-vehicle crash on April 20. A public memorial is set for Monday at Herrick Chapel. We wish comfort to all who knew them. </p><p>Oldie but goody Not surprised to see a recurring message recently on the Schaumburg municipal sign outside the police and fire departments. It read: \"phone in one hand, ticket in the other.\" Very important message for distracted drivers. Very unfortunate it still needs to be said. Weather warning was right We've gotten some weather warnings on those windy days about the risk of fire because the air's still dry. Lo and behold, a \"spontaneous fire\" erupted in a South Barrington landscaping company's mulch pile and spread to the nearby Spring Creek Forest Preserve. A forest fire in the suburbs? It's not California, but it still can be frightening. If you say so about Libertyville complex The village of Libertyville has decided to lease its Indoor Sports Complex to a Canadian operator. While the village has lost a million bucks a year on the complex, Canlan Sports leaders \"thought we'd take it for a test run,\" according to a VP for the company. That sounds like they're not overly worried, and the village is happy; it's a win-win. This week's Clippable Quote \"You can cut all the flowers, but you cannot keep spring from coming.\" \u2014 Chilean poet Pablo Neruda. Another Clippable Quote \"People are obviously capable of handling the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. But I don't know how many people have had to experience them within seconds of each other.\" \u2014 two-time Daytona 500 winner Michael Waltrip. Will Bears replace horses? It's happened before and can happen again: the Chicago Bears entertaining thoughts of moving to Arlington Heights. With Arlington Park almost certainly hosting its final horse racing season and the land up for sale, the time is right. No one is commenting publicly. But we hope Arlington Heights is thinking big. Hope springs eternal The roar could be felt throughout the suburbs when the Bears moved up in the first round of the NFL Draft to pick Ohio State quarterback Justin Fields. Have the Bears finally found their franchise QB? At least there's a reason for optimism. Now, we just need Aaron Rodgers to leave the frozen tundra of Lambeau Field for the bright lights of \"Jeopardy!\" Evening stroll Starting next week, Cantigny Park in Wheaton will launch its \"Stroll After Sunset\" program and stay open late on Wednesdays. Visitors will have the opportunity to enjoy the 500-acre park for up to an hour after sunset. Considering how beautiful Cantigny's gardens are during the day, it sounds like a great way to spend a summer evening. Many happy returns This weekend heralds the reopening of Navy Pier and the return of Arlington International Racecourse and the McHenry Outdoor Theater. We are all excited about expanding our entertainment options after the long winter and continuing pandemic, but don't forget to mask where needed and keep a safe distance. Enjoy!</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHDLY-0001267773</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHDLY2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62KC-FGX1-DY6F-J05V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163823</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"532\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Paddock Publications, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Daily Herald</publicationName><edition>WEB EditionNC1 EditionNC2 EditionNC3 EditionNM1 EditionNC EditionNC14 EditionMC1 EditionML2 EditionNL1 EditionNC14C EditionNC4 EditionCLFM EditioneBlast Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 1, 2021 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp;

While it is not clear how much rallygoers spread the virus through secondary infections, state health officials have so far reported 63 cases among South Dakota residents who attended the event.</p><p>The epicenter of the rally, Meade County, has become red-hot with new cases, reaching a per capita rate that is similar to the hardest-hit Southern states. The county reported the highest rate of cases in the state over the last two weeks, according to Johns Hopkins researchers.</p><p>The Black Hills region's largest hospital system, Monument Health, warned Friday that it has seen hospitalizations from the virus rise from five to 78 this month.

Some health officials noted people could have caught the virus elsewhere.</p><p>A team from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined last year's rally looked like a \"superspreader event.\" The team said the event offered a lesson: Such large gatherings can result in \"widespread transmission\" of infections and attendees should follow precautions like getting vaccinated, wearing masks and social distancing.</p><p>The aftermath of this year's rally looks eerily similar to last year - when the event heralded a wave that did not subside until the winter.</p><p>But the pandemic fallout from the rally won't be seen for weeks and an exact case count will likely remain unknown, Osterholm said.</p><p>Daniel Bucheli, a spokesman for the state Department of Health, said the virus spike is following \"a national trend being experienced in every state, not just South Dakota.\"</p><p>He also pointed out that Meade County's vaccination rate of 45% lags behind the statewide rate of 56% eligible people vaccinated.</p><p>The city of Sturgis also downplayed the virus numbers, issuing a statement that blamed the increase in positivity rate on a \"significant increase in testing performed to proactively reduce the spread of COVID-19\" and accusing \"individuals in the national media\" of mischaracterizing the event.</p><p>Despite the more contagious delta variant, this year's motorcycle rally was even bigger than last year. More than 500,000 people showed up during the 10-day rally.</p><p>The streets of Sturgis filled with rallygoers drawn to the libertarian rules of South Dakota - motorcycle helmets weren't required, minimal attire and bodypainting were welcome, and masks were often nowhere in sight. Bikers bellied up to bars and packed into rock shows.</p><p>Two bands that performed at the rally have canceled shows after musicians came down with the virus. Corey Taylor, the lead singer of Slipknot who had embarked on a solo tour, told fans he was \"very, very sick\" from COVID-19, though he did not say where he contracted it.</p><p>\"This is the worst I've ever been sick in my life,\" Taylor said in a Facebook video this week. \"Had I not been vaccinated, I shudder to think how bad it would have been.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BISTRB-10109053</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BISTRB2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63GS-9NH1-JCM7-R1J1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"690\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Bismarck Tribune, a division of Lee Enterprises All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Bismarck Tribune</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 30, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLDH</classCode><className>MOTORSPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000511</classCode><className>DISEASES &amp;

According to a recent report from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a whopping 94% of state and local chambers said businesses were finding it difficult or very difficult to find workers. As summer approaches and many employers move into their busiest season, you may be looking at staffing options you may have never considered in the past, including hiring teen workers, creating internship programs, and offering volunteer opportunities. Any or all of those may be viable options for your organization, but there are a host of potential compliance pitfalls that you need to consider. Here is a guide to bringing aboard minors, interns, and volunteers this summer. </p><p><br/>Employing Minors  <br/>Both federal and state laws restrict the time of day and number of hours that minors can work, the type of work that minors can perform, and the equipment they can use. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) is the federal law that governs child labor and the Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division (WHD) is the agency charged with its enforcement. The FLSA allows states to enact more restrictive child labor laws, so you must be aware of any local restrictions as well. In situations where the federal law and state law differ, you must follow the law that provides the most protection for the minor. <br/>Days and Hours of Employment <br/> Age 18 - Those workers who are 18 and older have no restrictions on the type of work they may perform or their work hours. Ages 16 and 17 - Under the FLSA, minors aged 16 and 17 can be employed for unlimited hours in any occupation other than those deemed hazardous by the Secretary of Labor. This is an area where some state laws differ. For example, Indiana, California, and Ohio have restrictions on the number of hours and times of days this age group may work. Ages 14 and 15 - You are limited in the days and hours you can employ children in this age range as follows: The work must be outside school hours; They can work no more than three hours on a school day, including Fridays, and no more than eight hours on a non-school day; They can work no more than 18 hours in a week when school is in session and no more than 40 hours in a week when school is not in session; and They cannot work before 7 a.m. or after 7 p.m., except from June 1 through Labor Day when they may work until 9 p.m.  <br/>Occupations <br/> Ages 16 and 17 - The FLSA prohibits minors aged 16 and 17 from working in occupations that the Secretary of Labor has declared to be hazardous. Currently, there are 17 Hazardous Occupations: <br/> HO 1. Manufacturing or storing explosives; HO 2. Driving a motor vehicle or work as an outside helper on motor vehicles; HO 3. Coal mining\u2014bans most jobs in coal mining; HO 4. Occupations in forest fire fighting, forest fire prevention, timber tract, forestry service, and occupations in logging and sawmilling operations; HO 5. Power-driven woodworking machines; HO 6. Exposure to radioactive substances and ionizing radiation; HO 7. Power-driven hoisting apparatus; HO 8. Power-driven metal-forming, punching and shearing machines; HO 9. Mining, other than coal; HO 10. Power-driven meat-processing machines, slaughtering and meat and poultry packing plants; HO 11. Power-driven bakery machines; HO 12. Balers, compactors, and power-driven paper-products machines; HO 13. Manufacturing of brick, tile, and related products; HO 14. Power-driven circular saws, band saws, guillotine shears, chain saws, reciprocating saws, wood chippers, and abrasive cutting discs; HO 15. Wrecking, demolition, and ship-breaking operations; HO 16. Roofing operations and work performed on or about a roof; and HO 17. Trenching and excavation operations.  <br/>There are limited exemptions for a few of the hazardous occupations for 16 and 17-year-olds who are apprentices or student-learners enrolled in approved programs. <br/>It is important to keep in mind how these occupations may cross into unexpected areas. In two recent WHD child labor investigations, one involving a grocery store and one a bakery, the child labor violations did not stem from the grocery store's meat slicer or the bakery's dough mixer. Rather, the violation stemmed from the simple task of trash removal where the trash was loaded in a trash compactor, which violated HO 12.  <br/>These investigations serve as good reminders that you should review all of the job duties that will be assigned to minor workers and compare those with DOL's prohibited occupations. You should also check state law, which may have additional restrictions on the types of occupations that employees under 18 can work. <br/>Another area that can create confusion for employers is driving. Under the FLSA, no employee under 17 years of age may drive a motor vehicle on public roads as part of their job. Minors who have reached the age of 17 may drive on public roadways as part of their employment, but only during daylight hours on an 'occasional and incidental' basis, and subject to several other stringent restrictions. Importantly, 17-year-olds are not permitted to make urgent, time-sensitive deliveries, such as pizza deliveries. <br/> Ages 14 and 15 - In addition to Hazardous Occupations, minors aged 14 - 15 are also prohibited from working in: <br/> Manufacturing, mining, or processing occupations; Occupations that involve hoisting apparatus (operating, tending, setting up, adjusting, cleaning, oiling, or repairing); Work performed in or about boiler or engine rooms, including repair and maintenance; Occupations that involve operating, tending, setting up, adjusting, cleaning, oiling, or repairing any power-driven machinery, including but not limited to lawn mowers, golf carts, all-terrain vehicles, trimmers, cutters, weed-eaters, edgers, food slicers, food grinders, food choppers, food processors, food cutters, and food mixers; Operating motor vehicles and serving as helpers on motor vehicles; Outside window washing that involves working from windowsills, and all work requiring the use of ladders, scaffolds, or similar equipment; Very limited baking and cooking activities; Work in freezers and meat coolers and limited work preparing meat for sale; Youth peddling (also known as door-to-door sales); Loading and unloading of goods or property onto or from motor vehicles, railroad cars, or conveyors; Catching and cooping of poultry for transport or for market; Public messenger service; and Occupations in connection with: Transportation of persons or property; Warehousing and storage; Communications and public utilities; and Construction, with exceptions for some office and sales work.  <br/>Limited exceptions to these prohibitions may be available for children enrolled in an approved Work Experience and Career Exploration Program or Work-Study Program. <br/>The child labor regulations provide direction on the types of work youth ages 14 -15 are permitted to perform, including: <br/> Office and clerical work; Work of an intellectual or artistically creative nature; Cooking with electric or gas grills which does not involve cooking over an open flame; Cashiering, selling, modeling, art work, work in advertising departments, window trimming, and comparative shopping; Price marking and tagging by hand or machine, assembling orders, packing, and shelving; Bagging and carrying out customers' orders; Errand and delivery work by foot, bicycle, and public transportation; Clean up work, including the use of vacuum cleaners and floor waxers, and the maintenance of grounds (but not including the use of power-driven mowers, cutters, trimmers, edgers, or similar equipment); Kitchen work and other work involved in preparing and serving food and beverages; Cleaning vegetables and fruits, and the wrapping, sealing, labeling, weighing, pricing, and stocking of items, including vegetables, fruits, and meats, when performed in areas physically separate from a freezer or meat cooler; The loading onto motor vehicles and the unloading from motor vehicles of certain items; and Lifeguarding at traditional swimming pools and water amusement parks (only if 15 years of age and subject to several other restrictions). <br/>Importantly, any job that is not specifically permitted for this age group is prohibited. <br/> Age 13 - Those workers who are 13 or younger may generally: <br/> Deliver newspapers to homes of subscribers or consumers; Baby-sit on a casual basis; Work as an actor or performer in motion pictures, television, theater, or radio; and Work in a business solely owned or operated by the youth's parents (but not in manufacturing, mining or any occupation deemed hazardous by the Secretary of Labor).  <br/>Work Permits/Age Certificates <br/>Work permits and age certificates are not required under the FLSA, but many states require them for workers of certain ages. Work permits are usually issued by the local school authority or the state labor department. States that have work permit requirements generally require employers to review the work permit documentation before hiring a minor. <br/>Some states require that you obtain an age certificate before hiring a minor. These are typically issued by the states in which the minor works, but DOL will issue age certificates if the minor employee's state does not. A valid, unexpired federal certificate of age or a certificate issued by a state designated by DOL provides proof that a minor is at least the minimum age to work in a particular occupation and it may provide a defense to a claim for child labor violations. <br/>Meal and Rest Breaks <br/>In addition to the days and hours of employment requirements, you must also comply with applicable state law obligations related to meal and rest breaks. These generally include provisions on the number of meal and/or rest breaks that must be provided, when they should be provided, and how long they should last. While the FLSA does not require meal or rest breaks, the regulations require that rest breaks that last between 5 and 20 minutes must be paid. Meal periods of 30 minutes or more may be unpaid.  <br/>Postings  <br/>Employers who hire minors may be required to display additional postings. Federal law requires FLSA-covered employers to conspicuously post the 'Employee Rights Under the Fair Labor Standards Act' poster, which includes information related to child labor. Some states have their own separate child labor posters and may also require you to post age-related permits or certificates, a list of the minors employed, or their meal and rest breaks. <br/>Creating Internship Programs  <br/>You may also be considering internship programs to help alleviate your staffing woes. The National Association of Colleges and Employers reported that employers expect to boost their intern hiring by over 22% for the academic year that is wrapping up this summer. However, be careful not to think that internships are a ready-made solution to help you fill open roles or otherwise replace departed employees, as they are not necessarily like-for-like replacements for your paid employees. <br/>As a general rule, the FLSA requires 'for-profit' employers to pay employees for work. In some instances, however, interns and students may not be considered 'employees' and therefore may not be entitled to compensation. <br/>To determine whether an employment relationship exists between and employer and an intern, courts examine the 'economic reality' of the relationship to see which party is the 'primary beneficiary' of the relationship. If the employer is the primary beneficiary, the intern must be paid. If the intern is the primary beneficiary, the intern may be unpaid. <br/>7-Factor Test <br/>The 'primary beneficiary test' includes seven factors. The test is flexible and no single factor is determinative, so the determination about whether the individual should be considered a paid employee or an unpaid intern is made on a case-by-case basis. <br/> The extent to which the intern and employer clearly understood that there is no expectation of compensation (any promise of compensation suggests the intern is an employee); The extent to which the internship provides training that would be similar to that which would be given in an educational environment; The extent to which the internship is tied to the intern's formal education program by integrated coursework or the receipt of academic credit; The extent to which the internship accommodates the intern's academic commitments by corresponding to the academic calendar; The extent to which the internship's duration is limited to the period in which the internship provides the intern with beneficial learning; The extent to which the intern's work complements, rather than displaces, the work of paid employees while providing significant educational benefits to the intern; and The extent to which the intern and the employer understand the internship is conducted without entitlement to a paid job at the conclusion of the internship. <br/>State laws may have separate internship requirements, so you should examine the requirements under both federal and state law. You should also review educational documentation to ensure your internship program aligns with the goals and approach of the intern's educational program. You may want to coordinate with local colleges and universities to define the parameters of the internship program and to obtain assistance identifying candidates who may be interested in an internship. <br/>To avoid blurring lines between employees and interns, you should not use interns to fill open positions. You should also refrain from giving any assurances of a job after the internship ends. <br/>Drafting Volunteers <br/>For public sector and non-profit organizations, volunteers may also be a viable option to ease some of the current strain they are feeling. This is not the case for private sector, for-profit employers. <br/>DOL guidance indicates that a volunteer generally will not be considered an employee for FLSA purposes if the individual freely volunteers for public service, religious, or humanitarian objectives, and without contemplation or receipt of compensation. Examples may include members of a men's or women's organization assisting patients in nursing homes, parents reading to students in a school library, or individuals driving a school bus to transport a school band on a trip. <br/>To be considered a 'volunteer,' the individual: <br/> Typically serves on a part-time basis; Does not displace regular employees or perform work that would otherwise be performed by a regular employee; and Does not expect to receive compensation. <br/>Volunteers who are employed by a non-profit organization may not volunteer to provide the same types of services to their non-profit organization that they are employed to perform. Volunteers may be paid expenses, reasonable benefits, a nominal fee, or any combination thereof for their service without losing their status as volunteers. However, those payments cannot be a substitute for compensation or tied to productivity. <br/>Conclusion  <br/>By understanding the specific rules surrounding volunteers, interns, and minors, you may be able to develop a new crop of valuable talent to your organization this summer. These new relationships could be rewarding to both the individuals you bring aboard and your business. <br/></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

A public memorial is set for Monday at Herrick Chapel. We wish comfort to all who knew them. Oldie but goody Not surprised to see a recurring message recently on the Schaumburg municipal sign outside the police and fire departments. </p><p>It read: \"phone in one hand, ticket in the other.\" Very important message for distracted drivers. Very unfortunate it still needs to be said. Weather warning was right We've gotten some weather warnings on those windy days about the risk of fire because the air's still dry. Lo and behold, a \"spontaneous fire\" erupted in a South Barrington landscaping company's mulch pile and spread to the nearby Spring Creek Forest Preserve. A forest fire in the suburbs? It's not California, but it still can be frightening. If you say so about Libertyville complex The village of Libertyville has decided to lease its Indoor Sports Complex to a Canadian operator. While the village has lost a million bucks a year on the complex, Canlan Sports leaders \"thought we'd take it for a test run,\" according to a VP for the company. That sounds like they're not overly worried, and the village is happy; it's a win-win. This week's Clippable Quote \"You can cut all the flowers, but you cannot keep spring from coming.\" \u2014 Chilean poet Pablo Neruda. Another Clippable Quote \"People are obviously capable of handling the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. But I don't know how many people have had to experience them within seconds of each other.\" \u2014 two-time Daytona 500 winner Michael Waltrip. Will Bears replace horses? It's happened before and can happen again: the Chicago Bears entertaining thoughts of moving to Arlington Heights. With Arlington Park almost certainly hosting its final horse racing season and the land up for sale, the time is right. No one is commenting publicly. But we hope Arlington Heights is thinking big. Hope springs eternal The roar could be felt throughout the suburbs when the Bears moved up in the first round of the NFL Draft to pick Ohio State quarterback Justin Fields. Have the Bears finally found their franchise QB? At least there's a reason for optimism. Now, we just need Aaron Rodgers to leave the frozen tundra of Lambeau Field for the bright lights of \"Jeopardy!\" Evening stroll Starting next week, Cantigny Park in Wheaton will launch its \"Stroll After Sunset\" program and stay open late on Wednesdays. Visitors will have the opportunity to enjoy the 500-acre park for up to an hour after sunset. Considering how beautiful Cantigny's gardens are during the day, it sounds like a great way to spend a summer evening. Many happy returns This weekend heralds the reopening of Navy Pier and the return of Arlington International Racecourse and the McHenry Outdoor Theater. We are all excited about expanding our entertainment options after the long winter and continuing pandemic, but don't forget to mask where needed and keep a safe distance. Enjoy!</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHDLY-0001267673</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHDLY2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62KC-FGX1-DY6F-J028-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163823</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"517\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Paddock Publications, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Daily Herald</publicationName><edition>WEB EditionNC1 EditionNC2 EditionNC3 EditionNM1 EditionNC EditionNC14 EditionMC1 EditionML2 EditionNL1 EditionNC14C EditionNC4 EditionCLFM EditioneBlast Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 1, 2021 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp;

While it is not clear how much rallygoers spread the virus through secondary infections, state health officials have so far reported 63 cases among South Dakota residents who attended the event.</p><p>The epicenter of the rally, Meade County, has become red-hot with new cases, reaching a per capita rate that is similar to the hardest-hit Southern states. The county reported the highest rate of cases in the state over the last two weeks, according to Johns Hopkins researchers.</p><p>The Black Hills region's largest hospital system, Monument Health, warned Friday that it has seen hospitalizations from the virus rise from five to 78 this month. The hospital was bracing for more COVID-19 patients by converting rooms to intensive care units and reassigning staff.</p><p>Virus cases were already on the rise when the rally started, and it's difficult to measure just how much the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally is to blame in a region where local fairs, youth sports leagues and other gatherings have resumed.</p><p>However, Meade County could be a harbinger of things to come for the Upper Midwest as infections ripple from those events, said Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota\u2019s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.</p><p>\u201cThis coronavirus forest fire will keep burning any human wood it can find,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will find you, and it\u2019s so infectious.\u201d</p><p>Health officials in North Dakota, Wyoming, Minnesota and Wisconsin all reported cases among people who attended the rally, with North Dakota also reporting two hospitalizations.

Tens of thousands of people, mostly ultra-Orthodox Jews, gather each year to honor Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai, a 2nd century sage and mystic who is buried there. Large crowds traditionally light bonfires, pray and dance as part of the celebrations.</p><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it a \u201cgreat tragedy,\u201d and said everyone was praying for the victims.</p><p>Media estimated the crowd at about 100,000 people.</p><p>Eli Beer, director of the Hatzalah rescue service, said he was horrified by how crowded the event was, saying the site was equipped to handle perhaps a quarter of the number who were there.</p><p>\u201cClose to 40 people died as a result of this tragedy,\u201d he told the station.</p><p>The incident happened after midnight, and the cause of the stampede was not immediately clear. Videos circulating on social media showed large numbers of ultra-Orthodox Jews packed together in tight spaces.</p><p>A 24-year-old witness, identified only by his first name Dvir, told the Army Radio station that \u201cmasses of people were pushed into the same corner and a vortex was created.\u201d He said a first row of people fell down, and then a second row, where he was standing, also began to fall down from the pressure of the stampede.</p><p>\u201cI felt like I was about to die,\u201d he said.</p><p>Zaki Heller, spokesman for the Magen David Adom rescue service, said 150 people had been hospitalized, several dozen in serious or critical condition. Army Radio, citing anonymous medical officials, said the death toll had risen to 44.</p><p>That would match the death toll of a 2010 forest fire, which is believed to be the deadliest civilian tragedy in the country's history.</p><p>Heller told the station \u201cno one had ever dreamed\u201d something like this could happen. \u201cIn one moment, we went from a happy event to an immense tragedy,\u201d he said.</p><p>Photos from the scene showed rows of wrapped bodies.</p><p>The Israeli military said it had dispatched medics and search and rescue teams along with helicopters to assist with a \u201cmass casualty incident\" in the area. It did not provide details on the nature of the disaster.</p><p>It was the first huge religious gathering to be held legally since Israel lifted nearly all restrictions related to the coronavirus pandemic. The country has seen cases plummet since launching one of the world's most successful vaccination campaigns late last year.</p><p>Health authorities had nevertheless warned against holding such a large gathering.</p><p>But when the celebrations started, the Public Security Minister Amir Ohana, police chief Yaakov Shabtai and other top officials visited the event and met with police, who had deployed 5,000 extra forces to maintain order.</p><p>Ohana, a close ally of Netanyahu, thanked police for their hard work and dedication \u201cfor protecting the well-being and security for the many participants\u201d as he wished the country a happy holiday.</p><p>Netanyahu is struggling to form a governing coalition ahead of a Tuesday deadline, and the national tragedy is sure to complicate those efforts.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-cf9f6e159d03efdb42dcf2d401beefc220210430</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62JN-0791-JC5B-G0WM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"550\"/><timeReceived>3:48 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"04\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>April 30, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Today's call will be hosted by Martin Juravsky, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mr. John Reid, President and Chief Executive Officer of Russel Metals Inc. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the meeting over to Mr. Martin Juravsky. Please go ahead, sir.</p><p>MARTIN LEB JURAVSKY, EXECUTIVE VP, CFO &amp; SECRETARY, RUSSEL METALS INC.: Great. Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. I plan on providing an overview of the Q1 2023 results. And if you want to follow along, I'll be using the PowerPoint slides that are on our website and just go to the Investor Relations section. If you go to Page 3, you can read our cautionary statement on forward-looking information.</p><p>So let me begin with just a little bit of perspective on the quarter before I go into the detail. In Q1, we were very pleased with the financial results as we saw a pickup in performance across our business units. In addition, we advanced a number of internal initiatives related to our CapEx programs, systems, safety and professional development of our staff. All these initiatives have set the stage for long-term growth of our business. We also published our inaugural sustainability report, which you can find through the link on the main page of our website.</p><p>We are very proud of our sustainability accomplishments, including a very low carbon footprint as measured on both an absolute basis as well as relative to our industry peers, strong governance and attention safety and engagement in our communities.</p><p>So let's begin with going to Page 5 to have a little bit of a discussion around market conditions. Steel prices picked up late in Q4 and continue that trend into Q1. In particular, both plate and sheet had price increases on the heels of higher scrap prices and remain at levels that are above historical frames of reference. As you can see from the charts that are on the right-hand side of the page, supply chain inventories are modest in both Canada and the U.S. And when combined with the recent pickup in demand, it allows the industry to be well positioned from a supply and demand perspective.</p><p>Specifically on the demand side, we are seeing broad-based support from our customer base as we are focused on the industrial side of the North American economy, which from our lands is doing quite well. I think the industrial side of the economy is still playing catch-up with pent-up demand, and we are seeing favorable demand dynamics coming from onshoring of North American manufacturing, infrastructure products, projects, spending on renewable energy and as well as a variety of other areas of demand.</p><p>If we go to Page 6, you can see a snapshot of our Q1 results. We saw a sequential pickup in revenues, EBITDA, margins and returns. If we look across the various charts going from top left, revenues were $1.2 billion versus $1.1 billion in Q4. EBITDA was $116 million versus $97 million in Q4 due to a pickup from each of our business segments. We saw an approximate 100 basis point pickup in EBITDA margins and solid results from each of our segments. From a bottom line perspective, EPS and return on capital also improved with EPS of $1.19 per share and Q1 2023 annualized return on capital of 27%. We continue to deliver exceptional results.</p><p>In terms of capital structure, we have net cash of $105 million versus net debt of almost $500 million at the end of 2019. The $600 million increase in free cash flow gives us a lot of financial flexibility going forward. In particular, we are pursuing a range of strategic initiatives that we think should grow the business, and I'll talk about those items in a few more minutes.</p><p>If we go to Page 7, I'll go through a few items related to our detailed financials. From an income statement perspective, at the top of the page, I covered a number of the high-level items already, but a few other items of note. Revenues of $1.2 billion or 8% higher than Q4. On margins, service centers and steel distributors improved while energy field stores were once again our highest margin segment. Interest expense came down to $4 million as the increase in interest rates is allowing us to generate interest income on our growing cash reserves. Overall, we generated earnings of $74 million and earnings per share of $1.19 per share.</p><p>Our Q4 results were impacted by a few nonoperating items. For the case of TriMark, we picked up $9 million for our share of their earnings and $4 million of cash flow came in from dividends through Trimark in Q1. Stock-based compensation had a $4 million negative impact in the quarter versus $2 million in Q4. We had a small $3 million decrease in our inventory and RV reserves as the improvement in steel prices reduced the inventory risk and the inventory provision.</p><p>From a cash flow perspective, in Q1, we used $18 million for working capital. There were a number of moving pieces with accounts receivable going up due to improved sales activity and AP coming up as well, all the while inventory was relatively unchanged. CapEx of $14 million was similar to Q4, but higher than last year at this time as we are continuing to advance a series of value-added equipment projects and facility modernizations. As we said in the past, our annual CapEx should pick up and be around $75 million on average for the next couple of years.</p><p>From a balance sheet perspective, we are in a net cash position with net cash of a little over $100 million, which is made up of our term notes of $300 million that is more than offset by a cash position of a little over $400 million. Our liquidity is almost $800 million. Our book value is up again and is now approximately $26 per share.</p><p>Lastly, we have increased our quarterly dividend from $0.38 per share per quarter to $0.40 per share per quarter, and I'll talk about that to give a little bit more context to it in a few more minutes. If we go to Page 8, you can see our EBITDA variance between last quarter and this quarter. And looking at service centers, the large pickup in volume was the biggest factor in Q1 as it added around $23 million of EBITDA to the quarter. Margins picked up a bit as we moved through the quarter, and that could trade about $7 million of additional EBITDA by the service centers.</p><p>The operating cost for service centers did pick up a little bit as we had higher volumes and higher incentive-based compensation for that business unit. Energy field stores improved by approximately $6 million in the quarter as the capital spending in the sector continues, and steel distributors improved by about $7 million due to the pickup in steel prices.</p><p>There was a $12 million unfavorable variance in the other category, which included the slightly lower earnings in Q1 versus Q4 from TriMark, the seasonal impact of our Thunder Bay terminal operation and that should shift back the other direction in Q2 and the mark-to-market on stock-based compensation with the increase in our share price.</p><p>If we go to Page 9 of some of the segmented P&amp;L information. The service centers continue to do well as the market improved. Revenues margin EBIT picked up and mostly impact was late in Q1, so we think there is a favorable dynamic heading into the early part of Q2. In Energy field stores, we are continuing to see positive market sentiment. Overall, market conditions remain upbeat as we look into 2023, although there is typically some softening in Q2 due to the Canadian spring breakup phenomenon.</p><p>Gross margins came in at 27% for energy field stores and have remained in that 25% to 30% range since the monetization of the OCTG/Line pipe business in mid-2021. Distributors revenues was down slightly for the quarter, but margins and operating profit were up as they benefited from improving steel prices and a favorable product mix.</p><p>If we go to Page 10, we're having a deeper dive on some of the metrics specifically related to our metal service center business. The top right graph is the last 5 years for tons shipped. And as you can see, the typical Q1 dynamic is a pickup from the seasonally impacted Q4, and we did see that in a very positive way this past quarter.</p><p>In Q1 2023, we had a 16% increase in tonnage and experienced the highest volume quarter that we have seen for several years. Demand continues to look solid into the early part of Q2. On the bottom left graph, we have the revenues and costs that is sold per tonne. Our revenue per tonne even though there was a decline for the quarter versus Q4, we did start to see that trend shift late in Q1 with a 3% increase in March versus February.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, we are continuing to see pricing levels that are higher than the long-term historical average. For cost of goods sold, it did come down faster than our selling prices as we realized on the lag effect of lower cost inventory in our system. The bottom right graph shows gross margins and EBITDA per tonne. Margins picked up by about $20 per tonne versus Q4 and remain well above historical levels.</p><p>The current margin profile of $464 per ton remains healthy as we're seeing the continuing benefits from good demand and the increase in value-added processing in the portfolio have an impact on our results. On Page 11, we have shown our inventory turns. This chart shows inventory turns by quarter for each segment with Energy in red service centers in green and steel distributors in yellow. In addition, the black line is the average for the entire company, a few high-level takeaways.</p><p>Overall, our inventory turns improved slightly in the quarter from 3.7% to 3.9%. When we benchmark ourselves versus our publicly traded peers, we are generally the top performer on this metric by sector, Service Centers improved a bit from 4.2 to 4.5. Energy field stores was flat at around 3 and for steel distributors and allowed inventory turns increased from 2.7 to 3.2 as our inventory position declined in the quarter as we realized on backlog in that business.</p><p>If we go to Page 12, you can see the impact of the inventory turns on inventory dollars. Total inventory came down by about $60 million from December 31. This was mostly a reduction in steel distributors that was offset by increased energy field stores and increase in energy field stores was really to serve its growing backlog of business.</p><p>The service center saw a $12 million reduction in inventory, which is mostly due to a reduction in average cost of inventory as opposed to tonnage. Overall, our inventories are in pretty good shape as we have achieved a really nice balance between managing capital prudently and serving our customers in the marketplace.</p><p>If we go to Page 13, you can see the overall impact on capital utilization and returns. Our capital deployment is up a little bit to around $1.5 billion. More importantly, our returns continue to be industry-leading with a strong start to 2023. Our LTM returns stand at 31%. If we go to Page 14, I want to update our capital structure. The continuation of favorable market conditions and our disciplined approach to capital utilization has given us a lot of financial flexibility.</p><p>On the left table, you can see that our cash position went up to $401 million, which was a $255 million increase over the past year and $38 million increase just in the past quarter. As I said earlier, we are realizing the return on our cash balance that substantially offset the interest cost on our outstanding term notes. Our equity base continues to grow and is now over $1.6 billion. And if you look at the chart on the right, you can see the continuation of the last number of years. Our book value per share is now $25.90 which is an almost $11 increase over the past 2 years.</p><p>If we go to Page 15, we have an update on our capital allocation priorities going forward. Given our strong balance sheet, we have a multipronged approach to capital allocation. For investment opportunities, we continue to seek average returns over the cycle, greater than 15%, and we have consistently delivered well above that target. The ongoing initiatives are threefold. We are continuing to identify and pursue new value-added projects. We moved forward on a number of series of projects in both Canada and the U.S. in the past quarter, and we're seeing more and more opportunities ahead of us that we continue to target.</p><p>Two, folly modernizations. We're moving forward with expansions and upgrading projects in (inaudible), Joplin, Missouri and Little Rock, Arkansas. These projects will evolve over 2023 and into 2024. In addition, we are looking at potential projects in several other locations where we have legacy setups that can be upgraded and consolidated into newer modern operations. These facilities will allow for volume growth, increase operating efficiencies, improve health and safety conditions. And in some cases, they will also allow for the monetization of higher value legacy real estate.</p><p>In terms of acquisitions, we remain committed to our financial and operational criteria. That being said, the deal pipeline remains active. In terms of returning capital to shareholders, we have adopted a flexible approach for dividends. As I said earlier, we have increased our dividends to $0.40 per share per quarter from $0.38. For the NCIB, we have acquired 1 million shares under the current plan and of 2.2 million shares of availability under that program.</p><p>If we go to Page 16, I want to give a little bit more context to our dividend increase. Russel has had a history of dividend increases having rate dividend 4x between 2009 and 2014, however, it has been a static dividend for the past 9 years. That being said, if we look back at the last 5 years, we generated almost $18 per share in earnings and paid out a cumulative dividend of $7.60 over those 5 years, which equates to about a 42% payout ratio.</p><p>Our change in business mix over the past few years has resulted in lower free cash flow volatility, stronger earnings power and a very strong capital structure. Therefore, we feel very comfortable to increase our dividend to $0.40 and also maintain our ability to pursue a range of other capital allocation scenarios. Going forward, we plan to periodically review our dividend level for potential future modifications by considering the prevailing market condition as well as our earnings, capital structure and alternative uses of capital.</p><p>In closing, on behalf of John and other members of the management team, I'd like to express our appreciation to everyone within the Russel family. 2023 is off to a great start. We are very pleased with our financial results, but equally important, we were very pleased with the series of initiatives that led to record low health and safety incidents. Thanks to everyone across the company for your contributions on all fronts.</p><p>That concludes my introductory remarks. So Operator, you can please now open the line up for questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) And your first question will be from Michael Doumet at Scotiabank.</p><p>MICHAEL DOUMET, ANALYST, SCOTIABANK GLOBAL BANKING AND MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: So maybe first question, just on the sequential margin improvement in metals service centers. I think in your outlook, you highlighted that demand trends, steel prices increase continue into Q2. I think you also in a different section of your opening commentary, you talked about the reduced average cost of inventory. So wondering whether that implies so far higher revenue per ton and EBITDA per ton so far into Q2 and just how maybe you view the balance of Q2 in that segment?</p><p>MARTIN LEB JURAVSKY: Yes. It's a good question, Michael, because the dynamics that occurred within the quarter, we're heading in the right direction. So we had positive trends when we look at Q1 versus Q4 as it relates to overall margins, but the margins got better through the back end of the quarter than the front end of the quarter. And we're seeing positive margin dynamics in the early stage of Q2 as well. So said another way, our margins that we're seeing in April were slightly better than the margins that we saw for Q1 on average.</p><p>MICHAEL DOUMET: Got it. That's helpful. And maybe just changing topics here. The fact that you guys have effectively no net leverage, just amazing because presumably, well, this business is working capital heavy. I'm assuming competitors are being more challenged with interest costs and credit availability. Do you think that's translating or maybe they'll translate into market share gains and potentially eventually M&amp;A?</p><p>JOHN GREGORY REID, CEO, PRESIDENT &amp; DIRECTOR, RUSSEL METALS INC.: I think you're spot on there. I think it's going to give us some opportunities in both in market share gains, and we're seeing that now. A lot of that is being led by our value-added initiatives, and so we're able to become more sticky with our customers. And again, putting our balance sheet in a position relative to our competitors. I think it opens opportunities for M&amp;A, but we'll remain very disciplined into our criteria.</p><p>MARTIN LEB JURAVSKY: And John, it's fair to say, too, that when we actually look at the industry data, this is not just a new phenomenon. If we look back where we are today versus the period pre-COVID, we gained market share.</p><p>JOHN GREGORY REID: Yes. That's right.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question will be from Ian Gillies at Stifel.</p><p>IAN BROOKS GILLIES, DIRECTOR OF INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH AND RESEARCH ANALYST OF ENERGY SERVICES &amp; INFRASTRUCTURE, STIFEL NICOLAUS CANADA INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: With respect to the strength in HRC prices through Q1, is there any reason to think that you won't be able to pass those on to your customers through Q2 as you're actually selling that inventory because there seems to be some commentary around demand being weak in certain instances. And I'm just trying to get your view on how that dynamic is playing out.</p><p>JOHN GREGORY REID: If you look at the market right now, we're seeing a little bit of pressure on HRC due to scrap prices going down. We're not having any trouble passing it on. Keep in mind, I think Martin mentioned earlier, our turns are at 4.5x. So we're moving through our inventory much faster than the rest of the market. So we're not seeing any trouble since we're sustaining those high margins that we saw at the end of the quarter. So we're not very concerned about that and the ability to pass those on. We'll watch the market. But again, I think this is more of a dynamic we scrub we're not seeing a lot of opportunities that are out there right now at attractive levels. Demand is very solid. So again, I think you'll see scrap bounce along here and impact HRC up and down.</p><p>IAN BROOKS GILLIES: Okay. That's helpful. And switching gears to the energy products side. It's obviously early days and it's horrible related to the Alberta wildfires. But is there any update you can provide on what your intentions are for that business to do in the near term here? I know it's typically a seasonally weak quarter, but nonetheless, would be helpful.</p><p>MARTIN LEB JURAVSKY: Yes. It's fair to say. And you're right. The forest fire dynamic is just out difficult for people operating in those situations. It hasn't had that direct impact on what we've seen in the normal seasonal dynamic that happens in Canada at this time of the year because of spring breakup. Hopefully, everybody is able to work through the (inaudible) situation out west. But in terms of that being the cause and effect of what we're seeing in our business, generally speaking, what we're seeing from our energy business in Canada, also in the U.S. is just a generally positive trend. Yes, there's going to be mother nature that comes to play every now again for parts of the year. But we're trying to see through that. And the trend for that segment is pretty positive.</p><p>IAN BROOKS GILLIES: Okay. That's helpful. And then if I could maybe just sneak in one last one with respect to steel distributors. I mean, the margins there were great during the quarter. Has that continued on into the second quarter? Or is that business normalized out? Just I'm trying to get a sense of what's happening there.</p><p>JOHN GREGORY REID: It's normalizing out, Ian, and there were some timing things that we had some material bill up at the port came in late Q4. And so it flowed into Q1 to say we're able to monetize that in the market change, but they'll normalize out as we go through Q2.</p><p>OPERATOR: Next question will be from Frederick Felicia at Raymond James.</p><p>FELICIA FREDERICK: There are concerns right now that the tightening credit environment will finally catch up to the segments of the construction sector that have thus far been resilient. Just wondering what your thoughts are on this and whether you're seeing -- starting to see cracks at all in sort of the big steel heavy projects that you're helping support?</p><p>MARTIN LEB JURAVSKY: The short answer is no right now. I mean how things evolve over the medium to long term with the economy. And I think it goes to broader issues in terms of interest rates and inflation that are still out there. Those are -- those may or may not become relevant as things unfold. But the part of the economy of deal that we deal with is still doing fine. At the margin, there may be some pauses in individual projects here and there in the regions here and there. But looking at things in their totality across the segments that we deal with, and we deal with a very broad range of industrial type consumers. The broader dynamic is very good. Yes, there's little spots here and there where there may be some softening, but that's always going to be the case when we look across the portfolio. But on average, things are pretty good, how things evolve more over the medium to longer term. Our crystal ball doesn't go out that far, but the short term is generally pretty solid.</p><p>FELICIA FREDERICK: The other question I have is around renewable power. There's a lot of investments being made in North America now to support the energy transition, et cetera. And I recall this was sort of an end market that you were feeling pretty good about. Can you provide a bit of an update here and whether that comment you made in the past is still stands?</p><p>MARTIN LEB JURAVSKY: Thanks, Fred. It's -- yes, we're very positive right now on the renewable wind solars. We're seeing that money start to slow down in the U.S. in the initial stages, we think it will have a big impact in Q4 of this year. And so we'll see it affect the plate market pretty dramatically. So we're pretty bullish on what's going on there.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Your next question will be from Michael Tupholme at TD Securities.</p><p>MICHAEL TUPHOLME, RESEARCH ANALYST, TD SECURITIES EQUITY RESEARCH: A quick question about the energy field stores segment and also looking at the JV earnings. So energy field stores, you saw an improvement sequentially in EBIT. The JV earnings, though, were down a little bit (inaudible) much so strong but down a bit sequentially. So I'm just -- I realize they're different businesses, but at the same time, it seems like the driver here is really just the improvement in the energy sector and the level of activity, and I would have thought that both would generally move in the same direction. So just kind of looking for a bit of a clarification on why they moved in ops direction sequentially.</p><p>JOHN GREGORY REID: So keep in mind, the OCTG/Line Pipe or the JV, again, is driven by the downhole, the big project when they have it's timing of the project and really our field stores is driven by what's going on in the market, but they have a big large maintenance component. And so they maintain it for the life of the well as well as the installation of the well. So they get some of these pickups intermittently in the period when you get wells going in for the JV may have a well go in and going to a low, they will go throughout. And so they'll see that consistent maintenance and MRO type business that you won't see in the JV.</p><p>MARTIN LEB JURAVSKY: The contrast between those 2 businesses is part of the reason we did what we did back in 2021. They both touch on energy, but in different ways. And we feel pretty good about the field stores as being a good part of our portfolio on the long-term basis because of the dynamics that John talked about, and there are very different dynamics that impact the volatility and seasonality on OCTG/Line Pipe. So in some ways, it's a little bit of a micro test that confirms the path that we started down a couple of years ago in separating out those businesses and monetizing those OCTG/Line Pipe.</p><p>MICHAEL TUPHOLME: Okay. That makes sense. Second question, I don't think you were often asked about this, but corporate expenses this quarter looks somewhat higher than certainly than they were a year ago, but also just higher than they've been in general over recent quarters. So wondering if there's anything to sort of explain that? And then secondly, how to think about corporate expenses going forward?</p><p>MARTIN LEB JURAVSKY: Yes. So there's a variety of moving pieces in there. But using Q1 as a baseline of this year is a good place to start, Mike. When you look at year-over-year comparisons, there's a variety of things that are in play. One is you do have mark-to-market on stock-based comp that has some variability into it. You've seen some inflation and also the way the connectivity to variable comp also flows in there as well. So as market conditions improve or as market conditions come down and profitability goes up and profitability comes down, the variable comp moves with it. That's why you will see some variance in corporate expenses.</p><p>And then the last piece is there is some inflation that is occurring this year versus last year across all parts of the economy, and that's one place that we're seeing it.</p><p>MICHAEL TUPHOLME: Okay. So what we saw this quarter, do you think that's a reasonable way to think about it over coming quarters for this year?</p><p>MARTIN LEB JURAVSKY: Yes, that's a good starting point for your model, Mike.</p><p>MICHAEL TUPHOLME: Okay. Perfect. And then the comment you had in the release just regarding the fact that you had evaluated a number of potential acquisitions in the quarter. I mean I know this is part of the strategy, and it gets talked about on quarterly calls quite regularly. I don't recall seeing a comment like that in the release. So just wondering if maybe just clarify for starters, if that is, in fact, sort of new and the motivation for including that. And maybe more importantly, like maybe just comment on the pipeline and what you are seeing in terms of the opportunity set right now given the strength of the balance sheet.</p><p>MARTIN LEB JURAVSKY: Yes. I actually don't remember of kind of what we have said or hasn't set in the past to be perfectly honest. But in terms of capturing where things are right now, it is active. Now that being said, we've seen a lot of deal activity in terms of potential deal flow over the past period. But I think there were -- it was hard to find the right situations for us as we look back to 2022. I'm probably more optimistic today in terms of the situations that are in and around us. But there's still some more to be chopped in order to move things forward. But I'm more optimistic about the pipeline that I'm seeing today and the pipeline that we are seeing, say, 6 months ago.</p><p>MICHAEL TUPHOLME: Okay. And is it primarily the U.S. that we should be thinking about is really the focus area and more specifically service centers in the U.S.</p><p>JOHN GREGORY REID: Yes. But keep in mind, we've said that for years, and then we end up doing something in Canada along the way. So we will remain opportunistic. But ideally, yes, it would be U.S. service centers that we're focused on.</p><p>OPERATOR: And at this time, gentlemen, we have no other questions registered. Please proceed with closing remarks.</p><p>MARTIN LEB JURAVSKY: Great, thank you, Operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out at any time. Otherwise, we look forward to staying in touch during the balance of the quarter. Thank you, everyone.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this does indeed conclude your conference call for today. Once again, thank you for attending.

(AP) \u2014 Rumbles from the motorcycles and rock shows of the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally have hardly cleared from the Black Hills of South Dakota, and the reports of COVID-19 infections among rallygoers are already streaming in \u2014 178 cases across five states, according to contact tracers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the three weeks since <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-health-coronavirus-pandemic-south-dakota-sd-state-wire-b729c1e92cb7e0f74c12343c483f9474\">the rally kicked off</url>, coronavirus cases in South Dakota<url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-coronavirus-pandemic-south-dakota-sd-state-wire-033ae7a5d0953fcf34849ba7873dc417\">have shot up at a startling pace</url> \u2014 sixfold from the early days of August. While it is not clear how much rallygoers spread the virus through secondary infections, state health officials have so far reported 63 cases among South Dakota residents who attended the event.</p><p>The epicenter of the rally, Meade County, has become red-hot with new cases, reaching a per capita rate that is similar to the hardest-hit Southern states. The county reported the highest rate of cases in the state over the last two weeks, according to Johns Hopkins researchers.</p><p>The Black Hills region's largest hospital system, Monument Health, warned Friday that it has seen hospitalizations from the virus rise from five to 78 this month. The hospital was bracing for more COVID-19 patients by converting rooms to intensive care units and reassigning staff.</p><p>Virus cases were already on the rise when the rally started, and it's difficult to measure just how much the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally is to blame in a region where local fairs, youth sports leagues and other gatherings have resumed.</p><p>However, Meade County could be a harbinger of things to come for the Upper Midwest as infections ripple from those events, said Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota\u2019s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.</p><p>\u201cThis coronavirus forest fire will keep burning any human wood it can find,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will find you, and it\u2019s so infectious.\u201d</p><p>Health officials in North Dakota, Wyoming, Minnesota and Wisconsin all reported cases among people who attended the rally, with North Dakota also reporting two hospitalizations. Some health officials noted people could have caught the virus elsewhere.</p><p>A team from the <url normalizedValue=\"https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/73/Supplement_1/S106/6257584\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined last year's rally looked like a \u201csuperspreader event.\"</url> The team said the event offered a lesson: Such large gatherings can result in \u201cwidespread transmission\u201d of infections and attendees should follow precautions like getting vaccinated, wearing masks and social distancing.</p><p>The aftermath of this year's rally looks <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-ap-top-news-nd-state-wire-sd-state-wire-ne-state-wire-3ea1a021f82fee05736f22138df90ddf\">eerily similar to last year</url> \u2014 when the event heralded a wave that did not subside until the winter.</p><p>But the pandemic fallout from the rally won\u2019t be seen for weeks and an exact case count will likely remain unknown, Osterholm said.</p><p>Daniel Bucheli, a spokesman for the state Department of Health, said the virus spike is following \u201ca national trend being experienced in every state, not just South Dakota.\u201d</p><p>He also pointed out that Meade County\u2019s vaccination rate of 45% lags behind the statewide rate of 56% eligible people vaccinated.</p><p>The city of Sturgis also downplayed the virus numbers, issuing a statement that blamed the increase in positivity rate on a \u201csignificant increase in testing performed to proactively reduce the spread of COVID-19\" and accusing \u201cindividuals in the national media\u201d of mischaracterizing the event.</p><p>Despite the more contagious delta variant, this year's motorcycle rally was <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-sd-state-wire-b5f40e85f564ea1998e8db9446fed3fe\">even bigger than last year.</url> More than 500,000 people showed up during the 10-day rally.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-health-coronavirus-pandemic-south-dakota-sd-state-wire-b729c1e92cb7e0f74c12343c483f9474\">The streets of Sturgis filled with rallygoers drawn to the libertarian rules of South Dakota</url> \u2014 motorcycle helmets weren't required, minimal attire and bodypainting were welcome, and masks were often nowhere in sight. Bikers bellied up to bars and packed into rock shows.</p><p>Two bands that performed at the rally have canceled shows after musicians came down with the virus. Corey Taylor, the lead singer of Slipknot who had embarked on a solo tour, told fans he was \u201cvery, very sick\u201d from COVID-19, though he did not say where he contracted it.</p><p>\u201cThis is the worst I\u2019ve ever been sick in my life,\u201d Taylor said in a Facebook video this week. \u201cHad I not been vaccinated, I shudder to think how bad it would have been.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-6446e345441fe62c74ec88de5bd9ae3d20210828</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63G9-PBW1-JC5B-G52Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304479</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"691\"/><timeReceived>2:46 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;
