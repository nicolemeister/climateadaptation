These adaptations range from particularly thick bark, which protects the sensitive cambium in the trunk from the fire, to the cones of certain types of pine, which open only due to the heat of fire, allowing a quick regeneration and recovery of affected woodland .</p><p>AI is accelerating ecosystem models</p><p>\"The interaction between climate, forest fires, and other processes in the forest ecosystem is very complex, and sophisticated process-based simulation models are required to take account of the different interactions appropriately,\" explains Prof. Seidl. A method that has been developed at TUM is using artificial intelligence to significantly expand the field of use of these complex models.</p><p>This method involves the training of a deep neural network in order to imitate the behavior of a complex simulation model as effectively as possible. The neural network learns on the basis of how the ecosystem responds to differing environmental influences, but does so using only a fraction of the computing power that would otherwise be necessary for large-scale simulation models. \"This allows us to carry out spatially high-resolution simulations of areas of forest that stretch across several million hectares,\" explains scientist Dr. Werner Rammer.</p><p>Forecast for the forests in Yellowstone National Park</p><p>The simulations completed by the team of scientists include simulations for the \"Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem\", which has the world-famous Yellowstone National Park at its heart. This area, which is approximately 8 million hectares in size, is situated in the Rocky Mountains and is largely untouched. The researchers at the TUM have worked with American colleagues to determine how different climate scenarios could affect the frequency of forest fires in this region in the 21st century, and which areas of forest cannot regenerate successfully following a forest fire.</p><p>Depending on the climate change scenario, the study has found that by the end of the century, the current forest coverage will have disappeared in 28 to 59 percent of the region. Particularly affected were the forests in the sub-alpine zone near the tree line, where the species of tree are naturally less adapted to fire, and the areas on the Yellowstone Plateau, where the relatively flat topography is mostly unable to stop the fire from spreading.</p><p>Climate change is causing significant changes to forest ecosystems</p><p>The regeneration of the forest in the region under investigation is at threat for several reasons: If the fires get bigger and the distances between the surviving trees also increase, too few seeds will make their way onto the ground. If the climate gets hotter and drier in the future, the vulnerable young trees won't survive, and if there are too many fires, the trees won't reach the age at which they themselves yield seeds.</p><p>\"By 2100, the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem is expected to have changed more than it has in the last 10,000 years, and will therefore look significantly different than it does today,\" explains Rammer. \"The loss of today's forest vegetation is leading to a reduction in the carbon which is stored in the ecosystem, and will also have a profound impact on the biodiversity and recreational value of this iconic landscape.\"</p><p>Sign up for the Eurasia Review newsletter.

In the next step, the research team will be using AI to estimate the long-term impact of the problems caused by climate change in the forests of Europe.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUSRVW-225148974</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUSRVW2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:634X-5T41-F11P-X4PR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417294</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"700\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Buzz Future LLC Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Eurasia Review</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35455\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 14, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

Yet there is a big disconnect between these global and local warnings on the one side, and preventive actions at the state and national levels on the other. Meanwhile, global carbon emissions reached an alarming record high in June, which should worry all, especially those living along the U.S. coastlines.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The problem is that unlike COVID-19, where a direct connection is made between the virus and illness, the link between climate change and disasters is indirect, as with a sinking land along the East Coast or the forest fires on the West Coast. Which is why policymakers and the media must make the climate connection <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">during</emphasis> catastrophes, to help change mindsets on climate action.</p><p>It is true that attribution of the extent of a specific disaster to climate change - be it Hurricane Sandy on the Atlantic Coast in 2012 or the condominium collapse in Surfside, Fla. - is not straightforward, and ironclad evidence of causation is not always at hand. Heavy rain and wind gusts from Tropical Storm Elsa in the U.S. brought a fatality, injuries, power outages, and flooding from Florida on up the East Coast, including flash flood warnings for Delaware and New Jersey (and meanwhile, two short-lived tornadoes hit South Jersey).</p><p>Even if it is difficult to pin the \"causality\" for storms like Elsa on global warming, the collective evidence signals that climate change is the underlying factor behind the rising frequency of extreme floods and storms. In the triage of responses, climate action must be a top priority, along with correcting engineering and managerial lapses.</p><p>Since 1960, the world has seen a tenfold increase in extreme hazards of nature, with the impacts proving deadliest in low-lying coastlines such as those along the Atlantic, and in regions highly exposed to heat waves like the Northwest. Warming air raises sea levels to dangerous levels and flooding lowers the ground level through inundation. For the past two decades, the global sea level has risen 0.1 inches a year, with Philadelphia exceeding that average, with a worrisome outlook. Miami is barely six feet above sea level.</p><p>Multiple factors turn hazards of nature into disasters. Managerial and engineering factors would seem to have contributed to Florida's condominium devastation. After all, the adjacent twin structure in the Florida condominium complex that did not collapse faced the same climate conditions as the 12-story Champlain Tower South - the one that did. A 2018 report had flagged \"major structural damage\" to the concrete slab beneath the ground-level pool deck.</p><p>But heightened environmental risk has been an overarching factor in the devastating events along the East Coast, including the condominium collapse. Champlain Tower South was constructed on reclaimed wetlands and sits on a barrier island facing an ocean that has risen about a foot in the past century. Underneath it is sand and organic fill brought in from the bay after mangroves were deforested. The fill sinks spontaneously, and the subsidence deteriorates as the water table rises. A 2020 study had found that the land beneath the complex had been sinking since the 1990s.</p><p>On the West Coast, arson or not putting out a cigarette can trigger a forest fire, but it is climate change making the fires more frequent and deadly. Lack of readiness could have contributed to the destructive force of Australia's bush fires of 2019 and 2020, but their frequency and intensity are rising due to climate change. Inadequate warning and evacuation were immediate factors in the impact of Typhoon Haiyan - among the strongest on record - in the Philippines in 2013, but high sea levels caused the storm's unprecedented fury.</p><p>Climate change is identified as eliminating the atmospheric protective barrier against hurricanes, adding urgency for action specifically along the East Coast. It is vital, therefore, that the priority for climate investment in state and national infrastructure plans be raised, even amid the challenges of recovering from COVID-19. To help change mindsets on the urgency for action, it will be vital to connect, in real time, climate change to climate disasters.</p><p>Vinod Thomas is a former senior vice president of the World Bank and author of \"Climate Change and Natural Disasters.\" vthomas14</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHIINQ-PHQP20210713Ar01100</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHIINQ2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:634G-JJG1-DYJT-2013-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"724\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Philadelphia Inquirer</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 13, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>Business &amp;

The final months of 1918 provide a sobering answer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An influenza pandemic began ravaging the state in the fall of that year, ultimately killing more than 10,000 Minnesotans. Meanwhile, young men were being sent off to a bloody world war overseas and wildfires were destroying entire cities in northern Minnesota.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Reader Sarah Rasmussen moved into a 1917 Minneapolis home just before COVID-19 hit and realized they were not the first family to endure a pandemic within its walls. She wondered what life was like for those people a century ago. \"Maybe they saw friends in the backyard,\" Rasmussen wrote in an e-mail.</p><p>She sought answers about life in Minnesota during the 1918 pandemic - and how it compares to today - from Curious Minnesota, the Star Tribune's reporting project fueled by great reader questions.</p><p>The disease that began killing thousands in 1918 likely originated in Kansas, based on modern research. It quickly earned the nickname \"Spanish influenza\" because Spain was a neutral country in World War I and did not censor reports about the illness. After cropping up in military camps, it spread quickly due to the proximity and movement of troops during the war, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>By the fall, social activities in Minnesota ground to a halt much as they did in spring 2020. Some cities shut down schools and canceled large events. Police broke up crowds in local saloons. The University of Minnesota delayed opening for the fall semester.</p><p>\"All the towns and cities for miles around are closed - everything but the meat markets, grocery and dry good stores,\" a young woman, LaVerne Roquette, wrote to her boyfriend overseas in October 1918. \"At some places people have to wear gauze masks when they appear on the streets. ... The government has closed all schools, churches, theatres.\"</p><p>\"That was written 104 years ago but could have been yesterday,\" said Curt Brown, author of \"Minnesota 1918: When Flu, Fire and War Ravaged the State.\" A former Star Tribune reporter, Brown still writes a weekly history column for the newspaper.</p><p>Not everyone appreciated the precautions. Dr. H.M. Bracken, executive officer of the state board of health, vociferously opposed the school and business closures in Minneapolis.</p><p>\"If you begin to close, where are you going to stop? When are you going to reopen and what do you accomplish by opening?\" Bracken told the Minneapolis City Council in October 1918. \"Thus far, St. Paul has seen fit to follow my advice.\"</p><p>About 10 days later, citing a surge in cases, St. Paul followed, shuttering everything.</p><p>Even government agencies were sparring over the new rules. The Minneapolis school board tried to defy the city Health Department's closure order. The health commissioner responded by ordering the chief of police to close all school buildings and arrest anyone who tried to interfere.</p><p>Poorly understood disease</p><p>The differences between the two pandemics largely outweigh the similarities, however, starting with the basic standards of living at the time. Cars were still a luxury item and home electricity wasn't guaranteed - particularly in rural areas.</p><p>\"No one had radios in their homes. ... They weren't getting barraged with total case numbers and death counts on social media and TV and radio,\" Brown said. \"It was more word of mouth.\"</p><p>Newspapers offered regular guidance, but understanding of the disease was limited.</p><p>\"Scientifically, they didn't even know what the influenza virus was until 1933,\" Brown said. \"They thought it was bacteria.\"</p><p>The Minneapolis City Council ordered that the street commissioners \"sprinkle and flush\" the streets with water, because \"the bacillus of Spanish influenza lurked in the dust of the streets,\" according to a Minneapolis Morning Tribune article from October 1918.</p><p>Some advice is familiar today. The assistant dean of the University of Minnesota medical school, Dr. Richard Beard, said at the time that the disease passed through particles \"distributed by mouth or nose spray.\" The importance of fresh air was regularly stressed. Beard advised that people should open streetcar windows, work in ventilated offices, avoid crowded places and \"sleep as nearly as possible out of doors.\"</p><p>Within weeks of the first case reported in Minneapolis, hospitals were overrun. Testing wasn't available and treatment options were limited to prevention. It would be several decades before an influenza vaccine was available.</p><p>\"Death from disease was less of a mind-blow than it is today,\" Brown said. \"I think they were used to people dying of diseases like diphtheria and smallpox.\"</p><p>Nursing staffs were stretched thin by the double crises of flu and war. In early November 1918, half the nurses at the City Hospital in Minneapolis were out sick with influenza, and substitutes were hard to find. Another place flu found fertile ground to spread was in the temporary housing set up for evacuees of the wildfires in northern Minnesota. Historic wildfires in 1918 decimated entire cities, and those who escaped the fast-moving blazes were packed into cramped housing or crowded hospitals.</p><p>'Trifecta of woe'</p><p>The flu lingered through 1919 and into 1920, though it claimed the majority of its victims at the end of 1918. As with our current pandemic, it came in waves that spurred lockdowns and subsequent reopenings.</p><p>Roughly 12,000 Minnesotans ultimately died from the flu, Brown said, which is slightly more than have died so far from COVID-19. But Minnesota's population was less than half its current size, so proportionately the death toll was much larger. And unlike other outbreaks, an unusual number of healthy young adults succumbed to the 1918 flu.</p><p>\"Then you throw on this huge forest fire in the fall and the guys serving in World War I,\" Brown said, \"it was a trifecta of woe.\"</p><p>Hannah Sayle \u00b7 612-673-7185</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRIB-MERLIN66378825</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRIB2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64P5-2JG1-JC8F-K08V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8384</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"986\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Star Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN)</publicationName><edition>METRO EDITION</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"01\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>January 30, 2022 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL &amp;

Nearly 60 wildfires tore through bone-dry timber and brush from Alaska to Wyoming, according to the National Interagency Fire Center &lt;<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nifc.gov/fire-information/nfn&gt;\">https://www.nifc.gov/fire-information/nfn&gt;</url>. Arizona, Idaho and Montana accounted for more than half the large active fires. The fires erupted as the West was in the grip of the second bout of dangerously high temperatures in just a few weeks. </p><p>A climate change-fueled megadrought also is contributing to conditions that make fires even more dangerous, scientists say. The National Weather Service says the heat wave appeared to have peaked in many areas, and excessive-heat warnings were largely expected to expire by today. However, they're continuing into tonight in some California deserts, and many areas were still expected to see highs in the 80s and 90s Fahrenheit. In Northern California, a combined pair of lightning-ignited blazes dubbed the Beckwourth Complex was less than 25% surrounded after days of battling flames fueled by winds, hot weather and low humidity that sapped the moisture from vegetation. Evacuation orders were in place for more than 3,000 residents of remote northern areas and neighboring Nevada. There were reports of burned homes, but damage was still being tallied. The blaze had consumed 140 square miles of land, including in Plumas National Forest. A fire that began Sunday in the Sierra Nevada south of Yosemite National Park exploded over 14 square miles and was just 10% contained. A highway that leads to Yosemite's southern entrance remained open. The largest fire in the United States lay across the California border in southwestern Oregon. The Bootleg Fire \u00e2\u20ac\u201d which doubled and doubled again over the weekend \u00e2\u20ac\u201d threatened some 2,000 homes, state fire officials said. It had burned at least seven homes and more than 40 other buildings. Over the weekend, the Klamath County Sheriff's Office warned that it would cite or even arrest people who ignored orders to \"go now\" in certain areas immediately threatened by the blaze. Tim McCarley told &lt;<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kptv.com/news/family-says-they-evacuated-bootleg-fire-with-just-minutes-to-spare/article_d9f80e76-e373-11eb-b07c-5bd8fed3d6b7.html&gt;\">https://www.kptv.com/news/family-says-they-evacuated-bootleg-fire-with-just-minutes-to-spare/article_d9f80e76-e373-11eb-b07c-5bd8fed3d6b7.html&gt;</url> KPTV that he and his family were ordered to flee their home on Friday with flames just minutes behind them. \"They told us to get the hell out 'cause if not, you're dead,\" he said. He described the blaze as \"like a firenado,\" with flames leaping dozens of feet into the air and jumping around, catching trees, \"and then just explosions, boom, boom, boom, boom.\" The fire was burning in the Fremont-Winema National Forest, near the Klamath County town of Sprague River. It had ravaged an area of about 316 square miles, or more than twice the size of Portland. Firefighters hadn't managed to surround any of it as they struggled to build containment lines. The fire drastically disrupted service on three transmission lines providing up to 5,500 megawatts of electricity to California, and that state's power grid operator has repeatedly asked for voluntary power conservation during evening hours. Elsewhere, a forest fire that started during lightning storms in southeast Washington state grew to 86 square miles. It was 20% contained yesterday. Another fire west of Winthrop closed the scenic North Cascades Highway, the most northern route through the Cascade Range. The road provides access to North Cascades National Park and the Ross Lake National Recreation Area. In Idaho, Gov. Brad Little (R) mobilized the National Guard to help fight twin lightning-sparked fires that have together charred nearly 24 square miles of dry timber in the remote, drought-stricken region. The July heat wave follows an unusual June siege of broiling temperatures in the West and comes amid worsening drought conditions throughout the region. Scientists say human-caused climate change and decades of fire suppression that increases fuel loads have aggravated fire conditions across the region. \u00e2\u20ac\u201d John Antczak and Christopher Weber, Associated Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-0000017aa185dc3ca57eb5cdfd6c0000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63BH-J5H1-JBSK-R4YV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"696\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLC</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 13, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Weekly surveillance testing will be conducted as it was during the fall semester among undergraduate students, according to a Jan. 29 university announcement.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Residential students obtained self-swab nasal test kits by mail ahead of their arrival and were instructed to follow the step-by-step instructions to collect a sample. Students had to send their sample to the testing lab on the same day they collected their sample. The university needed to receive students' results no more than 72 hours prior to their arrival time. After moving into their residence halls, residents were required to take a follow-up self-swab COVID-19 test on campus. The tests were provided through Color, a genomics and testing company partnered with St. Joe's. Color will continue to provide surveillance testing services.</p><p>At the beginning of the fall 2020 semester, the university only mandated one-time on-site entry testing. The university received approximately 4,600 tests by the Aug. 28, 2020 deadline to take a test, as reported in the Sept. 2 issue of The Hawk. On-site campus testing was highly recommended at first in the fall, but was made mandatory after approximately 2,000 community members completed a test.</p><p>Other universities in the greater Philadelphia area are expanding their testing programs this spring as the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Philadelphia is now over 100,000, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Public Health. Villanova University, for example, implemented pre-arrival testing for all students and is continuing surveillance testing from last semester. Villanova now reports 262 active COVID-19 cases as of Feb. 2, according to their university dashboard.</p><p>As of Feb. 1, St. Joe's reported 26 total positive COVID-19 tests through the entry-testing program, according to the SJU Dashboard.</p><p>The Hawk reached out to Jill Bodensteiner, chair of the university's testing working group, for the total number of pre-arrival and entry tests administered so far this semester. In response, Gabrielle Lacherza, public relations and communications specialist, wrote in response to written questions from The Hawk that \"all available testing and case data is provided through the University's dashboard.\"</p><p>The dashboard does not list how many pre-arrival tests were submitted by residential students, how many entry tests have been conducted thus far or how many positive cases were determined through pre-arrival testing. As of Jan. 29, there are a total of seven isolation and quarantine housing spots occupied, and the dashboard will reflect a daily snapshot of available spaces to isolate and quarantine beginning on Feb. 8, according to Lacherza.</p><p>Entry testing on campus, originally scheduled to conclude on Jan. 26, has been extended to Feb. 2 and Feb. 3. This is to \"allow additional community members, especially voluntary testers, the opportunity to participate\" in testing procedures, Lacherza wrote.</p><p>Faculty, staff and graduate students were encouraged to do on-site testing but were not required to complete tests.</p><p>Cary Anderson, Ed.D., associate provost and vice president of Student Life, said the university decided to implement pre-arrival testing per the guidance of \"available science, public health indications and our experience from the fall semester.\"</p><p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's health and safety recommendations for institutions of higher education, \"Symptom screening, diagnostic testing and contact tracing are some of the strategies that can be taken to slow and stop the spread of COVID-19.\" The CDC also lists, in addition to masks, social distancing and hand washing as mitigation methods.</p><p>Jeffrey Morris, Ph.D., professor of biostatistics and the director of the biostatistics division at the University of Pennsylvania, said the keys to stopping the spread of COVID-19 in larger populations include pre-arrival testing combined with entry testing, continued systematic testing and enhanced contact tracing protocols.</p><p>\"The forest fire analogy is a good one because this virus spreads so fast that when it really gets going in a closed population, it does get to become like a forest fire that's hard to manage, but when it's just starting, it's a spark, and there are little brush fires,\" Morris said. \"If you find it then you can put it out. You can isolate it, and it won't burn the forest down.\"</p><p>Anderson said because most transmission last semester was identified within the residential student population, those students were selected to complete pre-arrival testing as a preemptive isolation strategy.</p><p>Maura Farrell '23 was a residential student in the fall and decided to continue living on campus for the spring semester.

State politicians and Montana's largest electricity utility company seem set on keeping it that way. <url normalizedValue=\"https://revealnews.org\">https://revealnews.org</url> This story also appeared in Reveal[1]  <br/> Reveal's Jonathan Jones travels to the town of Colstrip in the southeastern part of the state. It is home to one of the largest coal seams in the country - and one of the largest coal-fired power plants in the West. He learns that the state has signed off on a massive expansion of the coal mine that feeds the plant and that Montana's single largest power company, NorthWestern Energy, has expanded its stake in the plant, even though it's the single biggest emitter of greenhouse gas in Montana. Jones speaks with Colstrip's mayor about the importance of coal mining to the local community. He also speaks to local ranchers and a tribal official who've been working for generations to protect the water and land from coal development.  <br/>Jones follows the money to the state's capital, where lawmakers have passed one of the most extreme laws to keep the state from addressing climate change. He meets with plaintiffs involved in a first-of-its-kind youth-led lawsuit who are suing Montana for violating their constitutional right to a 'clean and healthful environment.' Jones dives into lobbying records behind a flurry of bills that are keeping the state reliant on fossil fuels. He also finds that NorthWestern is planning to build a new methane gas plant on the banks of the Yellowstone River, and the company is being met with resistance from people who live near the site and from state courts. <br/>Finally, Jones visits the state's largest wind farm and speaks with a renewable energy expert, who says Montana can close its coal plants, never build a new gas plant and transition to 100% clean energy while reducing electricity costs for consumers. He also speaks with NorthWestern's CEO and looks at other coal communities in transition. <br/>Dig Deeper <br/>Read: Gianforte signs bill banning state agencies from analyzing climate impacts[2] (Montana Free Press) <br/>Read: Affordable and Reliable Decarbonization Pathways for Montana[3] (Vibrant Clean Energy study for 350 Montana) <br/>Read: The Coal Cost Crossover 3.0[4] (Energy Innovation Policy &amp; Technology) <br/>Read: Net Zero by 2050[5] (NorthWestern Energy) <br/>Listen: Colstrip's Next Chapter[6] (Shared State podcast from the Montana Free Press, Montana Public Radio and Yellowstone Public Radio) <br/>Watch: 'Cowboy Poets[7],' a 1988 film featuring Wally McRae, a cowboy poet and conservationist in southeastern Montana. <br/>Watch: What the Hell is Going On With the Colstrip Plant?[8] (Montana Environmental Information Center) <br/>Credits <br/>Reporter: Jonathan Jones | Producer: Stephen Smith | Editor: Jenny Casas with help from Kate Howard | Additional reporting and research: Amanda Eggert | Fact checker: Nikki Frick | Production manager: Steven Rasc\u00f3n | Original score and sound design: Jim Briggs and Fernando Arruda | Digital producer: Nikki Frick | Episode art: Stephen Smith | Interim executive producers: Taki Telonidis and Brett Myers | Host: Al Letson <br/>Reported in partnership with the Montana Free Press. Special thanks to reporter Mara Silvers and editor Brad Tyer of the Montana Free Press and Yellowstone Public Radio. <br/>Transcript <br/>Al Letson: From the Center for Investigative Reporting and PRX, this is Reveal. I'm Al Letson. The local coal industry has always been a villain in William Walksalong's life. <br/>William Walksalong: They're like a monster, and its teetering, ready to fall over. And that, I want to be part of the effort to cut its throat and let it bleed out and let it go away. <br/>Al Letson: William grew up on the northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation in southeast Montana. It's near one of the largest coal seams in the country and one of the largest coal fire power plants in the west. He remembers when they started building it when he was in high school in the seventies. <br/>William Walksalong: Oh, I remember distinctly all kinds of strange people from all over the country, construction workers. They'd blast those power plants to test them and you could drown everything out even in the classroom, kind of startle you when they were starting those big power plants up. <br/>Al Letson: The power plant is in a town called Colstrip, and William was against it from the beginning. But when the construction was done, a lot of people from his community went to work there. <br/>William Walksalong: I had adults and high school students telling me and my brother we were traitors, that we should go back to Colstrip and dig coal. <br/>Al Letson: William never worked for the power plant or the coal mine that fed it. In the nineties, he became the vice president of the tribe at a time when there was a push to expand coal mining into the reservation. <br/>William Walksalong: They were trying to get rid of our Indian nation as a obstacle or a barrier to unfettered energy development, including undermining our sovereignty, promising economic self-sufficiency, at the cost of our historical cultural sites. It was just a total shakedown of our way of life. <br/>Al Letson: For the last three decades, William has done everything he can as a tribal administrator to keep coal mining off the reservation. And most recently, he was a part of an ongoing lawsuit against the Biden administration's decision to permit coal leasing on public lands. Coal is, by far, the single biggest contributor to climate change. In 2022, global coal production rose above 8 billion metric tons, its highest level in history. <br/>William Walksalong: I remember growing up. We had deeper snow, better runoff, and I've never seen so much drought in my life, and I've been alive for about almost Well, I'm 64 years old, and I've never seen drought last that long. [inaudible] Creek dried up that one year, never seen that in my lifetime, and it's due to climate change. <br/>Al Letson: More and more states are shifting their energy consumption away from coal, but Montana is running in the opposite direction. The state is expanding coal mining and the legislature has been passing laws to prop up the fossil fuel industry. <br/>Interviewees: Coal really is our ace in the hole. We just want to keep producing coal and bring money into the coffers. <br/>And we'll help encourage that industry to stay in the business of generating electricity. <br/>We have a third of the nation's coal, which greatly supports the state of Montana. <br/>It's good for Montanans and it's good for business. <br/>William Walksalong: They must live on a different planet. I don't understand that. Well, I know the Republican super majority, they want to make it a clear path, easier path for energy development, dirty energy, I guess, coal and gas plants. <br/>Al Letson: Montana is a place with some of the most extreme laws to prevent the state from addressing climate change. There's also a powerful fossil fuel lobby and it's a state with a lot of potential to completely shift to clean renewable energy. Reveal's Jonathan Jones went to the Colstrip power plant, the one that was built when William was in high school and where the fight over its future has implications for the entire planet. <br/>Jonathan Jones: I'm standing next to a big coal field. There's a big black ridge of exposed coal, and then there are these big earth moving machines that are pushing the coal. This is the Rosebud coal mine. It's right outside the town of Colstrip in southeastern Montana and one of the largest strip mines in North America. <br/>Jonathan Jones: Bulldozers and large trucks that are bringing massive amounts of coal in from the coal mine to this big pile of coal that they're then going to put on a conveyor belt. And the conveyor belt is like this long sort of khaki colored centipede that carries the coal from here to the power plant. <br/>Jonathan Jones: The conveyor belt feeds coal directly to the Colstrip power plant that towers over the town. <br/>Jonathan Jones: It's a massive structure with four smoke stacks, two of which are active, two of which are quiet, and then there are two big cooling towers with billowing vapor coming out of it. <br/>Jonathan Jones: Along with that vapor, the plant also puts out more than 10 million metric tons of carbon dioxide each year. It emits more greenhouse gas than any other single source in Montana, making it one of the biggest producers of CO2 in the western United States. The electricity made here has powered homes and buildings across the state and the Pacific Northwest since the 1970s. <br/>Jonathan Jones: It's coal fire power plants like this that's provided most of our electricity for generations. But that's changing now with the shifting energy market as more and more states pass legislation to wean themselves off coal. <br/>Jonathan Jones: But not Montana. The Rosebud strip mine is expanding and one of the owners of the Colstrip power plant plans to keep burning coal until at least 2042 and people in the town want it that way. <br/>Jonathan Jones: There are very few retail stores here. Right next to me is the Energy Employees Credit Union and outside there are two signs, one of which says 'Coal keeps the doors open,' and the other one says 'Coal keeps the lights on.' It's almost hard to go one block here without seeing some sort of sign promoting coal, defending coal, and reminding people of coal's importance to the energy sector and of course to Colstrip. <br/>John Williams: My name is John Williams. I'm the mayor of the City of Colstrip. Everything here is either coal or power production as a result of coal. <br/>Jonathan Jones: John Williams first moved here in 1971 when there were only a few hundred people in town. <br/>John Williams: Colstrip came from the fact that this was a large strip of coal here. The story is that it was misspelled by the federal government when they put in the post office down here and that's the name, and it stuck with it. C-O-L-S-T-R-I-P rather than C-O-A-L. That's the story. <br/>Jonathan Jones: Mayor Williams says he was one of the first two employees who oversaw the construction of the power plant. He essentially built the town and helped incorporate it as a city in the nineties. As I drive around, you can't help but see a lot of the signs that say 'Coal keeps the lights on,' 'Coal keeps the doors open.' Can you talk a little bit about that? <br/>John Williams: It's happened because of the threat against coal, the war against coal. I mean billions of dollars within our state have been created as a result of the mining of coal and we get a lot of benefit as a result of coal, jobs, taxes. <br/>Jonathan Jones: Together, the coal mine and the power plant are the two largest employers in the Colstrip area. The jobs and the tax revenue support a first class public school system, a nine hole golf course, medical services, a park system, and a median household income that's 35% higher than the state average. <br/>John Williams: Don't kill the goose that laid the golden egg, so that's my take on that. Right or wrong, that's how I feel. <br/>Jonathan Jones: So obviously this is a community as you've said that is extremely dependent on one natural resource, coal. <br/>John Williams: Coal. <br/>Jonathan Jones: And we've talked about sort of its positive aspects, but how has this created some challenges for the community? <br/>John Williams: Well, part of the challenges are that we're considered to be a one horse town, one industry town. And there's also, we have a number of companies, the Pacific Northwest companies are making decisions or having decisions made for them that to remove themselves from coal. <br/>Jonathan Jones: What he's referring to is that for decades, Colstrip's biggest customer for electricity was the Pacific Northwest. The Colstrip power plant is owned by six power companies, the majority of which are based in Oregon and Washington, and now they want out of Colstrip for what boils down to two main reasons. First, those companies are facing new climate laws requiring them to stop using coal power. Second, they say it's too expensive to run the coal fire power plant. But there's one main stakeholder staying put in Colstrip and buying out the other's shares, NorthWestern Energy. It is the single largest electricity provider in Montana. <br/>Brian Bird: I may be the only CEO in the utility industry adding coal to his portfolios. <br/>Jonathan Jones: That's NorthWestern CEO, Brian Bird at a meeting of state lawmakers and other officials in Montana's capital. He's announcing that NorthWestern is buying out another owner in Colstrip and for an unbeatable price, nothing. <br/>Brian Bird: So understand why are we doing this, we're doing this for our customers and our communities in Montana. And by the way, we're doing it for three reasons, reliability, affordability, and sustainability. <br/>Jonathan Jones: After the announcement, environmental groups blasted NorthWestern's new Colstrip deal. They said it had nothing to do with reliability, affordability, or sustainability. <br/>Anne Hedges: So NorthWestern wants that plant to continue to operate, not because it's this great resource that it can't possibly do without, it's because that's a lot of money and they don't want to lose it. <br/>Jonathan Jones: Anne Hedges is co-director of the Montana Environmental Information Center. It's one of the state's leading environmental groups. Her organization has legally challenged Colstrip stakeholders over a dozen times over pollution, rate increases, and mining expansions. <br/>Anne Hedges: NorthWestern doesn't give a hoot about its customers. It is more concerned about its executive salaries and bonuses and its shareholders than it is about the people who pay the bills. <br/>Jonathan Jones: The company operates as a monopoly in Montana. It profits from generating electricity and charging people for it, and it also makes money by recouping the costs of its investments from its customers. So buying up shares and owning a bigger portion of the Colstrip power plant means more money for NorthWestern. This is how electric utilities operate in most states. <br/>John Oliver: Our main story tonight, utilities, specifically electric utilities. <br/>Jonathan Jones: John Oliver explained it this way on his show Last Week Tonight. <br/>John Oliver: When they build something, a piece of physical infrastructure, they're allowed to then pass along that cost to you through your bill, plus an additional percentage that they get to keep as profit, usually around 10%, and this creates a clear incentive. The bigger the project like a power plant, the more profit they make. <br/> What else you need to know: <br/> 06.02.202306.02.2023  <br/> 06.02.202306.02.2023  <br/> 06.01.202306.01.2023  <br/><br/><br/>Jonathan Jones: John Oliver uses this analogy. It's like a waiter in a restaurant where there's a guaranteed tip. The more money that is spent on the meal, the more the waiter is going to make. NorthWestern first bought its stake in Colstrip in 2007 and paid around 187 million for it. But then the state approved the company's request to value their assets in the power plant at 407 million, more than double what NorthWestern paid for it. And since utilities get to make back their expenses plus another eight to 10% profit, NorthWestern gets to pass the cost of the plant onto its electricity customers. In other words <br/>Anne Hedges: As long as that plant operates for the life of the plant, which was expected to be about 2042, NorthWestern will continue to collect from its customers. That's a lot of money over time. <br/>Jonathan Jones: A lot of money and a lot of consequences for the environment. Here's Anne speaking on a recent webinar called What the Hell Is Going on with the Colstrip Plant. <br/>Anne Hedges: Eight to 10 million tons of greenhouse gases a year being released from that facility. If we can't solve a problem of one single plant like Colstrip and get it on a path towards closure and replacement, then we simply can't solve our climate problem. I mean, it's that simple. <br/>Terry Punt: Girls and boys, [inaudible] <br/>Jonathan Jones: About an hour's drive south of Colstrip Rancher, Jeanie Alderson and her husband Terry call out to their cows. Well, <br/>Jeanie Alderson: We have about 50 mother cows and then we have yearlings, two year olds and a three year olds. We butcher them about three years old and so they just get fat on We feed them through the winter and then in the summer they'll go out on grass. <br/>Jonathan Jones: Jeanie's a fourth generation rancher. Her family's run cattle here since the 1880s. <br/>Jeanie Alderson: My dad's family came from the deep south. My great-great granddad was from Alderson, West Virginia, and he was a Baptist minister. He was an abolitionist, so he had to leave the town and they went to Texas and then they came up from Texas to Montana. <br/>Jonathan Jones: Jeanie's family came up for the grasslands and the water. It's why they're still here today. She worries about the impact that coal has on the land. Toxic waste from the mine and the power plant has already harmed the water, the springs, wells, and creeks that ranchers and farmers depend on. <br/>Jeanie Alderson: When you mine coal and you process it through the power plants, what's left is the ash. So what they've done is to store this ash, they've been stored in these ponds, and it is getting into the groundwater. I mean the ranchers that are around Colstrip, it's very scary for them. <br/>Jonathan Jones: According to the State Department of Environmental Quality, the coal ash ponds associated with the power plant have been leaking since their inception. Elevated levels of toxic chemicals have been found in the groundwater. Colstrip residents have to get their drinking water pumped in from the Yellowstone River 30 miles away. <br/>Jeanie Alderson: Ranching right now is hard enough, really hard to make enough money to stay in business. Since 1980, something like 40% of ranchers in this country have gone out of business and no one is really talking about that. Any other industry had we had that kind of loss, you would see it in the news more. And so we already are stressed to try and keep our ranches together. <br/>Jonathan Jones: The Alderson Family Ranch has had to adapt to the changing market. Faced with relentless pressure from large scale beef packers offering lower prices, Jeanie and her family got creative. They invested in a herd of Wagyu cattle, a Japanese cow that produces one of the most expensive cuts of beef. <br/>Jeanie Alderson: They don't look like the kind of animals that most ranchers are used to, especially most ranchers in this part of the country. <br/>Jonathan Jones: Other ranchers in the area have also adapted, but Jeanie's worried that most people in southeastern Montana aren't planning for a future that doesn't rely on coal. <br/>Jeanie Alderson: There's so much potential here, but the leadership in the community, the mayor, the others, they're so tied to the energy company, and I kind of feel like our leaders are just still thinking that they're going to just keep going with coal. <br/>Jonathan Jones: And in Helena, state lawmakers say their intention is to do just that. <br/>Al Letson: Coming up. <br/>Jason Small: Coal in Montana's no different than potatoes in Ireland. I mean, that's something we got and we've got it in spades and that's our great equalizer, right? <br/>Al Letson: Jonathan heads to Montana's capital to meet with lawmakers behind the state's coal expansion. That's next on Reveal. From the Center for Investigative Reporting and PRX, this is Reveal. I'm Al Letson. <br/>Wally McRae: My family's been in this corner of southeastern Montana for over a hundred years. We celebrated our centennial year in 1986. <br/>Al Letson: Wally McRae is a third generation rancher. His family has raised cattle and sheep in the Colstrip area since the 1800s. He's a cowboy poet known for his writing about life in rural Montana. <br/>Wally McRae: Cowboys have probably always been kind of popular, kind of a hero figure and maybe we fit in that. And so if people can get inside of that life through meter and rhyme, it's got a combination of appeals. <br/>Al Letson: This tape is from a 1988 film by Kim Shelton called Cowboy Poets. The film is from another time, but echoes many of the issues Montana ranching communities still wrestle with today. Here, Wally is describing a major theme of his poetry. <br/>Wally McRae: Because one of the largest strip mines in the United States is in my backyard, I have written several poems about the effect that coal oriented industrialization has upon the cowboy culture. <br/>Al Letson: One of his poems is called The Lease Hound. It describes a coal mining agent visiting a local ranch. <br/>Wally McRae: I've come to lease your land for coal was how he launched his spiel. He'd been given an authority, the grand generous deal. The nation needs the coal, he said, as I am sure you know. We need more power every year to make our nation grow. And it's the patriotic duty of each American to help to get the coal mine and expedite our plan. Now, you may not like strip mining and tearing up the earth, but it's your duty, isn't it? <br/>Jeanie Alderson: Land men would go to people in that big boom time in the early seventies, the way my mom described it, and they would say, 'Everybody else around you has sold out, why don't you sign here? There's nothing you can do.' <br/>Al Letson: Rancher, Jeanie Alderson's mom, Caroline was a contemporary of Wally's. She was also hearing from speculators in the mid seventies. <br/>Jeanie Alderson: When you're told that your patriotic duty is to step aside so they can mine this coal underneath you, it's insulting, it's infuriating. <br/>Al Letson: The speculators were there because of a report. The North Central power study published by the federal government in 1971. It designated southeast Montana as 'a national sacrifice area for energy production.' <br/>Jeanie Alderson: You know, eastern Montana, this kind of dry area anyway, who's out there anyway, who really cares? Let's just turn it into the boiler room of the nation. <br/>Al Letson: The plan proposed building 42 coal fire power plants, half of them in and around Colstrip. <br/>Wally McRae: They didn't treat us well, they lied and they pitted one neighbor against another and it wasn't a pretty sight and it offended us, it really did. <br/>Al Letson: Montana has a long history of making money by extracting its natural resources, namely copper and coal. But Caroline, Wally, and other local ranchers didn't want to be part of that legacy. <br/>Jeanie Alderson: And my mom and other ranchers, they could right away see that the cost was going to be their land and water and their communities, and they were trying desperately to hold onto that. <br/>Al Letson: Together, they organized the Northern Plains Resource Council, a grassroots movement to protect the land in rural Montana from industrial development. <br/>Wally McRae: I think a lot of people assume that any sort of opposition to coal oriented industrialization was based purely on environmental grounds. I think that our concerns were more cultural or social and finally, long-term economic. I mean, hell, we've been here a hundred years, are we going to be able to be here a hundred years from now? <br/>Al Letson: Other environmental groups followed. They held teach-ins, stage protests, and met with lawmakers. Their actions led the state to rewriting its constitution in 1972, producing what has been called one of the most progressive constitutions in the United States. It includes language to protect the public's right to a 'clean and healthful environment in Montana for present and future generations.' Today, a group of Montanans say that right is under attack and it's coming from inside the state house. Reveal's Jonathan Jones went to the state capitol in Helena to find out why. <br/>Jonathan Jones: In the rotunda of Montana's state capitol building in Helena, 14 year old Mica Kantor is practicing his speech. <br/>Mica Kantor: I love animals. My favorite animal's a pika. Unfortunately, they will be one of the first North American animals to go extinct because of climate change. It scares me to think that I will be- <br/>Jonathan Jones: Moments later, Mica is called to join a small group behind a podium. <br/>Interviewees: Let's get started. Welcome everyone to the people's house. Welcome everyone. <br/>Jonathan Jones: Hundreds of people are gathered to hear what they have to say. <br/>Interviewees: Welcome everyone to the rally to defend Montana's constitution. <br/>Jonathan Jones: Mica gets up to speak. <br/>Mica Kantor: I'm not old enough to vote, so sometimes it is hard for me to feel like my voice is being heard. <br/>Jonathan Jones: Mica stands out. Not just because he's one of the youngest people here, but because he's one of 16 young people suing the state over its fossil fuel energy policies. They argue state officials are violating their constitutional right to a healthful environment. The clause, put into the state constitution decades ago, thanks to environmental activists like Wally and Jeanie's mom, Caroline. <br/>Mica Kantor: Despite knowing about climate change and its detrimental effects for decades, the state of Montana has decided to ignore it for profit. But we have to ask ourselves if it is worth it. Is it worth it to lose the things we love? Is it worth it to lose the places that we relish? Is it worth it all in order for more profit? <br/>Jonathan Jones: At age four, Mica started worrying about the future of the world's glaciers. At nine, wildfire and smoke forced him to stay inside for six weeks and made him sick with headaches and eye irritation. At 11, a forest fire broke out about a mile from his home. Mica wrote letters to elected officials asking them to act on the changing climate. He got back a few automated responses. And so when his mom heard about an environmental lawsuit that needed young people to join and asked Mica if he was interested, it was an easy choice. <br/>Mica Kantor: We'll be the ones to have to live with the effects of climate change more than anybody else, so it's really important for me to do this. <br/>Jonathan Jones: The youth-led climate trial is the first of its kind in US history and it's set to begin this summer on June 12th. Just upstairs from the rally are the offices of the lawmakers whose actions are part of the youth climate lawsuit. Tell me who you are and what you do. <br/>Steve Fitzpatrick: Steve Fitzpatrick, senator from Great Falls, Montana, and I am the Republican senate majority leader. <br/>Jonathan Jones: Senator Fitzpatrick is a lawyer and one of the most powerful political figures in the state. Fossil fuel companies are also some of his biggest campaign contributors. There's this big rally at the Rotunda noon today over this youth climate lawsuit. What is your reaction to the lawsuit? <br/>Steve Fitzpatrick: [inaudible] I don't know anything about it. I've never read any of the pleadings. I mean, it's kind of hard for me to offer a comment on a lawsuit where I haven't even- <br/>Jonathan Jones: But you're a lawyer and you're getting sued by the youth of Montana over the state's climate policy, isn't it in your interest to know what's going on? <br/>Steve Fitzpatrick: The state of Montana gets sued all the time, so I don't I'm a state legislator, I'm not the attorney general's office. I don't go read every lawsuit that gets filed. <br/>Jonathan Jones: Fitzpatrick was elected to the state house in 2010 and then to the senate in 2016. He's the son of John Fitzpatrick, a former lobbyist for NorthWestern Energy, who is now a state representative. For the past several years, Senator Fitzpatrick has been pushing legislation to make sure the coal fired power plant in Colstrip stays open. <br/>Steve Fitzpatrick: The way I look at that is that we've got a resource, we have an asset in the state of Montana, and I don't think it ought to be destroyed. We need coal and we need energy that's reliable and useful. <br/>Jonathan Jones: In 2021, when the Colstrip power plant owners based in the Pacific Northwest tried to pull out, Senator Fitzpatrick introduced a series of bills to keep them from leaving. One bill that passed imposed a $100,000 fine for every day they didn't pay their share of the operating costs. <br/>Steve Fitzpatrick: To have somebody from another state reach into our state and tell us what we're supposed to do with facilities and plants in our state, yeah, that's frustrating. <br/>Jonathan Jones: The bills were declared unconstitutional by the courts in October 2022, but that hasn't discouraged Senator Fitzpatrick and other lawmakers from fighting to ensure the state's continued reliance on fossil fuels. During the 2023 legislative session, Republicans passed a flurry of these kinds of bills. There was a bill to limit environmental lawsuits over fossil fuel projects, a bill to add a hefty tax for charging electric vehicles, a bill to allow coal mining expansions with limited review, and a bill to weaken water quality protections for coal mines. All of these proposals were signed by the governor and became law. <br/>Jason Small: Mr. Chair, members of the [inaudible] for your consideration. <br/>Jonathan Jones: And then, there was Senate Bill 228. <br/>Jason Small: Basically, this bill preemptively stops any locality from banning fossil fuels and the tools, appliances, or equipment that utilize it. <br/>Jonathan Jones: Senate Bill 228 became law too, making it illegal for local governments to take action to limit fossil fuels in their cities and towns. Senator Jason Small was its primary sponsor. <br/>Jason Small: Coal and Montana is no different than potatoes in Ireland. I mean, that's something we got and we've got it in spades and that's our great equalizer, right? <br/>Jonathan Jones: Senator Small is from the Colstrip area and a member of the Northern Cheyenne tribe. When he's not at the state house, he works at the power plant as a boiler maker. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://shop.montanafreepress.org\">https://shop.montanafreepress.org</url>/  <br/>Jason Small: There's nothing in the state financially that coal doesn't touch. That's something even some of the most remote places in the state, there's some mines there, and those mines keep everybody living a good lifestyle. They're educating kids. We sprinkle coal dust all over the state. <br/>Jonathan Jones: He scoffed at the notion that the coal industry's days are numbered. <br/>Jason Small: Oh hell no, coal's not dead. There isn't that much reliable power out there and reliable power you're going to get is from gas. It's from propane natural gas, methane, it's from coal. Those are the ones that are always going to be there when you need them. <br/>Jonathan Jones: If there's one company that seems to benefit the most from these kinds of policies, it's NorthWestern Energy, the largest single provider of electricity in Montana. The company finances a small army of lobbyists every legislative session. In 2023, NorthWestern lobbied for bills to weaken oversight of coal mining expansions, bills increasing taxes on electric vehicles, and bills restricting solar energy. <br/>News Anchor: NorthWestern Energy is planning to build a new 250 million natural gas plant in Laurel. <br/>Jonathan Jones: The company also supported a bill that allows state regulators to approve big new capital projects like building a new power plant without having to demonstrate it's actually the best deal for Montanans. And NorthWestern supported that bill while it was building a brand new methane gas plant. The new plant started construction in 2022 and they built it on the banks of the Yellowstone River in Steve Krum's family's backyard. <br/>Steve Krum: We're just south of Yellowstone River, just south of the plant location currently being built by Northwest Energy. I just don't understand why you'd build a plant like this here. <br/>Jonathan Jones: Steve is a retired oil refinery worker who's lived in the area his whole life. He wasn't the only one upset about the plant. Other local residents and environmental groups opposed it since it was first announced in 2021. They say NorthWestern started building before getting the proper zoning permits. <br/>Steve Krum: This thing was being pushed as quickly and as fast as it can. They had no concern for the people here whatsoever. They had zero community meetings to get the people on board, the neighbors that live right next to them. <br/>Jonathan Jones: The new gas plant is projected to emit more than 769,000 tons of greenhouse gases a year. That's equivalent to the annual emissions of nearly 170,000 cars. Concerned for his community, Steve became part of a lawsuit launched by the Sierra Club and the Montana Environmental Information Center. The suit claims the state unlawfully granted NorthWestern a permit to build the gas plant because it failed to do an adequate environmental review. <br/>Steve Krum: We all know that we got climate issues, we know that. They're using this as a step to quick money because it's the most expensive way other than coal to fire a generating plant to get the biggest return they can to their stockholders. <br/>Jonathan Jones: This spring, judge Michael Moses ruled in the plaintiff's favor. He ordered NorthWestern to halt construction of the gas plant. The plant has been sitting half constructed for months. This win was one of many for environmental groups filing suits against the state for permitting fossil fuel expansions. The judge's ruling riled Montana's Republican lawmakers. <br/>Steve Fitzpatrick: So what the judge did, I think was outrageous. It flies in the face of law. It was probably one of the more atrocious pieces of judicial activism I've ever seen and we've seen a lot of bad decisions out of this judge. <br/>Jonathan Jones: That's Senator Fitzpatrick again, speaking on the floor of the Montana Senate this April. A few weeks after the ruling, the Republican super majority suspended its own rules to introduce a controversial new bill at the last minute. <br/>Steve Fitzpatrick: This decision by the judge, it threatens every individual project in the state of Montana. This could be refineries, this could be mines, this could be anybody with an air quality permit, and we all know that each individual project is never going to change the temperature of the earth. <br/>Jonathan Jones: The ruling and the lawsuit over the new gas plant were all about how the state failed to assess the environmental impacts including greenhouse gas emissions, so the new bill would prevent state agencies from considering the potential impact of climate change altogether. <br/>Interviewee: Senator Small. <br/>Jason Small: Yes, thank you, Mr. President. House bill 971 makes it clear that unless and until Montana policymakers enact laws to regulate carbon, a procedural review does not include a climate analysis. <br/>Jonathan Jones: In other words, House bill 971 explicitly prohibits all state agencies from considering climate change and greenhouse gas emissions when reviewing projects that could harm the environment. <br/>Jason Small: We're not going to allow endless litigation to stop projects and industry in the state of Montana. <br/>Jonathan Jones: More than a thousand people submitted comments with the vast majority in opposition to the bill and more than 60 people testified against it. <br/>Steve Krum: My name is Steve Krum, K-R-U-M. I live in Laurel, Montana and I'm opposed to HB 971. <br/>Interviewees: Are we willing to sacrifice our environment to support corporate profits? <br/>I'm an engineer and a parent and I speak for all the children who aren't born yet and all the ones who don't have a voice yet. Please oppose this bill. <br/>My future and the generations to come after me will be significantly affected. <br/>Think of the legacy you will be leaving our grandchildren. <br/>Jonathan Jones: Nationally, the bill is considered one of the most extreme legislative actions to keep regulators from addressing climate change. After it passed, largely along party lines, it was signed into law by Republican governor Greg Gianforte. Two days later, attorneys for the state cited it when asking a judge to dismiss the youth-led climate lawsuit. The judge declined and ordered the attorneys to prepare for trial. <br/>Al Letson: Coming up, Jonathan kicks the tires on the idea that there's nothing more reliable, affordable, or sustainable than coal power. <br/>Anne Hedges: How much does wind cost for fuel? Nothing. How much does solar cost for fuel? Nothing. Coal is not cheaper, not on any calculus that anybody is doing today. <br/>Al Letson: That's next on Reveal. <br/>From the Center for Investigative Reporting and PRX, this is Reveal. I'm Al Letson. While he was in Montana, Reveal's Jonathan Jones talked to many policymakers who were quick to dismiss clean energy. For a lot of them, the commitment to coal and other fossil fuels comes down to jobs, tax revenue, or a disbelief in climate change. And there's one more thing. <br/>Gary Parry: The sun's not always going to shine and the wind's not always going to blow. <br/>Al Letson: In other words, reliability. <br/>Steve Gunderson: The biggest problem that we have in trying to do this changeover to wind, solar, those two especially, is they're not an on demand. They are when the wind blows, when the sun shines. <br/>Steve Fitzpatrick: The fact of the matter is in the middle of the dead of winter, when it's super cold, there is no wind blowing. <br/>Jason Small: When the wind's not blowing, obviously you're not getting wind power. There's no solar energy today because it's snowing. <br/>Al Letson: That was state representatives Gary Parry and Steve Gunderson and Senators Steve Fitzpatrick and Jason Small. Montana's largest utility company seems to agree. This spring, NorthWestern Energy unveiled its plans for supplying electricity across the state. That plan included burning more coal at the Colstrip power plant for the next two decades and finishing construction on their new gas plant on the Yellowstone River. Utilities across the west are phasing out their coal fire plants and pivoting to renewable energy. So why is one of Montana's biggest energy players expanding its fossil fuel footprint? Jonathan went to ask the man behind the decisions at NorthWestern, the CEO. <br/>Jonathan Jones: Brian Bird has worked for NorthWestern Energy for two decades. He became CEO at the beginning of 2023. Before that, he was president and chief operating officer. I asked him what he's learned in his time at the head of the organization. <br/>Brian Bird: We have a capacity problem at NorthWestern. And what I mean by capacity, we don't have a sufficient amount of resources to deliver 24/7 power to our customers. <br/>Jonathan Jones: Right now, NorthWestern imports energy from out of state to address that capacity issue. The company has to balance the electricity demands of its customers and the growing population in Montana. But it's also a publicly traded company that has to make money for its shareholders, big investment firms like BlackRock and Vanguard, which manage the retirement funds of millions of Americans. Critics say that NorthWestern is sort of doubling down on outdated, inefficient, and polluting power sources because those are the most profitable and they're making Montanans pay the bill. What's your response to that? <br/>Brian Bird: I'm doing that because our customers need that capacity. If I can't deliver it to them, they're going to be very angry with us as a utility, so it has nothing to do with profitability. <br/>Jonathan Jones: About 58% of the electricity NorthWestern supplies in Montana generates zero carbon emissions. Some of it comes from wind power, some from hydroelectric dams, a along with a little bit of solar. He says the company is committed to adding more renewable resources. <br/>Brian Bird: So it's a false narrative to say that we're not doing anything from a renewable energy perspective. <br/>Jonathan Jones: But you are building the new gas plant. <br/>Brian Bird: I am indeed, and that gas plant was built to offset the intermittency of renewables put on the system. I need to balance reliability, affordability, and sustainability, and I'm doing as quickly as I can to not only serve our customers today, but to serve them with cleaner energy in the future. <br/>Jonathan Jones: Why do you think NorthWestern has been such a target of criticism among environmentalists in Montana? <br/>Brian Bird: That's a great question. I think the fact that we continue to be in a coal fire plant is probably the primary reason. <br/>Jonathan Jones: Do you worry about climate change? <br/>Brian Bird: I do. But in our own backyards, we need to think about, again, balancing reliability, affordability, and sustainability, and serving our customers today with serving our customers in the future, and to balance all of that. <br/>Jonathan Jones: Should NorthWestern be working to rapidly phase out coal fire power plants? <br/>Brian Bird: Should we be rapidly? I think what we're doing is we're doing it in a constructive way. We're looking at how can we find alternatives that are cost effective and are going to be reliable. It's going to take some time. We can't close down all the coal fire plants tomorrow and expect that we're going to have first world reliability electric system. <br/>Jonathan Jones: NorthWestern critics point to other utilities that are investing in large scale wind and solar projects. They say Montana could be a national leader in green energy. That famous big sky that seems to go on forever can charge up solar panels and that vast almost treeless range brings the wind, which can turn huge propellers to make electricity. <br/>The app of my phone says the wind's blowing about 15 miles per hour, but I have to say, standing out here, it seems a lot windier than that. <br/>About a two hour drive from the Colstrip power plant is the clear water wind farm. It is the largest wind farm in Montana. They kind of look like giant sort of white toothpicks with three blades spinning around. It's like a big wind turbine forest. The state isn't necessarily known for its wind, but it ought to be. It's the fifth windiest state in the country. Other states in North America's breezy midsection are charging ahead with wind energy, Texas, Iowa, Kansas, and Oklahoma. But Montana lags behind. It ranks 20th among states in terms of output from wind energy. <br/>I feel like in some ways standing here we're really at sort of the epicenter of the battle between fossil fuels and clean energy. <br/>And it's a battle experts say that clean energy could easily win in Montana. <br/>Chris Clack: You are in a state where you've got abundant capacity to produce way more energy than you need. <br/>Jonathan Jones: Chris Clack is a renewable energy expert and a mathematician who has studied energy sources in Montana. I asked him about the argument that renewables can't replace coal and other fossil fuels because they're just not reliable. <br/>Chris Clack: It's demonstrably not true, no. I mean, wind and solar are reliable. The sun is always shining, it's just it's not overhead all the time. We'd have bigger problems if the sun wasn't always shining, and the wind is always blowing, always somewhere the wind is blowing. <br/>Jonathan Jones: So why do they use that argument? <br/>Chris Clack: The truth in that argument is that it is variable. It'll sometimes be windy, it'll sometimes be cloudy, and so there is truth in the fact that it is variable, but it's predictable. We have weather forecast, we have climatologies, we have long-term data series now of seeing what the wind and solar does over time. <br/>Jonathan Jones: In other words, you can plan for when the wind is blowing or the sun is shining in one part of the US and draw from other areas when it's not. In 2021, Chris analyzed sources of electricity in the state on behalf of the environmental group, 350Montana. The first page of the executive summary reads in all caps, THIS IS THE YEAR MONTANA DECIDES HOW TO REPLACE COAL. For this study, Chris created a model showing how the state could drastically reduce carbon emissions in its energy system. He found that Montana could retire its coal plants, never build another gas plant, and still meet people's energy needs at no additional cost to the consumer. How would Montana do that? <br/>Chris Clack: In a nutshell, it's really building more wind and solar. You could do it at low cost whilst producing twice as much electricity. <br/>Jonathan Jones: But the inconvenient political and social truth is that wind farms and solar panels, at least right now, don't help the economy like coal does. Renewables don't create the same number of long-term well-paying jobs as a strip mine or a coal fire power plant, and renewables don't replace the tax revenue that a town like Colstrip, Montana depends on. I posed this problem to Anne Hedges, co-director of the Montana Environmental Information Center, who advocates phasing out coal in this state. How do you replace those good paying jobs? <br/>Anne Hedges: You probably don't, let's be real. I'm, I'm not going to lie, I'm not going to sugarcoat it, those are really good jobs. They pay a lot, they pay way above average, those people are super fortunate to have had those jobs for as long as they have, which is why we need to plan for that transition. <br/>Jonathan Jones: And eventually, even without an energy transition, the coal will run out. Anne says pretending that coal fire power plants can operate forever is a disservice to the workers, their communities, and the planet at large. <br/>Anne Hedges: We can't just say we're going to ignore the climate crisis, we're going to say that these jobs are more important than people's health, than people's wellbeing. Let's go talk to people after hurricanes in this country and say how they feel about it. They'd like to have jobs too and their jobs are disrupted. <br/>Jonathan Jones: Renewables won't immediately replace jobs and they don't satisfy the people who are skeptical of climate change, but Anne says there's another incentive. Switching to renewable energy will dramatically lower the cost of producing electricity. <br/>Anne Hedges: How much does wind cost for fuel? Nothing. How much does solar cost for fuel? Nothing. Coal is not cheaper, not on any calculus that anybody is doing today. <br/>Jonathan Jones: And she says Montanans would see the difference every month. <br/>Anne Hedges: And that is their utility bills and how much are they paying and is there a way for them to pay less. <br/>Jonathan Jones: The short term jobs, the tax revenue right now are a political deal breaker in Montana, but other states are modeling a different approach. In 2019, Colorado created an office of just transition to help communities and workers shift away from the mining and burning of coal. That includes working with utilities and mining companies to bridge the gap of lost jobs and revenue. Colorado's largest utility plans to stop burning coal altogether by 2030. And about 20 miles down the road from Colstrip, the community college on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation recently got a 1.8 million federal grant for workforce development and training in renewable energy. Rancher, Jeanie Alderson wishes Montana's political leaders would follow suit and pivot away from coal too. <br/>Jeanie Alderson: This one might be a double band. <br/>Jonathan Jones: It's branding day on the ranch for the calves born this spring. One by one, the ranchers lift each animal onto a special table. It closes to cradle the cow while a hot brand is pressed against its hide. A meadowlark sings from a fence post and spring grass is greening on the hill. <br/>Jeanie Alderson: The land itself, it's so much more than just home. I feel really lucky to just have this space and to get to live with my family, to have my boys grow up working with their dad and their granddad. Everything that I am, that my family has been, that will be seems all tied up in this place. <br/>Jonathan Jones: Jeanie told me earlier that she and her husband changed the way they ranch in order to stay in business, to stay on the land, and she says it's time for the power companies and legislators tied to coal to adapt too. <br/>Jeanie Alderson: We have to recognize that these coal jobs were good jobs, and losing that is devastating, and we've got to come up with the way so workers aren't left without a way to take care of their families. But we also have to realize that we've got to find a way to take care of the land and water first because it is what's going to be here long past us. <br/>Al Letson: Our lead producer for this week's show is Stephen Smith.

To see how this might affect a major urban area, Drew Gentner and his colleagues at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, analysed air quality in and around the New York City region in August 2018. They found that pollution levels were high enough to trigger an air-quality alert in mid-August and another towards the end of the month.</p><p>The scientists modelled the origins of the air parcels that settled over New York City during those periods. The air mass that set off the first alert had passed over western Canada, where wildfires were burning. The air mass behind the second alert had passed over agricultural fires in the southeastern United States.</p><p>As climate change makes wildfires more common, officials need to prepare for the health effects of smoke on cities \u2014 even when fires are thousands of kilometres away.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><p>[1].Atmos.

Invasive shrubs in Northeastern forests that sprout leaves earlier in the spring and keep them longer in the fall not only absorb more sunlight than native shrubs, but their foliage lowers air temperatures on the forest floor, likely giving them another competitive advantage.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's the conclusion of Penn State researchers who conducted a three-year study of the effect of invasive shrub removal on native forest plants in The Arboretum at Penn State on a tract called the Hartley Wood.</p><p>Invasive shrubs are flourishing in temperate, deciduous forest understories of eastern North America where resources especially light are limited, explained postdoctoral researcher Erynn Maynard-Bean, who led the study. The extended leaf phenology of invasive shrubs provides photosynthetic advantages, but these plants also benefit from seasonally novel shade they create.</p><p>\"Light and temperature influence ecosystem processes, likely slowing the growth of native plants,\" she said. \"We saw a pattern of reduced maximum air temperature in the presence of invasive shrubs during the growing season of most years.\"</p><p>In findings recently published in Natural Areas Journal, the researchers reported that they detected 26.8% less light energy infiltration below invasive shrubs compared to under native shrubs, with differences largest in the spring.</p><p>Because photosynthesis is driven by the number of photons of sunlight within the spectral range that plants use, researchers quantified photons in plots with native and invasive shrubs with a ceptometer, above and below the shrub layer. Those two measurements were taken at approximately 10 feet above and about 4 inches above the forest floor, at the same 20 collection points, on 27 dates spanning three years.</p><p>That difference in light energy is significant, Maynard-Bean noted. \"Think of it this way, it's like a 60-watt lamp in every 10 square feet of the forest is removed by the presence of invasive shrubs, on average, across the growing season,\" she said.</p><p>Researchers recorded temperature data hourly and daily periodically during the study. To understand the influence of invasive shrubs on the daily minimum and maximum temperatures, they calculated the difference in temperatures between invasive shrub plots and native shrub plots. However, temperatures fluctuated in the experiment, according to Maynard-Bean.</p><p>That variation resulted from different surfaces the sunlight hits on the forest floor, she explained, and how much moisture is present.</p><p>\"Sunlight warms the surface, and then that heat transfers to the air. But it turns out to be extremely variable, because it depends on how wet the surfaces are water will absorb a lot of that energy, not changing the temperature. It's also dependent on the type of material on the forest floor. It's mostly leaf litter, but also sticks, logs and rocks change the rate of transfer of light energy into temperature.\"</p><p>The study results may explain a phenomenon that scientists have witnessed associated with invasive forest plants, Maynard-Bean pointed out.</p><p>\"First, we know that invasive shrubs negatively impact bees, butterflies and amphibians in forest understories,\" she said. \"Those are exothermic species, meaning their activity and development is highly influenced by light and temperature in the understory. So, this could help explain why we don't find as many butterflies, bees and amphibians in invaded understories as we do in uninvaded understories.\"</p><p>The findings also may suggest a reason why Eastern forests have grown increasingly fire resistant, to the detriment of fire-tolerant plant species such as oak, Maynard-Bean noted, adding that lower light conditions have potential implications for forest litter quality and decomposition rates.</p><p>\"The darker, cooler conditions caused by the invasion of nonnative shrubs have the potential to exacerbate the mesophication the transition of a fire-adapted community to a fire-intolerant one of Eastern deciduous U.S. forests,\" she said. \"Decades of forest fire suppression have allowed mesophytic, or shade-tolerant, species to shift the understory toward more cool, damp and shaded conditions resistant to burning.\"</p><p>Margot Kaye, associate professor of forest ecology, contributed to the study. Her research group in the College of Agricultural Sciences has studied plant communities at The Arboretum at Penn State for more than a decade.</p><p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture supported this work.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124711530</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63M5-VR61-JCBF-S21G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"769\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 31, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>PENN STATE UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N611310SS</classCode><className>COLLEGES &amp; UNIVERSITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FYF</classCode><className>LIFE FORMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001477</classCode><className>RESEARCH REPORTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N611310SS</classCode><className>COLLEGES &amp; UNIVERSITIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GS154</classCode><className>PENNSYLVANIA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GR120</classCode><className>NORTH AMERICA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Nevertheless, the impact of Japanese mini submarines, balloons, an anthropomorphic bear, unintended consequences, and human actions should not be ignored.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">California fire officials said this week more than 3.4 million acres have burned, destroying thousands of homes and structures and taking at least 35 lives. To date, there have been 7,900 separate fires reported.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Oregon more than 500,000 people have been evacuated, and dozens are missing with fires there devouring in excess of 950,000 acres. In Washington state, Gov. Jay Inslee reported a week ago fire had burned approximately 627,000 acres.</p><p>In the 1880s, the United States Army was put in charge of administering Yellowstone National Park. When wildfires in 1910 burned millions of acres in Idaho and Montana, the concept of \"fighting\" fires was born. It would evolve into a policy of putting out all fires. Native Americans and private landowners could be fined for burning on their own land.</p><p>People living in forested areas have always had a realization of how devastating a wildfire can be. However, those on the West Coast have an unusual historical perspective ingrained in their psyche. Just as baby boomers have memories of sheltering under their desks in case of nuclear attack, residents of the West Coast have shared memories of preparing for potential firestorms ignited by Japanese attack.</p><p>On Feb. 23, 1942, a Japanese minisub fired from 16 to 25 rounds from its deck gun at the Ellwood Oil Field west of Santa Barbara, Calif., initiating the first attack on the North American mainland. Little damage was done. However, the repercussions in California were massive, adding to the fear of a coastal invasion. Two days later this fear intensified during the \"Battle of Los Angeles\" when air raid sirens sounded at 2:25 a.m,. leading to more than 1,400 anti-aircraft shells being fired at \"reported\" aircraft. No aircraft was evident. Unfortunately, during the more than two-hour \"attack,\" five civilians died: three in car accidents during the chaos and two from heart attacks.</p><p>These two events culminated in President Roosevelt interring 110,000 people of Japanese heritage, 11,000 of German ancestry, and 3,000 with Italian ancestry until the order was rescinded in 1945.</p><p>A release by Japanese naval forces of more than 9,000 fire balloons created an intense fear of wildfires along the coast. In an effort to offset the demoralizing effect of these threats, the USDA Fire Service organized the Cooperative Forest Fire Prevention Program (CFFP) in 1942. Civilians were mobilized in an effort to protect trees. Lumber was a valued wartime commodity.</p><p>At the time, the animated Disney character \"Bambi\" was extremely popular and had been used for anti-fire poster. This poster was such a success that another animal was determined to be the best ambassador for a fire prevention campaign. On Aug. 2, 1944, a bear was introduced to fill this role. \"Smokey Bear\" would become synonymous with forest fire prevention.</p><p>Unfortunately, Smokey may have done his job too well. The idea of fire suppression was so strong that for many, all fire was equated with being bad for the forest. This led in many instances to the prevention of fire fulfilling it's needed role in the forest.</p><p>IN 1931 Herbert Lee Stoddard published, \"The Bobwhite Quail: Its Habits, Preservation, and Increase.\" Stoddard argued that successful wildlife management required more than setting seasons and regulations. It required active management of natural processes, the most controversial being the use of fire to maintain the longleaf pine forests in the Red Hill region of Georgia. This ran against the practices of the day when foresters felt that fire would be detrimental to reforestation if reintroduced into the areas that had been destroyed by the logging practices of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. State and federal agencies of the day developed policies of strict fire suppression.</p><p>Stoddard was among the first to call them out on the practice, arguing fire should be harnessed as a tool in ecological management. When he presented his initial studies, his peers literally laughed at him.</p><p>Today, Stoddard's philosophy of fire as a necessary tool in the forest has been widely accepted in the Southeastern states with the region taking on a leadership role in the practice. In 1958 he and others who believed in this philosophy founded Tall Timbers Research Station near Tallahassee, Fla. It was the first research center in the nation focused on fire ecology. Fire-based ecology uses prescribed, or control burns, to reduce wildfire hazards by reducing fuel loads on the ground as well as clearing downed and dead trees.</p><p>In the early 1970s, Tall Timbers began to focus on the issue of using a fire regime in the western United States. They observed the rebounding of forests after wildfires and determined through experiments that prescribed burns would be a safe and effective management tool. For a variety of reasons, though, the practice has not been broadly embraced there. Data show that the federal government has continued to spend more money on fire suppression than prescribed burns. Data from the National Interagency Fire Center indicates that the Forest Service has averaged using prescribed burns on an average of only 2.2 million acres a year, or 11% of the land managed by the agency.</p><p>In California, the impact of these policies is evident and key, considering that the Federal government owns 57 percent of the land in the state. California owns only 3 percent, with the other 40 percent in private ownership.</p><p>Success! An email has been sent to  with a link to confirm list signup.</p><p>Error!

Fires create smoke, and the control of smoke is an integral part of any prescribed burn plan. California state regulations related to air quality make it difficult to effectively burn where fire is most needed and would be an effective deterrent.</p><p>State regulations restricting timber harvesting have made it extremely difficult to manage the state's forests. President Clinton was successful in restricting the development of new roads in the national forests, making it difficult to access potential timber for harvest.</p><p>Thomas McClintock represents the 4th Congressional District in northern California, encompassing Yosemite National Park.</p><p>\"Time and again, we see vivid boundaries between the young, healthy, growing forests managed by the state and private landowners, and the choked, dying, or burned federal lands,\" McClintock said. \"There's an old adage that the excess timber comes out of the forest one way or another. It's either carried out, or it burns out.\" McClintock has expressed support of the Resilient Federal Forest Act, a bill that would stop the practice of taking fire prevention funding and using it instead for fire suppression.</p><p>Ironically, the use of fire suppression in California has resulted in creating a larger carbon footprint. It is estimated that each forest fire releases 5.2 metric tons of greenhouse gases, or the equivalent of 1.1 million passenger cars annually.</p><p>In 2018 President Trump issued Executive Order 13855, directing the Department of Interior and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to promote active management of America's forests to reduce wildfire risk with specific targets for actions.</p><p>Interior officials were required to:</p><p>--Treat 750,000 acres of public land to reduce fuel loads (controlled burns);</p><p>--Treat 500,000 acres of public lands to protect water quality and mitigate severe flooding and erosion risk arising from forest fires;</p><p>--Reduce vegetation through forest health treatments by offering for sale 600 million board feet of timber from public lands.</p><p>In California this accounted for reducing the fuel load on 38,837 acres and improved the water quality and erosion risk on 4,125 acres. Approximately 16 million board feet of timber were sold. It also resulted in 1,157 miles of roads being improved for access in forest areas. In Georgia, this accounted for reducing the fuel load on 8,741 acres and 326 miles of road improvement.</p><p>Although it is encouraging to see this step toward the utilization of a fire-based system of management, the scope of the problem remains daunting. The impact of EO 13855 in California impacted .002 percent of the land under control by the DOI.</p><p>In 2019, wildfire activity was significantly less than prior years and the 10-year annual average, as there were 48,484 wildfires that burned 4.57 million acres. The 10-year annual average has been approximately 60,000 wildfires burning 6.7 million acres, but in 2018, more than 52,000 wildfires burned 8.5 million acres of federal, state, tribal and private lands.</p><p>With the 2020 fire season is off to a dramatic start, it is not surprising that the raging wildfires have taken on significant political overtones. Visiting California Monday, President Trump blamed poor management practices, downplaying the impact of climate change. Former Vice President Joe Biden responded later, \"If you give a climate denier four more years in the White House, why would we be surprised that we have an America ablaze?\"</p><p>___ (c)2020 The Albany Herald, Ga.

He attributes the disappearance of his breath fog over the years to global warming. </p><p><br/>Waway, 53, is a traditional musician and pioneer of the art of soil painting using 23 hues from the earth where he lives. He is a cultural bearer of the Talaandig tribe, one of seven in the Bukidnon province[1] in Mindanaoand one of an estimated 110 Indigenous groups in the country. <br/>The second largest and poorest island in the nation, Mindanao is nevertheless known asthe 'food basket' of the Philippines[2], devoting a third of its land to agriculture and producing 40% of the country's nourishment, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization[3] of the U.N. <br/>Land survey data and satellite image guided estimates suggest that over two thirds of the primary rainforest cover in Bukidnon is gone and continuing to disappear. Over a century of denudation of the mountain landscape for hardwood exports, development and commercial farming has exacerbated fires, floods, landslides and water supply problems that threaten lives and reduce economic security. <br/>One Talaandig tribe member serenades another on a traditional bamboo flute at a reforestation and agroforestry site in Songco village in Bukidnon Province on Mindanao island.Courtesy: Henry Binahon Deforestation And Climate Change <br/>Newly elected as a municipal councilman in June, Waway seeks to connect the local government with community-led efforts to restore the upland rainforest ecosystem, maintain the food supply and create economic opportunities for the impoverished Indigenous people. If successful, these local partnerships could provide a template for much-needed solutions on a larger scale. <br/>Deforestation worsens the impact of climate change-related natural disasters[4] across the entire Philippines, a geographically diverse archipelago of over 7,640 islands. Without trees to absorb rain and spread nutrients, soil becomes dust, mountains crumble and the water supply diminishes because, without anything to catch it, precipitation dries up after flooding empty land and overwhelming rivers. The peak dry season in spring then becomes a drought with heightened forest fire risk. The answer, advocates say, is to try to reverse the damage. <br/>'After these floods, they just pray to God. But they've been praying for a long time that God will protect them but they did not plant a single tree. God cannot give you a hectare of trees so that you'll be protected. You should plant those trees, and you'll be protected,' Waway says. <br/>Philippine President and agriculture secretary Ferdinand Marcos Jr. acknowledged the connection during a press conference on Nov. 1[5]. Tropical storm Paeng had just ripped through the country[6], killing at least 110 people, displacing nearly a million and wreaking $50 million in agricultural damages[7], especially to rice crops. <br/>'We have to include tree planting in our flood control,' said Marcos Jr., who had celebrated his 65th birthday[8] in September by planting a tree. <br/>Talaandig tribesman and agroforestry farm owner Henry Binahon, left, poses with Indigenous trainees.Courtesy: Henry Binahon Commercial Logging And Other Threats <br/>Before colonization by Spain in the 16th century, most of the Philippines was covered by nearly 70 million acres of lush, protective native forests. But commercial logging for hardwood exportation for luxury furniture after the U.S. took possession of the islands in 1898 decimated the trees. By the 1980s, logging concessions during former President Ferdinand Marcos' martial law reduced the nation's tree coverage to 7 million acres. <br/>This low level of forestation has persisted as governmental policies have toggled between exploitation and restoration, exhibited in this sweeping timeline[9] by the Pulitzer Center's Rainforest Investigations Network initiative. <br/>The son of a Talaandig chieftain, Waway learned the importance of sustainability early on from elders who lived off of the land. <br/>In 1986, Waway's father, also a musician, replanted bamboo trees to harvest for instruments. A decade later, Waway's older brother Datu Migketay Victorino Saway, better known as Datu Vic, successfully lobbied for the signing of the Indigenous People's Rights Act in 1997. <br/>The law enforced the sovereignty of Indigenous tribes over ancestral domains, some of which had been transacted to new settlers, developers and logging enterprises after American administrators imposed a land title system. This system prevailed after the Philippines gained independence in 1946, aggravating territorial conflicts that exist to this day with the native Muslim Bangsamoro population of Mindanao. <br/>Community-led reforestation and agroforestry efforts have created space for collaboration among the region's groups and the entities that support them. <br/>One example is the not-for-profit Hineleban Foundation, established by John Perrine, a Bukidnon native and former CEO of Unifrutti Tropical Philippines Inc. In 2001, he planted bananas in Songco. He thought that he had done everything right until he received criticism from Datu Vic. <br/>He met with the chieftain only to be confronted by some 200 Talaandig residents who informed him that his operations had killed a revered Balete tree that had served as a sacred altar for the tribe. <br/>'Reforestation will have to include the connectivity of the ecosystem, including the spirituality of the Indigenous people.' - Henry Binahon, Binahon Agroforestry Farm <br/>After more conversations, Perrine removed his banana plantations. In 2006, with his wife Renee, he initated the foundation towork with Indigenous people[10] on food security, reforestation and disposable income projects. Eventually, he planted a replacement Balete in the original tree's spot. <br/>Today, 329 families across the province reap the benefits from gardening and farming with Hineleban. A marketable example of these endeavors is the cultivation of arabica coffee. <br/>Local production used to bring in three to four cents per pound for unprocessed beans. Now, 248 Bukidnon farming families get 14 to 23 cents per pound, or $6,500 an acre annually. Another 137 families grow adlai[11], a native grain trending as a superfood with anti-cancerous powers. Both products are sold in Manila at Healthy Options franchises and the Hineleban Cafe in the trendy Makati neighborhood. <br/>Unifrutti remains Hineleban Foundation's largest financial supporter. In 2018, Globe Telecom donated $500,000 over a five-year period. Foreign backers such as the Embassy of the Netherlands and the Dutch water utility company VEI also have partnered with the organization. And individuals can gift a seedling tree to the community for under $6. <br/>Over the past 30 years, Henry Binahon, Waway's fellow tribesman, has become the largest supplier of seeds and seedlings throughout Mindanao and Visayas, the central island group of the Philippines. <br/>'Extinction of the forest will also be extinction of the Indigenous culture,' he warns. <br/>The Talaandig tribe gathers under the replanted Balete tree of Songco village.Courtesy: Georgia Perrine/2022 <br/>Enchanted by planting since childhood, he started his career with the Philippine Department of Environment and Natural Resources, working on watershed and biodiversity management projects. <br/>In 1992, he and his wife began Binahon Agroforestry Farm on 7 acres of land, growing bamboo, mahogany and gmelina trees. The farm grew to 20 acres, plus another 10 for reforestation research plantings. By the highway in Malayabalay, the capital of Bukidnon, Binahon set up a 5-acre nursery for seedlings, many descended from trees planted years before. <br/><br/>With financial and technical support from groups linked tothe Asian Development Bank and the World Agroforestry Centre[12], Binahon is now planting five model farms. <br/>He also is establishing a Lantapan-Manupali watershed subcommittee overseen by local government units and representatives from the Riverbasin Management Office of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources in Manila. If he can duplicate good results in the local watershed, he dreams of scaling up the models with DENR to improve the condition of other upland watersheds. <br/>'It's ambitious, but who will be ambitious for us and who will work for us? We all have to think in 360 degrees,' Binahon says. <br/>Coming Together <br/>On Sept. 26, 2014, the DENR and Mindanao Development Authority set a Guinness World Record for planting more than 3 million trees[13] at once throughout the region. <br/>For 2023, the Philippine government has earmarked $43 million of its budget for an Enhanced National Greening Program[14] that promises to replant billions of trees across 17.5 million acres of 'unproductive land.' However, the program has already drawn concern over limited community engagement and the favoring of exotic rather than native species for replanting. <br/>By contrast, Binahon has planted 100,000 trees and dispersed 1 million seedlings since 2010, some directly to the DENR. <br/>According to Global Forest Watch, Bukidnon was responsible for more than 28,000 acres of tree cover gain from 2000 to 2020 - 6.6% of the increase nationwide.Lantapan, Songco's municipality, was the top third among five districts contributing to the overall gain. <br/>But there has been a net loss of trees due to tripping for firewood, development and slash-and-burn clearing of massive fields for pineapple, sugar cane or genetically modified corn. <br/>Abandoned sites also become host to cogon grass, which self-ignites in hot, windy weather and causes wildfires. As a buffer, Hineleban Foundation has sponsored the planting of nearly 900,000 Calliandra 'powderpuff' trees, usually as the pilot species for new reforestation sites. <br/>Long-term replenishment of a complex ecosystem also requires a multi-story assembly of tall trees, smaller trees, fruit plants, seedlings, creeping and crawling plant varieties, agroforestry crops and root vegetables that propagate easily, Binahon says. And each growth must serve multiple functions such as absorbing and releasing water, providing food and habitats for rare species, hosting honeybees, emitting oxygen and absorbing carbon dioxide. <br/>Three decades of replantings flourish in Songco village on the island of Mindanao. Abaca, a native banana, appears in the foreground.Courtesy: Henry Binahon <br/>One multifunctional crop is rattan palm, a native climbing evergreen that holds land together and bears fruits that bulbul birds eat and later replant through droppings. The tree also yields a profitable cane popular for furniture, baskets and home decorations, serving Binahon's overarching goal of securing compensation for his people's hard work. <br/>'I'm really looking at economic empowerment so the people can be involved in decision-making,' Binahon says. 'Reforestation will have to include the connectivity of the ecosystem, including the spirituality of the Indigenous people.' <br/>Corporate interests that in the past have borne much of the blame for environmental woes have also begun trying to help. <br/>Nestle Philippines pledged in 2021[15] to plant 3.5 million bamboo and native trees over three years in Mindanao. Plantations on the island provide beans for the company's Nescafe line. <br/>Georgia Perrine, general manager of Hineleban Foundation, has noticed the heightened interest of other companies seeking to reduce their carbon footprint or boost their environmental, social, and governance business scores. <br/>Named after a sacred Talaandig-Hingaunen term meaning 'Mother Tree of the rainforest that sustains the cycle of all life,' the foundation remains keenest about cherished partnerships with the Indigenous community. In December 2012, the organization mediated a declaration of unity signed by the seven tribes of Bukidnon for collaborative sovereignty over the region. So far, the alliance has planted Indigenous forest trees across 1,092 acres throughout the province. <br/>Meanwhile, Binahon hosts farm stays, tours, and charity concerts at his farm to fund further reforestation research and education. <br/>Bukidnon is on the State Department's reconsider travel list[16] for 'crime, terrorism, civil unrest, and kidnapping.' But pastoral Songco village, which has just over 4,000 inhabitants, appears ensconced from these deadly clashes or the fatal strife befalling land defenders against illegal logging in Palawan[17] and opponents of coal mining in southern Mindanao. <br/>When Waway travels, he beckons, 'Come to my village. We are a peaceful community with good people.' <br/>On Oct. 19, he performed at Honolulu's Waiwai Collective with Talaandig percussionist Marcelino Balugto P Necosia Jr. The musicians were in Hawaii for the first time on tour with the House of Gongs creative movement to amplify traditional Philippine art forms. Back in Bukidnon, five people had just died after being buried in post-rain landslides. In Songco, Talaandig planters had pushed a pickup truck full of seedlings uphill through the mud. <br/>Tribesmen pushing a truck up muddy hill to deliver seedlings  <br/>Waway strummed his two-stringed katyapi made of taparak wood and sang while Necosia Jr. drummed and played a bamboo kubing mouth harp. Later, Necosia Jr. imitated frog and bird calls on the kokak, two flat, resonant sticks carved from Bukidnon bamboo. <br/>Addressing the audience, Waway vowed to continue raising awareness about Songco's rainforest through art as much as municipal leadership. <br/>'We will try to make more beautiful songs, more beautiful paintings because even the president of the world will bow to that. That's the power of beauty,' he said. <br/>Civil Beat's coverage of climate change is supported by the Environmental Funders Group of the Hawaii Community Foundation, Marisla Fund of the Hawaii Community Foundation and the Frost Family Foundation.  <br/> Sign up for our FREE morning newsletter and face each day more informed.  <br/><br/><br/> Sorry.

We stand on their shoulders and move forward,\" he said. \"Time is changing, so is our task. Now, we need to make contribution to building an ecological civilization.\"<br/>The achievements of Saihanba for more than half a century are a reflection of the concept that \"clean waters and green mountains are just as valuable as gold and silver.\" It proves Chinese President Xi Jinping's idea that \"protecting the ecological environment means protecting productivity and improving the ecological environment is developing productivity.\"</p><p>Child of the mountains<br/>Born on a ranch in 1990s, Zhang has a deep connection to mountains and forests.<br/>He was given a name \"Jianglai,\" which means \"in the future\" in the Chinese language. It's possible his parents wished he would explore the world in the future, but instead he chose to work on the Saihanba Mechanized Forest Farm in North China's Hebei Province following his graduation in 2016.<br/>\"I arrived on National Day in 2016. It was my dream job,\" he said.<br/>At first, Zhang was assigned to Dahuangqi farm in Saihanba as a technician. Afterwards, he was given the role of managing the forests, planting trees, and overseeing online trading of carbon credits. He was promoted to director at the Xiahebian farm of Saihanba in December 2021.<br/>Working in the cradle of the mountains, Zhang often has to bear a harshness and loneliness that people living in the cities could hardly image.<br/>\"I still remember the first winter when I came to Saihanba. The cold wind seemed to have penetrated my bones,\" he said. \"In the shadow of the hills, even wearing the thickest gloves, my fingers still turned numb. The cold wind blew to my face directly and I was breathless.\"<br/>\"At that time, I asked myself, why did I choose this job?\"<br/>However, Zhang felt ashamed soon after seeing his co-workers were not complaining about the extreme work environment. On the contrary, they were recording data carefully.<br/>\"The process of adaption is difficult, yet it builds will power the most,\" Zhang realized.<br/>Once, on a normal day in May, when Zhang was planting trees on the mountain slopes, it started to snow. \"I did not expect snow at this time of the year and I started to shake immediately. I was frozen and could not even tear open the seasoning for a bag of instant noodles.\"<br/>Working in the woods, it is normal to be bitten by bugs. In the summer of 2019, while planting trees in the mountains, Zhang was bitten by a tick. He did not pay much attention to the bite and thought he would heal soon. However, he did not, and his arm swelled to the point that he was unable to bend it.<br/>\"I went to the hospital in the end and I still have a scar there,\" he said, \"this is the first medal this job gave me.\"<br/>During winter, the forests face risk from spot fires. To ensure the region's safety, Zhang wakes up at 4 am every day. \"Even though it is -20 C, I have to inspect the forests and reach every checkpoint. It is a real battle.\"<br/>\"Gradually and slowly, I realize why everybody could fight for the forests - when I see lush saplings on the mountain, I cannot describe how satisfied I feel in my heart. This job really brings me happiness.\"<br/><br/>The will of a young Party member<br/>Zhang conquered difficulties in his work because he lives with the spirit and values of a CPC member. He also has a deep understanding of today's CPC.<br/>From a very young age, Zhang has been working hard to become a CPC member. He joined the Party soon after he started working at Saihanba.<br/>\"The Communist Party of China is the vanguard of the Chinese working class, and the leading core of the Chinese people of all nationalities. Joining the Party is not only a kind of spiritual purification, but also a kind of improvement of one's consciousness,\" he said.\u00a0<br/>\"At that time, I had an idea that I wanted to join the CPC. I want to realize the value of life. Now, as a Party member of five years, when I recall the time when I joined the Party, I still feel excited.\"<br/>Zhang believes as a youth Party member in the new era, one must draw on the strong spiritual power of perseverance passed down from the older generation.\u00a0<br/>Since 1962, the builders of the Saihanba Afforestation Community responded to the call of the Party by working hard to make a miracle happen \u2014 turn this treeless, sandy wasteland into a vast forest. The spirit of Saihanba entails a strong sense of mission, arduous pioneering work, and green development.<br/>\"This is my story, and it is also a portrayal of the young people in the forest farm. Every little role shines when we work together. The older generation has laid a solid foundation for us. We stand on their shoulders and move forward,\" he said.</p><p>New task in a new era<br/>Times are changing, and so are the tasks in the forest farm. From planting trees on bold hills to fostering new growth in the forests, from providing timber to ecological products\u2026 the role of Saihanba is changing, with people here calling it the \"second startup\" of Saihanba.<br/>New technologies are being deployed to streamline work in Saihanba. Now, Saihanba has forest fire prevention monitoring system, drone monitoring, infrared fire detection radar and lightning early warning monitoring system.\u00a0<br/>\"We are born at a good time and have a heavy responsibility on our shoulders. Our young generation should make persistent efforts, shoulder this heavy burden, take the initiative to learn, and use science and technology to lead the development of Saihanba's green business, and contribute to the construction of an ecological civilization for our young generation,\" Zhang said.<br/>\"There is a vivid expression of ecological environment protection and economic development: to protect the ecological environment is to protect productive forces, and to improve the ecological environment is also to develop the productive forces,\" Zhang said.<br/>\"The successful restoration of Saihanba is an example of ecological civilization initiative led by the CPC. The miracle of Saihanba relies on the Party members not forgetting their original aspirations and remembering their mission,\" Zhang said.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202206/1267319.shtml\">https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202206/1267319.shtml</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=CN05507&amp;sd=2022-06-30\"/> View original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-times-young-cpc-member-inherits-saihanba-spirit-of-strong-sense-of-mission-arduous-work-green-development-301578643.html</p><p>SOURCE Global Times</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=CN05507&amp;Transmission_Id=202206300456PR_NEWS_USPR_____CN05507&amp;DateId=20220630\"/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><contact><bodyText><p><br/><br/>CONTACT: Wenting Xie, +86-01065367634, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:xiewenting@globaltimes.com\">xiewenting@globaltimes.com</email> .cn </p></bodyText></contact></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRNEWS-CN0550720220630</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRNEWS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65TJ-08M1-DXP3-R0K2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8054</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1425\"/><timeReceived>4:56 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>PR Newswire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"06\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>June 30, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Eisgruber told the crowd, \"and it is fantastic to have you all out here this evening for one of the most memorable traditions at Princeton University: the bonfire.\"</p><p>The event began early Sunday as each undergraduate class took to Cannon Green with paint and wooden pallets, decorating the wood with the scores of both winning games -- Princeton: 18, Harvard: 16, and Princeton: 35, Yale 20 -- and other embellishments. As the temperature dropped and the sun set, the crowd gathered as the Undergraduate Student Government handed out hot chocolate, posters and t-shirts.</p><p>Cheerleaders' chants, a DJ set by University Spokesperson Ben Chang, and the sounds of the Princeton University Band rang out across the green to welcome hundreds of students, alumni, faculty, staff and local community members.</p><p>Before introducing President Eisgruber, Charles thanked campus partners, with a special nod to Princeton Facilities and Operations, the Department of Public Safety, the Department of Fire Safety, the Princeton Fire Department, the Princeton First Aid and Rescue Squad, and the New Jersey Forest Fire Service for keeping the crowd safe.</p><p>Eisgruber took the podium next to welcome everyone . He praised the football team's \"tenacious defense\" and \"explosive offense\" and congratulated the players, the coaching staff and the \"team around the team\" for bringing home the Ivy League trophy.</p><p>\"Thank you, Tigers, for the excitement, the excellence and pride that you have brought to our campus this season,' he said, \"and thank you for giving this community the occasion to come together tonight.\"</p><p>The bonfire crowd heard next from senior Christian Potter, president of the Undergraduate Student Government, and from the Class of 2022 president, Santiago Guiran.</p><p>Potter spoke about having missed football games and other student gatherings during the pandemic, saying, \"Let the lighting of this bonfire be the ultimate re-ignition of community.\"</p><p>Guiran noted that the Class of 2022 started their time as students with a bonfire in 2018 and are ending with another one. He encouraged students to have fun Sunday night, and to not worry about academic expectations until Monday morning.</p><p>Attending his first bonfire as athletic director, John Mack, Class of 2000, honored the women's lightweight rowing team, one of the few Ivy League teams to compete in the spring of 2021, for their national championship. They led the crowd in a traditional locomotive chant.</p><p>In addition to recognizing the football and rowing teams, Mack spoke to the success of Princeton's student-athletes this fall. Four teams won conference titles this semester, five reached the NCAA tournament, and all nine fall sports teams earned first or second place in their conference.</p><p>\"There's not a school in this league that can rival that kind of broad athletic success. It's a result of the hard work and dedication of our coaches, our student-athletes and their supporting teams but it's also a direct reflection of the Princeton student body and the Princeton University community,\" said Mack.</p><p>Grace Stone, a junior from Glen Cove, New York, majoring in African American Studies, watched the program from the crowd alongside her teammates on the women's basketball team. \"The last year-and-a-half has been an extremely hard time for all of us, especially for student-athletes who haven't been able to connect with each other and play the sports that they love,\" Stone said, \"so it's super exciting to see everybody come together.\"</p><p>The next speaker was Charles W. Caldwell Jr. '25 Head Coach of Football Bob Surace, Class of 1990, who was met with raucous applause and cheers from his players. He expressed his gratitude for the season-long support from the University community, saying \"Every single home game our students, our community, our alumni, our faculty showed up and brought the energy so we could win.\"</p><p>In bonfire tradition, three captains of the team that was the last to earn a bonfire returned to campus to hand off the torch literally to this year's squad. The Class of 2019's Tom Johnson, Kurt Holuba and John Lovett were all on hand to give the torch to the 2022 senior captains.

People are not leaving California because the weather is bad. They are leaving California because the state's policies are messed up.\" - Jonathan Williams, ALEC chief economist<br/>Dr. Arthur Laffer, economist Stephen Moore and ALEC Chief Economist and Executive Vice President of Public Policy recently held a video conference call with ALEC state directors to discuss highlights of the 2022 Rich States, Poor States Report. Here are top line messages from the call.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dr. Arthur Laffer:</emphasis><br/>If you believe incentives matter, and I do, state policymakers have the effect of changing those incentives at both the state and local levels. Those changes in incentives have consequences. This ranking of states is a tried-and-true formula and ranking the gun states by this, I think is a great way of picking winners and giving guidance on how states should be effectively governed.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stephen Moore:</emphasis><br/>This study has had a big impact on what state officials, governors and legislators are doing. States seem to be moving in our direction where we're seeing significant improvements in tax codes and improvements in fixing unfunded liabilities in pension systems. We are making progress in terms of transparency in healthcare costs, something which could really drive down costs. ALEC has really led the charge in all these things. While I don't like the direction the federal government is going, I sure like the direction so many states are moving in.<br/>This is our 15th annual Rich States, Poor States Report and every year one state has come out on top, Utah.\u00a0 Congratulations to Gov. Cox and previous governors who have done an amazing job. I just got back from Salt Lake City, and it is booming! It's an incredibly vibrant place and they've got the whole formula put together very well there.<br/>Congratulations to North Carolina which made a big move up in the rankings this year. This is a nonpartisan report and the governor in North Carolina is a Democrat and he's signed a lot of legislation that the Republican legislature passed. The previous governor was good, as well.<br/>Finally, it was a huge mistake for the federal government to spent trillions of dollars during COVID. The federal government can only give money to states by taking money from them. It's an illusion that somehow the federal government is bailing out the states. This was the states' money to begin with, and now, for the most part, states have gigantic surpluses. And this is a great time to use those surplus revenues to fix their tax code.<br/>This is a magic moment. It's a magic moment for school choice because parents want their kids in good schools. It's a magic moment for tax reform at the state level. I think even in some of these blue states that have been traditionally very liberal, they're looking at some reforms that could really make their states more prosperous. I think the direction is good, and I think a lot of that direction is a result of the Rich State, Poor State rankings.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jonathan Williams, ALEC Chief Economist and Executive Vice President of Policy:</emphasis><br/>Over the years we've seen that states can fall behind by simply standing still in the rankings as other states become that much more competitive. North Carolina is a state that has been very aggressive in the past decade in lowering taxes and has moved from being ranked #26 a decade ago to #2 now. Our great ALEC members in the legislature led the way on this. This is huge. North Carolina now wants to phase out their business income tax altogether by the end of the decade. They're at 2.5% right now in North Carolina, and they're going to zero.<br/>We've been just so pleased to see the governors and legislators leading the way and cutting taxes this year. If we can't cut taxes in a year like this, when there's so much money sloshing around in state budgets, we might as well give up the ghost and not even attempt it. This is the year to cut taxes.<br/>We saw Gov. Kim Reynolds of Iowa work with state lawmakers to get their flat tax done. Gov. Reynolds' response to President Biden's State of the Union address couldn't have shown a stronger contrast for how ideas are winning.<br/>In my estimation, since states first began progressive income taxes 110 years ago, only four states moved away from the progressive income down to a flat tax. In contrast, in the last month or so, we've seen four more states become flat tax states and go away from progressive income tax.<br/>This is basic economics. This is clearly the what the Founders had in mind from the \"laboratories of democracy\" and taking the stories of what works comparing them against the stories of what does not work. Sure enough, the rising tide is lifting all boats when it comes to good policy right now.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dr. Arthur Laffer:</emphasis><br/>Progressive tax rates kill prosperity.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stephen Moore:</emphasis><br/>The trillions of dollars of spending and borrowing mostly at the federal level is obviously a major driver of the high inflation we are seeing. \u00a0This inflation crisis could lead to a crash landing. I hope it doesn't. I think the match that lit this forest fire was that trillions of dollars of federal spending. We spent four to five trillion dollars on COVID that we didn't have.<br/>We've done a lot of analysis, looking at the effect of all these government benefits to people who are not working. And the big increase in the unemployment benefits had an extremely negative effect in terms of getting people back into the workforce. Now a lot of those extra benefits have gone away. But we've got to get back to work. States need to work on welfare reforms. We've got to get people back working. We shouldn't incentivize them not to work.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dr. Arthur Laffer:</emphasis><br/>States can really make a difference by reforming welfare and unemployment benefits. States need to maintain very low payments for being unemployed, making it literally for what it's supposed to be a temporary bridge to another job and not a permanent situation where they don't work.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jonathan Williams:</emphasis><br/>Let's stop taxing work. Let's tax consumption. Let's not tax people's livelihoods getting back to the workforce.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dr. Arthur Laffer:</emphasis><br/>Let's reduce all taxes including consumption.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jonathan Williams:</emphasis><br/>A huge phenomenon and takeaway from this report is that taxpayers vote with their feet. And it's one of the key elements of why it's so important to get things right in Americans. You go down the line of the states that are growing, they are states that are cutting taxes. Doing the right thing leads to a virtuous cycle of attracting businesses attracting individuals. The number one reason on census surveys that people give for moving from one state to another is not for better weather. People are not leaving California because the weather is bad. They are leaving California because the state's policies are messed up. And so that's such a key factor in years of our report.<br/>\u00a0<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-160283</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:657B-6V01-DYY9-01TC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-04-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1165\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2022 ALEC, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>American Legislative Exchange Council</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"04\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>April 14, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Tax Reform</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>Tax Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDJFQzVCQzk2QjMxNDQ5NEJEMDE1QkE3MUMyQTkzMUE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTUwMTgzQjdBNzg5NDIwRjhGRjY5MTc0OTExMjAwODc</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Imposition of Tax</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTA2MjBCODUyNEEzNDMxMjk4Qzc0RjEzM0ExMzQ3MTg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzRCRkI3RTBDNEE3NEQxQkE5Q0RGRTMxQTQyMkU4RDg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLA3</classCode><className>ECONOMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

Airports have been significantly affected, experiencing major decreases in traffic over the past 15 months. Despite these consequences, airports have played a crucial role since the start of the pandemic by continuing to provide essential air services, including traveling to medical appointments, air ambulance services, community resupply, getting goods to market, search and rescue operations, and forest fire response.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, the Minister of Transport, the Honourable Omar Alghabra, launched two new contribution funding programs to help Canada's airports recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic:</p><p>* The Airport Critical Infrastructure Program (ACIP) is a new program providing close to $490 million to financially assist Canada's larger airports with investments in critical infrastructure-related to safety, security or connectivity;</p><p>* The Airport Relief Fund (ARF) is a new program providing almost $65 million in financial relief to targeted Canadian airports to help maintain operations.</p><p>In addition to launching these two new funding programs, the Minister announced that Transport Canada's Airports Capital Assistance Program (ACAP) is receiving a funding top-up of $186 million over two years. The ACAP is an existing contribution funding program which provides financial assistance to Canada's local and regional airports for safety-related infrastructure projects and equipment purchases.</p><p>Quotes</p><p>\"Canada's airports are major contributors to our country's economy, and play a key role in sustaining the social and economic well-being of our communities, and our local airport workers. These programs will help ensure that, as Canada works towards recovery and travel restart post pandemic, our airports remain viable and continue to provide Canadians with safe, reliable and efficient travel options, while creating and maintaining good paying jobs in the airport sector.\"</p><p>The Honourable Omar Alghabra, Minister of Transport</p><p>Quick facts</p><p>* The Airport Critical Infrastructure Program (ACIP), the Airport Relief Fund (ARF), and the Airports Capital Assistance Program (ACAP) funding top-up and program expansion were originally announced in the Fall Economic Statement in November 2020.</p><p>* The Airport Critical Infrastructure Program (ACIP) will distribute $489.6 million in funding over five years to airports for eligible projects such as runway repairs/rehabilitation, airfield lighting enhancements, investments in terminal buildings, and transit stations to ensure connectivity to mass transit systems.</p><p>* On April 15, 2021, the Government of Canada announced a contribution of up to $100 million towards the $600-million project to construct a new Reseau express metropolitain (REM) light rail underground station at the Montreal-Trudeau International Airport. Federal funding for this project comes from the Airport Critical Infrastructure Program (ACIP).</p><p>* The Airport Relief Fund will provide $64.8 million in funding to airports whose 2019 revenues were less than $250 million. The amount of funding to each targeted eligible recipient will be calculated using a tiered formula-based approach, based on 2019 revenues.</p><p>* In addition to the one-time funding top-up of $186 million, eligibility for the Airports Capital Assistance Program (ACAP) has been temporarily expanded to allow National Airport System airports with less than one million annual passengers in 2019 (Gander, Charlottetown, Saint John, Fredericton, Moncton, Thunder Bay, London, and Prince George) to apply for funding under the Program in 2021-2022 and 2022-2023.</p><p>* For 2021-2022, funding has been awarded to 63 airports for 86 ACAP projects, including runway and taxiway repairs/rehabilitation, lighting enhancements, purchasing snow clearing equipment and firefighting vehicles and installing wildlife fencing.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7479375 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7479375</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62N8-PP21-JC11-127S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"667\"/><timeReceived>8:30 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 12, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Getting a handle on them required preparation, perspiration and all hands on deck.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To face off against a wave of fire starts sparked by a lightning storm over Southern Oregon, the Oregon Department of Forestry Southwest District broke the two counties into quadrants. Supervisors in each section strategized ways to utilize an extra 200 contracted personnel and six extra helicopters Thursday, while a fifth supervisor coordinated initial attack teams to tackle the newest fire starts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By the end of the week, a third of roughly four dozen new fires were extinguished, and containment lines were wrapped around nearly all of the new fires \u2014 except for the Hog Creek Fire near Merlin and the Rum Creek Fire north of Galice. The Hog Creek Fire held at 30 acres as of Saturday, and the Rum Creek Fire, estimated at 100 acres, was uncontained, according to ODF spokeswoman Natalie Weber. (Corrected)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It continued a pattern so far this fire season in Southern Oregon of firefighters being successful at keeping fires small.</p><p>But the success sometimes comes at a high cost.</p><p>A firefighter working the Rum Creek Fire, 25-year-old Logan Taylor of Talent, was killed Thursday by a falling tree. Another firefighter working a fire on Tallowbox Mountain south of Applegate needed to be pulled from the fire lines after suffering a heat-related illness.</p><p>Firefighter Collin Hagan, 27, of Michigan, was killed Aug. 10 by a falling tree on the Big Swamp Fire north of Crater Lake.</p><p>A week earlier, Aug. 3, a firefighter working the lightning-caused Wards Creek Fire east of Rogue River needed to be flown from the fire lines to the bottom of the road then taken to a nearby hospital after working in temperatures in the high 90s.</p><p>Lightning naturally tends to strike the tallest point, according to ODF Southwest Oregon District spokeswoman Natalie Weber, so lightning-caused wildfires often are in steep terrain where crews also face challenges such as falling rocks and trees.</p><p>\"In a lot of cases, there isn't very good access, so firefighters are driving to the closest point and then having to hike farther up the hill to actually get to the fire in order to start working on it,\" Weber said.</p><p>Since the fire season began June 1, crews have faced triple-digit temperatures and hundreds of lightning strikes, not to mention multiple close calls. Yet as of this week, no local fire has surpassed the low double digits in acreage.</p><p>With fire season almost three months old, local fire officials shared insights on their efforts and the tools used to keep fires small.</p><p>Story of another summer</p><p>On July 15, 2018, a lightning storm sparked at least 145 fires across Southern Oregon. Many of those fires were quickly extinguished, but not all.</p><p>Within a week, the Rogue Valley's air quality forced Oregon Shakespeare Festival to cancel outdoor performances and Britt to move its outdoor classical concerts to North Medford High School's auditorium.</p><p>Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest Fire &amp; Aviation Staff Officer Dan Quinones was the forest's acting forest duty officer the day the 2018 fires broke.</p><p>Quinones also helped allocate resources this fire season, which has a different track record: 44 fires that burned a combined 8.07 acres. He described this season's strategy in a Zoom interview earlier this month.</p><p>\"The strategy in '18 and the strategy today are really the same,\" Quinones said. \"In 2018, we ran out of stuff \u2014 not just locally but nationally.\"</p><p>The July 2018 fires were competing with other pressing wildfires, according to Quinones, and the Geographic Area Coordination Center in Portland had to prioritize resources for fires threatening people, property and infrastructure.</p><p>Fires in backcountry and wilderness areas lost out. Quinones said the resources they had were focused on protecting communities in Ashland, Butte Falls, Jacksonville and Cave Junction.</p><p>\"We just didn't have enough stuff to get to those fires in a timely fashion, even though we had jumpers on them, etc.,\" Quinones said.</p><p>In the biggest firefights, such as those threatening entire communities, watersheds or critical infrastructure, the GACC has the ability to reassign resources. It's a sword that cuts both ways.</p><p>\"We might lose some aircraft or ground resources without being asked \u2014 they'll just take them,\" Quinones said.</p><p>Quinones described a good relationship and rapport with the GACC Portland office as key to ensuring they understand the resources RRSNF needs to keep during fire season. Presently, he said, \"there are no issues.\"</p><p>\"They know our fuel type down here and that our fires, once they get established, are very resistant to control,\" Quinones said.</p><p>Bracing for lightning</p><p>When lightning is in the forecast \u2014 especially on dry fuels \u2014 Quinones will coordinate the strategic placement of hand crews, tree fallers, fire engines, water tenders, dozers and other equipment needed on the ground between stations in Prospect, Jacksonville, Powers, Cave Junction and Gold Beach, along with the J. Herbert Stone Nursery in Central Point.</p><p>\"We got some places to put stuff,\" Quinones said.</p><p>A forest duty officer at each of the districts oversees operations on the entire forest and will seek out input from staff officers such as Quinones.</p><p>\"From the bigger picture, I'll say, 'Hey, can we move this one asset from one location to another location? Because this is what we have going on,'\" Quinones said.</p><p>Quinones said he coordinates closely with partner agencies such as Oregon Department of Forestry in stationing and allocating resources.</p><p>\"We get all the tools in our toolbox that we need \u2014 not only for us but also for where we think we may need to support our partners as well,\" Quinones said. \"We stage them around the forest for quick response for the projected areas for the event.\"</p><p>New tools for looking ahead</p><p>Late last month, the Corey Fire broke out on the outskirts of Central Point and White City and started spreading to nearby properties, prompting the evacuation of approximately 25 residents nearby.</p><p>The fire started on a property containing large amounts of debris and abandoned vehicles, and it took out three mobile homes on the property, but the fire never grew beyond 5 acres, and 15 threatened structures were spared.</p><p>According to Fire District 3 Chief Robert Horton, the Corey Fire was one of six fires in his jurisdiction aided by two new camera-based technologies this fire season giving incident commanders the ability to see what they're up against.</p><p>Horton chairs the Governor's Fire Service Policy Council, which provides guidance to the governor and the Oregon State Fire Marshal's Office, and was recently named Vice President of the Western Fire Chiefs Association.</p><p>In prior years, incident commanders had to wait until the first firefighters arrived on scene and saw the fire with their own eyes before calling for the resources they need.</p><p>\"We have the technology today that allows for that visualization to occur at time of event, not time of first unit arrival,\" Horton said.</p><p>The Alert Wildfire Camera system utilizes cameras watching over roughly a dozen areas across the Rogue Valley, according to Horton.</p><p>The cameras are designed to complement those used in ODF's Detection Center, which looks out at rural areas in Jackson and Josephine counties.</p><p>\"They're looking for lightning strikes in the forest so they can get their resources out there fast,\" Horton said. \"Our cameras are more targeted toward the interface \u2014 where the forest is meeting the communities.\"</p><p>The camera Fire District 3 utilizes is on Long Mountain and covers parts of Eagle Point, White City and Sams Valley. Other cameras in the system include one on Mount Baldy that helps Fire District 5, providing a view of Phoenix, Talent and parts of Ashland. A third camera covers the Illinois Valley.</p><p>The public can view feeds from the cameras by visiting alertwildfire.org, but emergency response personnel have the power to pan, tilt and zoom if they need to zero in on an area, according to Horton.</p><p>Fire District 3 collaborated with Rogue Valley Council of Governments and Rogue Broadband to install the Long Mountain camera on the company's tower, according to Horton.</p><p>\"We really worked hard in that collaboration to have that camera and the Mount Baldy camera both operational by this fire season,\" Horton said.</p><p>Another technology rolled out in late June and early July is the new 911 Eye system, which allows a person calling in an emergency to send livestream video to the 911 dispatcher.</p><p>The 911 dispatcher can send the caller a link which can be shared with Fire District 3's incident command. If bandwidth is limited, the system can accommodate photos instead.</p><p>Since the Labor Day 2020 wildfires, Horton said there are more firefighting resources at the local level than there were.</p><p>Funds made available from the Oregon Legislature last year through Senate Bill 762 provided fire agencies added funding that Fire District 3 utilized to add a wildland response unit on shift every day.</p><p>\"Right on initial response we have more units to send out to calls,\" Horton said.</p><p>Other districts throughout the Rogue Valley used the fire funding to increase their staff, and SB 762 also covered added resources such as engines and air resources for ODF.</p><p>\"We've got more firefighting resources in our system \u2014 across the state but especially here \u2014 since the 2020 season,\" Horton said.</p><p>Although there's more resources, Horton remembers the challenge he faced during the Labor Day 2020 fires, when the massively destructive Almeda Fire and South Obenchain Fire broke out. With all local resources battling the fires, he called Salem for help, but all of the state's resources were allocated to seven conflagrations across Oregon.</p><p>\"On that day there wasn't units,\" Horton said. \"There's more capacity in the state of Oregon now, so we hope to not have that vulnerability, but I would be remiss if I didn't say there's more room for us to go.</p><p>\"We still could use more units across the state,\" Horton added.</p><p>Reach web editor Nick Morgan at 541-776-4471 or <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:nmorgan@rosebudmedia.com\">nmorgan@rosebudmedia.com</email> Follow him on Twitter @MTwebeditor.</p><p>Correction Aug. 21: This story was updated to say that the Rum Creek Fire was uncontained Saturday.

While it is not clear how much rallygoers spread the virus through secondary infections, state health officials have so far reported 63 cases among South Dakota residents who attended the event.</p><p>The epicenter of the rally, Meade County, has become red-hot with new cases, reaching a per capita rate that is similar to the hardest-hit Southern states. The county reported the highest rate of cases in the state over the last two weeks, according to Johns Hopkins researchers.</p><p>The Black Hills region's largest hospital system, Monument Health, warned Friday that it has seen hospitalizations from the virus rise from five to 78 this month. The hospital was bracing for more COVID-19 patients by converting rooms to intensive care units and reassigning staff.</p><p>Virus cases were already on the rise when the rally started, and it's difficult to measure just how much the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally is to blame in a region where local fairs, youth sports leagues and other gatherings have resumed.</p><p>However, Meade County could be a harbinger of things to come for the Upper Midwest as infections ripple from those events, said Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.</p><p>\"This coronavirus forest fire will keep burning any human wood it can find,\" he said. \"It will find you, and it's so infectious.\"</p><p>Health officials in North Dakota, Wyoming, Minnesota and Wisconsin all reported cases among people who attended the rally, with North Dakota also reporting two hospitalizations.

In this way, less energy is needed to create an ignition because the temperature of the fuels is already elevated. Wind speed and direction and low relative humidity can also exacerbate these conditions, increasing probabilities for increased ignitions and fire spread,\" said Coates.</p><p>\"Drought and extreme heat may also lessen the defense mechanisms that trees and other vegetation might use to protect themselves from other potential disturbances, such as insects and pathogen,\" he said. \"Over time, vegetation may be more susceptible to the effects of these organisms, the vegetation may die, and subsequently new fuels may be added to a given location.\"</p><p>Coates is an assistant professor in the department of forest resources and environmental conservation, in Virginia Tech's College of Natural Resources and Environment.</p><p>\"In California and other areas, warm and dry conditions have been extended beyond the summer months and into autumn and early winter in some years,\" said Coates. \"This essentially extends our 'wildfire season' and provides increased chances for ignitions and conditions that are conducive to rapid fire spread.\"</p><p>\"It also taxes the resources the people, equipment, money -- used to suppress wildfire ignitions. Many of those resources are also used to proactively manage fuels in many locations through the use of controlled and managed prescribed fire.\"</p><p>Dr. Coates maintains an active research program focused primarily on fire ecology. This includes elements of fire behavior, fuels, fire effects, silviculture, and restoration ecology.

When the news broke, I was in shock.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The two other members of the group, rapper Ritchie with a T and producer Parker Corey, went quiet for over a year. Then, last month, they suddenly returned to social media and announced they would be releasing an album, \"By The Time I Get To Phoenix.\"</p><p>As the first project without Groggs, the only thing I could imagine was that the album would be a tribute to him.</p><p>The group is known for their experimental and bombastic sound characterized by hard bass, electronic sound effects, energetic rapping, and the occasional emotional track to complement.</p><p>\"By The Time I Get to Phoenix\" is an entirely different experience.</p><p>The first single from the album, \"Knees,\" was not at all what I expected to hear. Instead of brash and confident lyrics, Ritchie repeatedly croons the words \"Knees hurt me when I grow / And that's a tough pill to swallow\" throughout the track. His vocals are dripping with autotune, yet they still feel raw and heartfelt.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The opening track on the album, \"Outside,\" sets the tone for the noisy, abstract and moving experience to come.\u00a0</p><p>It's turbulent, sparse and dystopian, like it was made in a barren wasteland after society's collapse. Ritchie's vocals are delivered in a frantic and aggressive manner, leaving the listener dazed and confused.</p><p>The only listed feature of the album comes from Detroit rapper ZelooperZ on \"SS San Francisco.\" His music has a very abrasive and cocky style, yet here he opts for a completely new sound.</p><p>Ritchie and ZelooperZ both give intense verses. Add in a deep guitar riff and disorienting noises in the background, and the entire track takes on a haunting, intimidating feel.\u00a0</p><p>\"Footwork In A Forest Fire,\" \"Ground Zero\" and \"Smoke Don't Clear\" each follow one another and epitomize the powerful soundscapes that make this album so impressive and unique.</p><p>Enjoy what you're reading? Signup for our newsletter</p><p>Email Address</p><p>Then comes \"Top Picks For You.\"</p><p>This is their direct tribute to Groggs, and wow.\u00a0</p><p>Ritchie raps about the memory of his fallen partner, and the way it feels unreal, as if he should still be here with him. Yet he knows that he's gone and never coming back. It's passionate and touching, angelic yet chaotic - in a way, transcendent.</p><p>It's followed by \"Wild Wild West,\" a glitchy and aggressive banger with quick, choppy vocals that feel like an assault on the ears.</p><p>\"Postpostpartum,\" one of the more mellow tracks, carries more familiar sounds in production and a melancholic tone to the vocal delivery. It feels like an ode to the band's maturity and their place in the industry.</p><p>The final track, \"Bye Storm,\" feels somber but hopeful and leaves the listener on a high note. Ritchie and a posthumous Groggs discuss dealing with hardships, and how to push through.</p><p>This album is not for everyone. It is challenging and at times overwhelming, yet it's this same quality that makes it deeply impressive.</p><p>Injury Reserve manage to evoke profound emotion primarily through sound, and the lyrics only further those sensations of pain and shock.\u00a0</p><p>\"By The Time I Get To Phoenix\" is an intricately assembled avant-garde piece of music that draws from a wide array of music, seamlessly blending them together into a moving final tribute to Groggs.</p><p>Rating: 9/10</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:mezacuem@miamioh.edu\">mezacuem@miamioh.edu</email></p><p>Read More</p><p>Little Simz explores her relationship with fame on \"Sometimes I Might Be Introvert\"</p><p>By Sean Scott</p><p>|</p><p>September 8, 2021</p><p>Little Simz, real name Simbiatu \"Simbi\" Abisola Abiola Ajikawo, had been a quiet but dominant force in rap and R&amp;B even before her debut album, \"A Curious Tale of Trials + Persons,\" dropped in 2015 after four mixtapes and five EPs.

The innovative program, which uses a collaborative approach with federal and local partners, is delivering results in three important ways:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1) Supporting federal forest collaboratives.</p><p>2) Delivering current scientific finding to improve understanding of forest restoration.</p><p>3) Using the state's workforce to reduce the risk of wildfire and restore resiliency to federal forests.</p><p>Researchers from the Ecosystem Workforce Program (<url normalizedValue=\"http://ewp.uoregon.edu/ODF_FFRP_Monitoring\">http://ewp.uoregon.edu/ODF_FFRP_Monitoring</url>) at the University of Oregon, Oregon State University, and the USDA Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station pored over numbers in the report to determine the program's impact. According to the monitoring report, the program invested $4.41 million of state funds and leveraged an additional $3.5 million from the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) through projects under Good Neighbor Authority (GNA), which allows ODF to sell federal timber to offset the cost of needed restoration projects.</p><p>These investments resulted in:</p><p>* Grants to 12 collaborative groups that helped prepare project-level restoration plans totaling 859,174 acres of federal forestland across 32 different planning areas resulting in:</p><p>* 40,000 acres of forest restoration, timber sales, pre-commercial thinning, and piling of fuels;</p><p>* 25,000 acres of pile burning and about 3,800 acres of broadcast burning;</p><p>* Approximately 210 million board feet of timber sales that supported 486 jobs harvesting or processing timber and 610 jobs in other sectors.</p><p>* Technical assistance and scientific analysis projects including:</p><p>* Three studies examining historic forest fire and ecological conditions;</p><p>* Outreach, communications, and storytelling support for three forest collaboratives.</p><p>* Investments in Forest Service and BLM projects that resulted in:</p><p>* 2 million acres surveyed by LiDAR;</p><p>* 9,759 acres of NEPA surveys (heritage and botany);</p><p>* 2,550 acres of non-commercial fuels and prescribed fire treatments;</p><p>* Two contracted NEPA Categorical Exclusion projects covering 9,093 acres.</p><p>Why a state program to restore federal forests? During Governor Kitzhaber's administration, state and federal land management officials recognized that the status quo was not working. Citing increasing wildfires, stagnant rural economies and declining forest health, the Oregon Legislature created ODF's Federal Forest Restoration program to pioneer new ways of getting things done. Rather than lawsuits and bureaucratic silos, the program employs a collaborative \"all lands, all hands\" approach.</p><p>The program takes aim at a very large problem. Wildfires are getting bigger and fire season is lasting longer. According to the Governor's Council on Wildfire Response (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.oregon.gov/gov/policy/Pages/wildfirecouncil.aspx\">https://www.oregon.gov/gov/policy/Pages/wildfirecouncil.aspx</url>), an estimated 5.6 million acres of Oregon's forests and rangelands need some form of active restoration, such as prescribed burning, fuels reduction, and restoration thinning. These treatments can slow fire's spread and provide important jobs for rural communities.</p><p>These investments also created longer duration jobs for both ODF seasonal employees and local forest contractors. Each year ODF hires hundreds of seasonal firefighters. The program uses ODF crews during the winter and spring months to conduct fuels reduction and restoration work thereby decreasing fire risk and lengthening employment for seasonal employees. These ODF crews accomplished an additional 3,370 acres of thinning and prescribed burning as well as 6,370 acres of commercial and non-commercial project preparation work including layout and tree marking.</p><p>Lastly, the report highlights the benefits of state and federal agencies working together on forest restoration.</p><p>\"The Federal Forest Restoration Program is a model for inter-agency cooperation. When state and federal agencies, communities, and forest contractors work together, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts\", said Kyle Sullivan, ODF Acting Federal Forest Restoration Program Lead.

That's 4minutes faster than the estimated duration for human hikers - and with no falls or missteps. <br/><br/> This is made possible by a new control technology, which researchers at ETH Zurich led by robotics professor Marco Hutter recently presented in the journal Science Robotics[2]. <br/> Professor Hutter says: 'The robot has learned to combine visual perception of its environment with proprioception - its sense of touch - based on direct leg contact. This allows it to tackle rough terrain faster, more efficiently and, above all, more robustly.' <br/> In the future, ANYmal can be used anywhere that is too dangerous for humans or too impassable for other robots. <br/> Perceiving the environment accurately <br/> To navigate difficult terrain, humans and animals quite automatically combine the visual perception of their environment with the proprioception of their legs and hands. <br/> This allows them to easily handle slippery or soft ground and move around with confidence, even when visibility is low. Until now, legged robots have been able to do this only to a limited extent. <br/> Takahiro Miki, a doctoral student in Hutter's group and lead author of the study, says: 'The reason is that the information about the immediate environment recorded by laser sensors and cameras is often incomplete and ambiguous.' <br/> For example, tall grass, shallow puddles or snow appear as insurmountable obstacles or are partially invisible, even though the robot could actually traverse them. In addition, the robot's view can be obscured in the field by difficult lighting conditions, dust or fog. <br/> Miki says: 'That's why robots like ANYmal have to be able to decide for themselves when to trust the visual perception of their environment and move forward briskly, and when it is better to proceed cautiously and with small steps. <br/> 'And that's the big challenge.' <br/> A virtual training camp <br/> Thanks to a new controller based on a neural network, the legged robot ANYmal, which was developed by ETH Zurich researchers and commercialized by the ETH spin-\u200boff ANYboticscall_made, is now able to combine external and proprioceptive perception for the first time. <br/> Before the robot could put its capabilities to the test in the real world, the scientists exposed the system to numerous obstacles and sources of error in a virtual training camp. <br/> This let the network learn the ideal way for the robot to overcome obstacles, as well as when it can rely on environmental data - and when it would do better to ignore that data. <br/> Hutter says: 'With this training, the robot is able to master the most difficult natural terrain without having seen it before.' <br/> This works even if the sensor data on the immediate environment is ambiguous or vague. ANYmal then plays it safe and relies on its proprioception. According to Hutter, this allows the robot to combine the best of both worlds: the speed and efficiency of external sensing and the safety of proprioceptive sensing. <br/> Use under extreme conditions <br/> Whether after an earthquake, after a nuclear disaster, or during a forest fire, robots like ANYmal can be used primarily wherever it is too dangerous for humans and where other robots cannot cope with the difficult terrain. <br/> In September of last year, ANYmal was able to demonstrate just how well the new control technology works at the Darpa Subterranean Challenge[3], the world's best-\u200bknown robotics competition. <br/> The ETH Zurich robot automatically and quickly overcame numerous obstacles and difficult terrain while autonomously exploring an underground system of narrow tunnels, caves, and urban infrastructure. <br/> This was a major part of why the ETH Zurich researchers, as part of the Cerberus team, took first place with a prize of $2 million. <br/> Main image: The legged robot ANYmal on the rocky path to the summit of Mount Etzel, which stands 1,098 metres above sea level.

Some of them did it because they just needed clothes for Easter and they didn't have money to get it.</p><p><br/>Reporter: Paul, you participated in the riots. Can you tell us why they-why you-had a part in them?<br/>Paul: I had a part in it because where I live at is five stories high. And I can see my cleaners. And I saw them burning down my cleaners. So I say, Why shouldn't I get something? And everybody burn down my clothes, take my clothes out, and do what they want to do? So I'm gonna go in the store and get what I want.<br/>Reporter: You got any feeling about it at all, David?<br/>David: No, I don't.<br/>Reporter: Why not?<br/>David: It's kind of fun to me, see, burning up property and stuff like that.<br/>Reporter: You thought that was just fun?<br/>David: Yes I did.<br/>Vann R. Newkirk II: A riot is a collective. When people start to act together, the crowd can seem to have a mind of its own. It can move like an organic entity, with a will and a drive. By the time it reaches a critical mass, people, individuals, can be swallowed up into it.<br/>But every person who decides to go out has a reason. Frustrations, rage, passions, setbacks, or even boredom all can play a role. Years of history and upbringing and feeling all come into play in the decision to throw just one brick. And you have to consider all that to understand any riot, uprising, or rebellion. Vanessa Dixon was just 12 years old when King was killed. She was Vanessa Lawson back then.<br/>Newkirk: Did you ever watch any of the news when they were reporting on the looting and the rioting?<br/>Vanessa Dixon: Yes, it was unbelievable. It was unbelievable to me, for one, for myself and my friends, that we participated at the beginning of what turned out to be so, so bad.<br/>Newkirk: How do you feel about that?<br/>Dixon: I can say I'm sorry for the things I did. I didn't know better. But then the flip side of me says, I'm glad for the experience.<br/>Newkirk: I went to see Vanessa in her house to understand. Vanessa Dixon lives just outside D.C. She's something of a family historian.<br/>Dixon: I've got a bunch of projects in here. I did try to clean it up as much as I could.<br/>Newkirk: She keeps old newspapers, comic strips, obituaries, family trees. And she's got a ton of photographs.<br/>Dixon:  right here is the one with the black-and-white pictures in it.<br/>Newkirk: Oh, wow.<br/>Newkirk: The photos are all black-and-white. But they all remind me of my own childhood. She's got one where her three older brothers are all very little, standing in front of a brick wall, smiling. She wasn't born yet, I guess. The youngest of the boys, Vincent, is a toddler in overalls.<br/>Dixon: This is Vincent.<br/>Newkirk: Vincent?<br/>Dixon: Mm-hmm.<br/>Newkirk: What's he wearing here?<br/>Newkirk: Underneath the picture, somebody scribbled, \"Boys in the Hood.\"<br/>Dixon: Do you remember the little photobooth they used to have? This was at Union Station.<br/>Newkirk: Oh, wow.<br/>Newkirk: The picture she treasures most is one of just Vincent, the littlest of her older brothers-the closest one to her age. They were the two youngest kids. They even got matching medallions with their initials on them: V.L. They were peas in a pod.<br/>Dixon: He was my best friend in the world. I had little girlfriends and stuff like that I called my best friend, but he was really my best friend because we, we was like the dynamic duo.<br/>Newkirk: Maybe it's hard to imagine the little boy from the picture going out the night of a riot, but Vanessa says that Vincent did love excitement. He got in a little trouble sometimes, and Vanessa did too. But he was smart. He did well in class and he had a way with people. He was supposed to make it out. They were supposed to make it out together.<br/>Dixon: We always thought we could feel each other's heartbeat when we weren't around.<br/>Newkirk: In the picture Vanessa showed me, Vincent is a teenager, maybe 14 or so. To me, he mostly still looks like a little boy, but you can see where he's starting to grow up. He's still got a baby face and these wide eyes. But he's clearly trying to look older, you know? He's got on one of those '60s-style, spread-collar white shirts and a jacket. Think  like, Teddy Pendergrass style. And his lineup is immaculate.<br/>Dixon: That was his signature haircut. You never catch him, he wasn't into the bush.<br/>Newkirk: So, no afro.<br/>Dixon: He wanted it shaped up. He was always brushing it. Always brushing. He used to talk about his mustache-when he got his mustache, how it was going to look, how his beard was going to look, how he's going to keep it so shaped up. But he never got to have any hair on his face.<br/>***<br/>Newkirk: After King was assassinated, Vincent hit the streets, just like his sister. I wonder why he went out. Vanessa says part of it was that he was a bit of a thrill seeker, a daredevil. But there was also something there from how he grew up, and what he didn't have growing up.<br/>When they were kids, Vanessa and Vincent's family bounced around the working-class neighborhoods in the heart of old Black D.C., around the H Street Corridor. The house Vanessa seems to remember best was right off 8th and H [Street] NE, right down the way from where the old Apollo Theater used to be. Their parents didn't make a lot. Sometimes, instead of going to Shoe Town for new shoes, their dad would take them to Safeway, the grocery store.<br/>Dixon: And there was a big, old, big, old basket. Huge. And the shoes weren't in boxes. They were just tied together by the shoestrings. [Laughs.] And we, you know, while they did the shopping, our job was, You want some shoes? Dig through them, find your size and find what you want. Typically, that's what most of the people around there did for their kids.<br/>Newkirk: But, even as little kids, Vincent and Vanessa stayed with some money. The dynamic duo was always scheming on how to do odd jobs and hustle to make more for themselves. They were everywhere around H Street. They did yard work.<br/>Dixon: We would knock on people's doors and ask them, you know, \"Do you want me to rake your leaves?\"<br/>Newkirk: They sold popcorn bags and odds and ends on the street. Their dad got them a broke-down Radio Flyer wagon from Goodwill, and they fixed it up and used it to take people's groceries home-for a fee, of course.<br/>Dixon: We couldn't get them all in the wagon. So I literally had to carry a bag and my brother and I took turns. He would pull and I would carry, and he would carry and I would pull.<br/>Newkirk: Vanessa and Vincent kept the money they made in shoeboxes, and needed bigger and bigger sized boxes when they came up with more hustles. One time, they turned their backyard into a petting zoo.<br/>But things changed for the family when their parents got divorced. Vanessa and her siblings had to move with their mother away from H Street to the housing projects out on East Capitol, right by the Maryland border.<br/>Dixon: I remember riding in a car up East Capitol Street, and when we got to where it was, my brother said, \"All these houses look alike.\" I had never even seen a project before. He hadn't either.<br/>Newkirk: The projects were different. It was like they were designed to remind people that they were poor. Mom had to take up a job keeping house for white folks across town. Vanessa hated that. They all still went to the Morton's department store back on H Street to shop for essentials. But now those trips were heartbreaking for Vanessa and Vincent.<br/>Dixon: She would get this cardboard box and she'd open it up. And then they had about six pairs of stockings in it, and she would take a couple of pair out. And one time I remember my brother asking her, \"Mom, why do you keep coming up here and getting two pair of stockings?\" Okay, and she said, \"Well, that's all I can afford for right now.\" And we used to try to give her some of our money. We even tried to go in Morton's to try to buy stuff. They wouldn't let us in the store without a parent.<br/>Newkirk: Looking at Vincent in that picture, with his spread collar and sharp haircut, he looks like was moving from boyhood to adulthood. He was trying to be somebody. He was blazing a new trail, finishing up his first year of high school. He went to school back over by his grandmother's house, still out by H Street, which meant that he and Vanessa had to be apart more than ever. He wanted to make his folks happy. He wanted to make his mom happy. And then came the assassination.<br/>Dixon: We see people blowing horns and sitting on the car doors and yelling and screaming and smoke bombs. It was crazy. It was hype for me, and I don't think any of us had any fear. That's why I know my brother felt the same way.<br/>Newkirk: Vanessa and Vincent were just two of the thousands of Black people who hit the streets in D.C. after King was killed. Each one of those thousands is more than just a footnote to history. On the whole, they all tell a story that goes beyond the binary of the triumph of the civil-rights movement and the tragedy of losing one man. They help explain why, after a decade of supposed progress in America, its capital city, and one of its blackest cities, burned.<br/>Newkirk: Part 2: \"Inferno.\"<br/>Newkirk: Which route would you have taken, did you take?<br/>Tony Gittens: We would have taken right down this street. This is Columbia Road. And we would have come from down where Howard is and walked up. We didn't take any bus, there was no metro, and so we just walked.<br/>Newkirk: Today, Tony Gittens is an institution in D.C. He founded the Washington, D.C., International Film Festival and has run it for over 35 years. He was on the local Commission on the Arts and Humanities, and he's known just about every mayor to come through the city. He used to work with Marion Barry. He knows these streets like the back of his hand. But back in 1968, April 4, he was still a kid from Brooklyn who had only been in D.C. for a few years. He was attending Howard University.<br/>Gittens: I didn't know anything about Washington when I came here. I had no idea. I knew I was going to Howard. That's all I knew. Got on the bus from Brooklyn, came. That's all I knew.<br/>Newkirk: While Vanessa and Vincent Lawson were settling into the East Capitol projects, Tony got involved with The Hilltop, the Howard University newspaper. And he started volunteering with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, SNCC-one of the major civil-rights protest organizations. It was famous on campus. Some of SNCC's earliest and most well-known members had gone to Howard, including Kwame Ture, then known as Stokely Carmichael. Back In '66, they took Tony on his first trip down South, to Alabama.<br/>Gittens: And so I got to meet Stokely and Bob Manns and these other folks who had been in the movement in the South. Then they moved up to D.C. and we became friends, you know, became friends.<br/>Newkirk: In 1966, Stokely was the chairman of SNCC. He was one of the most famous-or infamous-Black men in America. The same summer Tony went down to Alabama, Stokely started talking about Black Power. It was new. It was radical.<br/>Stokely Carmichael: Every courthouse in Mississippi ought to be burned down tomorrow to get rid of the dirt in here. Now, from now on, when they ask you what you want, you know what to tell them. What do you want?<br/>Crowd: Black Power!<br/>Stokely Carmichael: What do you want?<br/>Crowd: Black Power!<br/>Stokely Carmichael: Everybody, what do you want?<br/>Newkirk : What was Stokely like?<br/>Gittens: Stokely. Stokely was a little  um  I was always a little scared of Stokely, until later on, when I got to know him slightly, a bit-slightly a bit.<br/>He was a smart guy. He knew every goddamn thing. Bob Manns used to say, \"Stokely Carmichael, you know every goddamn thing.\" And he was a smart guy.<br/>Newkirk: Tony turned all that organizing experience with SNCC into momentum on campus. In March, he and other students staged demonstrations, calling for change inside and outside the walls of campus. They even occupied the university's administration building. And in response, Howard agreed to create a new student disciplinary system and consider making a more pro-Black curriculum.<br/>Gittens: You know, we got, we walked into a room and they would almost say, \"What do you want?\" [Laughs.] They didn't want us going back in that building. I tell you that.<br/>Newkirk: SNCC was a major inspiration for Tony and the student protesters. They also were becoming a force in D.C. politics. Stokely had moved up to the city to try and build a power base for his organizing. Other SNCC veterans also moved up from projects in the Deep South. One of them was Frank Smith.<br/>Newkirk: So you were in Mississippi for years?<br/>Frank Smith: Six years.<br/>Newkirk: What brought you to D.C.?<br/>Frank Smith: Well, I met a woman who was in the civil-rights movement, too-a Howard University student. I dropped out of Morehouse. She dropped out of Howard. And we got married in '65, and one of the things that we promised was we were both going to finish. She wanted to go to medical school. And so we eventually came here.<br/>Newkirk: Frank is from Georgia, and he started his activism as a student at Morehouse College. He was involved in boycotts and other protests pretty early on. He says it's something that was sparked in him by the killing of Emmett Till in 1955.<br/>Frank Smith: I think I was in the eighth or ninth grade in Newnan, Georgia, when a young girl named Jessie Smith brought the Jet magazine to school with Emmett Till's picture in there, that awful assassination and brutalization of him and mutilation of his body. And I think in my heart, I must have thought, That could have been me. And, This has to stop. And I hear that from a lot of people of my generation. It was personal, really, in a sense.<br/>Newkirk: Frank was a founding member of SNCC when the group was formed at <url normalizedValue=\"https://snccdigital.org/events/founding-of-sncc/\">Shaw University</url> in 1960. When the group decided to shift gears from the sit-ins and Freedom Rides to its voter-registration project, he was the first person they sent into the teeth of Jim Crow, the MississippiDelta.<br/>Frank Smith: So people ask me, \"Why did you feel  Were you scared when you  ?\" Well, hell, being scared was a rite of passage for Black boys in my generation. You were scared all the time. So what's the difference between being scared in Mississippi and being scared in Georgia? You've got the same fear that some white person thinks they're entitled, and with the law behind them and with all the tradition, could just do whatever the hell they want to you and your family and your property and your friends. Who wants to live like that?<br/>Newkirk: He got there just seven years after Emmett Till was killed. In Mississippi, people were still being fired, beaten, disappeared, or worse for even joining the NAACP, let alone registering to vote. Just a few years earlier, a Black man named Mack Charles Parker was murdered and his body thrown from a bridge over the Pearl River. SNCC didn't have infrastructure or protection. But Frank got to work getting sharecroppers to register. One of the people who was brave enough to do it was Fannie Lou Hamer. She ended up becoming a household name in Black America.<br/>Frank Smith: She was already made by the time we met her. We found her in the Delta. She was ready for her freedom.<br/>Newkirk: Frank had been to D.C. during the height of Freedom Summer in 1964, trying to spread the news nationally about the folks like Fannie Lou Hamer who were trying to participate in democracy for the first time. But when he moved up to the city for real, to the Adams Morgan neighborhood, it was a big change from life in the MississippiDelta. Luckily for him, there were some familiar faces.<br/>Frank Smith: One advantage of living in Adams Morgan was that it looked like what SNCC had started to look like then. And I wasn't the only one there. There was probably 20 people from SNCC who were living in the neighborhood, too, in between there and 14th Street. So we had enough people for our own little tribe, if we wanted to have a tribe. <br/>Newkirk: Frank started organizing immediately. He helped tenants out in disputes with landlords. He was all over the Black neighborhoods in D.C. He actually felt at home there. Lots of Black families had just recently arrived from the South. There were middle-class, working-class, and upper-class communities; Black universities like Howard; people who followed King; Black Power activists; and members of the Nation of Islam. There were people who just wanted to keep their heads down. Living in D.C., Frank saw potential for bringing everybody together. On April 3, Frank Smith was still working towards that goal when he ran into Martin Luther King.<br/>Frank Smith: The day before he was killed, I flew into the airport in Memphis. He was coming from Atlanta. And I think it was Andy Young that pointed me out, saying, \"There's one of those SNCC'ers over there.\" And so King came over and asked me  said he wanted me to come to Memphis to help organize the young people-he said the young Panthers.<br/>Newkirk: King and his folks called all the Black radicals Panthers. But he was really talking about a local Memphis group, called the Invaders.<br/>Frank Smith: They were obviously interested because they were coming to the demonstration and stuff. They just wouldn't join the march. They were marching on the sides. They were throwing rocks and stuff. And he was scared that they were going to incite the cops to riot. And he wanted to see somebody come and help organize those young people. And I was probably 25 years old then, and so I wasn't so young anymore, and also I told him I'd hung up my marching shoes. And he said, \"Don't ever hang up your marching shoes.\" That was his last words to me.<br/>***<br/>Newkirk: In D.C., Tony Gittens and his friends were riding high. They were celebrating their successful protests against the Howard University administration. On the night of April 4, he and the boys were just hanging out.<br/>Gittens: I was in Drew Hall, which is a dormitory, and in the social lobby there, and we're just hanging around, talking, you know, some people probably playing cards and stuff. I don't know.<br/>Newkirk: And then <br/>Walter Cronkite: Good evening. Dr. Martin Luther King, the apostle of nonviolence in the civil-rights movement, has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee. Police have issued an all points bulletin  <br/>Gittens: Everybody stopped. Everybody stopped. You know, everybody stopped and said, \"What?\"<br/>Newkirk: Across the city, Black Washingtonians of all ages came out as more and more people heard the news. Rage came spontaneously, like hot tears or a lump in the throat.<br/>Gittens: And they were talking about-there was this riot in the streets of D.C. So we had to be there.<br/>Newkirk: Tony and his friends walked out from campus. They figured that if anything was happening, it was gonna be down on 14th and U. It was one of the busiest and most famous street corners in Black America. The corner was where everything happened. There was a drugstore there, and nearby a florist, banks, theaters-lots of shops. They didn't have to walk far.<br/>Gittens: The closer we got to it, the more you could smell the smoke.<br/>Newkirk: Stokely Carmichael had actually been there, on that corner, when it all started. He'd been going from store to store, telling white business owners to shut down shop and go home. He was also telling Black folks to be careful. That they weren't prepared to go up against the guns and tear gas of the police and military. But then, somebody threw a trash can through the window of the Peoples Drug Store.<br/>Gittens: So we got to 14th and Columbia Road. And I remember this sharply, that there was all this fire. I mean, the place was  it was like a forest fire. You know, it was like this red fire. It was coming out of these buildings, these stores.<br/>Newkirk: They made it a few blocks north of the epicenter. They were surrounded on all sides by fire.<br/>Gittens: There were these young guys who were breaking into the stores and taking out the stuff, whatever was in that window there. A lot of people were just watching by, shouting at the police. Cars were going down, honking their horns, and there were these people just walking the streets, shouting, pissed off-just very, very angry people.<br/>Newkirk: Walking on Columbia Road with Tony today, you can envision looking down the hill and seeing the smoke, hearing the chants of \"Black Power!\", seeing the police  powerless.<br/>Gittens: The police had no control. I mean, they had no control. They tried to talk to people. They weren't pulling any arms or anything. But nobody was paying any attention to them. It was just chaos. It was like a war zone.<br/>Newkirk: Some people went home. Down on U Street, things got out of hand, and Stokely got in a car and drove off. But lots of people, like Tony, just stayed out there, in a daze.<br/>Gittens: You know, we felt like we were a part of it, quite frankly. We weren't breaking into any buildings or setting any fires; we made no attempt to stop it; we understood it, thought maybe it was time for it to happen. We just felt, you know, Hey, America brought this on itself and this is what they had to pay.<br/>We walked the street. I was up all night. I remember being up all night and just walking the street. Nobody wanted to mess with the police. We just stayed away from the police, just watching what was going on.<br/>Newkirk: Why did you feel like you had to be out there to see it?<br/>Gittens: It wasn't even a question. Um  it would have been cowardly for me not to be there, that these were my people, in a way. These were the people who were fighting the fight. I didn't even think about not going. [Laughs.] I had to be there. If the police were going to come and take us all to jail, I had to be one of the ones that was going to go down there.<br/>Newkirk: Tony says he never participated in the riots. He wasn't even really a King guy, philosophically. But he was angry at white people.<br/>Gittens: This had built up over months, over years of frustration, not getting any response from the government. No change. No change. And this was like the last straw. He was holding it back.<br/>Newkirk: He was holding it back?<br/>Gittens: Holding it back. He would've said, Don't do this rioting. He would have said, you know, Be cool. Go home. Demonstrate. March. You know. But don't go in here and tear up this place like this. He would have said that. He was holding it back. And they took him away. Dams burst. Dams burst. I mean, that was my feeling. He was the good guy, and you killed him.<br/>Newkirk: Within just a few hours, disturbances were reported in many of the country's largest Black communities. There was unrest in Harlem, Brooklyn, Detroit, Cincinnati, Trenton. There were even reports coming from outside of cities. Frank Smith saw what rebellion looked like in rural Mississippi.<br/>Frank Smith: So I was actually in Mississippi the day he was killed. I was in Greenwood. And I can tell you, the demonstrations broke out everywhere.<br/>Newkirk: They broke out in Mississippi?<br/>Frank Smith: Everywhere brother. People burned cotton gins and stuff, man. Everybody did some kind of protesting, man.<br/>Newkirk: Frank watched the chaos unfold around him. He also paid attention to the news from the rest of the country. He knew D.C. was on fire.

An anti-pollution mask is designed to protect the wearer from pollutants in the ambient air.</p><p>Companies Mentioned</p><p>-Respro Ltd</p><p>-Ohlone Press LLC</p><p>-RESPILON Ltd.</p><p>-idMASK Co., Ltd</p><p>-3M</p><p>-Reckitt Benckiser</p><p>-Canada Prosper Apparel Ltd.</p><p>-Totobobo Pte.

An N95 mask is a NIOSH-approved respirator that gives 95 percent protection from the air pollutants that are found outdoors. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also permits it as a surgical mask. Due to this reason, there is a rising demand for similar protective masks by the people who are alert regarding the risks associated with ignorance of pollution. For instance, in addition to the above, Prana Air, an Indian company has installed a rechargeable-battery-run micro-ventilator that removes the unpleasant build-up of carbon dioxide at different fan modes.</p><p>Asia Pacific leads the Market</p><p>The Asia Pacific region is drastically affected by pollution due to the large population and the boom is continuous. As this population is developing and urbanizing, the pollution gradient is also peaking. According to Reckitt Benckiser's brand, Dettol, air pollution is the fourth-largest cause of death in the world. In India alone, one in nine people die as a direct result of air pollution and that's anticipated to 6.5 million premature deaths every year. China even installed the world's largest air purifier in its Northern region to moderate pollution levels. Recently, air pollution hit alarming levels in Southeast Asia, where smoke from wildfires in Indonesia affected thousands. Owing to the threatening issues, the manufacturers in the region are coming up with anti-pollution masks as an easy to adopt remedy against air pollution. Thus, the anti-pollution mask market is expected to grow in the future.</p><p>Report information:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/i12iz6\">www.researchandmarkets.com/r/i12iz6</url></p><p>((Comments on this story may be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newsdesk@closeupmedia.com\">newsdesk@closeupmedia.com</email>))</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WNCLPM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WNCLPM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T7-JG01-JCRR-015B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345215</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"429\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Close-Up Media, Inc.

An anti-pollution mask is designed to protect the wearer from pollutants in the ambient air.</p><p>Companies Mentioned</p><p>-Respro Ltd</p><p>-Ohlone Press LLC</p><p>-RESPILON Ltd.</p><p>-idMASK Co., Ltd</p><p>-3M</p><p>-Reckitt Benckiser</p><p>-Canada Prosper Apparel Ltd.</p><p>-Totobobo Pte. Ltd.</p><p>-Honeywell International Inc.</p><p>Key Market Trends</p><p>Efficiency in Air Purification with Easy Breathing is the Prime Consumer Demand</p><p>PM 2.5 particles from sources such as vehicle exhaust or from burning crops and forest fire, tobacco smoke and burning lamps cause coughing and shortness of breath. An N95 mask is a NIOSH-approved respirator that gives 95 percent protection from the air pollutants that are found outdoors. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also permits it as a surgical mask. Due to this reason, there is a rising demand for similar protective masks by the people who are alert regarding the risks associated with ignorance of pollution. For instance, in addition to the above, Prana Air, an Indian company has installed a rechargeable-battery-run micro-ventilator that removes the unpleasant build-up of carbon dioxide at different fan modes.</p><p>Asia Pacific leads the Market</p><p>The Asia Pacific region is drastically affected by pollution due to the large population and the boom is continuous. As this population is developing and urbanizing, the pollution gradient is also peaking. According to Reckitt Benckiser's brand, Dettol, air pollution is the fourth-largest cause of death in the world. In India alone, one in nine people die as a direct result of air pollution and that's anticipated to 6.5 million premature deaths every year. China even installed the world's largest air purifier in its Northern region to moderate pollution levels. Recently, air pollution hit alarming levels in Southeast Asia, where smoke from wildfires in Indonesia affected thousands. Owing to the threatening issues, the manufacturers in the region are coming up with anti-pollution masks as an easy to adopt remedy against air pollution. Thus, the anti-pollution mask market is expected to grow in the future.</p><p>Report information:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/i12iz6\">www.researchandmarkets.com/r/i12iz6</url></p><p>((Comments on this story may be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newsdesk@closeupmedia.com\">newsdesk@closeupmedia.com</email>))</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCCLPM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MCCLPM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T1-HTB1-F06S-P2FP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"429\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Close-Up Media, Inc.

But not many know about different survey tools or experience platforms.</p><p>Started as the world's first chat survey tool, back in 2017,SurveySparrow\u00a0received major attention for their conversational UI that gets 40% more responses and\u00a0has been constantly in the limelight, owing to their continuously expanding platform that has bagged many awards.</p><p>However, to the world outside the Experience industry, they still think surveys have not evolved and are still stuck in their boring age-old formats. To that end, SurveySparrow has launched an awareness video as a call out to all the misfits and\u00a0rebels with curious minds that ask the right questions.</p><p>A change in the set course or a break in the tradition is what inspires innovation. There's always a way to do the thing we do\u00a0better. And for that, we need to ask the right questions. Thisvideo\u00a0illustrates just that.\u00a0</p><p>The hero of the video is an adorably cute sparrow, whose questions leave our heads burning with questions. The Sparrow seeks the whats, the whys, and the hows\u00a0of the world; from the forest fire to melting ice and the\u00a0COVID pandemic, the Sparrow ensures the viewer misses nothing.</p><p>\"Why do surveys have to be boring?\u00a0This question led my initial team and me to build the world's first chat surveys. Asking the right questions can help you change the routine and\u00a0break traditions. But most importantly, it helps us do the things we do, the better way,\" said Shihab Muhammed, Founder &amp; CEO, SurveySparrow.</p><p>Interestingly, the Sparrow is not shown merely as a spectator, but it turns itself into the first-hand recipient of all the extreme situations portrayed in the video.\u00a0The video ends by urging the viewer, too, to ask the right question, rather than being a spectator.</p><p>SurveySparrow, as a part of the Experience industry, has often stated the motto is to refine experiences across touchpoints and customer/employee journeys. And what better way to refine experiences\u00a0than starting with asking the right questions.</p><p>After being in the spotlight for the launch of their inbuilt NPS platform and 360-degree assessments, SurveySparrow reported an explosive growth rate of 300%+ even amidst COVID. SurveySparrow was recently announced as the fastest-growing SaaS product 2021, in G2 Crowd, consecutively for the last two years.</p><p>About SurveySparrow<br/>SurveySparrow is a leading experience management platform on a mission to help brands refine experiences at every touchpoint.

Getting a handle on them required preparation, perspiration and all hands on deck.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To face off against a wave of fire starts sparked by a lightning storm over Southern Oregon, the Oregon Department of Forestry Southwest District broke the two counties into quadrants. Supervisors in each section strategized ways to utilize an extra 200 contracted personnel and six extra helicopters Thursday, while a fifth supervisor coordinated initial attack teams to tackle the newest fire starts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By the end of the week, a third of roughly four dozen new fires were extinguished, and containment lines were wrapped around the largest of the new fires \u2014 the Hog Creek Fire near Merlin and the Rum Creek Fire north of Galice, both holding at 30 acres.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It continued a pattern so far this fire season in Southern Oregon of firefighters being successful at keeping fires small.</p><p>But the success sometimes comes at a high cost.</p><p>A firefighter working the Rum Creek Fire, 25-year-old Logan Taylor of Talent, was killed Thursday by a falling tree. Another firefighter working a fire on Tallowbox Mountain south of Applegate needed to be pulled from the fire lines after suffering a heat-related illness.</p><p>Firefighter Collin Hagan, 27, of Michigan, was killed Aug. 10 by a falling tree on the Big Swamp Fire north of Crater Lake.</p><p>A week earlier, Aug. 3, a firefighter working the lightning-caused Wards Creek Fire east of Rogue River needed to be flown from the fire lines to the bottom of the road then taken to a nearby hospital after working in temperatures in the high 90s.</p><p>Lightning naturally tends to strike the tallest point, according to ODF Southwest Oregon District spokeswoman Natalie Weber, so lightning-caused wildfires often are in steep terrain where crews also face challenges such as falling rocks and trees.</p><p>\"In a lot of cases, there isn't very good access, so firefighters are driving to the closest point and then having to hike farther up the hill to actually get to the fire in order to start working on it,\" Weber said.</p><p>Since the fire season began June 1, crews have faced triple-digit temperatures and hundreds of lightning strikes, not to mention multiple close calls. Yet as of this week, no local fire has surpassed the low double digits in acreage.</p><p>With fire season almost three months old, local fire officials shared insights on their efforts and the tools used to keep fires small.</p><p>Story of another summer</p><p>On July 15, 2018, a lightning storm sparked at least 145 fires across Southern Oregon. Many of those fires were quickly extinguished, but not all.</p><p>Within a week, the Rogue Valley's air quality forced Oregon Shakespeare Festival to cancel outdoor performances and Britt to move its outdoor classical concerts to North Medford High School's auditorium.</p><p>Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest Fire &amp; Aviation Staff Officer Dan Quinones was the forest's acting forest duty officer the day the 2018 fires broke.</p><p>Quinones also helped allocate resources this fire season, which has a different track record: 44 fires that burned a combined 8.07 acres. He described this season's strategy in a Zoom interview earlier this month.</p><p>\"The strategy in '18 and the strategy today are really the same,\" Quinones said. \"In 2018, we ran out of stuff \u2014 not just locally but nationally.\"</p><p>The July 2018 fires were competing with other pressing wildfires, according to Quinones, and the Geographic Area Coordination Center in Portland had to prioritize resources for fires threatening people, property and infrastructure.</p><p>Fires in backcountry and wilderness areas lost out. Quinones said the resources they had were focused on protecting communities in Ashland, Butte Falls, Jacksonville and Cave Junction.</p><p>\"We just didn't have enough stuff to get to those fires in a timely fashion, even though we had jumpers on them, etc.,\" Quinones said.</p><p>In the biggest firefights, such as those threatening entire communities, watersheds or critical infrastructure, the GACC has the ability to reassign resources. It's a sword that cuts both ways.</p><p>\"We might lose some aircraft or ground resources without being asked \u2014 they'll just take them,\" Quinones said.</p><p>Quinones described a good relationship and rapport with the GACC Portland office as key to ensuring they understand the resources RRSNF needs to keep during fire season. Presently, he said, \"there are no issues.\"</p><p>\"They know our fuel type down here and that our fires, once they get established, are very resistant to control,\" Quinones said.</p><p>Bracing for lightning</p><p>When lightning is in the forecast \u2014 especially on dry fuels \u2014 Quinones will coordinate the strategic placement of hand crews, tree fallers, fire engines, water tenders, dozers and other equipment needed on the ground between stations in Prospect, Jacksonville, Powers, Cave Junction and Gold Beach, along with the J. Herbert Stone Nursery in Central Point.</p><p>\"We got some places to put stuff,\" Quinones said.</p><p>A forest duty officer at each of the districts oversees operations on the entire forest and will seek out input from staff officers such as Quinones.</p><p>\"From the bigger picture, I'll say, 'Hey, can we move this one asset from one location to another location? Because this is what we have going on,'\" Quinones said.</p><p>Quinones said he coordinates closely with partner agencies such as Oregon Department of Forestry in stationing and allocating resources.</p><p>\"We get all the tools in our toolbox that we need \u2014 not only for us but also for where we think we may need to support our partners as well,\" Quinones said. \"We stage them around the forest for quick response for the projected areas for the event.\"</p><p>New tools for looking ahead</p><p>Late last month, the Corey Fire broke out on the outskirts of Central Point and White City and started spreading to nearby properties, prompting the evacuation of approximately 25 residents nearby.</p><p>The fire started on a property containing large amounts of debris and abandoned vehicles, and it took out three mobile homes on the property, but the fire never grew beyond 5 acres, and 15 threatened structures were spared.</p><p>According to Fire District 3 Chief Robert Horton, the Corey Fire was one of six fires in his jurisdiction aided by two new camera-based technologies this fire season giving incident commanders the ability to see what they're up against.</p><p>Horton chairs the Governor's Fire Service Policy Council, which provides guidance to the governor and the Oregon State Fire Marshal's Office, and was recently named Vice President of the Western Fire Chiefs Association.</p><p>In prior years, incident commanders had to wait until the first firefighters arrived on scene and saw the fire with their own eyes before calling for the resources they need.</p><p>\"We have the technology today that allows for that visualization to occur at time of event, not time of first unit arrival,\" Horton said.</p><p>The Alert Wildfire Camera system utilizes cameras watching over roughly a dozen areas across the Rogue Valley, according to Horton.</p><p>The cameras are designed to complement those used in ODF's Detection Center, which looks out at rural areas in Jackson and Josephine counties.</p><p>\"They're looking for lightning strikes in the forest so they can get their resources out there fast,\" Horton said. \"Our cameras are more targeted toward the interface \u2014 where the forest is meeting the communities.\"</p><p>The camera Fire District 3 utilizes is on Long Mountain and covers parts of Eagle Point, White City and Sams Valley. Other cameras in the system include one on Mount Baldy that helps Fire District 5, providing a view of Phoenix, Talent and parts of Ashland. A third camera covers the Illinois Valley.</p><p>The public can view feeds from the cameras by visiting alertwildfire.org, but emergency response personnel have the power to pan, tilt and zoom if they need to zero in on an area, according to Horton.</p><p>Fire District 3 collaborated with Rogue Valley Council of Governments and Rogue Broadband to install the Long Mountain camera on the company's tower, according to Horton.</p><p>\"We really worked hard in that collaboration to have that camera and the Mount Baldy camera both operational by this fire season,\" Horton said.</p><p>Another technology rolled out in late June and early July is the new 911 Eye system, which allows a person calling in an emergency to send livestream video to the 911 dispatcher.</p><p>The 911 dispatcher can send the caller a link which can be shared with Fire District 3's incident command. If bandwidth is limited, the system can accommodate photos instead.</p><p>Since the Labor Day 2020 wildfires, Horton said there are more firefighting resources at the local level than there were.</p><p>Funds made available from the Oregon Legislature last year through Senate Bill 762 provided fire agencies added funding that Fire District 3 utilized to add a wildland response unit on shift every day.</p><p>\"Right on initial response we have more units to send out to calls,\" Horton said.</p><p>Other districts throughout the Rogue Valley used the fire funding to increase their staff, and SB 762 also covered added resources such as engines and air resources for ODF.</p><p>\"We've got more firefighting resources in our system \u2014 across the state but especially here \u2014 since the 2020 season,\" Horton said.</p><p>Although there's more resources, Horton remembers the challenge he faced during the Labor Day 2020 fires, when the massively destructive Almeda Fire and South Obenchain Fire broke out. With all local resources battling the fires, he called Salem for help, but all of the state's resources were allocated to seven conflagrations across Oregon.</p><p>\"On that day there wasn't units,\" Horton said. \"There's more capacity in the state of Oregon now, so we hope to not have that vulnerability, but I would be remiss if I didn't say there's more room for us to go.</p><p>\"We still could use more units across the state,\" Horton added.</p><p>Reach web editor Nick Morgan at 541-776-4471 or <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:nmorgan@rosebudmedia.com\">nmorgan@rosebudmedia.com</email> Follow him on Twitter @MTwebeditor.</p><p>___ (c)2022 the Mail Tribune (Medford, Ore.)

I'm Christian Amanpour in London.</p><p>It's a busy day in Washington where President Biden is hosting Britain's prime minister, Rishi Sunak. The president describes the U.K. as America's greatest ally despite a lingering post Brexit chill and no new trade deal, which is always top of Britain's agenda. Managing A.I. and the Ukraine war will also be front and center.</p><p>President Zelenskyy is pleading with the International Community now for a swift humanitarian response to catastrophic flooding after breaches in a dam near Kherson. Ukraine is bracing for a massive environmental catastrophe there too.</p><p>Meantime, the United States is in the midst of an environmental crisis, as heavy smoke continues to spread from wildfires that are raging in Canada.</p><p>With climate a huge global issue, in a minute I'll speak with Senator Chris Coons, a close confidant of the president who's also met with Prime Minister Sunak on this issue. But first, authorities have issued air quality alerts along the East Coast, affecting more than 75 million people. Correspondent Athena Jones reports on the apocalyptic scenes and the health risks facing the people.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ATHENA JONES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): From New York --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Very, very scary, just walking down the street and feeling like I'm going to have an asthma attack.</p><p>JONES (voice-over): -- to Lansing, Michigan --</p><p>BRYAN SMYTH, LANSING, MICHIGAN RESIDENT: I've noticed a little bit of a difference, you know, with being able to breathe right, coughing more.</p><p>JONES (voice-over): -- to Washington, D.C. and even as far south as Raleigh, North Carolina unhealthy air blanketing a large swath of the United States --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, look. That's fire.</p><p>JONES (voice-over): -- from over 400 active wildfires burning in Canada as of Wednesday afternoon. More than half of them determined to be out of control, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center.</p><p>JUSTIN TRUDEAU, CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER: Last year and this year, the worst wildfire season we've ever had, right across the country.</p><p>JONES (voice-over): Canada's wildfire season got off to an intense start in May, and it's unusual to see so much destruction this early. It picked up aggressively this month largely in Quebec. More than 9 million acres have burned in Canada so far this year, 15 times the normal amount.</p><p>Smoke from those fires traveling hundreds of miles affecting cities all across New York State.</p><p>GOV. KATHY HOCHUL (D-NY): This is the worst air quality we've experienced in over 20 years. This is hard to breathe right now.</p><p>JONES (voice-over): Governor Kathy Hochul said New York State is making 1 million N95 masks available to the public due to ongoing poor air quality that could be harmful for everyone or even hazardous for some</p><p>ZACHARY ISCOL, NEW YORK CITY EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER: I know that times like this can be scary, it can be shocking for many New Yorkers when you step outside, when you smell and breathe this air.</p><p>JONES (voice-over): New Yorkers being urged to stay indoors as much as possible, because particles and wildfire smoke can infiltrate the lungs and enter the bloodstream. Too much smoke inhalation has been linked to conditions like asthma and heart disease.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But the best protection is to avoid being outside until the air clears.</p><p>JONES (voice-over): Officials warning the smoke will continue to impact much of the East Coast until at least the weekend.</p><p>MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D-NY), NEW YORK CITY: I want to be clear, while there may be potential for significantly improved conditions by Friday morning, smoke predictability that far out is low.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: Athena Jones reporting there in a rare example of bipartisan policy along with Republican Kevin Cramer.</p><p>Senator Chris Coons recently introduced a bill that will lay the groundwork for America's first carbon border tax. And he's joining me now from Washington.</p><p>Senator, Welcome to the program</p><p>[13:05:00]</p><p>SEN. CHRIS COON (D-DE): Great to be on with you again, Christiane.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes. Can I just ask you, because now we know that the -- you know, the air is moving down south towards you, towards Washington, and all sorts of EPA alerts are at their highest, can you describe? I mean, what it is it like where you are? Is it difficult to breathe?</p><p>COONS: Well, I went for a walk here outside this morning in Washington, you can smell the smoke in the air, it is hazy. In my home state of Delaware, it's even worse and -- where my youngest, Margaret, is a recent college graduate in New York City, it's a complete blanket of haze. My family was sending images back and forth between the five of us in the last day or two.</p><p>This is a real public health challenge and a reminder that climate change has dramatic consequences. The vast wildfires out of control in Canada are impacting the entire East Coast of the United States. And for folks who are particularly vulnerable, who have asthma or other breathing difficulties, this is a critical issue.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, do you think something like this, the actual clear and present public health danger that you talk about, and the people are talking about, is actually something tangible that can bring on board climate skeptics, deniers, reluctance, whatever we want to call them?</p><p>COONS: I hope so. As you may know, Christiane, I co-founded the Climate Solutions Caucus here several years ago. It's a bipartisan group of 14 senators, seven Republicans, seven Democrats, where, as a group, we agree that the climate is changing because of human activity, and we have to come together to do something about it.</p><p>The bill you referenced that Senator Cramer and I just introduced has a bipartisan group of co-sponsors, and it would direct the Department of Energy, the U.S. federal government, to begin a mission standard testing so that we've got data on the emissions intensity of U.S. manufactured heavy industry products like steel and aluminum, glass and concrete, and to gather that data from our partners and allies, like the U.K. and E.U. and Canada, and our competitors like Russia, China, India, that's laying the technical groundwork or foundation for our carbon border adjustment mechanism.</p><p>The E.U. is already well on its way to having such a mechanism in place that will impose tariffs on imported goods into the E.U., including potentially from the United States. And I've had several important conversations with national leaders, with climate advocates, with legislators from the E.U., U.K., Canada and other countries about how we could pull together and have a common carbon club of shared emissions reduction ambition.</p><p>We can use trade and potential tariffs as a way to bring into compliance our closest partners and allies and to impose costs on the heavy industrial products of countries like Russia and China that do not reduce emissions.</p><p>AMANPOUR: OK. Senator, so, I understand that you could probably get some good -- and you have done bipartisan support for this because it's outside the borders of the United States. But in the United States there's still so many who are reluctant, you know, on the other side of the aisle to talk about a carbon tax or any of these big mitigating possibilities.</p><p>COONS: That's right.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, how do you expect your own country, you know, fully on board?</p><p>COONS: So, first, we've just made the biggest move forward in terms of climate ambition, in not just American history but in world history when President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act, which has $369 billion of incentives to transition towards a cleaner energy economy here in the United States. That's an important first step, to show the world that we're serious.</p><p>But to your point, Christiane, I am not trying to impose a carbon tax. We are trying to measure the emissions reduction that have already happened in the United States because of our regulations, and then advantage cleaner or lower emissions, heavy industrial products. So, for example, American made steel and aluminum should not face any tariffs, whereas perhaps steel and aluminum coming from Russia or China that are intensive in their emissions would, and imports from the E.U. or Canada or the U.K. wouldn't because they have regulatory schemes because of their carbon taxes and because of their regulations that are comparably low emissions to ours.</p><p>I know it's a little complicated, but I think there is a way for us to harmonize our approaches to climate ambition across these open market democracies that also close partners and allies.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, let's talk about China, because it's clearly a very big player, and most of the China, you know, experts, including the Biden administration climate czar, John Kerry, basically state the obvious, that without China's cooperation none of this will come to pass.</p><p>[13:10:00]</p><p>COONS: Exactly.</p><p>AMANPOUR: There are distinctly frosty relations between the United States and China right now. I mean, worse than frosty.</p><p>COONS: That's right.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Do you see anything attempts in the -- attempts at a thaw that the U.S. is trying to project that could bear any fruit?</p><p>COONS: So, look, I am always an optimist about that possibility, but this is an approach that doesn't require warmer or closer relations between the United States and China. That's part of the beauty of an approach that says, if you want to access the American market, you have to prove that you have low emissions heavy industrial products. The thing that is most likely to bend the curve of emissions in China and India is market forces through trade.</p><p>So, again, Christiane, let's just imagine for a moment if the E.U., U.K., U.S., Canada, South Korea, Australia, all aligned around low emissions approaches to how we manufacture steel and aluminum, glass and cement, heavy industrial products and to access our markets, China and India would have to demonstrate, and Russia, that they are reducing their industrial emissions. That will drive them to change their emissions profiles, to slow down the rate at which they're currently building a record number of coal fired power plants. That's the thing that is going to drive global reductions in emissions more than any agreement, because I frankly think our relations may continue to be strained or even as you put it, frosty for years to come.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well --</p><p>COONS: So, using --</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- maybe frosty was --</p><p>COONS: -- free market, using trade might well work.</p><p>AMANPOUR: OK.</p><p>COONS: And our agreements so far have not.</p><p>AMANPOUR: OK. But there's still trade problems between the United States and China. President Biden hasn't lifted some of the mechanisms and tariffs that President Trump imposed, and there seems to be a real sense that this China administration of President Xi is very different from the predecessors trying, you know, very hardline negotiating with the United States.</p><p>COONS: Correct.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Do you believe that the U.S. is having any success with its attempts to reach out or not, whether China will accept it, as we speak, there have been near misses both involving Chinese and American, you know, naval assets and air assets??</p><p>COONS: That's right. Christiane, we're in a very dangerous period in U.S. China relations. There have been, as you said, a number of very near misses on the seas and in the air, and we are trying to reopen the lines of dialogue simply to deal with the potential for escalation in the event there were a midair collision caused by reckless conduct by a Chinese pilot, for example.</p><p>Those Section 232 tariffs, the tariffs that were imposed by President Trump that are still in place on Chinese industrial products are also still in place on some imports from our close partners and allies. And Katherine Thai, the U.S. trade representative, is negotiating with the E.U., with the U.K., with other partners on potentially reducing or eliminating those tariffs and moving forward with something like an agreement on sustainable steel and aluminum.</p><p>This bill that I just introduced with my Republican partner, Senator Cramer, would advantage the manufacturing of U.S. based low emissions, heavy industrial products and potentially, if we work this out, reduced tariffs on things coming into this country from our partners and allies in U.K, Canada, E.U. but retain high tariffs on high emissions imports from countries like China or Russia.</p><p>That's actually similar to the trade approach of the former president, President Trump, but justified on different grounds and a way that reinforces our shared climate ambition and our alliances with the countries I've just been mentioning that are open markets and open societies.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, let's talk about one of the countries. So, Russia. What we've seen is continued shelling in the Kherson area as Ukrainians are trying to rescue people who are downstream of this, you know, leaking dam and the floodwaters are terrible. President Zelenskyy has appealed for real help. Let us just play what he -- what -- the appeal he made today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): The situation in the occupied part of the Kherson region is absolutely catastrophic. The occupiers have simply abandoned the people in these dreadful conditions without rescue, without water, they are left on the rooftops in flooded communities.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, he's basically saying that the occupiers, the Russians who have taken over since the war are not doing anything about the catastrophe there. Can I ask you what the United States believes to be the cause of this breach in this dam, first and foremost?</p><p>[13:15:00]</p><p>COONS: Well, Christiane, I can't speak on the behalf of the U.S. government about their assessment of the breach in the Kakhovka dam. I'll tell you my opinion that it seems more likely than not that this was a Russian action because of the consequences. It's going to slow or thwart a potential counteroffensive by Ukrainian troops that would be seeking to cross the Dnipro River to its south side and to advance, to retake Ukrainian territory that the Russians currently hold.</p><p>It's also going to have long-term consequences. It will increase hunger in Ukraine. This is some of the most fertile and productive land in all of Ukraine that's now flooded and won't be productive for several seasons. There's an environmental catastrophe at hand as well.</p><p>If we look at history in the Soviet era, hunger was used as a weapon in a horrible way, in the Holodomor in Ukraine in the 1930s. This brings back some terrible memories of action by the Soviet state that led to the suffering and the death of millions of Ukrainians. I'm very sad to say, it's my view that history is repeating itself, that the ongoing war crimes being committed by the Russians in Ukraine are most likely being repeated here in this breach of a dam that is both -- that is tragically going to lead to lots of environmental and humanitarian consequences.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I mean, it is horrible to hear you, you know, evoke that terrible, terrible time in history. So, what do you think about the Ukrainian's ability to capitalize with a counteroffensive? Local reports, press reports are saying the counteroffensive has started. What's riding on this?</p><p>COONS: Christiane, I am optimistic about the Ukrainian counteroffensive, in part, because of how much progress they made, how much territory they re- took in their previous counteroffensive last year. They have been provided with training, with equipment, with support, but they possess something that no outside ally or supporter could provide, which is the will to win, the will to fight, the will to retake their nation and restore their sovereignty and their control over the towns and people that the Russians have so brutally occupied and oppressed since their invasion, their expanded invasion of Eastern and Southern Ukraine began last year.</p><p>So, I am optimistic about it because they have the weapons, the support and the will to fight. If they are successful in this counteroffensive, I think they will continue to deserve the robust support of the American people, of our western partners and allies, of the 40 countries around the world who are supporting Ukraine in its fight for freedom and to restore its lost territory that's been occupied by Russia.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, Senator, you said if, if it's successful. What if it's not as successful as has been billed? What if it takes longer time than it's -- you know, they need more weapons, they need more time? We are hearing a very stiff Russian resistance. Does that mean the opposite will happen, the U.S. will stop supporting?</p><p>COONS: There will be stiff Russian resistance. And, Christiane, part of why I'm wearing the Ukrainian and the American flag today, and many of my colleagues, both Democrat and Republican, have been demonstrating, speaking out about their support for Ukraine on the Senate floor, in wearing flags, in their actions and votes, is because we know that Putin's core strategy here is to wait us out, as he did in the wars in Chechnya, as he had in the war in Syria. Putin's plan is to simply continue to bombard civilians, continue to grind away at Ukraine's strength and resistance, and to hope, to plan on the West, on the United States losing interest. We cannot allow that to happen.</p><p>Putin cannot be rewarded for his brutal invasion. He has already lost strategically because NATO is going to expand, he has already lost strategically because his standing in the world, the respect for Russia has fallen significantly. But we have to sustain our support for the brave Ukrainian troops who continue to fight and be willing to die for their country and to retain the sovereignty, to regain the control of territory that Russia's deprived them of.</p><p>What are the consequences if they're not successful? Well, in the long run, if we care about freedom, we have to continue to support Ukraine's fight against the Russian aggressor.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, as we all know, that's, you know, a leading mantra of the Biden administration and particularly, they draw their comparison to the Republicans, particularly Former President Trump. So, I just want to ask you a domestic question. More and more Republicans are throwing their hat in the ring, more and more, allegations and warnings of investigations are coming down towards Trump.</p><p>Mike Pence, his vice president, officially launched and he also held a town hall on CNN. This is the scathing assault he launched on his former boss. Just take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[13:20:00]</p><p>MIKE PENCE, FORMER U.S. VICE PRESIDENT AND U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Let me say what I said today was that anyone who puts themselves above the constitution should never be president in the first place. And anyone who asks anyone else to put them over the constitution should never be president again.</p><p>I had hope that President Trump would come around on our difference about that tragic day and about my role, and I still hope he does.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: In the unlikely event that he does come around to change his opinion, does -- do you think the Democratic Party, President Biden, prefers to face Trump or any of the other Republicans who are throwing their hat in the ring right now?</p><p>COONS: Look, that's going to be up to the American people and to the Republican Party, in their primaries. I would prefer to be standing by and supporting President Biden more than any of the Trump or Trump like candidates who are getting in on the other side because President Biden has a real and strong record of accomplishment.</p><p>Former President Trump promised that he'd fix infrastructure, he didn't. President Biden has. He promised that he'd reduce prescription drug prices, he didn't. President Biden has. Our president has signed into law big, bold, bipartisan bills that are making progress in addressing the issues the American people care about, from community mental health, to background checks on guns, to rebuilding our infrastructure, to standing up to China, to bringing advanced manufacturing back in the United States.</p><p>With that strong record of runoff, I'd face any of this field of a dozen Republicans. And that's why I'm strongly supporting my predecessor here in the Senate, my fellow Delawarean, Joe Biden, for reelection in 2024.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And we would expect nothing less from you, Senator Coons, a close confident and a Democrat. Very thank you very much, indeed, for joining us.</p><p>And we turn now to another issue that has plagued America, that is police brutality. My next guest has made ending that violence a key mission. Keith Ellison is Minnesota's attorney general, and he was responsible for prosecuting the police officers who killed George Floyd almost exactly three years ago.</p><p>In his new book, \"Break the Wheel: Ending the Cycle of Police Violence,\" Ellison takes us through his journey to justice, and he's joining me now from Minneapolis.</p><p>Welcome back to our program.</p><p>KEITH ELLISON: Thank you, Christiane. Always a pleasure.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I just want to take you back to, well, three years ago. We spoke in the month or several weeks after George Floyd was murdered, and I say murdered because a court convicted the police officer, and you supervised that prosecution and that trial. Take me back to what it was like as you sat there on the edge of your judicial seat hoping that justice would, in fact, prevail.</p><p>ELLISON, AUTHOR, \"BREAK THE WHEEL\" AND MINNESOTA ATTORNEY GENERAL: Well, when we got a call that a verdict had come back, I was surprised at that. I thought there was always a possibility of a hung jury because in so many other cases that were similar, that is what had happened.</p><p>And then, when the judge began to read the verdict, my pulse was racing. I could feel the palpitations in my chest and my heart beating, and the judge read guilty, guilty, guilty, and I felt relief. And then, I looked over at, you know, Derek Chauvin and I realized, his life is going to change. He did a horrible act, 12 people, his peers, found that he was guilty of it beyond a reasonable doubt. But I hope that it -- I thought it was a sad that somebody who signed up to protect and serve now had been found guilty of doing the opposite. And I hope that we would learn a social lesson and make the reforms we need to stop this from happening ever again.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, before I get into your recollections and your prescriptions in the book, I just want to point out, of course, what hopefully people know, that Chauvin was the first white Minnesota police officer to be convicted of murdering a black person on the job.</p><p>The stakes were enormously high and you have written about the difficulty of trying to seat the right jury, if I could put it that way. What were you looking for --</p><p>ELLISON: Right.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- and how did you manage to achieve? Because the other side would've wanted to extract some and, you know, put their own people in, et cetera.</p><p>ELLISON: Well, you know, we call it jury selection, but what it really is, is jury exclusion. We have a group of people brought in on a random basis, and both sides are allowed to make challenges to jurors who have a bias, and then there are some peremptory challenges where we're allowed to just remove people with no reason, as long as it's not a racially based reason, or for some reason that's a bias or impermissible.</p><p>[13:25:00]</p><p>And so, we were looking for an impartial jury. We knew that everybody, everywhere, had seen the video and heard all about the case. There had been massive protests around the world, protests in London and Attenborough and Cardiff, but also throughout the United States, as you know. It was an international event and we needed to find some people who, despite seeing that video, could still be fair and still be impartial. People who would not go based on anything except what they saw through the evidence chair. And that was not easy.</p><p>And we know that some people were going to come in bias in favor of the police, because all of us are raised, as we should be, to trust the police and believe in the police, but then others would be very angry against the police and maybe not want to be fair to them. We were looking for impartial jurors and, you know, we found 12. And I was glad that we were able to do so, but it was by no means obvious in the beginning that we were going to be able to do that.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Indeed. And when we spoke, it was obviously before all of this. I mean, again, it was just weeks after the killing.</p><p>ELLISON: Right.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And at the time, you were emotional, of course. It was a very, very emotional time for everybody. And you basically said then, you saw this murder, in fact, as a moment of opportunity for police reform. You said exactly, I think that --</p><p>ELLISON: Right.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- it's important for us to use this moment as a moment of real change. But three years later and one conviction later, there's still no major national legislation and only a very small percentage of police killings result in officers being charged with a crime. Has America missed this moment?</p><p>ELLISON: You know what, I think the moment is still going on and it's a little too early to say we missed the moment. And also, Christiane, we didn't get one conviction, we got four. We convicted all four officers in state court and federal. And since this tragic incident, I've had to prosecute other cases involving officer involved deaths. So, we've been doing our work beyond this case.</p><p>But I will tell you, you've got a point that we have not seen enough progress. The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act has not passed. But Minnesota passed a law on police officer standards and training licensing. Now, if you're a police officer who does certain bad acts, you don't have to be convicted of a crime to lose your license to practice policing. That is a change.</p><p>We also have barred a lot of the chokehold that used to be lawful and no- knock warrants, and we have made a number of other changes. We've gotten some new personnel. We change our police department from only police doing public safety to the entire or public safety division, which includes police fire, 911, also civilian violence interrupters and peer violence reducers.</p><p>So, we've done a lot of things, but you are right, there's still too many problems. I mean, look, you've got Tyre Nichols in Memphis. What a tragic incident that was. There are many others. We are not close to finishing this journey, but I'm not ready to say that we missed the moment. In fact, every moment presents an opportunity to do the right thing.</p><p>I mean, Martin Luther King famously said, the time is always right to do what is right, and that moment is going on right now. So, I'm so optimistic, Christiane.</p><p>AMANPOUR: We were. And clearly, you must have written this book. And describe for me how you managed to write a book and what, you know, tools that you used. I heard you were given all these notepads and all the rest of it. But you mentioned Tyre Nichols. So, the 29-year-old black man killed by police. But it was five police -- five black police officers who were charged with his murder.</p><p>ELLISON: Correct.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I don't know how you equate that, how do you see that in your head and can people then argue that based on that case, the diversifying of police department actually won't lead to reform or might not lead to reform? I mean, let's face it, the Minnesota Police Department had also already gone through reform, so to speak, before George Floyd's murder.</p><p>ELLISON: Sure. Well, let me say, you know, diversity in police departments is important. We need more female officers. We need more officers of color. But that alone will not change anything. Why? Because the prevailing culture that exist before any of those officers get there, those new officers of color and women officers have to fit into the culture or that culture will spit them out.</p><p>[13:30:00]</p><p>So, what you see is officers who just accommodated a culture that allowed for chronic use of excessive force. And so, we've got to do more than just have diversity, though we and should strive for diversity.</p><p>You know, Christiane, what we've got to start with is prosecute any crime, no matter whether the person has a badge or not, and we've got to use administrative tools to act quicker. Never forget, Derek Chauvin had 18 prior excessive force complaints.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Right.</p><p>ELLISON: That is a supervisory failure. We've got to be able -- we've got to say, when you're getting four or five of them, you know, drawing people in, engaging that officer, what's the problem? Why are you getting so many? Do you need some retraining? And, you know, that's the kind of thing we have to do.</p><p>We found that it's not just -- you can't just blame all this on Derek Chauvin. Yes, he is guilty and he's responsible for what he did, but he's part of a larger culture that allowed it to happen. And we've got to face that fact, and that's all over our country, that's not just Minneapolis.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And what about basic strategy, whether it's local or national? You were reelected in 2022 as attorney general. Very, very close race. You won by less than 1 percent.</p><p>ELLISON: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And your opponent made crime a top issue. And he accused you of leading the defund the police movement.</p><p>ELLISON: True.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Do you think, as others have suggested, that that slogan did, in fact, I guess it hit the wrong nerve amongst many people in the United States?</p><p>ELLISON: I think you are right, but I will tell you this. I know of nobody who's ever stood for office, no Democrat who stood for office who called for defunding the police. There was a great candidate in Wisconsin, my neighboring state, named Mandela Barnes, he's not even in law enforcement at all, and they accused him of that.</p><p>It was an unfortunate slogan used by some young activists, very upset about the murder of George Floyd. But then, people on the conservative end of the political scale grabbed that slogan and tried to use it as a political weapon and win some elections. So, it got exploited and it got distorted.</p><p>But what I will say, though, is we do need to re-fund community. We need to re-fund mental health. We need to fund things like strong educational after school programming. We need to fund things like housing, so we don't have so many people living on the street like that. And so, yes, we need to fund the police, but we need to find other things too. And I think that's what the main point of those activists were trying to make.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Right. OK. Well, just quickly, I want to ask you, because, you know, your book is about breaking the cycle of violence, and you did, of course --</p><p>ELLISON: Right.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- you know, do your due diligence and sit down for many, many interviews with polic and unions, et cetera.</p><p>ELLISON: Right.</p><p>AMANPOUR: What was their response to you, having prosecuted one of their own, and how do they think the cycle of violence can be broken?</p><p>ELLISON: Well, my experience with police is positive. Overwhelmingly, individual officers are like, thank you for doing this. We condemn what Derek Chauvin did too. We are proud of being police officers and we believe he tarnished the badge.</p><p>There are some people who think that merely prosecuting a police officer, no matter what they did, somehow undermines policing, but I'm trying to help them understand that high standards and excellent work is what will restore the dignity of the noble profession of policing, not impunity and looking the other way when people like Derek Chauvin do the wrong thing.</p><p>I think overwhelmingly, most officers want to see the reform come and they understand that, look, crimes happening and people do need police to help protect them from that. So, we need police to be respected, but it's going to have to be based on some reform. And then, I think we're going to be in a much, much better place. But thanks for that question, because it has been a point of controversy.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, what I want to quickly ask you, because it's important. You know, a black candidate, Senator Tim Scott, is running for president, for the Republican Party. But when he announced --</p><p>ELLISON: Right.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- on the -- you know, a few days before the anniversary of George Floyd's death, he said, in Biden's America, crime is on the rise, law enforcement is in retreat, the far-left is ending cash fail, demonizing, demoralizing, defunding the police. So, again, the same question I sort of asked you but it's now from a presidential candidate on the Republican side.</p><p>ELLISON: Right.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And there are places where some crime is rising, though apparently on the whole, violent crime is static since 2010. But what do you make of a presidential candidate saying that, a black presidential candidate?</p><p>[13:35:00]</p><p>ELLISON: Well, sure. Well, let me tell you, in Minneapolis, crime rates have declined. They're still too high. If you are a victim of a crime, then crime is high, right? But if you look at statistically, crime has gone down, particularly in some of the most adversely affected areas, we've seen some dramatic reductions.</p><p>But, what I think, though, Christiane, is that it's just typical exploiting and demagoguing crime in order to get votes. Making people afraid in order to get them to cling to you. I think it's unfortunate Tim Scott is doing that, because Tim Scott, after all, was one of the main folks we were counting on to help pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. He's the one who abandoned court Senator Cory Booker, he's the one who abandoned Representative Karen Scott, and that's -- and it's him as to why the bill never passed.</p><p>So, I think it's a sad, bad sign and will not bode well for the future if we want to bring this crisis to an end.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Attorney General Keith Ellison, author of \"Breaking the Wheel,\" thank you so much, indeed, for joining us.</p><p>And next, another look at how racial discrimination impacts American society, this time, in housing policy. Author Richard Rothstein believes that for generations unconstitutional laws have severely restricted the wealth and success of African Americans. In his latest book, \"Just Action,\" written with his daughter, Leah Rothstein, he explores how local communities can undo decades of neighborhood segregation. And they are joining Michel Martin to discuss their findings.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHEL MARTIN, CONTRIBUTOR: Thanks, Christiane. Richard Rothstein, Leah Rothstein, thank you both so much for joining us.</p><p>LEAH ROTHSTEIN, CO-AUTHOR, \"JUST ACTION\": Thank you for having us.</p><p>RICHARD ROTHSTEIN, CO-AUTHOR, \"JUST ACTION\": Thank you.</p><p>MARTIN: All right, Mr. Rothstein, I'm going to start with you. Your last book, \"The Color of Law,\" you argue that housing segregation is, number one, deeply important. And number two, that it's not accidental. You argue that this is really been a matter of law and custom in the United States for a very long time. As briefly as you can, would you describe why it's so important and why you say it's not accidental?</p><p>R. ROTHSTEIN: \"The Color of Law,\" my previous book, demolished the myth of the de facto segregation, something we all thought existed, the fact, as you said, that the fact that every metropolitan area is racially segregated happened either by accident or because of private discrimination or bigotry of single-family home owners who wouldn't sell to African Americans, people (INAUDIBLE) the same race.</p><p>It turns out that the reason we are segregated, we have an apartheid society. We are segregated by racially explicit federal state and local government policy. In the mid-20th century, somewhat before and somewhat after, that was unconstitutional, blatant constitutional violations.</p><p>When the Federal Housing Administration and Veterans Administration decided to suburbanize the entire white working class and middle-class population into single-family homes and all white suburbs, the white families who were subsidized to do this -- and these weren't rich people, these were returning war veterans -- the white families gained wealth because those homes appreciated in value over the next couple of generations.</p><p>They used that wealth to send their children to college, they used it to take care of temporary emergencies, maybe unemployment. They used it to subsidize their retirements and they used it to bequeath wealth to their children and grandchildren. But then had down payments for their own homes.</p><p>The result of the fact that African Americans were prohibited, by written federal policy, written federal policy, from participating in this subsidy program means that today, although African American incomes are about 60 percent of white incomes, African American wealth is only about 5 percent of white wealth.</p><p>This wealth gap underlies the most serious social problems in this country today, it underlies the concentration of African Americans lower income communities where the schools are less well resourced, it underlines the fact that they have poorer health because they're living in more polluted more dangerous communities, it even underlies the police violence that we've been spending so much time paying attention to in the last few years, because when you concentrate the most disadvantaged young men in single neighborhoods, it's inevitable that they are going to be contradictions with the police.</p><p>So, these unconstitutional policies underlie our apartheid system and they require us to remedy it.</p><p>MARTIN: So, Leah Rothstein, I want you to pick up the thread here. What -- how does \"Just Action\" continue that conversation?</p><p>L. ROTHSTEIN: A lot of people who read \"Color of Law,\" myself included, and wanted to see my dad lecture about it, you know, were moved and just sort of overwhelmed by the comprehensive history laid out in how intentional it was in this -- the creation of our segregated communities, and I asked him, after one of his lectures, you know, now that we are reawakened to this history, what do we do about it now? How can we begin to undo it and challenge these decades and decades of policies, the entrenched, you know, living patterns that we are so used to now?</p><p>[13:40:00]</p><p>And so, he challenged me to help him answer that question, by writing this book. And in this book, we help answer that question for people all over the country looking for ways to take action and begin to redress segregation. And we really focus on local efforts, what can be done in our local communities. We understand that federal policy change will be necessary eventually, but we do not have the political will on the federal level to make these changes nationwide. But we can build that will in our local communities, and there's actually a lot that's under local control that can go a long way towards undoing segregation, challenging it and remedying the harms that have come from it.</p><p>MARTIN: Housing segregation just seems so big. I mean, people live in their houses, in some cases, you know, for 30 years, 50 years. It just seems so big. So, Leah, let me just start by asking you this, when you thought about this, geez, how do I -- how do you tackle this? Did you find it daunting yourself?</p><p>L. ROTHSTEIN: You know, I did at the beginning. I have been a community organizer and activist, and I've worked in housing policies. So, I've worked on these issues a lot and I didn't know how to fix this problem when I started this project with my dad. I was overwhelmed by just the enormity of the issue, and it's right, you know, people live in the same place for a long time. The history my dad laid out shows us how, you know, the wealth gap between blacks and whites was created by housing policy. So, there's just so much to undo. It did feel overwhelming and rather daunting.</p><p>But in \"Just Action,\" we outlined dozens and dozens of policies and strategies that a local activist group could take on, to begin to redress segregation in their communities. And for every one of those policies, we give an example from a local community group somewhere in the country that's working on this issue or has successfully implemented this policy change.</p><p>So, I ended this project and writing this book feeling very hopeful, actually, that there's a lot that can be done. It's not one policy or one change that's going to fix all of this, but it's a lot of little pieces that will begin to undo different aspects of segregation, different segregation's effects, but all of these small pieces together have a huge impact.</p><p>MARTIN: Mr. Rothstein, I'm going to ask you the same question. As you were researching this book, did you feel a sense of hope that this could be addressed?</p><p>R. ROTHSTEIN: Very hopeful, very hopeful. Because as long as we thought it happened by accident, it was easy to think it could only happen by accident. Once we understood that it was created by explicit public policy, explicit public policies can fix it.</p><p>And as Leah said, there are so many local policies that sustain, reinforce and perpetuate segregation. It was created nationally, but its sustenance is local. If I can give you an example.</p><p>MARTIN: Yes, let's hear it. Yes. I'd love to hear an example.</p><p>R. ROTHSTEIN: Eventually, every metropolitan area in this country, African American homeowners pay property tax at a higher rate than white homeowners do. So, African Americans are paying taxes at an assessed value close to the market value, and white homeowners are paying taxes far below the assessed market value. This is a purely local issue. But every one of the black homeowners in those communities is owed refunds for their excessive taxation.</p><p>And activist groups could begin a campaign to win those refunds. They might not be totally successful, but they can make progress. And there are dozens and dozens of these kinds of programs and policies that exist in the local level that are accessible by local groups if they simply mobilize to take action to achieve them.</p><p>And the reason we wrote this book is because, well, 20 million Americans participate in the Black Lives Matter demonstrations, in the aftermath of George Floyd's murder. And most of them went home and they put signs on their lawns saying, black lives matter, and that was the end of it. But this is a base of support for a pretty large and significant civil rights movement of people who didn't know what to do next. We say anything that you do, any one of these policies is a beginning and starts somewhere.</p><p>MARTIN: Leah, I'm going to direct this question to you. You write in the book a lot about policies and practices that are on their face race neutral, but actually yield disparate results. Can you talk a little bit about that? I'm thinking maybe about credit scoring, for example.</p><p>L. ROTHSTEIN: Well, when we have an unequal society and you apply a race neutral policy across the board to everybody, it's going to have unequal effects. So, the example you brought up, credit scoring. So, a credit score system is a race neutral policy, it's not discriminatory in intent, but it is in effect and it is in effect because a credit score system is supposed to be an objective rating of your future likelihood of repaying a debt, and it bases that rating on your financial history, but it only uses a certain type of financial history to make that reading. And it's a type of financial history that whites are far more likely to have than African Americans.</p><p>[13:45:00]</p><p>So, if you've -- if you're applying for a mortgage and you're looking at your credit score, and you have had a mortgage in the past, that will factor into your credit score. But if you've never owned a home in the past and you've been a renter your whole life, which African Americans applying for a mortgage are more likely to have never owned a home before, and even if you've never missed a rent payment in your life, that financial history is not factored into your credit score.</p><p>So, as a result, African Americans are disadvantaged in the credit scoring system, which makes it harder for them to get a mortgage to buy their first home, and then harder for them to get a high enough credit score to get a good interest rate on that mortgage. So, the result that we see now is about a third of African Americans have no credit score at all, compared to about 17 percent of whites. And of those with credit scores, 20 percent of African Americans have a credit score high enough for a mortgage compared to over half of whites.</p><p>MARTIN: What would you say to people who would argue, well, that's just common sense, I mean, people need a credit score, lenders should have some way of knowing whether you're a good bet to lend money or not?</p><p>L. ROTHSTEIN: Well, we're not advocating getting rid of credit scores. I think you are right. We need a credit score so a lender knows who to lend money to. But those credit scores can take into account rental payment history, just as easily as they can take into account mortgage payment history. And that would go a long way to equalizing that system and not having a disparate impact on African Americans, and local bank branches and credit unions can start to do that.</p><p>Individually, even if the national credit scoring system isn't adjusted yet, they can start factoring in rental payment history in order to determine someone's credit worthiness, and that would go a long way to opening up access to credit for African Americans.</p><p>MARTIN: Richard, what are some of the solutions that you came across on the course of reporting this book that really stood out to you?</p><p>R. ROTHSTEIN: Well, we described so many solutions that it's really just a question of where you start. In our book, \"Just Action,\" we have a photograph, actually two photographs, of community groups in -- one in California and one in New York, that were picketing banks because it turned out that those banks were making mortgages to apartment developers, multi- unit apartments, and the mortgages penciled out only if those borrowers predicted a higher income stream than present rents would afford. In other words, the banks were being guaranteed that they would gentrify those buildings by evicting current tenants and charging higher rents.</p><p>Well, community pressure can make sure, as those two demonstrations that we photographed in the book, can make sure that those banks don't follow that policy, that they don't subsidize gentrification in that way, by issuing mortgages to borrowers whose finances would only qualify them for a mortgage if they evicted present tenants and took in higher paying ones.</p><p>MARTIN: So, Richard, I take Leah's point that, you know, a lot of these are local initiatives, but I am curious about your sense of whether there really is an appetite for these kinds of initiatives. Just given how it seems to kind of push these deep emotional buttons that people have about where they live, with whom they live, and how they live.</p><p>R. ROTHSTEIN: There's an enormous appetite for this if people would learn what they can do and if they organize themselves, form committees, form biracial committees, in particular, to begin to address these issues. And we have many examples in \"Just Action\" of people who've actually started to do this.</p><p>We can identify the banks, the realtors, the developers who created segregation under the aegis of the federal government, in people's particular communities, and those banks, those realtors, those developers should be the subject of actions and campaigns to get them to contribute to the redress of the segregation that they created.</p><p>So, I don't fear that there's no appetite for this. My previous book, as you mentioned, \"The Color of Law,\" you know, I don't mean to boast, but it sold a million copies. We also have a regular column that we're writing on Substack, and Leah, a few weeks ago, write a column -- wrote a column about a very elite suburban community that organized because they want to diversity, they wanted to include other people in their community. They organized and they defeated a referendum in that community that would've prohibited modifying single-family zoning.</p><p>So, if people organize, they can win successes. They won't win successes all the time, sometimes they'll be defeated. But small victories will lead to larger ones. And I'm confident that people take advantage with some of these ideas that we've thrown out will begin to see a cascading movement to redress segregation.</p><p>[13:50:00]</p><p>MARTIN: Why should people who have benefited from these systems want to change them?</p><p>L. ROTHSTEIN: Yes. Well, there's a couple of reasons. This group that I wrote about, they started by learning about the history of their own community and how it came to be segregated. So, they developed a workshop that they did around their region based on \"The Color of Law,\" and applying it specifically to their city and identified the policies that created segregation in that region.</p><p>And I think part of doing that, that kind of education, it opened up people's eyes to what they thought was just normal, what they thought they were entitled to in that community was actually intentionally created by prohibiting African Americans and others from living there. And once they reconciled with that history, they realize that that's not the kind of community that they wanted to live in. That they actually valued inclusion and they value diversity, and so they wanted to work towards that. So, that's the basis of that group.</p><p>And then, when they started working on this, defeating this ballot measure, they realized that, you know, the exclusivity of this community hurt them, hurt the people who live there as well. Their children couldn't afford to move back home. The ballot measure was in response to some affordable housing for teachers that was proposed in a town because 30 percent of teachers in this town left their positions every year because they couldn't afford to live anywhere near the schools that they taught in.</p><p>Their favorite cafes were closing because service employees couldn't find anywhere near there to live on a minimum wage salary. So, they saw how the exclusivity of their community and by keeping the home prices high, through maintaining single-family only zoning, was hurting them as well. And so, the values that they sort of developed and identified through learning about their history, along with the impacts that the affordable housing crisis and the exclusivity of their community were having on them personally helped them develop this really strong community group that defeated the ballot measure and are going on to work on housing policy in the future.</p><p>MARTIN: And, Richard, before we let you go, this work, again, really does focus on the experience, the historical experience, of African Americans in the United States and how that experience translates to today's -- to current, sort of, circumstances today, why is that focus on African Americans and why should people of different backgrounds, particularly Latino Americans, Latinx Americans, Asian Americans who perhaps arrived later on in this country care about this?</p><p>R. ROTHSTEIN: The reason they should care about this is because we are all Americans and our constitution was violated by the segregation of African Americans. The policies we described were focused on African Americans. It wasn't the large Hispanic migration at the time that these policies were enacted.</p><p>We have enormous economic inequality in this country today. There are many policies we need to follow that would benefit low income and moderate income, recent immigrants. That's a different issue. It's not a less important issue but it's a different issue from our obligation to remedy the unconstitutional segregation of African Americans.</p><p>The discrimination, the exclusion that black families have faced in this country was far more extreme, more violent, more oppressive than what was experienced by other groups, even though those other groups did experience discrimination as well. But they're not comparable, and different problems require different solutions.</p><p>What we say in our writing is that race specific crimes require race specific solutions. And, that's the reason that we're focusing this book on African Americans, it doesn't mean that there are other problems in the society that also need to be addressed.</p><p>MARTIN: Richard Rothstein, Leah Rothstein, thank you both so much for talking with us today.</p><p>L. ROTHSTEIN: Thank you for having us.</p><p>R. ROTHSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: And finally, we started the show with smoke blanketing the U.S. East Coast.

The plan was to first pick up the tower's framework, followed by the three pieces of the staircase, the platform, and finally, the roof, and drop the pieces off at the summit.</p><p>But a simple gust of wind drastically altered these plans.</p><p>As the Chinook was carrying up the second piece of the staircase up to the top, \"the pilot experienced a sudden down draft which caused the stairs to collide with the tower structure and unfortunately damaged the stair case to the point that it could not be attached correctly,\" Association Treasurer Paul Adams wrote on Facebook. Thus, work had to be called off for the day.</p><p>To add insult to injury, the poor weather on Sept. 30 prevented the helicopter from finishing its work, leaving the project in a lurch.</p><p>\"We're on hold, basically,\" Borst said, adding that his \"gut feeling\" is that this delay will push back the opening of the tower.</p><p>Unfortunately, Oct. 1 held no relief either; \"Friday morning, they went to fire the helicopter up and they had a warning light come on,\" Borst said. \"They weren't able to track it down until late in the afternoon.\"</p><p>But, he continued, Saturday, Oct. 2, went without a hitch.</p><p>\"The tower is in place. All the pieces are there,\" Borst said. \"They will have some adjustments and fine-tuning to make over the next two to three weeks, and so I'm guessing sometime in that time period\u2026 they will be completed.\"</p><p>Part of those fine-tuning adjustments include replacing the staircase railing that was damaged on Sept. 23; this is proving difficult, Borst said, because the kind of steel that is used for the tower is not locally available.</p><p>CELEBRATION</p><p>Although the tower may not be opened to the public for weeks yet, the Mount Peak Historical Fire Lookout Association is still going ahead with an Oct. 16 celebration at the big tent on the corner of Cole Street and Myrtle Avenue.</p><p>\"The reason is, the further we get to the end the fall, the worse chances there are for weather,\" Borst said. \"Even if the thing is not 100 percent complete, we're going to go ahead and have that celebration.\"</p><p>More details about the celebration are yet to come; Borst said to check out the Association's Facebook page for additional information.</p><p>TOWER HISTORY</p><p>Fire lookout towers used to be common in the Pacific Northwest region, as more than 800 lookouts dotted the landscape in Washington and Oregon. Enumclaw itself had four towers: Mount Peak, Grass Mountain, Carbon Ridge and Point McDonald.</p><p>The first fire lookout tower to grace Mount Peak with its presence was built in 1929 by the state Department of Natural Resources.</p><p>In 1934, the tower was replaced by one built by the Washington Forest Fire Association, and the tower was demolished and rebuilt again by DNR so it could be staffed 24/7. That tower stayed in use until the summer of 1964, and was taken down in '66.</p><p>In anticipation of this replica tower being built, the Mount Peak Historical Fire Lookout Association brought Lin Thrune-Makela \u2014 the last employee to staff the Mount Peak tower \u2014 back up the mountain in 2016.</p><p>It was her job to stay vigilant against forest fires all day and all night for nearly the entire summer, she told the Courier-Herald, but it was also her responsibility to relay messages: Thrune-Makela would get a call on a landline from the DNR office in town, and she'd have to radio the message to rangers in the field.</p><p>Hiking wasn't very popular back then, she recalled, but she did receive her fair share of visitors, as the peak wasn't as isolated as other fire lookouts were.</p><p>\"You felt like you were part of the community \u2013 you were still part of the world,\" she said.</p><p>For her efforts, Thrune-Makela pulled in $200 a month (worth $1,765 now), though she still had to buy all her own food, which was delivered via ranger who drove to the tower in an Army-surplus Jeep.</p><p>Copyright 2021 Enumclaw Courier Herald</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COUHER-news20211006PXG4223172</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COUHER2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63SP-5KG1-JD2C-J1FD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">475116</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"762\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

Most commonly known as drones, they have been used since the 1900s, initially by the US military for target practice.</p><p>Military applications still dominate the global UAV market, but the achievements of UAVs in military operations have boosted demand for drones in North America, Middle East and the Asia-Pacific. UAVs are becoming a key element in the intelligence and surveillance operations of military and fast expanding in other combative areas as well.</p><p>The fast development of the UAV global market is having a big impact on a range of mainstream industries. Apart from defense, applications also include environmental management, crisis management, agriculture, policing and crowd monitoring, civil engineering, fisheries protection, disaster management, telecommunications maintenance, oil and gas exploration, mineral exploration, mine safety, geophysical surveys and mapping.</p><p>The UAV market has traditionally been narrowly focused but it is rapidly diversifying. Given the pace at which technology and the effectiveness of aircraft are improving, and as sensor and automation technologies mature, commercial applications will rapidly grow over the next ten years.</p><p>1.2 Market Scope</p><p>The UAV sector is set to be the sector with the most dynamic growth in the aerospace industry globally in this decade. According to the Teal Group, global spending on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) programs is expected to more than triple over the next decade in military, commercial, and consumer markets.</p><p>In light of solid growth rates, the Teal Group forecasts global spending is expected to touch $20.3 billion by 2025. The civil UAS market is expected to grow faster than the military market over the next decade. The worldwide military UAS spending over the next decade is estimated to be US$216.5 billion. Of which, procurement spending will amount to US$162.2 billion and research spending will amount to US$72.5 billion. The US is expected to account for about 81% of the total military R&amp;D spending and about 48% of military procurement through to 2030.</p><p>The high level of military R&amp;D spending is forecast to be due to the bigger and higher-value systems procured by the US. The military UAS market growth will be led by unmanned combat aerial vehicles and high-altitude long endurance UAVs. The largest market segment over the next decade will be High Altitude Long Endurance UAVs, which will account for a third of the period's sales.</p><p>The civil UAS will be the most attractive market this decade as commercial applications take off and governments adopt UAVs for new roles in border security and public safety. The worldwide civil UAS market is expected to reach US$19.8 billion by 2031, from US$7.2 billion in 2022, according to the Teal Group. Over the coming decade, the civil market will grow at a CAGR of 9.1% and will generate US$139 billion in revenues. Civil UAS promises to be the most dynamic growth sector with commercial segment expected to lead the growth.</p><p>The worldwide commercial UAS market is projected to reach $9.5 billion by 2028. Delivery is likely to emerge as the leading sector for commercial UAS market in the US by 2030. Teal Group predicts that Teal growth opportunities will be in middle-mile (e.g., factory to warehouse) transportation, rather than in the last-mile deliveries. This is primarily due to complexities involved in regulating the last-mile deliveries, while the regulatory framework for middle-mile transportation is already in place. Globally, Agriculture will be the largest sector by 2030 led by more affordable UAS and heavy Chinese investments. This is also supported by UN projections which suggests world's population to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, causing significant growth in agricultural consumption. Another key sector that will drive growth of the commercial UAS market is Industrial Inspection. Construction will be the largest portion of the Industrial Inspection market. All ten of the largest worldwide construction firms are deploying or experimenting with UAS fleets.</p><p>China has a clear leadership in the consumer UAS manufacturing and is now seeking to expand its capabilities to commercial UAS manufacturing. The aggressive growth of the UAV industry in China is attributable to the policy and regulatory support as well as significant investments from the Chinese government.</p><p>Currently, Sichuan, Hunan, Hainan and Jiangxi provinces in China are pushing forward the reform of low-altitude airspace management, giving support to the commercialization of drone application. China's civil drone market is estimated at $6.6 billion in 2022, according to Shenzhen-based research firm AskCI Consulting. The industrial drone market is also witnessing rapid growth. According to data from Shenzhen-based Qianzhan Industry Research Institute, the industrial drone sales is projected to increase from 27.3 billion yuan in 2020 to 265.8 billion yuan in 2026. Shenzhen has more than 1,500 drone companies with civilian UAV business licenses.</p><p>Data from the Civil Aviation Administration of China showed that by the end of 2021, there are 781,000 registered drone users, and the number of registered drones totaled 832,000 in China. The Civil Aviation Administration of China released a plan that outlined several targets for the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) business in China by the years 2025, 2030, and 2035. These goals included the enhancement of rules and the expansion of airspace capacity for civilian UAVs.</p><p>Europe has fallen behind in the civil UAS market. It is now trying to catch up by enacting standardized airspace rules that will create a single market. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has established rules for small UAS across the European Union.</p><p>The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has become the first air transport safety regulator in the world to offer technical design guidance to urban planners and eVTOL manufacturers looking to build drone taxi vertiports across Europe. Europe also adopted 'European Drone Strategy 2.0' late last year aimed for the further development of the European drone market. Further, the implementation of the 'U-space' in January 2023, a European system to manage drone traffic safely, will lay the ground for increased operations. According to European Commission, the drone services market in Europe could be worth \u20ac14.5 billion, and create 145,000 jobs, by 2030.</p><p>The increase in defense spending by various countries to strengthen their defense forces is leading to growth in the number of military UAV systems. These UAV systems are being used for applications such as surveying, mapping, transportation, combat operations and monitoring. The US and European governments have already begun new programs using UAVs for protecting land and sea borders. Many other international agencies including the UN and other peacekeeping agencies are also deploying unmanned aerial protection systems.</p><p>According to the US Presidential budget for fiscal 2024, the US Department of Defense aims to hasten the deployment of advanced combat drones as part of a broader push to modernize the force and pursue cutting-edge technology. The budget includes $547.8 million for modifying five US Air Force MQ-9 Reapers to meet the US Marine Corps' interim requirement for a Group 5 UAS. The United States is not the only nation that is increasing defense spending on unmanned aerial vehicles. Earlier this year, Germany approved major uptick in defense spending on armed drones. German military will purchase ammunitions worth EUR152 million to arm German drones. This will be the first deployment of weaponized UAVs in German military.</p><p>Ukraine has announced plans to double down on its deployment of drones in its efforts to counter Russian forces, pledging nearly $540 million of spending in 2023 for the production and procurement of UAVs.</p><p>Japan has announced a record $40.7 billion defense budget for fiscal 2023, which will include significant spending on armed drones. It intends to raise defense spending to 2 percent of GDP by 2027. The Japanese defense ministry aims to introduce unmanned vehicles that can be used directly in combat, rather than just for surveillance and intelligence gathering.</p><p>According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), military expenditures are on the rise around the globe. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has led to increase in defense funding especially for drones. Over the next decade, growth in military market will increasingly shift towards international markets as more militaries incorporate UAVs into their forces.</p><p>Major drone providers from China and Israel have increased the manufacture and export of defense drones for foreign militaries. Many counties from Saudi Arabia to Myanmar and Iraq to Ethiopia, are stockpiling Chinese combat drones and deploying them on the battlefield.</p><p>The introduction of specially built unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) also promises to drive growth over the next decade. The emergence of the commercial UAS market, growing demand from governments to better patrol borders, and continued consumer drone growth all promise to drive more than a quadrupling of the non-military market over the next decade.</p><p>With increasing UAV installations across the globe, there is rising need to defend against such systems as well. In May 2022, South Korea approved a project to install uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) defense systems at 45 bases across the nation to neutralize hostile drones. South Korean government will spend NT$4.3 billion (US$144.45 million) to purchase the UAV defense systems.</p><p>Market Share</p><p>The world UAV sector is highly concentrated with a small number of companies holding most of the market share compared to other industries. Our estimates show there are more than 500 companies globally, with more than 200 commercial UAV companies, while the other 300 develop UAV for the military industry. AeroVironment, BAE Systems, Elbit Systems, Finmeccanica, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Navmar Applied Sciences, Northrop Grumman, Safran, Textron, Thales, Boeing, Tital Aerospace, TAI, AIA and Aviation Industry Corporation of China are among the biggest players in the UAV market.</p><p>A number of start-ups have made their mark on the market in recent years, however, and are challenging the dominance of the incumbent players. Technology companies like Intel, Qualcomm, Microsoft, Apple as well as venture capitalists have poured more millions of dollars into startup investments.</p><p>Impact of COVID-19 on the UAV Sector</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every industry, although not in an equal way. Some industries have felt the impact very differently to others. The effect on the UAV market especially commercial drones have been on the positive side. According to Drone Industry Insights, drone companies are on a path towards steady growth over the next many years. Global drone market size is forecast to reach US$55.8 billion by 2030, from US$30.6 billion in 2022, implying a CAGR of 7.8%. The services sector will remain the biggest segment, while hardware segment will be the fastest growing.</p><p>As the global economies were forced to shut down and implement strict shelter-in-place restrictions, the demand for unmanned aerial systems became higher. Further, the use of drones for transporting medical supplies proved a boon for the sector. Cargo, courier and warehousing are the sectors with the fastest adoption of drones. Many drone companies including Wingcopter, Zipline and Wing have been able to deliver and scale their solutions quicker than previously expected.</p><p>England's National Health Service (NHS) is among those trailing the vehicles to deliver fragile medicines to cancer patients living on the Isle of Wight. Chemotherapy drugs can have short shelf lives and thus quick delivery by drones is a boon for patients.</p><p>Walmart said that it completed 6,000 drone deliveries in 2022 from 36 US stores in seven states. These deliveries were done from drone delivery hubs operated by DroneUp, Flytrex and Zipline. Walmart has 4,700 stores located within 90% of the US population making it uniquely positioned to offer drone delivery at scale.</p><p>In June 2022, Zipline launched drone medical deliveries in Nigeria. Zipline will initially deliver over 200 different medical products, including medicines and vaccines, with plans to expand in the near future. This will enable Nigeria to create a strong and smart health system. In May 2022, Wingcopter announced a partnership with Continental Drones to develop a massive delivery network spanning 49 countries across Sub-Saharan Africa. The deal aims to deploy 12,000 of Wingcopter's 198 drone systems over the course of the next 5 years. In February 2022, Zipline announced launching operations in another African Nation with on-demand drone deliveries of medical supplies in Kenya. The company is already operating in Ghana, Nigeria, and Ivory Coast.</p><p>US-based Walgreens in partnership with Alphabet's Wing is targeting the drone delivery market. In April 2022, Walgreens announced that it will begin flying packages by drone to residents of Texas cities in partnership with Google's drone subsidiary, Wing.</p><p>US-based Matternet is another player targeting the medical delivery market. In September 2021, it launched the world's first city-wide drone delivery network for the rapid transport of medical goods in Abu Dhabi. The company will use drones to transport urgent, high-value goods such as COVID-19 vaccines, blood, and lab samples across the Abu Dhabi's health system.</p><p>LEK Consulting notes that drones could account for a large portion of package delivery market by 2040. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a rapid and more expansive testing of drone delivery systems. The technology has been able to accelerate its growth and development over the past 12 months or so.</p><p>To further assist the sector, the UK government announced new funding program for drone companies developing methods to deliver COVID-19 tests and personal protective equipment (PPE) to hospitals and rural communities. The government has announced ~\u00a37 million funding package for the sector.</p><p>According to research published in journal Patterns, drone deliveries could help reduce greenhouse emissions significantly. The paper states that greenhouse-gas emissions per parcel were 84% lower for drones than for diesel trucks. Companies such as Amazon have been testing the use of drones to deliver packages with an eye to reducing their environmental impact.</p><p>1.3 Market Trends</p><p>Start-ups Threaten Larger Incumbents</p><p>Over the past 20 years, the UAV sector has expanded and opened up to a whole new level of competition and innovation that had not been seen in the market. While large incumbents, especially the Big Three - Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman - have won a big slice of the available UAV deals, new and smaller entrants are increasingly winning against the big companies for UAV contracts, thus challenging their respective market positions.</p><p>A number of smaller start-up companies have burst onto the scene in recent years, threatening the market positions of the larger incumbents. Non-defense companies eager to diversify and get a slice of the fast-growing market have funded some start-ups.</p><p>The funding from Drone startups have started on a strong footing in 2023 after a robust 2022. In June 2023, defense and security UAV specialist group Red Cat Holdings raised $1.2 million in new funding to develop a new, portable UAV as standard issue equipment for soldiers. In April 2023, San Francisco-based Zipline raised $330 million at about $4.2 billion, a 55% increase from its $2.7 billion valuation reached two years ago. The funding will help the company to carry out its expansion activities. In March 2023, French advanced air mobility (AAM) startup Ascendance Flight Technology says it is aggressively pushing to finalize the prototype of its ATEA hybrid vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) plane, and has raised new investment of \u20ac21 million ($22.6 million). In February 2023, US-based drone manufacturer, Skydio raised $230 million in Series E funding at a valuation of $2.2 billion. The funding will be used to setup a new manufacturing facility in America. In January 2023, Japan-based Terra Drone raised $14 million from oil giant Saudi Aramco. The company says it will utilize the funding to set up a new subsidiary for inspection services in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>In November 2022, India-based drone delivery platform Skye Air Mobility raised $1.7 million. Skye Air Mobility is currently operating in eight cities across India and plans to expand to 16 cities in the next 24 months. In October 2022, Australian drone logistics service provider Swoop Aero landed a new investment round for its first and last mile airborne delivery network, bringing its total backing to $26 million to date. Swoop Aero plans to use the funds to enter new markets, scale its integrated logistics networks, and expand its manufacturing capabilities.</p><p>Regulatory Uncertainties Overshadow the Segment</p><p>UAV vehicles have evolved swiftly in recent years, particularly since making the leap from military technology to consumer gadgetry. The technology they use could be useful for myriad business opportunities. For example, UAVs are being used in many sectors, like the agriculture, construction, energy, mining and entertainment, as well as geological surveys and, utility safety and maintenance, thanks to their ability to shoot aerial photos and video, as well as collect other data cheaply.</p><p>The growth of the UAV market, however, has drawn considerable attention from regulators and legislators eager to mitigate the complexities involved in the growth of the number of aeronautical vehicles in the skies. For instance, in the US there has been delays and confusion regarding the rules set by FAA. With the courts and Congress getting involved in regulation, clarity around the regulatory landscape is yet to emerge.</p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued new rules for the commercial drone industry. Under the new rules, the FAA will allow small drones to operate at night and over people and will require remote identification of the drones. The new rules went into effect on 21 April 2021. Remote ID will be required for all drones weighing 0.55 lb (0.25 kg) or more. Remote ID requires identification of drones in flight as well as the location of their control stations or takeoff point.</p><p>Further, in 2022, the FAA will require every new produced drone weighing over 0.55 pounds to broadcast its location. In 2023, it will be illegal to fly drone without this broadcasting capability.</p><p>For fiscal FY 2022, FAA is requesting a total of over $100 million in funding for unmanned aircraft system (UAS) research, development, and integration. This includes $31.3 million for UAS implementation which incorporates FAA Drone Zone. The FAA Drone Zone is a cloud-based information technology platform that includes a UAS registration system, Part 107 authorizations and optional waivers, and UAS accident reporting.</p><p>FAA budget request also includes $24 million for UAS concept validation and requirements development, UAS flight information management, and urban air mobility.</p><p>The FAA plans to launch field tests of unmanned aircraft traffic management capabilities. The Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management (UTM) field test, which is set to launch in the spring 2022 and continue into 2023, is expected to lead to new policies and the development of updated industry standards for drones operating beyond visual line-of-sight (BVLOS).</p><p>The commercial potential of UAV continues to attract big investors and venture capital. For example, Amazon's is investing in its Amazon Prime Air program to create a delivery system utilizing UAVs.</p><p>Alphabet's drone-delivery subsidiary Wing launched a new mobile and web app, OpenSky, which is free to use and informs drone pilots about airspace restrictions, pre-plan flights, and get airspace approvals. Drone flyers can also use the app to check information on areas where they can and cannot fly.</p><p>This is just one of the many proposed uses for UAVs, however. Within the next ten years, it is expected that more than 32,000 drones will be flying for commercial operations worldwide. FAA projects that remote pilot certificates could grow almost 3x to 350,000 over the next five years.</p><p>For the US, the potential economic impact of UAVs, according to the Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, could reach approximately US$13.7 billion within the next three years and create more than 100,000 employment opportunities once the FAA drafts comprehensive drone regulations.</p><p>Despite some progress by FAA on establishing rules, it remains unclear. The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) delivered a report in January 2023 stating on the need for FAA to more clearly communicate a strategy to integrate drones into the airspace. GAO notes that the commercial drone use is likely to expand to 858,000 in 2026 from 622,000 in 2021.</p><p>The main conclusions of the report are that FAA needs to do better in both establishing and communicating a comprehensive strategy for broader UAV use, and in defining a uniform procedure for issuing waiver.</p><p>Wing's CEO Adam Woodwort in March 2023 reiterated the need to make drone regulations more pragmatic and predictable. He emphasized the need for drone regulations that support commercial operations. He noted that many of the current regulations make sense for passenger-carrying airplanes, but not for small aircraft with no people onboard.</p><p>In June 2023, China unveiled a list of new rules applying to drone flight by civilian users and these rules are set to come into force next year. The regulations ban people from using the devices to take pictures or video of military or defence industrial installations or secretive facilities. Drones cannot be used to gather and publish state secrets or unlawfully transfer information outside mainland China. It also bans non-Chinese drones and pilots who are not Chinese nationals from using the vehicles for surveying land. The country currently has a million registered civilian drones that fly around 20 million hours each year, according to data from China Daily.</p><p>The Buzz from Parcel-Toting Drones</p><p>In a few decades from now, we may look back and remember a time before flying robots delivered consumer orders. At least this might be the case if delivery drones turn out the way most retailers \u2014 as well as service providers - envision them. A delivery drone, or also known as a parcelcopter, is an UAV utilized to transport goods, packages, and foodstuffs, and recently, the delivery systems have been a hot future state plans among vendors.</p><p>By 2023, Statista projects global drone delivery market to touch $1.6 billion. Asia-Pacific will be the largest market accounting for nearly 39% of the total, followed by North America (31%) and Europe (22%).</p><p>McKinsey notes that as of early 2022, more than 2,000 drone deliveries are occurring each day worldwide. The growth rate is accelerating, and it projects that there will be close to 1.5 million deliveries in 2022 in total, up from just under half a million in 2021.</p><p>Drone Industry Insights noted that services such as cargo, courier, intralogistics and warehousing were the fastest-growing drone market in 2021 and are likely to continue to remain so till 2026 with a CAGR of 24.3%. This is due to the increased popularity and demand of drone deliveries for both internal (intralogistics and warehousing) as well as external services.</p><p>Drone deliveries can cut emissions and reduce congestion on roads. According to Virginia Tech University, drone delivery could save the average consumer up to 56 hours per year, reduce vehicle traffic by 294 million miles per year and displace up to 113,900 tons of CO2 per year.</p><p>China-based ecommerce platform Meituan announced that it has completed more than 100,000 drone deliveries by 2022, an increase of more than 400% year-on-year. The company expects greater number of drone deliveries going forward.</p><p>Alphabet's drone delivery service Wing is adding complex route management and self-loading capability for its drone delivery fleet that will make it capable of handling tens of millions of deliveries for millions of consumers by mid 2024.</p><p>Given the large opportunity in the drone delivery market, the space is witnessing new entrants. In 2023, Japan Post announced its plans to expand and accelerate its mail drone delivery services in the country. It is now undertaking trials in populated zones in the country.</p><p>Singapore's civil aviation authority and transport ministry has chosen a private consortium of 13 members to develop the drone program. Under this program, the aim is to use drones for tasks that include delivering parcels, inspecting buildings and providing security. The companies involved in the project have carried our various pilots. These include drone parcel delivery as well as using drones to transport blood samples and specimens between hospitals and central laboratory. Drones are being tested for delivering parts and other materials to factories as well.</p><p>China is not too far behind in this race. DHL in partnership with China-based drone company EHang has launched drone delivery service in China. JD.com and Alibaba have tested the drone delivery system as well.</p><p>Putting the parcelcopter concept into service will take some time because of the many setbacks. The major setback for this concept in the US is that there is no specific flight system where there needs to be a specific path for the drone to travel and deliver in a populated area - and this needs to be solved. Once resolved, the big benefit should be that these delivery-by-drone systems could be commonplace within the next decade. Open season on the open skies could arrive sooner than expected.</p><p>The Obsession with Armed Flying Robots</p><p>The use of a UAV as a weapon first became known in World War II. After the war, little development occurred in drone technology and most remotely piloted vehicles were used for target practice. The US military's first major spending on UAVs began after the Vietnam War, and over the past two decades, the country has become the world's pre-eminent user and supplier.</p><p>Military UAVs in the US have gone through meteoric growth over the past decade. Development has taken a quantum leap \u2014 from lab concept to battle-tested proven technology. Today, America's comparative advantage in UAVs, however, is being battered as technological know-how disseminates throughout the international system. While existing technology has started to lag, global competitors are playing catch up in research and development for drone technology.</p><p>As such, the Pentagon is expected to ramp up its investment in unmanned aerial vehicles in the coming years. The US Defense Department budget request for fiscal year 2023 mentions that unmanned weapons systems, such as drone ships, planes, and ground vehicles, will play an increasing role in future US military planning. The president's fiscal year 2023 defense budget requests new spending on unmanned/autonomous systems technology.</p><p>The Air Force request includes $187 million for enhancements to the MQ-9 Reaper combat drone and $111 million for work on the MQ-4C Triton high-altitude surveillance drone. The Navy and Marine Corps have also requested additional funding for UAVs. The Navy requested $1.2 billion for the MQ-25 Stingray drone, which is to be deployed on carriers and perform aerial refueling and surveillance functions.</p><p>No country has ramped up its UAV research in recent years faster than China, where every major company for the Chinese military has a research and development center and funding allocations dedicated to drones. In recent years, the country has pumped considerable amounts of funds and engineering brainpower into the technology, a field previously dominated by the US and Israel.</p><p>Much of the work done, however, remains secret, but the large number of drones created underlines not only the country's willpower to catch up in the sector by building comparable combat and surveillance models like the Predator and the Global Hawk but also the desire to trade the technologies globally. Its armed UAV CH-4, Wing Loong I and Wing Loong II have been rapidly gaining market share especially in developing countries such as Nigeria, Jordan, Algeria and Middle Eastern countries.</p><p>Israel, second after the US in drone technology, has flown armed UAV models but few details are available. India has also revealed its intention to develop drones that will fire missiles and fly at 30,000 feet, followed by Russia, which has revealed models of UAVs with weapons (although there is little evidence that they are currently operational).</p><p>The Lucrative UAV Micro Segment</p><p>The new generation of UAVs is being developed to improve monitoring of many kinds of systems. From tracking bush fires in Australia to observing traffic in the US, infrared cameras to track missing people at night, and laser spectroscopy used to monitor air pollutions, UAVs are using a lot of the new up-to-date miniature sensor technology.</p><p>All of this requires more focus on the integration of sensor systems in an airborne device that is severely constrained in power and weight. Changing the sensor architecture or even take the control sensors out entirely, allowing the size of the UAV to reduce dramatically. This has created a new class of ultra-small UAV sensors.</p><p>Lockheed Martin's Lockheed Sanders MicroSTAR series of prototypes is one of the many examples of a mini UAV. The battery-operated MicroSTAR designs resembled kid's toys. The device has winglets instead of the single vertical plane tail, and a nose mounted propeller. MicroSTAR featured a five-gram navigation system that could give directions by the ground station but could also automatically keep on a heading or orbit a target.</p><p>The US army has been using mini UAVs for mission in Afghanistan and other areas. These mini UAVs provide near-real time video that allows soldiers to better survey their surroundings and detect enemies in combat. FLIR System's Black Hornet is one such mini UAV which weighs less than two ounces, can be deployed in less than one minute and has a range of over a mile. It is intended to eliminate battlefield blind spots thereby saving lives.</p><p>French drone maker Parrot is also an established player in micro UAV space. It has been selected by Swiss army to develop and supply micro-drones as part of the Swiss Mini UAV Program.</p><p>Despite the advancements, the current micro UAV market remains constrained, largely due to regulatory frameworks on unmanned operations in airspace. But once regulatory restraints are loosened and clarified, the potential of this technology will be unlocked. Mini UAVs are set to become one of the major contributors to both the economy and technology. Market growth, however, still very much depends on the pace of UAV development in different countries, thanks to the wide range of applications and the added value related to these unmanned machines.</p><p>1.4 Applications</p><p>Defense</p><p>Defense will continue to the largest market for UAVs for the foreseeable future. UAVs can play an important role in counter terrorism and counter insurgency activities. They can be deployed in highly dangerous missions thereby saving personnel lives. The UAVs are also being used in difficult terrains for intelligence gathering and surveillance. They provide high resolution images and videos which can significantly help ground troops. Drones have been used by militaries of many countries to conduct strikes against terrorists.</p><p>Transport</p><p>UAVs are increasingly used in transport activities such as e-commerce parcel delivery, food delivery and medicine delivery. Of these, e-commerce delivery is getting the maximum attention with large companies such as Amazon already doing pilot tests.</p><p>Another promising area for UAVs is the delivery of food. It could be used in heavily populated urban areas for food delivery by restaurants and also could be used to deliver foods to difficult terrains including oil rigs and remote islands. Medical logistics is another area where UAVs can be used to transport medicines and can also be used as flying defibrillators.</p><p>Infrastructure</p><p>UAVs can assist in the management of various kinds of infrastructure, specifically construction sites. In the pre- construction phase, drones can survey the land and provide accurate field data and images. They are able to capture high-resolution videos and images, which can significantly improve the speed and quality of the design process. In the construction phase, drones can inspect the sites and provide accurate information regarding the progress of the construction.</p><p>The data received could be used by investors and property owners to monitor if the project is progressing as per original schedule or not. Abu Dhabi has launched the trial stage of implementing drones as aerial monitoring and inspection tools for the city's engineering projects and construction sites.</p><p>US state of Arizona is mulling the use drones to inspect roads, bridges and other infrastructure. The state has introduced Drone Infrastructure Inspection Grant Act, that would dispense about $200 million to purchase drones and the other half to train pilots to fly them.</p><p>The FAA's rollout of the Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC) has helped standardize and expand the use of drones in construction. LAANC automates the application and approval process for airspace authorizations and is currently available at near 500 airports across the country. LAANC is currently in beta and will be tested further before nationwide rollout.</p><p>An increasing number of construction firms and real estate developers in the Middle East are turning to drones amid the COVID-19 crisis. Drones are being used for progress monitoring and site mapping as companies try to speed up delivery of projects. In November 2020, New York's Department of Finance's property division said that it is looking into the use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems for tasks such as surveying tax lots, geographic information system (GIS) mapping and aerial photography.</p><p>Agriculture</p><p>One of the largest projected applications of UAVs in in agriculture. Drones can be used by farmers to monitor their crops. UAVs can survey a farmland faster and at a lower cost than airplanes/satellites and also provide better data and images to farmers. The current altitude restrictions for UAVs limit the area that it can survey, but if the altitude restrictions ease a little, the area could expand and provide greater benefits to farmers.</p><p>Japan has been using UAVs for crop dusting for more than 20 years now and drones account for more than 90% of crop dusters. In the US as well, the adoption of drones in agriculture is increasing due to exemption from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) under the part 107 rule.</p><p>China's largest agriculture drone maker XAG is trying to automate rice farming in China with the launch of its drone-based direct seeding system called JetSeed. It could replace manual seed planting and raise efficiency amid a labor shortage due to COVID-19.</p><p>In January 2023, the United Kingdom's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has given operational authorization to China-based XAG's agricultural spraying aircraft P40 and V40. This is the first time drone spraying and spreading has been legalized for use on UK farms.</p><p>Public Safety</p><p>This area again presents huge opportunities for UAVs. Drones can be used for law enforcement, search and rescue missions, firefighting and medical services. Civil governments are deploying an increasing number of unmanned systems.</p><p>The US and European governments have launched many new pilot programs to deploy UAV systems to protect borders. The United Nations and other peacekeepers are also deploying unmanned aerial systems to provide protection.</p><p>In the US, many agencies have acquired drones. Most of these agencies are police/sheriff departments followed by fire departments. In October 2022, the sheriff department of Las Vegas announced plans to deploy 400 drones as responders to rising gun violence. In Indiana and Maryland, police have successfully used drones to catch suspects and thieves. In Oakland, the fire department used drones to hot spots, which were not extinguished during a firefighting mission. The Los Angeles Fire Department has been using drones to make hot-spot identification and aerial mapping for wildfire response, as well as incident response for other search and rescue missions.</p><p>Further, drones can collect information, data and images on natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes and wildfires. UAVs have great potential for surveying storm damage and locating people after natural disasters. The US National Guard is using AI-powered drones to track wildfires in real time. The AI-backed drones can predict the area where fire is most likely to spread based on previous fires.</p><p>The US is using drones for border security as well. The drones support the border patrol team by providing enhanced intelligence, surveillance capabilities and reducing the risk to human operators on the ground.</p><p>Inspections</p><p>UAVs can be used for inspections in areas such as wind turbines, oil pipelines, power lines, railroads and more. Oil and gas companies can use a drone to conduct the required monthly inspection of their pipelines. Instead of hiring a helicopter, which is costly, companies can use drones to do the same at lower cost. Drone inspections can survey hundreds of miles of pipeline and pinpoint the location of the leaks, thereby reducing traditional surveilling costs by nearly 90%.</p><p>In November 2021, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines announced plans to use of drones for passenger aircraft inspection. The drones can inspect the aircraft for minor damage inflicted by events like hailstorms and lightning strikes.</p><p>Similarly, UAVs can inspect wind turbines, several hundred feet in the air, removing the need for an individual to physically reach the place. Netherlands-based wind energy company Vestas is using drones to conduct inspection of its 1,250 wind turbines. Archaeologists can use UAVs to inspect the sites and also patrol for looters. The city of London is using drones for surveys which are used for repairing and maintaining assets across the underground rail network.</p><p>1.5 Regulatory Environment</p><p>Drones are taking off in a big way. Once the preserve of the military, UAVs are now widely popular in the commercial sector, thanks to consumer-grade UAVs that become increasingly sophisticated and cheaper. Though regulatory obstacles could hinder growth prospects.</p><p>Currently, there are different sets of rules governing the uses of commercial UAVs around the world. In December 2020, the US FAA approved a new set of regulations governing commercial UAVs. The FAA will allow small drones to operate at night and over people and will require remote identification of the drones. This new regulation will bring a step closer to commercial drone use for agriculture, infrastructure repair, and eventually, even deliveries from companies such as Amazon.</p><p>Canada has had safety regulations in place that govern the use of UAVs. A recreational pilot operating a drone weighing less than 35kgs does not currently require either a license or a special flying permit. It, however, must follow a list of Transport Canada safety guidelines, such as staying nine kilometers from an airport, flying under 90 meters and always keeping the craft within eyesight.</p><p>Australia requires no registration of recreational drones. Recreational drone operators must comply with Civil Aviation and Safety Authority (CASA) rules that allow drones to be flown only within a visual line of sight. There are other restrictions on the maximum altitude, vicinity near airports and flying over crowded places.</p><p>The regulations allow commercial operators to fly drones weighing less than 2kg without a license. Operators must still adhere to all the existing rules for recreational drone use such as not to fly within 5.5km of an airport, above 400 feet or within 30m of buildings, railways or vehicles, and always to have line of sight of the drone.</p><p>Drones that weigh less than 20kgs in the UK can fly in normal airspace for private use as long as the operator is not planning to use data or images from the flight acquired by flying close to people or objects. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) requires all UAVs to remain 150 meters from crowded events or large assemblies, 50m from an individual or building, and stay within line of sight, which is 500m horizontally and 122m vertically. Drones that weigh more than 20kgs are currently banned from flying in civilian airspace.</p><p>The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has established new rules on drones. Under the rules, drone operators will have to be registered with their national authority and the drones will need to have a direct remote identification system in place. The regulatory framework will ensure the protection of citizens' privacy rights while addressing security issues as well.</p><p>China is moving rapidly to establish regulatory framework for drones. In October 2020, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) announced the first Unmanned Civil Aviation Experimental Zones (UCAEZs) to help accelerate the drone industry in China. The new experimental zones are designed to not only offer the airspace for testing innovative drone applications, but to ease the process of developing drone businesses.</p><p>1.6 Challenges and Opportunities</p><p>Opportunities</p><p>UAV industry presents tremendous opportunities for investors, companies as well as government. UAV technology has reached a maturity point that has placed it at the forefront of aerospace manufacturing. As UAV companies around the world make drones more accessible, the UAV sector despite the undeveloped regulatory framework, is set to develop into one of the most dynamic growth industries this decade. There are some 450 UAV companies worldwide behind this growing multibillion-dollar industry, with the number growing.</p><p>Both the military and commercial markets are set to grow rapidly in the next few years, as the US economy continues to recover, technology continues to diffuse around the world, as designs become more streamlined and efficient and as more industries adopt existing business processes for UAV use.</p><p>The non-military, especially the commercial drone segment, is set to grow the fastest with projections of mid to high teens growth over the next the next decade. The latest developments in computer vision, machine learning, cloud and data analytics are expected to push drone deployment in the mainstream commercial sector. In the US and many other places around the world, the regulations either remain too restrictive or are yet to be given a final shape, which has been a deterrent in the pace of UAV adoption.</p><p>With the explosion of interest in building and operating unmanned aircraft systems, the use of UAV technology is set to generate more high-tech jobs, with millions in tax revenues and tens of billions in economic impact.</p><p>UAV technology is moving ever faster forward as the market continues to flourish. Industry will need to consider how to best to integrate UAVs into their businesses.</p><p>Challenges</p><p>Safety, privacy and regulatory barriers remain key challenges for the rapid adoption of UAVs. The most urgent challenge for the governments is to ensure that the drone operations remain safe.</p><p>Privacy is another key concern that needs to be addressed. UAVs collect massive amounts of data including video and images, which sometimes could result in the invasion of personal privacy. A livestream or a recording of individuals or buildings can easily be captured without consent. Also, even if the data collected is with consent, the transmission of data itself remains vulnerable to hack. The growth and evolution of the UAV industry has outpaced the development of rules and systems to govern their use. This uncertainty weighs on innovation and commercial adoption, unless there is more clarity on the rules.</p><p>Illegal use of UAVs for criminal activities is another big challenge. For instance, drug cartels have used drones to transfer illegal drugs in the US. These vehicles tend to fly for short periods at very low altitudes. This makes it very difficult to detect using conventional sensor systems. Also, UASs or drones in particular could be a source of public nuisance. If a drone flying over a public place loses control and falls, it could cause substantial damage to the property as well as endanger lives.</p><p>In conclusion, the UAVs have raised a lot of concerns and it is up to policymakers to design and create laws that facilitate the good use of the technology while discouraging its harmful use.</p><p>2.

The Covid-19 lockdown has thrown the advantages of renewables into sharp relief. </p><p>With no fuel supply chain to worry about and priority access to the grid, solar is not just clean and cheap, it's resilient too. Analysts now tell Chlo Farand installed coal capacity could peak this decade[1], with the right government policies. This week's storiesand climate conversations Like wildfire The unofficial roads laid to extract timber, cattle and gold from the Amazon rainforest are also spreading coronavirus to communities with minimal healthcare facilities. Manaus, the biggest city in the region, and indigenous peoples have been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. A spike in deforestation January-March and dry weather forecast create the conditions for a severe forest fire season, experts warn[2], generating smoke that threatens to make the respiratory disease even deadlier. Bailout watch South Korea's government won a recent election on a Green New Deal platform, including a pledge to end public finance to coal. Why then is it backing a $2 billion coronavirus bailout to Doosan Heavy Industries, the country's biggest manufacturer of coal plant technology? The fastest way for Doosan to make a cash return is to sell polluting coal power stations to other countries, accelerating climate breakdown, campaigners say. Theyhave politely asked[3] the country's audit board to check the numbers.

Clallam County \u2014 not the district \u2014 owns and operates the sewer system in Carlsborg. The airport ownership group has not requested the district to provide sewer service.</p><p>The article indicates that the extension of the Carlsborg Urban Growth Area (UGA) to include the airport is necessary for the district to provide water service. While this may be necessary for the county to provide sewer service, it is not necessary for the district to provide water service.</p><p>The County Commissioners mailed a letter dated Nov. 9, 2021, to the district's general manager. The letter showed support for inclusion of the airport into the UGA, and expressed hope that a path may be forged to allow for a water connection (from the district). As discussed above, this path must include securing new water rights and funds for infrastructure improvements.</p><p>County commissioners have previously been included in discussion that new water rights are needed for the District to expand their water service area. The district has been clear regarding its long-standing policy to dedicate existing water rights to the build-out of its existing retail water service area. This area covers portions of the UGA and some adjacent neighborhoods.</p><p>The pioneers of the Carlsborg water system \u2014 those who paid for water rights and infrastructure \u2014 should be assured that these water rights will always be available to them and not given away elsewhere (for example, the airport). In collaboration with the county, the district commissioners formally adopted this policy by resolution in 2017.</p><p>Water rights are very difficult and expensive to acquire. The county and district entered into an agreement in 2013 regarding water rights for the UGA. The agreement essentially assigned to the county the responsibility for acquiring for the district new water rights for the build-out of the existing Carlsborg UGA. The county has been working on this since 2013 without yet gaining the approval from the Department of Ecology \u2014 the state agency that manages water rights. This has been an extremely challenging endeavor for both the county and the district.</p><p>The article included a quote from the county commissioners' letter to the district saying, \"We are uncertain as to why this facility was not included in the Carlsborg UGA boundary when it was originally created.\"</p><p>Counties have land use jurisdiction. Per the Growth Management Act (GMA), the county was responsible for UGA designation. Their records should show the public process toward the establishment of the Carlsborg UGA boundaries. These records may clarify why certain properties were included in the UGA and others, like the airport, were not.</p><p>The district has worked with the airport ownership group to plan for airport expansion noting that the ownership group must address the water rights and funding issues. The ownership group provided information on their wells and their water rights. Also, they provided preliminary engineering drawings for a commercial and residential development surrounding the airport. They have yet to provide how much water they would need for their planned development.</p><p>During the last 12 months, the discussion has focused on providing fire flow. The county fire marshal specifies the fire flow requirements, which depend on the size of buildings and their type of construction. Without knowing these specifics, the fire marshal assumed a high fire flow of 3,000 gallons-per-minute for 60 minutes.</p><p>In the past, the district has been able to provide fire flow, but to a much lesser amount, to a few businesses that are located outside, but adjacent to, our retail service area. The district and the ownership group have discussed a similar arrangement for the airport. This was last discussed in June 2021.</p><p>The article states \"Access to large volumes of water would benefit emergency vehicles during a catastrophic event, such as a major forest fire in the Olympics.\" Adding this fire flow to the fire flow required for future buildings in and around the airport would require even more water rights and funding for infrastructure improvements. The district policy comes into play again. Should the fire flow capacity of the existing water system be used for the airport and/or forest fires, which would leave no capacity to fight fires in the existing retail service area, such as a fire in Greywolf Elementary School?</p><p>The district would need to collaborate with Clallam County, state departments of Ecology and Health, and local water managers to develop a plan moving forward for water connection for the airport. Pumping water from wells impact streamflow and fish habitat. A plan to mitigate these impacts must be approved by the Department of Ecology before they would make a decision on a new water right.</p><p>Ecology must also be assured that water is physically and legally available, senior water rights are not impaired (such as in-stream flows in the Dungeness River), water is being put to beneficial use, and the water use is in the public interest. The Department of Health would approve (and provide loans for) infrastructure improvements only if Ecology approves water rights first.</p><p>The county should lead a public process that supports new water acquisition for the district to provide water service to the airport \u2014 a process that includes local water managers such as the Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe, the Dungeness Water Users Association and the Dungeness Water Exchange.</p><p>For more about Public Utility District No. 1 of Clallam County, visit clallampud.net.</p><p>Copyright 2022 Sequim Gazette</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SEQGAZ-news20220216PYC4282737</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SEQGAZ2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64T4-GJB1-JD2C-J4WJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">475109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1069\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

Kuehn says the intent of the drilling project is \"to help solve a major scientific puzzle which has implications for future environmental conditions and availability of water supplies.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Along with his work in convening the workshop, Kuehn is also part of a core group of nine individuals who co-authored a grant proposal for the event that was submitted to the International Continental Drilling Program (ICDP) in January of 2019. The group submitted a revised $62,500 grant proposal one year later. Funding received through this grant is being used to run the upcoming workshop.</p><p>As part of the ICDP Workshop on Scientific Drilling: PlioWest: Drilling Pliocene Lakes in Western North America, three plenary scientific presentations and multiple working groups will be held virtually between Aug. 26 and Sept. 26, 2021. In addition to the initial science team, other U.S. and international researchers have applied to participate in the workshop. Originally planned as an in-person meeting in 2020, the workshop is now being held virtually due to COVID-related travel restrictions.</p><p>Kuehn says that the upcoming workshop has three main purposes: (a) work out in more detail the scientific plans and objectives, (b) identify and put together the final science team, and (c) begin the process of putting together a full scientific drilling and coring proposal.</p><p>The international, multidisciplinary research group aims to obtain core samples from lake deposits in California, Oregon, Idaho and possibly sites in Mexico and Canada for a time in Earth history about 3 million years ago called the Pliocene. Kuehn says these core samples will be studied to produce well-dated histories of environmental, climate, and ecological conditions.</p><p>Kuehn is especially familiar with one of the areas being considered for drilling, Summer Lake in Oregon. He and Concord students have made multiple expeditions over the past dozen years to study the area's lake history, volcanic ash layers, and earthquake faults. This collaborative student-faculty research is why Summer Lake is among the sites being considered for drilling.</p><p>He explains why studying samples from this bygone time are significant today.</p><p>\"The western U.S. and Canada have been having major problems with droughts, heat waves, and fires. Recurring droughts and record-setting forest fire seasons have been going on for years,\" he says. \"This year many hundreds of people died from the heat, agricultural economies are being hit hard by the drought, towns and cities have water shortages, and many people have lost homes due to the fires. All the wildfire smoke also causes air pollution problems that can cause serious health issues. On the east coast, we've been seeing hazy and sometimes brownish skies from all of the smoke blowing over.\"</p><p>\"These kinds of problems are projected to get worse as carbon dioxide levels keep going up and the west keeps getting warmer and drier,\" he says.</p><p>\"However, during the Pliocene, which was the last time in Earth history when carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere were at levels that we are expected to reach this century, there were actually big lakes in places that are mostly desert today. This contrasts starkly with current trends,\" Kuehn points out, noting that this observation leads to some important questions.</p><p>\"Why was there so much more water around in the Pliocene, and what does this have to say about the future of water supplies in North America? Will places keep getting drier as the past several decades seem to indicate, or will we cross some climate threshold beyond which things actually start getting wetter instead?</p><p>\"Right now, we really don't know,\" he admits.</p><p>Kuehn stresses that trying to understand this, however, is important, and that the need for this knowledge extends to residents of \"The Mountain State\" too.</p><p>\"What actually happens has huge implications, even for people in West Virginia who eat a lot of fruits, vegetables, nuts, berries, etc. that are grown in those drought-stricken areas out west,\" he says.</p><p>To learn more about Concord University's Environmental Geoscience Program, please visit <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.concord.edu\">https://www.concord.edu</url>, then click on Academics, followed by College of Science, Mathematics, and Health.</p><p>Contact: Sarah M.

If demand for vaccinations continues to fall well short of supply, the sites may begin operating fewer days per week, but there are no plans to close any of them, Dr. Thomas Balcezak, Yale New Haven Health's chief clinical officer, said.</p><p>Because of COVID-19's geographic spread, Yale New Haven Health wants to maintain the statewide footprint of its vaccination sites, Balcezak said.</p><p>Yale New Haven Health's local affiliates \u2014 Lawrence + Memorial Hospital in New London and Westerly Hospital \u2014 had COVID-19 patient counts of 12 and one, respectively, on Monday. On April 23, the counts were 14 and two, respectively.</p><p>Balcezak said he could offer \"no good theory\" to account for Westerly Hospital's consistently low COVID-19 patient counts in recent weeks.

The Regulations provide a roadmap as to how greenhouse gas (GHG) emission offset credits generated by acceptable projects can be used by facilities to meet GHG emission reduction requirements under the output-based pricing system (OBPS) aspect of Canada's Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act (GGPPA). For a discussion regarding the mechanics of the GGPPA, including carbon pricing under the OBPS, see our December 2018Blakes Bulletin: Federal Carbon Pricing System Coming Into Force January 2019: How Will it Impact Your Business?[2] Although many aspects of the Regulations are similar to the draft regulation issued in March of 2021 (see our March 2021 Blakes Bulletin: Canada Issues Proposed Federal Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Offset Regulations[3]), there are also some important distinctions, several of which are discussed herein. </p><p><br/>BACKGROUND <br/>The federal OBPS applies in those provinces and territories that do not otherwise have an equivalent carbon pricing regime for large emitters. Currently, these provinces and territories include Manitoba, Saskatchewan (for certain facilities), Prince Edward Island, Nunavut and Yukon. Under the OBPS, offset credits are generated by registered projects wholly situate within Canada that generate GHG reductions (by preventing GHG emissions or removing GHGs from the atmosphere) in comparison to 'business as usual' GHG emissions. Once generated, offset credits can be used by facilities subject to the OBPS for compliance purposes. Alternatively, they can be used to meet corporate net-zero commitments or conditions of an Impact Assessment Act approval. <br/>NOTEWORTHY ASPECTS OF THE REGULATIONS <br/>At its most basic level, the Regulations describe the process by which offset credits can be generated under the GGPPA pursuant to an acceptable offset protocol. However, there are several noteworthy aspects of the Regulations, many of which differ from, or were not addressed in, the draft regulation, or simply bear repeating, including the following: <br/> Generating Offset Credits Environmental Integrity Account Sequestration and Risk Management Plans Project Duration and Renewals Compendium of Federal Offset Protocols <br/>A. Generating Offset Credits <br/>Offset projects can be limited to a single project or include an aggregate of projects. If a project (aggregated or otherwise) is situated in more than one province, the portions situate in each province must be registered as distinct projects. Every federal project must be registered and the project generator requires a federal GHG offset credit system account. Before any offsets are finalized, they must be verified by an independent third-party verification body (verifier). The project cannot be registered under any other offset credit system. In particular, a project will not be eligible to generate credits under the GGPPA if the province in which it is situate has an acceptable offset credit regime and an offset quantification protocol that covers the same activities. This latter requirement is important and reinforces Canada's position that the GGPPA only applies as a 'backstop' in those jurisdictions that do not otherwise have equivalent provincial OBPS regimes. <br/>B. Environmental Integrity Account (EIA) <br/>The EIA is essentially a reserve created to ensure the integrity of the federal offset credit system. A minimum of 3% of all offset credits generated by a registered project is annually deposited to the EIA. In the event there is an involuntary reversal of GHG reductions (such as a forest fire that destroys a forest-related carbon sequestration project), the Minister can revoke the corresponding number of offset credits deposited into the EIA. The EIA may also be used as a last resort to replace offset credits when project proponents fail to comply with replacement requirements. <br/>C. Sequestration and Good Stewardship <br/>The Regulations differentiate between forestry-related sequestration projects and non-forestry sequestration projects (which would include other biological/agricultural sequestration projects as well as non-biological/agricultural sequestration projects). Although the specific mechanics are not defined, the Regulations provide that forestry-related sequestration projects based solely upon good forestry stewardship practices can generate offset credits. In our view, this is the most nebulous aspect of the Regulations. It remains to be seen how offset credits can be generated from good forestry stewardship practices if the business as usual scenario is also good forestry stewardship. The concept of good stewardship is reinforced by the choice of three alternative GHG quantification methods for sequestration projects, namely the tonne-tonne method; tonne-year method; and hybrid tonne-year method. Project proponents involved with any sequestration project must specify the particular quantification methodology in their project application. <br/>The tonne-tonne method calculates the GHGs sequestered during the reporting period, taking into account the monitored quantity of GHG emissions to, and removed from, the atmosphere with respect to the project for 100 years. For example, a forest-sequestration project is considered to facilitate permanent carbon removal provided the forest remains uncut (and unburnt) for 100 years. <br/>Conversely, the tonne-year method and hybrid tonne-year method consider the climate benefit of withholding carbon from the atmosphere (or delaying its release into the atmosphere) annually over a reporting period as opposed to over 100 years. More particularly: <br/>From an offset credit generation perspective, more credits will be generated by projects using the tonne-tonne method in comparison to the tonne-year or hybrid tonne-year methods. However, the latter two alternatives may be attractive to some proponents, particularly those involved in agricultural sequestration projects where ensuring specific land-use and agricultural practices for 100 years may be impractical or unrealistic. <br/>D. Project Duration and Renewals <br/>The period in which a project can generate offset credits varies depending on the nature of the project, and unless otherwise set out in the applicable protocol, is: <br/> 30 years for a forestry-related sequestration project; <br/> 20 years for a non forestry-related sequestration project; and <br/> 10 years for all other projects. <br/><br/>If a project was previously registered in provincial offset system and transitions into the federal offset system, the duration over which the project was registered in the provincial system will be deducted from the crediting period in the federal offset system. Project crediting periods can be renewed as follows: <br/> up to 70 more years for forestry-related sequestration projects (i.e., no more than 100 years including all renewals); and <br/> all other projects can be renewed no more than two more times based upon their initial offset credit periods (i.e., up to 40 more years for non forestry-related sequestration projects and up to 20 more years for all other projects). <br/><br/>E. Compendium of Federal Protocols  <br/>Project proponents can only generate offsets pursuant to approved offset credit protocols set out in the Compendium of Federal Offset Protocols (Compendium). In March of 2021, when Canada released the draft regulation, it stated it was prioritizing the following four protocols for development: (i) advanced refrigeration systems; (ii) landfill methane management; (iii) improved forest management; and (iv) enhanced soil organic carbon. In concert with the release of the Regulations, Canada has added a fifth protocol priority: livestock feed management. Furthermore, it finalized and issued the Federal Offset Protocol for Landfill Methane Recovery and Destruction[4], which is currently the only recognized protocol in the Compendium. <br/>CONCLUSION <br/>Notwithstanding the Regulations are now in force, unless and until more protocols are developed and recognized as part of the Compendium, they has limited application. The only recognized protocol under which offset credits can be currently generated is the Landfill Methane Recovery and Destruction[4] protocol. <br/>We will continue to monitor developments with respect to the generation and measurement of offsets from biological sequestration projects and more particularly whether those projects truly represent emission reductions beyond business as usual. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2022/2022-06-08/html/sor-dors111-eng.html\">https://gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2022/2022-06-08/html/sor-dors111-eng.html</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.blakes.com/insights/bulletins/2018/federal-carbon-pricing-system-coming-into-force-ja\">https://www.blakes.com/insights/bulletins/2018/federal-carbon-pricing-system-coming-into-force-ja</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.blakes.com/insights/bulletins/2021/canada-issues-proposed-federal-greenhouse-gas-(ghg\">https://www.blakes.com/insights/bulletins/2021/canada-issues-proposed-federal-greenhouse-gas-(ghg</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2022/eccc/En4-461-2022-eng.pdf\">https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2022/eccc/En4-461-2022-eng.pdf</url></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

The crew was selling bigleaf maples to a mill in Tumwater, using forged permits, prosecutors said. Logging is banned in the forest, a vast wilderness encompassing nearly a million acres. <br/>The timber poachers sprayed insecticide and most likely gasoline on the nest, and burned it, the authorities said. But they were unable to douse the fire with water bottles, so they fled, prosecutors said. <br/>The fire spread out from the forest's Elk Lake area, near Hood Canal, burning 3,300 acres and costing about $4.2 million to contain, prosecutors said. It came to be known as the Maple Fire. <br/><br/> Nice guys! But it's the forest so how can they be caught?  <br/><br/>On Monday, the leader of the illegal operation, Justin Andrew Wilke, 39, was sentenced to 20 months in federal prison, prosecutors said. In July, a jury had convicted Mr. Wilke of conspiracy, theft of public property and trafficking in illegally harvested timber, among other charges, according to a statement[2] from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington. <br/>Notably, the jury did not convict him on charges related to the fire, even though prosecutors had argued that he was directly involved. Had it not been for a relatively new technique that used tree DNA as evidence, Mr. Wilke might not have been convicted on the other charges. <br/>Prosecutors said this was the first time that such evidence had been used in a federal criminal trial, although it has been used in state cases and in federal cases that did not reach trial. Researchers hope this will deter future poaching, particularly of bigleaf maples, for which there is now a large database. <br/><br/>Say what now?  <br/><br/>In this case, researchers built a DNA database specifically for the Olympic National Forest[3], sampling 230 trees and coming up with an estimate that the probability of a coincidental match was one in one undecillion \u2014 or one followed by 36 zeros, Dr. Cronn said. <br/>One limitation to a more widespread use of this technique in criminal prosecutions, Dr. Cronn said, is that databases must be created for individual tree species. This can be costly and time-consuming, he said, but he added that advances in genomics technology have made doing so easier. <br/>'If you think about a human forensic database, you're only making it for one species,' he said. 'The trees that are targeted for timber theft across the U.S. are really different. We have maple in the Pacific Northwest, walnut in the eastern U.S. We would need a database for each of the species, so that is a bit of a barrier.' <br/>Dr. Cronn said the use of tree DNA in this case would be a deterrent to similar theft. <br/>He said researchers had created a bigleaf maple database of more than 1,100 tree samples, covering a region 'basically from the U.S.-Mexico border all the way up to Vancouver Island and Canada.' <br/>'Any time trees are taken in that range can now be investigated,' Dr. Cronn said. 'We will be ready at the next trial.' <br/><br/>Wow. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/10/us/justin-wilke-maple-fire-tree-dna-sentenced.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/10/us/justin-wilke-maple-fire-tree-dna-sentenced.html</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/pr/leader-tree-poaching-ring-started-massive-olympic-peninsula-forest-fire-sentenced-20\">https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/pr/leader-tree-poaching-ring-started-massive-olympic-peninsula-forest-fire-sentenced-20</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/olympic\">https://www.fs.usda.gov/olympic</url></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Times[1];Cartogram: Kavya Beheraj/Axios The U.S. and COVID-19 are settling into a long, but hopefully manageable future together. <br/>The big picture: The worst of the pandemic is likely behind us, but the virus is here to stay. </p><p>We're entering a new phase \u2014 one in which the country's overall experience with this virus will be less like having a heart attack, and more like managing a lifelong chronic condition. Experts have been saying for a long time that there's almost no chance COVID-19 would disappear. Rather, they've been expecting it to become endemic \u2014 meaning it will stick around, possibly forever, but at more predictable, manageable levels.That transition appears to be happening right now. By the numbers: The U.S. is averaging about 74,000 new infections per day. That is, unfortunately, a 4% increase over the past two weeks. The CDC defines a 'low' rate of COVID transmission, measured at the county level, as an average of fewer than 10 new cases per 100,000 people per day.If you applied the same rubric to states, only four would qualify as having a low rate of transmission. In most of the country \u2014 nearly 40 states \u2014 the average infection rates are between 10 and 50 new cases per day per 100,000 people. Experts disagree about what is or isn't 'over.' Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has said over the past week[2] that 'we're close to the end of the pandemic phase of this virus.' Even if cases increase this winter, he said, the number of vaccinated Americans, plus the fact that infected people will soon have access to two highly effective treatments, will prevent another cascade of death and suffering.The other side: 'One too many smart people has told me or said on TV this week that the pandemic is over,' Andy Slavitt, a former Biden adviser on COVID, said on Twitter[3]. Reality check: Both sides have a point. The end of the pandemic phase isn't going to mean the end of COVID. There will still be rising and falling waves of infection. They'll probably be worse during colder weather, because people spend more time indoors, and in areas where vaccination rates are low. But they likely won't be as big, or as deadly, as last winter or this summer.Breakthrough infections will continue to occur, but only a small portion of those cases will be severe. A lot of that basic framework is already here. Vermont, for example \u2014 the most vaccinated state in the U.S. \u2014 has seen a significant spike in cases. It's now averaging just over 50 cases per capita per day. But its hospitals have not seen a rash of new COVID patients.In the Mountain West, on the other hand, vaccination rates are lower, cases are consistently among the highest in the country, and more of those patients are in the hospital. Between the lines: About 58% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated. Mandates and vaccines for kids may help nudge that number up, but it's otherwise not moving. The vaccination rate increased by less than 1 percentage point last week, according to the CDC. Nationally, we're a long way from the 70% or higher that experts had hoped to see.Millions more Americans have some immunity because they had COVID, but experts say the protection from a vaccine is more durable.\"There is more than enough human wood for this coronavirus forest fire to burn,\" the University of Minnesota's Michael Osterholm told NPR. He estimates that 70 million Americans are at risk from the virus. The bottom line: As long as no new variant emerges \u2014 which is a big \"if,\" but there doesn't seem to be one heading for us right now \u2014 we have a pretty good idea of where we're headed, and that overall landscape isn't likely to change too dramatically. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/gottlieb-pandemic-end-close-56a7ef11-6030-4404-9c26-5ff0b892e6d2.html\">https://www.axios.com/gottlieb-pandemic-end-close-56a7ef11-6030-4404-9c26-5ff0b892e6d2.html</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/ASlavitt/status/1458304302682763267\">https://twitter.com/ASlavitt/status/1458304302682763267</url></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Kuehn says the intent of the drilling project is \"to help solve a major scientific puzzle which has implications for future environmental conditions and availability of water supplies.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Along with his work in convening the workshop, Kuehn is also part of a core group of nine individuals who co-authored a grant proposal for the event that was submitted to the International Continental Drilling Program (ICDP) in January of 2019. The group submitted a revised $62,500 grant proposal one year later. Funding received through this grant is being used to run the upcoming workshop.</p><p>As part of the ICDP Workshop on Scientific Drilling: PlioWest: Drilling Pliocene Lakes in Western North America, three plenary scientific presentations and multiple working groups will be held virtually between Aug. 26 and Sept. 26, 2021. In addition to the initial science team, other U.S. and international researchers have applied to participate in the workshop. Originally planned as an in-person meeting in 2020, the workshop is now being held virtually due to COVID-related travel restrictions.</p><p>Kuehn says that the upcoming workshop has three main purposes: (a) work out in more detail the scientific plans and objectives, (b) identify and put together the final science team, and (c) begin the process of putting together a full scientific drilling and coring proposal.</p><p>The international, multidisciplinary research group aims to obtain core samples from lake deposits in California, Oregon, Idaho and possibly sites in Mexico and Canada for a time in Earth history about 3 million years ago called the Pliocene. Kuehn says these core samples will be studied to produce well-dated histories of environmental, climate, and ecological conditions.</p><p>Kuehn is especially familiar with one of the areas being considered for drilling, Summer Lake in Oregon. He and Concord students have made multiple expeditions over the past dozen years to study the area's lake history, volcanic ash layers, and earthquake faults. This collaborative student-faculty research is why Summer Lake is among the sites being considered for drilling.</p><p>He explains why studying samples from this bygone time are significant today.</p><p>\"The western U.S. and Canada have been having major problems with droughts, heat waves, and fires. Recurring droughts and record-setting forest fire seasons have been going on for years,\" he says. \"This year many hundreds of people died from the heat, agricultural economies are being hit hard by the drought, towns and cities have water shortages, and many people have lost homes due to the fires. All the wildfire smoke also causes air pollution problems that can cause serious health issues. On the east coast, we've been seeing hazy and sometimes brownish skies from all of the smoke blowing over.\"</p><p>\"These kinds of problems are projected to get worse as carbon dioxide levels keep going up and the west keeps getting warmer and drier,\" he says.</p><p>\"However, during the Pliocene, which was the last time in Earth history when carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere were at levels that we are expected to reach this century, there were actually big lakes in places that are mostly desert today. This contrasts starkly with current trends,\" Kuehn points out, noting that this observation leads to some important questions.</p><p>\"Why was there so much more water around in the Pliocene, and what does this have to say about the future of water supplies in North America? Will places keep getting drier as the past several decades seem to indicate, or will we cross some climate threshold beyond which things actually start getting wetter instead?</p><p>\"Right now, we really don't know,\" he admits.</p><p>Kuehn stresses that trying to understand this, however, is important, and that the need for this knowledge extends to residents of \"The Mountain State\" too.</p><p>\"What actually happens has huge implications, even for people in West Virginia who eat a lot of fruits, vegetables, nuts, berries, etc. that are grown in those drought-stricken areas out west,\" he says.</p><p>To learn more about Concord University's Environmental Geoscience Program, please visit <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.concord.edu\">https://www.concord.edu</url>, then click on Academics, followed by College of Science, Mathematics, and Health.

information was released by the Government of Canada:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Greeting</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good morning, everyone.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thank you for joining us today in Montreal's borough of Pierrefonds-Roxboro, which is on the traditional territory of the Kanien'keh :ka, part of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm pleased to be here with the Mayor of Pierrefonds-Roxboro, Dimitrios (Jim) Beis; and Sameer Zuberi, Member of Parliament for PierrefondsDollard, for this important announcement.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And let me extend a warm, virtual welcome to the over one thousand participants of the National Adaptation Strategy Symposium who are joining us today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Introduction</p><p>It's my honour to kick off the Symposium and make an important announcement on a subject that is preoccupying every level of government and every community in Canada: preparing for the impacts of climate change.</p><p>[Pause]</p><p>We have to look at climate action in this twenty-first century as a matter of both offence and defence.</p><p>As many of you may know, I've spent decades fighting to raise awareness and stop the pollution that causes climate change.</p><p>And so today, as we increase our preparations for the many impacts of our changing climate, it feels like we're fighting a war on two fronts.</p><p>We canand mustdo both:</p><p>We must reduce carbon pollution, and we must prepare for the impacts of climate change.</p><p>And it's going to take a big, coordinated Team Canada effort.</p><p>Today, I'm speaking to you from the banks of Rivi re des Prairies, where incidents of flooding are occurring more and more frequently because of climate change.</p><p>To give you an example of an adaptation to climate change, just upriver is Cap-Saint-Jacques nature park, where an ambitious natural infrastructure project is being carried out.</p><p>Thanks to a partnership between federal, provincial, and municipal governments, this new infrastructure will both protect rare wetlands and help create a natural buffer zone to protect the communities downstream to better withstand spring floods.</p><p>Back in 2019, our government committed $50 million to this project through the Disaster Mitigation and Adaptation Fund.</p><p>Our government is making record new investments under the Disaster Mitigation and Adaptation Fund, to the tune of $3.4 billion nationwide, effectively tripling spending in previous years, because these disasters are becoming more frequent with climate change.</p><p>To date, eleven projects in Quebec alone have been approved for funding under this program.</p><p>Our Disaster Mitigation and Adaptation Fund is supporting projects from Taber, Alberta, to the Cowichan Tribes in Duncan, BC; from Windsor, Ontario, to Windsor, Nova Scotia.</p><p>These projects are helping communities become more climate resilient by helping them prepare for and withstand the impacts of natural disasters.</p><p>Right now, with Manitoba once again threatened by spring flooding, we are reminded of the importance of forward-looking and cost-saving preparations to protect our communities and our economy.</p><p>But this is only one important example of a situation that clearly demonstrates the need for a climate change adaptation strategy.</p><p>Last Friday, the Minister of Emergency Preparedness, Bill Blair, announced a series of new measures for this year's forest fire season and for future seasons, supported by more than half a billion dollars in federal funding.</p><p>Preparing for climate change also means collecting and sharing the best data and climate knowledge . . .</p><p>. . . not just to forestall disasters like major floods and wildfires, but also to better manage the daily wear and tear of climate extremes.</p><p>For the City of Toronto, for example, adaptation means using climate data from the Canadian Centre for Climate Services to reassess its asphalt formula to better withstand extreme heat and temperature fluctuations.</p><p>The goal is to save money on road repairs, a massive municipal cost.</p><p>Or take the Hamlet of Arviat, in Nunavut, which is using data from the same federal centre to reassess its drainage needs for new flood protections to prevent damage, improve performance, and extend the lifespan of the storm drains.</p><p>Every smart city planner, every forward-looking business personeveryone who is thinking about the cost to generations to comeknows that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.</p><p>[Pause]</p><p>National Adaptation Strategy</p><p>Adaptation really is a global story of the survival of humankind across the ages.</p><p>With a rapidly changing climate, our government has been working urgently on the development of a new National Adaptation Strategy.</p><p>The National Adaptation Strategy represents a really important new direction for the country to go beyond climate change mitigation . . .</p><p>. . . and tacklein a comprehensive and strategic wayhow we make our communities safer and better prepared for the impacts of climate change.</p><p>The new Strategy will establish a shared vision and framework with clear targets and actions to drive new investments and initiatives . . .</p><p>. . . so that we build smarter, better use climate data, adjust our ways of doing business, harness nature, protect communities, and more.</p><p>No corner of Canada is untouched.</p><p>The costs of climate change are mounting in all parts of the country.</p><p>[Pause]</p><p>That's why today, I am pleased to announce that our government is launching public consultations on the National Adaptation Strategy, the big final step in making this strategy a reality.</p><p>We're kicking it off with a fantastic virtual conference.</p><p>We're also launching an interactive web portal where you can submit your ideas and comments.</p><p>We have launched a discussion paper that incorporates the feedback of many groups that have participated up until now.</p><p>Now, we want to hear from you!</p><p>We want to hear from communities and Canadians, from local environmental organizations and interested businesses.</p><p>Preparing for climate change takes many forms.</p><p>That may include something which seems quite simpleprotecting the nature that protects usso that a riverside park is designed to absorb heavier spring flooding.</p><p>It could include constructing better insulated homes and infrastructure.</p><p>Or better sharing of data on climate and weather systems with local public safety officials, city planners, and public utilities, which can then better prepare for every situation, from snow loads to wildfires.</p><p>Our National Adaptation Strategy will set targets, identify gaps, pinpoint needed areas for investment, and help make communities safer and better prepared to support a more stable and resilient economy.</p><p>We will launch our strategy this fall, and we need input from as many Canadians as possible on priorities for action.</p><p>The National Adaptation Strategy should work hand-in-hand with climate change mitigation to make our communities safer and better prepared for the impacts of climate change.</p><p>We're looking for a shared vision and framework with clear targets and actionsimmediately, in the mid-term, and in the longer term.</p><p>Provincial governments, municipalities, Indigenous Peoples, the business communitywe all have a stake in building a more climate-resilient Canada.</p><p>That's why it's so important today to get these public consultations underway.</p><p>Moving Forward</p><p>Canada is not alone in thinking ahead to prepare for climate change.</p><p>Today, I'm very honoured to say that Canada will host Adaptation Futuresthe largest international conference on climate adaptationin Montreal in the fall of 2023.</p><p>And I am pleased to announce that our government is supporting the conference with a contribution of $650,000 to help Quebec's climate group, Ouranos, bring together policy-makers, scientists, and practitioners from across the globe to exchange best practices on adaptation.</p><p>Together, we're going to ensure Canadians are leading the way not just in preventing climate change but also in protecting ourselves from its effects.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>This national consultation will make sure we leave no stone unturned, no climate impact ignored, no community bypassed, and no fresh idea unexplored.</p><p>If you have views on how we can best adapt to climate change, we want to hear from you.</p><p>Now is the time to work together to build a more climate-resilient Canada.</p><p>Thank you.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Severson, forest fire management officer with Hoosier National Forest, has been selected to join Southeastern Illinois College's Distinguished Alumni roster for 2021. The SIC alumnus will deliver the keynote speech at SIC's commencement exercises May 8, which will be livestreamed on SIC's YouTube Channel at 10 a.m. for baccalaureate Associate of Arts and Associate of Science degrees and 1 p.m. for Nursing, Career &amp;amp; Technical Education, Associate of Applied Science degrees, and certificates. The distinguished alumnus graduated from Chicago's Roosevelt High School in Chicago in 1979. Following the commencement of his secondary education, Severson worked as a forklift operator for a lumberyard, managed a shipping dock and then made custom paintings for a Rust-Oleum factory in Chicago. It was in Chicago that he first learned of SIC. </p><p>He explains, \" ... I was reading the Chicago Sun-Times newspaper and they had all the colleges and universities listed in the state.\" A small ad for the Southeastern Illinois College Forestry Technician Program caught his eye. \"Sold everything I had and moved to Equality, Illinois.\" Severson's time at SIC has left him with many special memories. \" ... Meeting new friends, seeing very cool places like Garden of the Gods, Forestry Club Hog Roast, (and) competing at conclave events,\" he reminisces. Severson graduated from SIC in 1984 with an Associate of Applied Science in Forestry. \"From there I went to the Peace Corps in Kenya East Africa, worked on the Tongass National Forest in Alaska, worked on hurricanes, wildfires, and oil spills in various leadership positions,\" he explains. Severson spent 27 months of service in the Peace Corps. He traveled for a time after the Peace Corps, then started coursework toward his eventual completion of a Bachelor of Science in Natural Resource Management from Southern Illinois University Carbondale in 1989. The graduate's career then took him to work in multiple states: Alaska, Missouri, Wisconsin, Florida, North Carolina, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and, now Indiana. Severson has worked in fire and land management for the last 30 years. In that time, he has worked for the National Park Service, Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge in Iowa, The Nature Conservancy (North Carolina Sandhills Program and the Northwest Florida Program), and for the Missouri Department of Conservation in Salem, Missouri. He has worked in all facets of fire management, land stewardship/management and resource forestry. Since 2009, Severson has served the Prescribed Fire Training Center of Tallahassee, Florida, as field coordinator. Recognized as a subject-matter expert, he has also served with the Forest Service International Programs as the Chief of Party on three fire management missions to the Democratic Republic of Congo to teach about prescribed fire management. The DRC team was awarded the Chief's Award in 2016 for Applying Knowledge Globally. Severson has also answered the call of service in times of national crisis. Hurricane Katrina's landfall in 2005 and the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill of 2010 both devastated the United States' Gulf of Mexico region. Severson served on all hazard assignments for both disasters. Severson resides in Tell City, Indiana, with his wife Trina and their two daughters. He along with other members of the Hoosier fire program handle roughly 5,000 acres a year. \"This small college in the middle of cornfields set the foundation for the rest of my career,\" Severson said. \"This all began at SIC. \"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>COURTESY OF SIC Terry Severson braved the flames while fighting an Alabama wildfire.photos COURTESY OF SIC Terry L.

Upwards of 45,000 wildfires scorched 5.8 million acres across the United States this year, causing places such as Reno, Nevada to experience the worst air quality on record. Hurricane Ida was one of strongest storms to make landfall in the United States, triggering record hourly rainfall in Manhattan and New York City's first ever flash flood warning.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An estimated 1 billion sea creatures were cooked to death off the coast of the Pacific Northwest following the heat wave. Last year, California wildfires emitted more carbon dioxide than the entire state's power grid. Hurricane Ida disrupted crude oil production in the Gulf resulting in more than 1,500 reports of oil leaks.\u00a0</p><p>Although scientists agree some devastating impacts of global warming are already irreversible, they also agree we must mitigate their severity by quickly and drastically reducing carbon emissions. Yet,\u00a0 Indiana emits the most toxic pollution per square mile in the United States, according to a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency report.\u00a0</p><p>Instead of adopting the sense of urgency our dying planet warrants, Indiana remains dependent on fossil fuels as the eighth largest greenhouse gas-emitting state in the nation. Indiana has an obligation to its residents, country and the rest of humankind to spearhead the shift toward clean energy.\u00a0</p><p>Coal accounts for 53% of Indiana's energy generation. Although Indiana has cut its electricity-related coal consumption by almost half since 2010, most of the reduction was offset by increased natural gas consumption.\u00a0</p><p>Human activity, such as burning fossil fuels, has increased the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration by 48% since the Industrial Revolution. Carbon dioxide works alongside other greenhouse gasses to trap heat in the atmosphere creating a greenhouse effect according to Melissa Denchak of the Natural Resources Defense Council. While the greenhouse effect is natural, emissions have thrown the natural process off balance causing a rapid rise in greenhouse gases and subsequently temperature, Denchak said.\u00a0</p><p>Scientists concluded human-driven climate change created the Northwest heat wave, doubled the Western U.S. forest fire area and increased the likelihood and intensity of major hurricanes like Ida.\u00a0</p><p>The use of fossil fuels also creates more localized consequences for Indiana.\u00a0</p><p>Coal ash is the residue left behind from burning coal and it typically contains harmful chemicals such as arsenic, lead and mercury. Much of the coal ash in Indiana is stored in open-air ash ponds, or surface impoundments. A study by the Hoosier Environmental Council revealed 14 of Indiana's 15 monitored coal ash sites \"have contaminated the groundwater rendering it unfit for use as drinking water.\" Indiana has the most ash ponds of any state.\u00a0</p><p>Burning fossil fuels also releases toxins that are detrimental to human health.\u00a0</p><p>The number of Americans who die from illnesses caused by air pollution is roughly equal to the number of people killed in car crashes in the U.S. every year, according to a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Researchers from Harvard believe that number is even higher, estimating pollution from fossil fuel emissions caused 18% of deaths in the world in 2018. These findings are particularly worrisome because Indiana ranks first in the nation for toxic pollution per square mile.\u00a0</p><p>Renewable energy investments are critical to lessen Indiana's dependence on fossil fuels that destroy environmental and human health. Nevertheless, a third of Indiana's counties severely restrict or ban wind and solar energy projects. Coupled with statewide misinformation campaigns by interest groups, clean energy companies find it increasingly difficult to obtain permits for projects in Indiana.\u00a0</p><p>Experts are calling on the United States and all other countries in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development to end coal use in the next eight years. Before Indiana can completely phase out coal and other fossil fuels, the state needs to expand investment in clean energy initiatives. Investing now will minimize job loss when Indiana fully transitions to clean energy and ensure the state has the appropriate infrastructure to support a clean energy grid.\u00a0</p><p>Indiana lawmakers must take initiative and invest in renewable energy immediately if they want an inhabitable state to govern.</p><p>Katelyn Balakir (she/her) is a senior studying policy analysis and political science.
