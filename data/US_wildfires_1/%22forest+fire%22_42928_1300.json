I don't sing to my kids either, not even on their birthdays.\" That's what Chris Breggin (from Denver, Colorado) told my colleague Francisco G\u00e1miz after I contacted him on Reddit. It's not that Chris doesn't like to have fun. In fact, he really liked 'Weird Al' Yankovic. But not for his songs, but for the humorous component of his skits. As a kid, he didn't feel any different. It was after he graduated that he began to understand that he didn't understand music the way others did. In fact, he didn't like it.</p><p><br/>         Javier, a 31-year-old from Madrid, feels that there is a social pressure for your musical tastes to define you as a person. What if you don't have musical tastes? That's why Michelle Palin, a 29-year-old Australian, hated and dreaded the typical question, \"What kind of music do you listen to?\". So one day she typed into Google \"I don't enjoy music\" and the term music anhedonia popped up for her.<br/>         I didn't know the concept either until I came across <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a study from the University of Barcelona</emphasis> according to which 3% of people don't like listening to songs, they are insensitive to them and they don't make them feel any kind of pleasure. I asked in my social networks and there were some people who identified with that kind of reaction. According to researchers, it is due to a disconnection between brain regions; that is anhedonia.<br/>         Music has a very powerful impact on people, and so perhaps there is an overexposure to it that is strange to those who may suffer from anhedonia. Chris wonders, in that sense, if the constant presence in stores, museums, restaurants and many outdoor spaces means that \"people don't like their thoughts\" or that \"the noise helps them\" in some way.<br/>         Another place where music is artificially inserted, based on convention, is in movies. The language of film has been built on the incidental use of music to tell a story. There is a Peter Jackson way of using music: in virtually every scene. At the opposite extreme would be the so-called \"vow of chastity\" of directors who made films under the rules of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dogma 95</emphasis>, in which it was forbidden for music to be incorporated later in the recording. And, between one thing and the other, cases like <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Cronenberg</emphasis>'s, who does not allow the music (usually also by the great Howard Shore, as in Jackson's films) to play at the same time as his characters speak.<br/>         Asked about this, Chris said he doesn't understand why it seems to filmmakers that music \"enhances the experience\" \"it's taken for granted that any music, even uncontrolled, is better than silence, but I'll never understand why,\" he says. Even if this is not your case, the experience and the testimonies of these 3%, which <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">you can read in this report</emphasis>, serve to reflect on how we do not all understand the same thing with artistic messages.     <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Three books</emphasis><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'Hermano fuego' by Ra\u00fal Vicente (Pepitas de Calabaza and Los Aciertos). </emphasis>In these weeks of intense pain due to the human, animal, natural and patrimonial loss caused by the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">flames</emphasis>, we have been thinking a lot about the forest firefighters. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Some of them are on strike</emphasis> -those in Madrid- to demand improvements in their working conditions (they suspended their strike to work in firefighting). So far this summer, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">seven firefighters</emphasis> have died in Spain and Portugal working on fires. What do they talk to each other? What do they feel when they go to the fire? How do they feel when they return home?<br/>         The publishing house Pepitas de Calabaza has published three books on this subject, so it may be a good time to read or reread them. Zaragozan firefighter Ra\u00fal Vicente wrote in Hermano fuego (2022) \"mishaps, joys and sorrows of a forest firefighter\". Franca Velasco, journalist of El Plural in Castilla y Le\u00f3n, writes in her journalistic essay Viaje a las mujeres de fuego (2024) about eleven women who fight every summer against flames, prejudices and stereotypes. Rounding out the trio is a historical episode recounted by Norman McLean in The Burning Mountain (2021), when a crew of fifteen elite paratrooper firefighters dropped on a forest fire in the United States in 1949. Two hours later, all but three were dead or fatally burned.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'Matar al papito' by Oriol Rosell (Libros C\u00fapula). </emphasis>I have been following Oriol Rosell all my life: he is a reference in the musical criticism of the most extreme sounds, besides being an excellent person to talk and illuminate culture, politics, life in general, from other perspectives. And with humor (that kind of killer humor that not everyone likes, but I do). Nando Cruz interviewed him with his previous book, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a treatise on noise</emphasis>. He has a new book, with the acerbic subtitle \"Por qu\u00e9 no te gusta el reguet\u00f3n (ya tus hijos, s\u00ed)\" (Why you don't like reggaeton (and your children do). It was time for someone to answer that question. Francisco G\u00e1miz has talked to him <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">in this new interview</emphasis> in which he discusses the evident general polarization regarding urban music, with a background that is not musical but socio-cultural.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> A m\u00ed, se\u00f1oras m\u00edas, me parece' by Florence Delay (Acantilado). </emphasis>This book is not a publishing novel but I recommend it in the wake of its author's death this summer. Florence Delay, professor of Spanish Literature at the Sorbonne, novelist, critic, translator and playwright, passed away last July 1 at the age of 84. This 2016 book is composed of 31 stories that stroll through the rooms of the palace of Fontainebleau, the only castle-like palace in which all French monarchs have lived from the 12th to the 19th century and the most lavishly decorated French royal castle. For lovers of palaces and chateaux (as is my case) this book is a delight that brings to life the ladies who adorn the walls or the ghosts of those who lived there.     <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Three songs, by Francisco G\u00e1miz</emphasis><br/>         These are my musical recommendations for the week. Remember that <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">you can listen to them in our playlist </emphasis>on Spotify, where you can also find those of previous weeks.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'Vodka Cranberry' by Conan Gray. </emphasis>After a weaker work with Found Heaven, the American artist releases his new studio album, Wishbone, where he recovers the magic that characterized his sound in Kid Krow (2020) and Superache (2022). In this song, the singer captures the feeling of being reunited with his ex, a boy he had not seen for a long time. The nostalgia of the track is also perceived in the beautiful music videos that Conan Gray is releasing for some of the tracks on the album, which follow the same romance. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Listen to it on Spotify</emphasis>.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'Hey Hi Hello' by Alison Goldfrapp.</emphasis> The English singer surrenders to the most eighties synth-pop in her solo stage. The artist, recognized by the indie pop duo Goldfrapp, formed by herself and Will Gregory, has just released her album Flux. Composed of ten songs, the composer tries to go back to where she was when she started with the opening track, Hey Hi Hello. That confession is, in fact, the beginning of the song. \"I never wanted to let you go,\" sings Alison Goldfrapp, who in a marching tone greets the listener and welcomes what's to come. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Listen to it on Spotify</emphasis>.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'Traveling On' by Rae Isla.</emphasis> The American singer-songwriter, still an unknown in the music scene, seeks to break through with melodies as beautiful as those of her latest single. Letting herself be lifted by melancholy, Isla explores self-discovery and the doubts that are always present in people's day-to-day lives. \"I don't know where I belong, but I'll keep traveling,\" sings the artist towards the end of the song, a statement that is repeated in a beautiful outro. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Listen to it on Spotify</emphasis>.     <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Three films, by Javier Zurro</emphasis><br/>         Hello! After a few weeks of absence due to the vacations, I'm back with my movie recommendations for this weekend.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Grab it as you can'.</emphasis> My date in theaters this weekend is with Liam Neeson and this late sequel to a classic spoof comedy. Neeson plays the son of the legendary Liam Neeson (not a spoiler, he's in the trailer) and critics say it's the funniest comedy in years. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Even our own Alberto Corona liked it</emphasis>, so I have no doubt that if you want to laugh you have to go see it. I wish the movies that parodied genres and other titles would come back, because seeing the level of many current comedies it is missed.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'The Return of Ulysses'.</emphasis> For fans of the Odyssey - which is a year ahead of Nolan's blockbuster - and for fans of Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche (who are back together on screen almost 30 years after The English Patient) this is the movie for this weekend. They bring Ulysses and Penelope to life in a look at the last part of Homer's text and reflect on the wounds of war, linking the film to the present.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'The Community'.</emphasis> It is the 25th anniversary of one of \u00c1lex de la Iglesia's best films, and to celebrate it, this black comedy returns to theaters with an outstanding Carmen Maura who confronts her community of neighbors for a betting pool with a full 15. A group that includes Terele P\u00e1vez and Emilio Guti\u00e9rrez Caba, terrifying and magnificent. Mordacious, frenetic, sharp? A gem.     <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Three plans for the weekend, by Francisco G\u00e1miz</emphasis><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Canela Party (Torremolinos, M\u00e1laga).</emphasis> Independent music is celebrating this weekend in Torremolinos, as the Canela Party festival will be full of songs with a very familiar atmosphere. Saturday, in addition, will be the big day of costumes, something characteristic of the festival. Biznaga, Diiv or Shego are part of the concert program, for which tickets are still available. The edition will offer a wide variety of groups and artists, both known and future promises.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Festa Major de Sants (Barcelona)</emphasis>. If you like to take advantage of the summer to go sightseeing, the best time to visit the neighborhood of Sants will be this weekend and the next. The festivities of Sants host a lot of cultural activities, but one of its great attractions are its decorated streets. In total, up to eleven streets and squares will compete for the title of the best decoration, so strolling through its corners promises to be a very enjoyable experience, turning the neighborhood into a beautiful museum of ephemeral art in the open air.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Veranos de la Villa (Madrid).</emphasis> This weekend will be the last opportunity toenjoy the Veranos de la Villa in the open-air Auditorium Pilar Garc\u00eda Pe\u00f1a in the Pinar del Rey Park, whose tickets cost five euros. The event that closes this year's edition pays tribute to the Cuban singer Celia Vive on the centenary of her birth, through a concert in which international artists will revisit the discography of the \"Queen of Salsa\", performing the greatest hits of her career.      <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Three exhibitions, by Francisco G\u00e1miz</emphasis><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Acopia' (Santander).</emphasis> Photographer and visual artist Luc\u00eda Gorostegui presents at the Juan Sili\u00f3 Santander Gallery a set of unpublished works that try to build, from matter, a language of their own from which to interrogate the present. The project dialogues with the author's previous research on perception, archive and memory, and its epicenter is Mallorca, where Gorostegui is currently based. It will be on view until October 10.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Dora Maar: photography and drawings' (Madrid).</emphasis> The Museo L\u00e1zaro Galdiano hosts an exhibition that highlights the key aspects of the multidisciplinary work of Dora Maar, a pioneering photographer of the 20th century. This exhibition includes photographs of Barcelona's urban scenes of a markedly social nature, portraits of friends and an unpublished archive of drawings. Admission is free, with more than 80 works distributed in the main hall and the Pardo Baz\u00e1n room, and curated by Mar\u00eda Mill\u00e1n.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'Pluma Roja, de Garc\u00eda Lorca a Pedro Zerolo' (Madrid).</emphasis> Another exhibition to go and see for free this weekend is this very interesting show that covers a century of sexual dissidence from Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca to Pedro Zerolo. The Arkh\u00e9 Archive and the Pedro Zerolo Foundation organize this exhibition, which covers the Spanish LGBT memory coinciding with two key dates: the twentieth anniversary of the approval of equal marriage and the tenth anniversary of the death of Pedro Zerolo. It gathers \"a hundred works of art, photographs, historical documents, publications and objects that trace a continuous line of activism, culture and LGTBI+ memory from the beginning of the 20th century until 2015\".     <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Three articles in case you missed them this week</emphasis><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How much does record manufacturing pollute? </emphasis>Hans Laguna delves, after reading Kyle Devine, into the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ecological impact of the music industry</emphasis>. Vinyl used to be made from petroleum derivatives. What about streaming?<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Walk to Alejandra Pizarnik. </emphasis>The influential Argentine writer arouses literary passion, encourages writing and sometimes stirs desire.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Luna Miguel edits a selection of</emphasis> little-known<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> prose</emphasis>.<br/>We send you the Culture newsletter every Friday if you subscribe for free at this link.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A summer of splashers. </emphasis>Are you afraid of sharks? Without a doubt, the movies are to blame. This month there have been two, no less. But there are so many that <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a binge of them</emphasis> could put an end to your atavistic fears.<br/>Authors<br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>                     Elena Cabrera - @elenac       </p></bodyText></listItem></list></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-72288470</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GJS-G0W3-RRVG-82FT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2183\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 22, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519290 WEB SEARCH PORTALS AND ALL OTHER INFORMATION SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Cultura</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001477</classCode><className>RESEARCH REPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX000204</classCode><className>BRAIN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000DJLY</classCode><className>SOCIAL NETWORKING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>N712110MM</classCode><className>MUSEUMS &amp;

This disaster prompted significant international and regional solidarity regarding responses to future calamities. It reignited the challenging political negotiations at the International Law Commission's office concerning the importance of <url normalizedValue=\"https://legal.un.org/ilc/guide/6_3.shtml#mandate\">the Draft Articles on the Protection of Persons in the Event of Disasters as an international treaty. The 2004 tsunami also spurred the idea of implementing a tsunami early warning system in vulnerable areas, which has since become more of a technocratic issue than an issue of human protection. The way we perceive a calamity influences our response to it and, most importantly, how international law views such events, as it seeks an authority to mobilise a multilateral humanitarian response. Focusing on past disaster events in Indonesia and how the government reacted to them, this article demonstrates the limit of the #8216;universally#8217; accepted definition of disaster that may hinder the effort of disaster prevention. </url></p><p>The Unnaturalness of the #8216;Natural#8217; Disaster</p><p>Many of us quickly categorize earthquakes and tsunamis as #8216;natural#8217; disasters. In comparison to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://wri-indonesia.org/en/wawasan/data-terbaru-mengonfirmasi-kebakaran-hutan-semakin-memburuk\">annual forest fires, people swiftly engage in the blame game regarding responsibility. The COVID-19 pandemic serves as a recent and clear illustration of why separating natural and human-made causes is unproductive when assessing whether an event qualifies as a disaster. Throughout the pandemic, various conspiracy theories arose to (un)justify its natural origins.

Consequently, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.undrr.org/terminology/disaster#:~:text=Sendai%20Framework%20Terminology%20on%20Disaster,and%20immediately%20after%20the%20disaster.\">describing disaster merely as a significant event that #8216;disrupts the functioning of a community or society#8217; is somewhat misleading. This current definition is rooted in a particular epistemology that UUPB has uncritically accepted, thereby allowing systemic injustices to persist. The prevailing notion suggests that disasters should be managed in a way that prevents disruption to this injustice, thereby enabling business as usual. In a sense, disaster management, as it's understood today, </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://academic.oup.com/book/38772\">focuses on maintaining injustices during disasters rather than addressing them.</url></p><p>Disruption of the Functioning of a Community or a Society</p><p>A community or society may operate within a culture of normalised injustice and impunity, but this does not necessarily indicate it is a just society. The functioning of society may have already been disrupted prior to the 2004 tsunami or the 2016 forest fire. For instance, the armed conflict between the Indonesian government and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.refworld.org/reference/countryrep/hrw/2001/en/21480\">GAM in Aceh, as well as the </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/09/22/indonesia-indigenous-peoples-losing-their-forests\">destruction of indigenous livelihoods and knowledge in Kalimantan, do not demonstrate that they have normal societal functioning before such disaster events. These calamitous occurrences highlight the socially catastrophic consequences of depoliticising disasters when we reduce the culture of impunity to a mere humanitarian issue. The complainants in those 13 industrial relations cases exposed </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://indonesiaatmelbourne.unimelb.edu.au/why-is-the-industrial-relations-court-failing-workers/\">the injustices within Indonesia's industrial relations system and the exploitation of workers prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Businesses are allowed to conceal their responsibilities under UUPB and find justification in the legal system. </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://law.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/3230378/MF19-Aceh-paper.pdf\">A peace deal was reached between the Indonesian government and GAM after the 2004 tsunami. The ongoing transboundary haze and forest fires indicate that we must view disasters as political consequences for those in power. </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/disaster-by-choice-9780198841357?cc=us&amp;lang=en\">There are disasters caused or permitted by those in power\u2014whether our government or the international community\u2014and there are disasters that must be prevented. Ultimately, it revolves around a single narrative: the (dis)allowance of #8216;disrupting the functioning of a community or a society.#8217; </url></p><p>UUPB stands out as one of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rcrc-resilience-southeastasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2015-IFRC-Disaster-Law-in-Southeast-Asia-Summary-of-Progress.pdf\">ASEAN's most extensive disaster management laws. Enacted in response to the Aceh tsunami, it includes vital provisions for disaster risk reduction, such as early warning systems, emergency response planning, and resilience-building initiatives to mitigate the effects of both natural and human-induced hazards. Nevertheless, UUPB is also among the most challenging laws to apply, carrying numerous implementation issues. </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hukumonline.com/berita/a/catatan-lbh-jakarta-terkait-kelemahan-ruu-penanggulangan-bencana-lt61b6f6291c557/\">The Community Legal Aid of Jakarta has pinpointed at least seven significant challenges related to UUPB. First, the government often attributes disaster events caused by natural hazards, such as flooding, primarily to natural causes. Second, there is a consistent passing of responsibility in disaster management responsibilities between the central and the regional governments. Both levels must improve coordination to ensure flood disaster management is more effective than deflecting accountability. Third, the River Management Strategic Agenda in big cities such as Jakarta is frequently misapplied, relying heavily on concrete constructions that can displace vulnerable communities. Fourth, there is a noticeable lack of dedication to prevention and recovery initiatives. Fifth, no assessment of development policies' impacts leads to misalignment with environmental capacities. Sixth, government interventions are mainly focused on technical elements, as they function primarily as reactive #8216;firefighters,#8217; limiting their efforts to emergency response. Finally, there is very little involvement from the community across various sectors.</url></p><p>It should be noted that the Indonesian government is inundated with disaster management responsibilities. However, the country's lack of resources, internal coordination, and finances hinders its ability to prepare for impending calamities. Even 20 years after the Indian Ocean tsunami, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/25/on-20th-anniversary-of-worlds-worst-tsunami-experts-warn-of-complacency\">Indonesia still lacks an effective early warning system for tsunamis despite an </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.undrr.org/implementing-sendai-framework/sendai-framework-action/early-warnings-for-all\">extensive international campaign to assist them in establishing one.</url></p><p>Disaster is Political </p><p>Viewing a disaster through a political lens encourages us to critically mitigate its risks to prevent future disasters, regardless of whether they will disrupt society's normal functioning, especially when international law has defined a disaster in political terms that need a political response. A society with a normalised culture of impunity sometimes requires disruption, but this is not how international disaster law currently interprets it. </p><p>Photo attribution: #8216;<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/turner-the-burning-of-rome-d36232\">The Burning of Rome#8217; by J.

Single-sector solutions are not sufficient to meet any clean air target. Public policy and investment need to optimize air quality actions across sectors, prioritizing those with the most cost-effective solutions, says the World Bank in a new report.</p><p>The report, Towards Clean Air in Nepal: Benefits, Pollution Sources, and Solutions, serves as a foundational assessment of air pollution in the country and the airshed of the Indo-Gangetic Plain and Himalayan Foothills (IGP-HF).</p><p>The Kathmandu Valley and the Terai are Nepal's air pollution hotspots, with no significant improvement over the past decade. Air pollution reduces life expectancy by 3.4 years for the average Nepali and causes approximately 26,000 premature deaths annually. In addition to health, air pollution impacts labor productivity, tourism, and the aviation sector. The economic cost of poor air quality is equivalent to more than 6 percent of Nepal's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) each year.</p><p>\"Clean air and economic growth are not in conflict. In fact, the cost of inaction on pollution is far greater than the cost of taking bold steps today,\" said Hon. Ain Bahadur Shahi Thakuri, Minister for Forests and Environment. \"From setting stricter industrial emission standards to promoting electric transport, the government is committed to cleaning Nepal's air.\"</p><p>The multi-sectoral and multi-regional nature of air pollution requires action on many fronts:</p><p>Vehicle Emissions: Continuing to electrify vehicle fleets, including cars, motorcycles, buses, and trucks is critical to address air pollution. This needs to be complemented by strengthening the vehicle inspection and maintenance system and reducing road dust.</p><p>Industrial Emissions: Support for cleaner technology and fuel adoption in industriesincluding electric and pellet boilers and furnaces in small and medium enterpriseswill help promote cleaner industries. Industrial facilities such as brick and cement factories also need to be supported to burn cleaner and more efficient fuels.</p><p>Household Cooking: Supporting households to adopt cleaner and, preferably, electric cookstoves is key to cutting household sources of air pollution. Biomass-fueled stoves create both indoor and ambient air pollution.</p><p>Forest fires: Forest fire prevention by reducing the fuel load and developing effective awareness programs is critical for reducing the likelihood of forest fires. Effective response systems to put out fires are also needed.</p><p>Transboundary pollution: Partnering effectively with neighboring countries is critical. Transboundary airflows carry pollutants across borders. The Indo-Gangetic Plain and Himalayan Foothills Region shares an airshed, meaning that pollutants can travel across borders, affecting air quality in multiple countries. Nepal's unique geographical location, particularly the bowl-shaped Kathmandu Valley surrounded by mountains, exacerbates the problem.</p><p>\"The World Bank is committed to helping Nepal strengthen its air quality improvement programs by leveraging financial and technical assistance and capacity-building support,\" said David Sislen, World Bank Country Division Director for Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. \"As a steadfast champion of clean air for better health and prosperity, the World Bank continues to tap into its extensive knowledge and experience from around the world to ensure that our efforts to support cleaner air in Nepal are impactful and sustainable.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1127190246</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G2H-WG53-RRMS-P4W3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"593\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 17, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This section provides an overview of selected issues raised in NEPA litigation that may be of interest to Congress.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Is a NEPA Review Required?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Is the Action Reviewable as a Final Major Federal Action?</p><p>NEPA applies if an agency's proposed activity is a major federal action./90 To qualify, the proposed action must be \"subject to substantial Federal control and responsibility\" and not subject to any statutory exceptions./91 For example, NEPA excludes actions with no or minimal federal funding and those with no or minimal federal involvement where the agency cannot control the outcome of the project./92</p><p>If an agency fails to initiate any environmental review for an action covered by NEPA, plaintiffs may challenge that in court, provided they can show the proposed action qualifies as a final agency action subject to the requirements of NEPA. For example, there may be questions about to what extent NEPA is triggered in discrete agency actions associated with a project implemented in multiple phases that require assorted federal approvals over the course of the project./93 In deciding whether any particular agency action for such a project requires NEPA review, courts may consider whether the agency action would irreversibly commit federal resources in furtherance of the proposed action as a standard to determine whether the agency activity is a qualifying action under NEPA./94 Even where an action qualifies as a major federal action under NEPA, there may be disputes over whether a proposed action is reviewable in court as a final agency action under the APA. To have a cause of action under the APA, the challenged action must also be considered a final agency action./95</p><p>Is the Action Exempt from NEPA Due to Competing Authority?</p><p>Courts must occasionally address what happens when an agency is faced with a potential conflict or overlap between NEPA and other statutory mandates. As the Supreme Court has held, NEPA was not intended to repeal any other statute by implication./96 Thus, when \"a clear and unavoidable conflict in statutory authority exists, NEPA must give way.\"/97 Such a conflict may exist, for example, if the period for implementing a statutory mandate is too short for an agency to complete environmental review under NEPA./98 Some courts have also held that NEPA does not apply when an agency's actions to comply with other statutes are \"functional[ly] equivalent\" to NEPA./99 This analysis requires courts to assess, on a case-by-case basis, what an agency must take into account when complying with other statutes, especially with respect to environmental effects or considerations./100</p><p>Does New Activity Warrant Additional Analysis?</p><p>When considering new activity related to a prior action that already has documented analysis of environmental impacts or when supplementing earlier NEPA analysis, an agency may refer back to the existing analysis and incorporate it by reference or take a multi-phased approach such as starting with a broader strategic level review and then supplementing on a project-specific basis with analysis limited to new conditions or information (tiering)./101 Sometimes this analysis is undertaken as a supplemental EA or EIS. Other times, an agency incorporates earlier NEPA analysis by reference. In some cases, an agency may issue supplemental analysis when a court remands environmental review to an agency to correct a deficiency in its initial analysis./102</p><p>* * *</p><p>90 Id.

Bureau of Land Mgmt., 555 F. Supp. 3d 739, 770, 805 (D. Alaska 2021) (invalidating the agency's initial NEPA analysis concerning the Willow Project)).</p><p>* * *</p><p>Additionally, a plaintiff may claim that an agency failed to conduct an appropriate supplemental environmental review. These disputes tend to center on situations where existing NEPA analysis exists and new information or circumstances arise./103 For example, supplemental analysis could be warranted for proposed changes to agency salvage logging operations following a wildfire unless the agency's environmental review already factored in post-fire conditions./104 Alternatively, if additional action is contemplated where an existing NEPA analysis has already been completed and there has been no material change in circumstances or information, even a one-paragraph explanation may be sufficient to defend an agency's decision to reference back to existing analysis (tiering) so long as the agency has documented that it determined that no new information or circumstances warranted further consideration./105</p><p>Did the Agency Properly Apply a Categorical Exclusion?</p><p>When an agency applies a CE to a specific action, it does not prepare an EA or EIS. Where an agency determines that site-specific conditions (extraordinary circumstances) exist that could result in more significant impacts from an action that would otherwise qualify for a CE, the agency may decline to apply a CE to the action. The presence of an extraordinary circumstance does not automatically restrict application of the CE, but it can lead an agency to evaluate whether impacts are anticipated to be significant such that it would be appropriate to prepare an EA or EIS./106 Agency CE procedures generally require the agency to consider extraordinary circumstances, but the same may not always be true of congressionally created CEs. At least one court has ruled that the Forest Service was not required to consider extraordinary circumstances before applying a congressionally created CE where the statute did not mandate such consideration./107</p><p>When an agency relies on a CE to determine that further NEPA analysis is not required, plaintiffs may argue that the agency improperly used a CE for a specific action or may challenge the creation of the CE itself. Whether an agency's decision to create or apply a CE was arbitrary or capricious is a fact-specific determination where courts consider whether an agency acted rationally and followed the appropriate procedures to do so./108</p><p>* * *</p><p>103 See, e.g., No Mid-Currituck Bridge-Concerned Citizens v.

Comm'n, 100 F.4th 1039, 1058 (9th Cir. 2024) (determining agency followed its own procedures and reasonably applied its CE).</p><p>* * *</p><p>In disputes involving challenges to specific uses of CEs, plaintiffs have raised different theories. For example, some plaintiffs have alleged that an agency failed to follow its own procedures to use a CE./109 In other cases, plaintiffs have argued that an agency improperly relied on multiple CEs to avoid preparing an EIS./110 While many plaintiffs have alleged that an agency improperly relied on a CE and should have instead prepared an EIS, at least one plaintiff unsuccessfully sued an agency for opting to prepare an EIS when it allegedly could have opted to apply a CE./111</p><p>Courts may consider whether an agency validly created a CE (sometimes referred to as \"adopting\" a CE) or appropriately adopted another agency's CE. For example, in Sierra Club v. Bosworth, the plaintiffs alleged that the Forest Service violated the APA by categorically excluding all fuel reduction projects of up to 1,000 acres and burn projects of up to 4,500 acres./112 The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit concluded that the Forest Service's CE violated the APA because the Service (1) collected data only to justify, rather than assess, the appropriateness of a CE; (2) failed to explain why the cumulative effect of each project would not have significant environmental effects; and (3) failed to specify criteria for each type of project that would ensure a project had no significant environmental effects./113 Additionally, as amended in 2023, NEPA has also allowed agencies to apply another agency's CE provided they follow the appropriate procedures and consults with the \"host\" agency about the appropriateness of applying the exclusion in question./114 Some plaintiffs have challenged these applications in court./115</p><p>Did the Agency Adequately Analyze Environmental Impacts?</p><p>A court may evaluate whether an agency's NEPA review was arbitrary or capricious based on an alleged failure to consider certain impacts or to fully consider the weight of the impacts reviewed. As discussed in more detail below, if an agency makes a decision to move forward with an action without preparing an EIS - whether by applying a CE, issuing a FONSI, or failing to prepare any document - plaintiffs can challenge the agency's decision, asserting that the action would result in significant impacts and therefore requires preparation of an EIS. In other instances, an agency may prepare an EIS where plaintiffs allege the analysis failed to consider a key element of the analysis or an alternative. In these cases, courts generally review the agency's analysis under the APA to determine whether the agency's decision to limit or exclude consideration of particular effects was arbitrary or capricious. In Seven County Infrastructure Coalition, the Supreme Court underscored that courts must afford agencies substantial deference in determining whether an agency reasonably exercised its discretion in determining the appropriate scope and contents of an EIS./116</p><p>* * *</p><p>109 See, e.g., Oak Ridge Env't Peace All. v.

Ct. 1497, 1512 (2025).</p><p>* * *</p><p>In particular, the Court clarified that under this standard, the \"only role\" for courts is to \"confirm that the agency has addressed environmental consequences and feasible alternatives as to the relevant project.\"/117</p><p>Did the Agency Reasonably Determine the Appropriate Scope of Impacts?</p><p>Disputes regarding the appropriate scope of analysis can arise, including whether anticipated effects are too attenuated from a proposed action to include in an EIS or EA. As the Supreme Court explained in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition, an agency should follow a \"rule of reason\" rooted in its statutory authority to determine the appropriate scope of a NEPA analysis./118 This analysis built on Department of Transportation v. Public Citizen, in which the Court ruled that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration did not violate NEPA by not considering the environmental effects related to a decision beyond the agency's (and NEPA's) purview: increased entry of trucks from Mexico into the United States, which had been authorized by the President (who is not subject to NEPA) as an outcome of a trade dispute./119 Additionally, the Court has clarified that a NEPA analysis should focus on the \"project at hand\" as opposed to broader effects associated with separate future projects./120</p><p>Another set of cases involves allegations that an agency failed to consider all relevant indirect effects arising from a proposed action. The Supreme Court has acknowledged that the extent to which an agency must include indirect effects in its NEPA analysis is a matter of agency discretion./121 In Seven County Infrastructure Coalition, the Court overturned a D.C. Circuit decision that had relied in part on a series of cases ruling that indirect effects, such as greenhouse gas impacts, must be considered where relevant to the underlying authority./122 While the Court acknowledged that environmental effects that \"might extend outside the geographic territory of the project or might materialize later in time\" - \"so-called indirect effects\" - \"may fall within NEPA,\" the Court asserted that \"courts should defer to agencies' decisions about where to draw the line\" as to \"how far to go in considering indirect environmental effects from the project at hand.\"/123 Ultimately, the Court in Seven County upheld the agency's decision to include some degree of greenhouse gas impacts in its NEPA analysis in part due to its determination that many of the effects concerned pertained to separate projects, and further, the APA's arbitrary-and-capricious standard mandates that courts defer to an agency's determination on what effects to include or exclude./124</p><p>* * *</p><p>117 Id. at 1511 (quoting Strycker's Bay Neighborhood Council, Inc. v.

Pub. Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 767 (2004)).</p><p>* * *</p><p>Can the Agency Substantiate Its Determination of Whether Impacts Are Significant?</p><p>Agencies and plaintiffs sometimes disagree about whether an agency should have prepared an EIS in instances when an agency applied a CE or prepared an EA and then issued a FONSI documenting the determination that a proposed action would not have significant effects. Courts consistently require that an agency must take a \"hard look\" at a proposed action's potential effects in order to determine whether impacts are significant, though the specific details are often fact-and case-specific./125 For example, some plaintiffs have argued an agency improperly segmented a project by dividing it into discrete, separate actions to \"avoid a more thorough consideration of the impacts of the entire project\" or parsed a proposal into subcomponents that could be completed via some combination of EAs and/or CEs in order to stay below the \"significance\" threshold./126 Others have alleged (to varying degrees of success) that an agency lacked enough data to make a reasoned decision about whether effects were significant./127 Other disputes involve questions about an agency's reliance on certain types of information, such as whether an agency inappropriately relied on outdated information or circumstances substantially changed before the agency finalized its decision (and failed to update its analysis)./128</p><p>In some situations, an agency may face litigation over its decision to prepare an EA and issue a FONSI where impacts could have been significant but for mitigation measures intended to address anticipated impacts./129 This is sometimes known as a mitigated FONSI./130 Agencies may also include mitigation measures as a condition for proceeding with a proposed action when issuing an EIS or authorizing use of a CE. Such mitigation measures may be enforceable in court./131</p><p>* * *</p><p>125 Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 350 (1989); see also Friends of the Floridas v.

For example, courts have found it reasonable for an agency to limit alternatives analysis to a preferred option and a no-action option./136 Additionally, if there was opportunity for public comment in preparation of a NEPA document, courts typically dismiss claims alleging the agency failed to consider an alternative if that argument was not raised during the comment period./137</p><p>Challenges to an agency's consideration of alternatives to the proposed action arise in a variety of ways. Under the APA's arbitrary-and-capricious standard, agencies are typically judged by whether they considered a reasonable range of alternatives and explained their reasoning for accepting or rejecting specific options./138 For example, in a decision that presaged Seven County Infrastructure Coalition, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit refused to find that the Bureau of Land Management was arbitrary or capricious in its rejection of alternatives outside the geographic area for a proposed lease, reasoning that activity beyond the planned area could be considered as a separate project at a later date./139 Similarly, the D.C. Circuit has refused to require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to consider the type of energy used in its alternatives analysis where a state controlled the selection of energy sources./140</p><p>* * *</p><p>132 42 U.S.C.

The Supreme Court has stressed there is no \"thumb on the scales\" in favor of an injunction as compared to ordering relief in the form of vacatur./166 A court could, for example, decline to vacate an action and instead remand to correct a NEPA violation while ordering an interim injunction, such as temporarily delaying project-level activity until the NEPA matter is cured./167</p><p>Sometimes in NEPA-related legal challenges, a plaintiff asks a court to impose a preliminary injunction early in litigation before the matter can receive a full ruling on the merits or a temporary restraining order to prevent imminent harm while the court considers whether to enter a preliminary injunction./168 The Supreme Court has explained that a preliminary injunction is an \"extraordinary remedy\" that is \"never awarded as of right.\"/169 To obtain a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff must show (1) a likelihood of success on the merits, (2) a likelihood of irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, (3) that the balance of the equities tips in the plaintiff's favor, and (4) that an injunction is in the public interest./170 While these four factors are generally universal in application, courts vary in interpreting how they apply./171 For example, the Ninth Circuit has explained that one way in which this four-part test could be met is where the plaintiff has adequately raised \"serious questions\" on the merits, the balance of hardships sharply tilts in a plaintiff's favor, and the other two factors are also satisfied./172</p><p>* * *</p><p>164 See, e.g., Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v.

While NEPA itself has been amended a handful of times since its inception, Congress typically considers hundreds of bills each congressional term with provisions addressing NEPA./177 Some of those bills would affect how courts consider NEPA cases, while others would affect reviewability by amending requirements in NEPA or individual agencies' environmental review processes. Introduced bills have offered changes to how courts would review an agency's NEPA documents in the context of a proposed action and to potential remedies a court may order if an agency's NEPA review has violated the law. Bills have also included approaches to clarify the scope of environmental effects an agency considers in its decisionmaking.</p><p>Congress has considerable latitude to specify when and under what circumstances courts would review an agency's NEPA analysis. Congress could limit judicial review of NEPA claims by restricting the scope of agency NEPA review or modifying the availability judicial review itself. For example, some bills introduced in the 118th Congress, such as Senate Amendment 1911 to H.R. 3935 or House Amendment 272 to H.R. 3935, would have limited consideration to effects the agency has the authority to directly regulate (as opposed to effects of actions an agency has the authority to take)./178</p><p>* * *</p><p>173 Monsanto Co. v.

Monsanto, 561 U.S. at 162. The practical distinction between this outcome and additional equitable relief in the form of an injunction pending cure of a NEPA violation is not always clear, as both situations could result in a temporary pause in an agency's action in order to address the NEPA violation.</p><p>177 CONGRESS.GOV, \"National Environmental Policy Act,\" 1574 results (Aug. 27, 2025) (filtered by \"Legislation\", \"1973-2026\"), <url normalizedValue=\"https://perma.cc/BDK7-ZHW9\">https://perma.cc/BDK7-ZHW9</url>.</p><p>178 E.g., S.Amdt. 1911 to H.R. 3935, 118th Cong.

Such changes could affect judicial review by expanding or contracting the universe of actions for which NEPA analysis is required and therefore what a court could review. Such amendments could also potentially affect NEPA litigation by imposing statutory guardrails that courts would consider when evaluating whether an agency's NEPA analysis was lawful.</p><p>Congress could consider enacting legislation in response to NEPA's evolving regulatory landscape./180 Recission of NEPA regulations and the Seven County opinion have shifted the onus more squarely onto individual agencies to navigate NEPA implementation. Codifying some or all of the elements of the NEPA process that were previously found only in CEQ regulations would limit agency discretion in implementing NEPA and thus would somewhat limit the deference that courts would otherwise afford to agencies. For example, incorporating specific procedural requirements into statute would provide federal agencies, stakeholders, and courts with clarity on the environmental review requirements Congress intends for agencies to apply. Alternatively, if Congress believes NEPA is best implemented via a less standardized approach, Congress could consider directing agencies to promulgate or update regulations detailing their NEPA procedures based on any additional parameters that Congress believes to be warranted.</p><p>* * *</p><p>179 E.g., H.R. 471, Sec. 121(c), 119th Cong.

This funding will directly support the Jones Road Wildfire response and recovery efforts in Ocean County. The Fire Management Assistance Grant Program is available to states, local, and tribal governments to mitigate, manage, and control fires on publicly or privately owned forests or grasslands, threatening such destruction as a major disaster.</p><p>The Jones Road Wildfire in Ocean County is estimated to have burned over 15,000 acres and continues to burn with 60 percent containment, said Acting Governor Tahesha Way. As our first responders attend to the fire, we are grateful to receive help from FEMA with the approval of the FMAG. This grant will ensure we are able to respond as quickly and capably as possible to reach full containment and recover in the aftermath of the fire.</p><p>\"I'm thankful that FEMA has approved our FMAG request. This support is vital to help us respond to and recover quickly from the Jones Road Wildfire and will effectively help us protect lives, homes, and communities,\" said New Jersey State Police Superintendent and State Director of Emergency Management Colonel Patrick J. Callahan.The FMAGalso helps equip our heroic firefighters and first responders working tirelessly on the front lines. I'm grateful for our whole community partnership that enhancesour capabilities and resilience during critical events.\"</p><p>\"This FMAG to New Jersey helps the state respond to the Jones Road Wildfire,\" said Andrew D'Amora, Acting Region 2 Administrator.\"FMAGs are made available by FEMA to assist in fighting fires that threaten to cause a major disaster. It will help cover eligible costs, like expenses for field camps, equipment use, materials, supplies and mobilization and demobilization activities attributed to fighting the fire. These grants do notprovide assistance to individual home or business owners and do not cover other infrastructure damage caused by the fire. We remain in close contact with the state and will continue to prioritize building local and state capacities.</p><p>I wish to thank Senator Kim on behalf of the DEPs Forest Fire Service and the many state and local agencies that responded to the Jones Road wildfire,\" saidNew Jersey Environmental Commissioner Shawn M. LaTourette. As devastating as this wildfire was, the heroic efforts of the Forest Fire Service and our many partners on the ground protected many thousands of lives and averted what could have been extensive loss of property. This wildfire, the most significant to impact the state in many years, serves as a powerful reminder of the importance or partnerships across all levels of government from federal agencies to state agencies and down to the local first responders who work tirelessly to protect their communities.</p><p>As I walked around the areas scorched by the fire, I wanted to ensure our brave firefighters and first responders had everything possible to help contain this disaster, said Senator Andy Kim.As Ranking Member of the Senate subcommittee that oversees FEMA, Im grateful to be able to help bring federal support to help our state during a time of critical need.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1127112010</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FNF-CVJ3-RSKF-V25D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"573\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 25, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Welcome CNN Newsroom, wherever you may be watching from. And here's what's ahead. A flagrant war crime. Palestinian officials warning Israel's Gaza's city takeover will be leading to more death and forced displacement.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And Russia hits Ukraine with its biggest attack in weeks. What does this all mean for those ongoing peace talks?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, North Korea's secret missile base. Researchers say that its construction started two decades ago. Why it's key for Kim Jong Un's future.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Live from New York. This is CNN Newsroom with Polo Sandoval.</p><p>SANDOVAL: And welcome to the program. Palestinian officials, they are warning that a looming Israeli invasion and occupation of Gaza City is in effect a death sentence for more than 1.2 million people living there. Some residents and displaced people they are already fleeing northern Gaza's largest city out of fear of what may come.</p><p>Officials are now calling on the international community to step in before it's too late. And their fear is that further displacement and escalating bombardment. Palestinians gathered in Gaza amid those fears. On Thursday, protesting carrying signs reading stop the genocide and Gaza is dying.</p><p>An Israeli source says that the military will be giving Palestinians approximately two months to evacuate Gaza City before the new assaults begin. They've set a deadline of October 7, the two year mark of the war.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stressing on Thursday that Israel is now at a critical juncture. He indicated that he will be approving plans for a military takeover of Gaza City. That's a major escalation of the war. And he instructed Israeli officials to resume negotiations with Hamas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): I came to approve the IDF's plans for taking control of Gaza City and defeating Hamas. At the same time, I instructed to begin immediate negotiations for the release of all our hostages and the end of the war under conditions acceptable to Israel.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDOVAL: Meanwhile, aid groups say a warning against the mass forced displacement of Gaza's city's residents. Medical aid for Palestinians says that people already exhausted by war and hunger now facing a horrible decision, either stay and risk annihilation or flee to uncertainty and risk being driven into exile.</p><p>Israel's military said on Thursday that it has begun warning medical officials and international aid groups to plan for mass evacuations and displacement in northern Gaza. And then there's this powerful Israeli strike that hit a tent encampment in Dier Al-Balah in central Gaza on Thursday.</p><p>The attack underscoring the dangers that people in Gaza City may face if they do flee south. Palestinian civil defense teams working to extinguish the fire. There was no immediate word on any casualties there. Israel has often said that it takes steps to avoid hitting civilians. Palestinians repeatedly say that they have nowhere safe to go.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNDIENTIFIED MALE (through translator): This is my tent. Within three minutes they told us to evacuate and I got the children out. People, women, babies, elderly, those with disabilities and the weak. They all evacuated. This is our situation. Those tents were great. We were living here happy. This is the area they said was safe south of Gaza. This is the safe area. I have been displaced from one place to another, from north to central of the Gaza Strip, and then here. We are tired. We are tired.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDOVAL: Let's go ahead and bring in Chris McIntosh, humanitarian response advisor with Oxfam. He joins us live at this hour from Gaza City. It is so good to have you with us. Thank you so much for joining.</p><p>CHRIS MCINTOSH, HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE ADVISER, OXFAM: Thank you so.</p><p>SANDOVAL: But before you bring us up to speed on the latest situation there on the ground, I'm wondering if you could just briefly tell us what kind of work your organization has been focusing on in the last few weeks? [01:05:03]</p><p>MCINTOSH: Sure. Oxfam's main staple is what's called water, sanitation and hygiene, which we shorten to wash. And this is providing clean drinking water to population, providing regular, what we call domestic water as well as removing wastewater. And we also do some psychosocial support and we facilitate fundamentally propping up as much as possible the humanitarian situation here.</p><p>SANDOVAL: And Chris, what are you hearing from the people there in Gaza and do you think that some will be reluctant to actually leave in the face of the Israeli government's offensive?</p><p>MCINTOSH: Well, without a doubt there's a plurality of understandings and there's a plurality of willingness to move yet again. So the vast majority of Gaza City was displaced at the beginning of this nearly two years ago. The people left and they returned.</p><p>In addition to that, what we have is displaced peoples from the eastern part of the city, which has been evacuated for now six months or so. So if you were to come here to Gaza City, what you would see is a great deal of rubbled out buildings. The destruction is 360 degrees. And then in addition to that, you would see a lot of tents on the side of roads, tents in the median of roads, tents all along the coastline here. So people are exhausted.</p><p>And what they're saying is that they're exhausted and that there's only so much of this that they can take. The psychological effects of this are tremendous. Imagine being expected to completely uproot your life and to leave behind your domicile or completely uncertain situations in a new place.</p><p>SANDOVAL: Chris, can you elaborate more on that level of fatigue? Obviously that the people of Gaza are tired is an understatement. They have been through so much war now. Where is that point when some people may potentially give up and go elsewhere?</p><p>MCINTOSH: That's an extremely personal decision. We've certainly as an organization, we're working through that understanding, trying to understand what the population is going to do, working through that with our own staff. But we're looking at the point we're almost at six months of a blockade. So there still is not enough food coming in. There's still not enough supplies coming in. And the bombardment happens on a regular basis.</p><p>As your reporting was mentioning earlier, there is nowhere safe in the Gaza Strip. And this prospect of moving hundreds of thousands of people, not only is that problematic, because in that situation they would be forced into the shrinking areas that are relatively safe where other people live, and then they would be forced to compete for dwindling resources in those locations.</p><p>And when I mean resources, I mean life sustaining water and food, but then as well as space to live, access to medical care. Gaza City is the biggest city in the Gaza Strip, and there are a lot of resources here. There's a lot of infrastructure here. So were they to displace, they would be severed from all of that.</p><p>SANDOVAL: And if we could elaborate on that a little bit more, Chris, as we just said a little while ago and reported a little while ago, the Israeli military is reaching out to not just health institutions there, but also organizations such as yours, encouraging them to evacuate ahead of this operation.</p><p>Just up against those challenges that you just laid out logistically, I mean, how do organizations such as yours even begin to assist in relocation of those who are willing to go elsewhere?</p><p>MCINTOSH: Well, it's exactly as you say. It's an enormous logistical challenge. Our policy is always we do what we can, while we can, where we can, and there are some ways to make it happen. Fortunately, we're in a position to gather some of those resources. We have resources of our own.</p><p>And so we're trying to figure out how to piece that together in a way that's going to be effective and fundamentally help people. Yes.</p><p>SANDOVAL: The Israeli military, a source telling CNN that they're giving folks essentially two months or at least until October 7th. Is that even realistic?</p><p>MCINTOSH: Yes, on that, I'd just like to say a few words that the Israelis, with Netanyahu's recent announcement, that is the fourth or fifth big announcement, and we are no closer to having any sort of clarity what's going on.</p><p>[01:10:05]</p><p>The Israelis don't stick to their word and they use misinformation as a tool. It's part of the architect of -- architecture of oppression. It's part of sidelining humanitarian agencies to not allow us to do our work. So, I don't put a lot of stuff in the details of the rhetoric.</p><p>The other thing that I'd like to mention is that the Israeli military, they are conducting operations and they do from time to time encounter hotbeds of resistance. But on a fundamental level, they operate in such a way to maximize their own safety and force protection, to minimize their casualties at the expense of civilian casualties. That is fundamentally how they work for months I've been watching this play out on the ground.</p><p>SANDVOAL: Chris McIntosh live from Gaza City. We wish you and those that you're helping continued safety. Thank you so much for your time.</p><p>MCINTOSH: Thank you. Take care.</p><p>SANDOVAL: Well, Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy says that Russia's latest barrage of drones and missiles now showing Moscow is not ready for talks for peace. Russia launching its largest attack in more than a month overnight on Thursday. Striking is as far west as the city of Lviv. Ukraine says that at least nine civilians were killed in those strikes and a U. S owned manufacturing company was hit.</p><p>The attack coming just days after U.S. President Donald Trump met first with Vladimir Putin in Alaska and then with Zelenskyy and European leaders at the White House amid a push to end this war. Moscow accusing Kyiv of not being interested in, as they put it, a fair and long term settlement. But Ukraine's president says that it's Russia that is putting the brakes on any progress.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Right now the signals from Russia are frankly obscene. They're trying to wriggle out of the need to hold a meeting. They do not want to end this war.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDOVAL: Meanwhile, President Trump appearing to show sympathy for Ukraine, posting on social media and I'll read his post. It is very hard, if not impossible to win a war without attacking an invader's country. Then he makes a sports reference. Here he writes, it's like a great team in sports that has a fantastic defense but is not allowed to play offense. There is no chance of winning again. The words from the U.S. president.</p><p>CNN's Bed Wedeman is in southern Ukraine with a look at how Ukrainian soldiers prepare for further Russian advancement.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A Russian train full of fuel goes up in a blaze of fire and smoke, struck by Ukrainian drones. This new era of warfare combines high tech close quarters combat harking back to the First World War.</p><p>The same brigade that took part in the train strike is also fighting in the trenches. Infantry squad commander Yevgeny returned at five in the morning from a deadly six-man attack on a Russian position.</p><p>One of my men was killed, he says. Two took shrapnel. Two of us got concussions from drone attacks and mortar fire. His men managed to kill a Russian soldier, then had to withdraw and came here, well underground, where the war is barely audible.</p><p>WEDEMAN: This complex of bunkers and trenches is not the front line. It's well away in the rear. The purpose is that they will be ready in the event the Russians push forward. And what we're hearing from senior Ukrainian officials is that they fear that the Russians are preparing for a major push in the Zaporizhzha area.</p><p>WEDEMAN (voice-over): Until then, this is where troops from the 65th Mechanized Brigade Rest and recuperate. Cramped and stuffy, yet safe, the cats welcome company. Also keeping the mice at bay. They're resting up for their next mission, defending the town of Orikhiv, or what's left of it. Only 800 of its original 14,000 residents remain. Oleksandr is the only handyman left, with plenty to keep him busy. Windows, doors, roofs, you can see for yourself. Everything needs repairs, he says.</p><p>In the town's post office, the last vestige of normalcy, we meet Ludmila, who lives alone with her two dogs. Her day started with shelling.</p><p>[01:15:00]</p><p>When it hit, I thought that was the end of everything, she says. To lighten her mood, I share pictures of hobbies and pets.</p><p>WEDEMAN: These are my potatoes.</p><p>WEDEMAN (voice-over): Communicating in a linguistic hodgepodge. We shared a laugh. Her dog, Alpha, shell shocked, was unmoved.</p><p>Far away is the powerful talk war and peace. Here, the powerless can only hold on and hope to live another day. Ben Wedeman, CNN, Orikhiv, southern Ukraine.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SANDOVAL: Joining me now live is Peter Zalmayev, director of Eurasia Democracy Initiative. Peter, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>PETER ZALMAYEV, DIRECTOR, EURASIA DEMOCRACY INITIATIVE: Thank you.</p><p>SANDOVAL: So by now, Peter, the White House had hoped that we would have seen a trilat, or at least have it on the calendar. Now we don't even know if we'll see a bilateral meeting between Russia and Ukraine here. So in your view, have President Trump's hopes for a peaceful resolution to the war been dashed?</p><p>ZALMAYEV: I think there were unrealistic hopes and very naive hopes from the beginning, dictated by Donald Trump's naive trust that Vladimir Putin is just as easily swayed by pomp and circumstance, by red carpets and all these other things, outward appearances. But Putin never had that in mind.</p><p>I think he pulled a quite a clever trick, and I expected that from the beginning. He got everything he wanted. He got the, you know, the optics of that meeting on the formerly Russian territory of Alaska, the red carpet, the private ride in the limo, as we all saw.</p><p>And I think he dropped some hints probably previously to Mr. Witkoff, the gullible, you know, envoy of Trump to the Middle East and to Ukraine, and then to Donald Trump just sort of stringing them along, making them feel that very, very soon something big will come, he'll be ready to sit down, maybe a trilat with Zelenskyy, but I don't think he fully really meant it.</p><p>And now all this backtracking or the realism, the realistic pictures, you know, coming through with Lavrov, the foreign minister of Russia, saying this is out of the question. Zelenskyy, he won't even refer to Zelenskyy as a human being. He says that type, that creature, whatever they say, they do not consider Zelenskyy legitimate. I just cannot see in which world Vladimir Putin would be sitting out with Zelenskyy other than to have him sign Ukraine's capitulation.</p><p>SANDOVAL: And that would speak to the naive nature of the expectations. And we have heard other experts also weighing in and describe it as such. And you mentioned Alaska. President Putin clearly buying himself more time to continue with this war. But given the challenges that the Ukrainian military has faced on the front lines, in your view, do you think that Ukraine is equipped or even armed to continue to tread water as well.</p><p>ZALMAYEV: Well, it has been equipped enough all along to just sort of mosey on to hold off the Russian defense or at least slow down the pace of the advance. But as actually Donald Trump rightly pointed out, even a broken clock can be correct once or even twice a day.</p><p>You know, if Ukraine was never given the proper offensive weaponry or in the sufficient amounts to kick out the enemy, he was right there. So I think there's still probably enough for a few months. The Ukraine is bleeding manpower, that is the big problem.</p><p>But it's still showing that it can more than hold its own and wage a successful asymmetrical war, hitting the Russians deep behind the front lines, deep inside Russia. But we need more weaponry, more offensive weaponry. We need speedier deliveries. And as it is, we are bleeding. And it is a war being waged to the last Ukrainian.</p><p>You know, we started off this war with the Russians saying that line. Now Ukrainians are saying that resentment is setting in our allies standing by us. The Europeans may be willing but not able nearly as much as the U.S. and Donald Trump is just constantly threatening to walk away. This is not a very encouraging position to be in.</p><p>SANDOVAL: And considering that skepticism that we get from you at the top, do you see a scenario where a Ukrainian Russian meeting actually happens or is that just really a pipe dream?</p><p>ZALMAYEV: I mean, it might, it could. If once again, if our Western allies make it costly for Putin to continue this war, Ukraine is doing all its all it can. It has already by some accounts disabled, neutralized, destroyed up to 15 percent of oil refining capacity inside Russia. That is actually hitting them at the pocket. That can create, you know, that can lead to some public unrest. And that is precisely where we need to be.</p><p>[01:20:05]</p><p>We need to make this war too costly to where Putin, you know, comes and sits down and talks peace.</p><p>SANDOVAL: Peter Zalmayev, really appreciate you coming on the program and sharing your perspective. I think that together with some of the reporting on the ground that we just saw, I think hopefully we have a clearer idea of the sense of urgency that really exists for the Ukrainian people right now. We'll check back with you. Thank you. Meanwhile, there's this. In a rare admission of his country's losses, Kim Jong Un is now paying emotional tribute to North Korean soldiers who were killed while fighting for Russia in its war against Ukraine. Speaking in Pyongyang, Kim said that his heart aches for the fallen members of what he called his heroic army.</p><p>The comments coming as Kim awarded medals to soldiers during a banquet honoring a North Korean unit that fought for Moscow in the western Kursk region.</p><p>North Korea has been making headlines for years as it builds up its military capabilities in an extremely unusual way.

According to news originating from Prague, Czech Republic, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"The recent increase of the air temperature due to the global climate change is considered as one of the important reasons for the wildfires increase in the world, even in areas where the wildfires are not that common. In addition to the various physical damages adversely affecting the ecological balance, harmful gases and solid particles are released into the atmosphere due to wildfires, causing serious health problems.\" </p><p><br/> Financial support for this research came from Student Grant Project of the Faculty of Agrobiology, Food and Natural Resources. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague, \"In this study, impacts of the most serious forest fire in modern history of the country lasting 16 days from 23rd of July 2022 in the National Park' Bohemian Switzerland' in the D &amp; ecaron;&amp; ccaron;&amp; iacute;n district, Czech Republic, were investigated using remote sensing satellite datasets by cloud-based Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), normalized burn ratio index (NBR), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land surface temperature (LST) and soil moisture index (SMI) were calculated from Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager and Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI and TIRS) dataset for the dates of 31st October 2021, 18th June 2022, and 31st October 2022. Relationship of the remote sensing indices were calculated to estimate the impacts of the wildfire. Furthermore, distribution of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was extracted using Sentinel-5P TROPOMI (Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument) to observe changes before and after the forest fire in the study region.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The burnt area approximately 13.20 km2 from the total area of 79.28 km2 was detected using different time series of the remote sensing indices in the national park.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Analysis of the Forest Fire In the 'bohemian Switzerland' National Park Using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-5p In Google Earth Engine.

According to news reporting out of Dehradun, India, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"The increased frequency and intensity of forest fires have necessitated the characterization and evaluation of factors influencing fire occurrences in the Western Himalaya, which is essential for managing and mitigating forest fire disasters. Environmental conditions leading up to fire episodes such as pre-fire conditions, anomalies in weather phenomenon and seasonality in biophysical parameters, have been identified to be intricately linked to forest fire occurrences.\" </p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, \"Information on the factors influencing forest fire, retrieved from satellite data in Google Earth Engine (GEE) and analysed using R Studio through machine learning algorithms (Random Forest and Maximum Entropy), was used to estimate spatial forest fire risk maps. Results showed a significant influence of seasonality of biophysical parameters in determining forest fire season. Furthermore, local conditions and fuel availability shows strong association with forest fire risk. For instance, Uttarakhand falls under moderate to very high forest fire probable risk category compared to Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. Statistically, Random Forest method showed better performance compared to Maximum entropy method, as indicated by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The study provides a clear understanding of quantitative influence of environmental and local factors responsible for forest fire risk and can be used for forest fire management and mitigation.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Earth Observation Based Characterization of Environmental Conditions for Forest Fire Risk In Western Himalayan Ecosystems Using Machine Learning Approach.

Three approaches including Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA), satellite image analysis, and direct observation were used to generate information on spatial and temporal forest fire severity. Findings revealed that agricultural activities (44.5%) and charcoal production (21.1%) are the primary causes of these fires. Burn severity maps were created using the differenced Normalized Burned Ratio (dNBR) index, and the combined high and low severity areas ranged from 32.120% to 20.31%.<br/> \u201cThe differenced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (dNDVI) maps showed the combined high and low severity areas of 36.30% to 21.10% of the total study sites respectively. Post-fire NDVI time series analyses revealed a sharp decrease from 0.21 to 0.36 in all burned areas, indicating significant vegetation loss. Therefore, this study demonstrated the potential of integrating Remote Sensing and Socio-economic aspects highlighting the need for improved forest fire management through sustainable practices that balance economic and ecological considerations, offering insights that can be upscaled to other forest areas for effective management.\u201d<br/> This preprint has not been peer-reviewed.<br/> For more information on this research see: biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.29.615696v1<br/> Keywords for this news article include: Ecology. <br/> Our reports deliver fact-based news of research and discoveries from around the world.

According to news originating from Kish, Iran, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"Forest fires represent a significant threat to natural ecosystems and human lives, necessitating early detection and rapid response for effective mitigation. In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a promising technology for forest fire detection.\" </p><p><br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Islamic Azad University: \"IoT-based solutions leverage Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), which consist of sensor nodes equipped with various sensors, data processing capabilities, and wireless communication, all powered by batteries. Energy efficiency is a critical consideration for WSNs, as they lack the luxury of periodic recharging. This paper explores the utilization of IoT-enabled WSNs in forest fire detection, with a specific focus on the sensor nodes' ability to monitor environmental parameters such as temperature, pressure, and humidity, as well as chemical indicators including Carbon Monoxide, Carbon Dioxide, and Nitrogen Dioxide. The self-healing and self-organizing characteristics of IoT sensor networks enhance their reliability and robustness in remote forested areas. ZigBee, based on IEEE 802.15.4, is a wireless technology that has gained prominence due to its low-cost, battery-powered applications and suitability for low data rates and short-range communications. This paper highlights the advancements, challenges, and potential applications of IoT-enabled WSNs for forest fire detection, underscoring the expanding possibilities enabled by the rapid development of the IoT.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"It emphasizes the growing research interest in IoT sensor networks and their potential deployment in various domains. The insights provided aim to contribute to ongoing efforts in developing efficient forest fire detection systems, ultimately enhancing the safety and preservation of our natural environment.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Safeguarding forest ecosystems: harnessing IoT for fire detection.

LaTourette and the New Jersey DEP Forest Fire Service today strongly urged the public to heed Stage 3 fire restrictions that are in place as extremely dry conditions are expected to persist across New Jersey.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mandatory statewide Stage 3 fire restrictions, put in place earlier this week, prohibit all fires unless they are contained in an elevated stove using only propane, natural gas or electricity. No wood or charcoal fires are allowed, and the use of kerosene or gas torches of any kind is prohibited while this level of restriction is in place. The fire ban is in place on all public lands and private properties in all municipalities throughout the state.</p><p>The next several days are of specific concern as wind gusts are forecast in excess of 20 mph with very low humidity. In response, the Forest Fire Service has contracted additional aerial resources capable of dropping 600 gallons of water at a time to stage in the event of a wildfire.</p><p>In addition, observers in fire towers across the state are vigilantly watching for any signs of wildfires, while measuring weather readings daily that include temperature, humidity, along with a drought index, which has indicated unprecedented dry conditions. This has raised concern about the potential rapid spread of wildfires in the state.</p><p>\"We are currently experiencing some of the driest conditions ever, making our forests, in particular the sprawling Pinelands region of southern New Jersey, especially vulnerable to wildfires that could spread very quickly and threaten property,\" Commissioner LaTourette said. \"It is critical that members of the public be extra cautious about fire prevention and refrain from using any open flames.\"</p><p>\"When conditions become this dry, the simplest things can start a wildfire,\" said Bill Donnelly, State Forest Firewarden and Chief of the Forest Fire Service. \"In my 30-year career with the Forest Fire Service, I can't recall a time when we faced such a prolonged period of dry weather with no relief in sight.\"</p><p>\"In the late 1800s, severe dry conditions similar to what we are experiencing today was the impetus for the creation of the Forest Fire Service,\" said John Cecil, Assistant Commissioner for State Parks, Forests &amp; Historic Sites. \"New Jerseyans should be mindful of the current severe dry conditions across the state, adhere to the Forest Fire Service's fire restrictions and exercise caution in their daily activities.\"</p><p>New Jersey Under Statewide Drought Watch</p><p>The Murphy Administration issued a statewide Drought Watch on Oct. 17, strongly urging residents and businesses to voluntarily conserve water as persistent dry and warmer-than-average conditions continue to stress the state's water supplies.</p><p>During the past three months, New Jersey has experienced significantly below-average rainfall, which has contributed to diminished streamflow, reservoir, and groundwater levels.</p><p>The declaration of a Drought Watch is intended to increase public awareness and appreciation of the stress water supply sources are facing and encourages the public to practice voluntary water conservation measures. If conditions do not improve, declaration of a Drought Warning or a Drought Emergency with mandatory water use restrictions may become necessary.</p><p>The last Drought Watch in New Jersey occurred in August 2022 and was lifted in December 2022. The last statewide Drought Emergency with mandatory water use restrictions was declared in March 2002, and was lifted in January 2003.</p><p>For updated information about the status of New Jersey's water supplies, visit dep.nj.gov/drought</p><p>For a list of Frequently Asked Questions about droughts, visit <url normalizedValue=\"https://dep.nj.gov/drought/faq/\">https://dep.nj.gov/drought/faq/</url></p><p>Prolonged Dry Conditions and Wildfire Risk</p><p>The drought index that the Forest Fire Service uses measures the dryness of soil and forest floor materials, such as leaves, pine needles, branches and twigs. This index is specifically designed to estimate wildfire potential. The index ranges from 0 to 800, with 0 representing completely saturated, wet soil and tops out at 800 representing extreme dryness and the maximum drought possible.</p><p>The Lebanon Fire Tower in Brendan T. Byrne State Forest, Burlington County, is presently reading the drought index as 725, representing near top level drought conditions and a condition rarely observed over decades of observations.</p><p>*Rest of the document can be viewed at: (<url normalizedValue=\"https://dep.nj.gov/newsrel/24_0049/\">https://dep.nj.gov/newsrel/24_0049/</url>) For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:contentservices@htdigital.in\">contentservices@htdigital.in</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USFDNW-PR4901993</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USFDNW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D8D-JKF1-F12F-F4PW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">282801</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"781\"/><timeReceived>10:01 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 HT Media Ltd.

With more than 7.8 million acres burned, according to Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre data, the season has already raced past the annual average, even when including the past two major fire seasons. The 25-year average for land burned is 7.3 million acres. </p><p>This year's tally is poised to finish well above normal. Dozens of active wildfires are burning from northern British Columbia and Alberta in a belt extending southeastward to Ontario. Many new blazes have started in recent weeks as a result of lightning, which is a common fire starter. The most intense fire activity has shifted its focus westward over recent days. The wildfires, mostly burning in dense boreal forest, continue to send thick smoke far from the source. Much of southwest and south-central Canada is under an air quality alert Tuesday, including the cities of Edmonton and Regina, where air quality reached Code Red levels in the morning. Some locations closer to Alberta experienced hazardous air quality. Multiple massive fires of greater than 250,000 acres are ongoing in five provinces. \u00a2 British Columbia has two of those huge out-of-control conflagrations, among 86 active wildfires there, and including one closing in on 500,000 acres in the province's far north that is suspected to have carried over from last year after smoldering through the winter. Another to its south grew rapidly during recent days, past 295,000 acres, leading to evacuation orders for rural indigenous First Nations regions Sunday. \u00a2 To the east, in Alberta, there are 60 active fires, five of which are 120,000 acres or larger and classified as out of control. The largest fire, sparked by lightning and mostly burning north of Edmonton, in oil country and forestland, was past 320,00 acres as of Monday. \u00a2 Central Saskatchewan's Shoe Fire \" 100 miles north of Saskatoon \" is the largest in the nation overall, now past 1.2 million acres in size. Despite improving conditions, evacuations from 33 rural communities continue, according to local reports. The entire area had notable rainfall in recent days, which has assisted in reducing imminent risks. Hot spots persist, especially on the southern flank. \u00a2 Manitoba has five out-of-control fires greater than 120,000 acres, the largest of which has blackened more than 740,000 acres near Flin Flon, on the province's western border with Saskatchewan. Another northeast of Winnipeg has scorched more than 530,000 acres. Both have grown much more slowly in recent days thanks to increased moisture. \u00a2 In Ontario, the largest blaze is 370,000-plus acres, while a number of fires are also surrounding Kenora in the province's southwest. Like blazes in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, those in Ontario have generally been subdued by recent wetter conditions. Canada has experienced warming at least two times faster than the rest of the globe.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHDLY-1006381683</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHDLY2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G17-31N3-RXT9-61M7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163823</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"493\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Paddock Publications, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Daily Herald</publicationName><edition>ML2 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 11, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000057</classCode><className>AIR QUALITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DVSL</classCode><className>EMERGENCY EVACUATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DOAM</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTER ALERTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008X7K</classCode><className>INDIGENOUS PEOPLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001196</classCode><className>NATIVE AMERICANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX001885</classCode><className>AIR QUALITY MONITORING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>STX001511</classCode><className>RURAL COMMUNITIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX064</classCode><className>REGINA, SK, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX056</classCode><className>WINNIPEG, MB, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS167</classCode><className>ALBERTA, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS177</classCode><className>SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GS169</classCode><className>MANITOBA, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GS174</classCode><className>ONTARIO, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Prosecutors said Friday that a 17-year-old was arrested and charged with arson, aggravated arson and hindering apprehension. </p><p>His name was not released because he is a juvenile. The fire that has been burning for nearly two weeks is 80 percent contained by Saturday, according to the state Forest Fire Service. The blaze in southern New Jersey's Ocean County has spread across 24 square miles. No injuries have been reported. A 19-year-old man from Waretown was charged with arson over a week ago. Prosecutors say Joseph Kling set wood pallets on fire and left the area. On Friday, prosecutors said Kling and a few other people took the pallets from a recycling center, drove to a heavily wooded area and used gasoline to start the fire. Kling's attorney said at a detention hearing Friday that Kling did not intend to set the wildfire or destroy any property. The Pine Barrens sit between Philadelphia and the Atlantic coast, a region with quick-draining sandy soil and trees with still-developing leaves where winds can kick up, drying out the forest floor. Firefighters have been contending with low humidity and the aftermath of a monthslong drought.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-00000196a0fed4f8a9d6ecff8e9f0000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FYC-04B3-S52M-7126-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"222\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"05\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>May 5, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>Criminal Law &amp; Procedure</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEU0RkE1OUQwNUQwNDgxODhEODZCMjkzOTg3NThBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OEU0MzE0MjlEMEQ2NDIxRjlDQTczQUIwRDA2RDc5OEI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0VDNzg2RUI5QkNGNDEwNzhBMDcwODZFNEQxQ0I3RTM</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTIyM0ZEQjQ4MkQ0NDNGQzg1MkU3QkJGODc5N0JDNEE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6N0Q0MjQ0NjJFQzA4NDQ0MjlENUU4NzYzNjE1OTVBMUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>STX000113</classCode><className>ARSON</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N922130TM</classCode><className>PUBLIC PROSECUTORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000112</classCode><className>ARRESTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>N115300CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N922130TM</classCode><className>PUBLIC PROSECUTORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>N115300CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GS146</classCode><className>NEW JERSEY, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>ST000A2L6</classCode><className>ATLANTIC OCEAN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the investigation.</p><p>\"We do believe that the suspect started the fire, and we do believe that it was an ambush and it was intentional,\" Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris said at a Sunday night news conference. \"These firefighters did not have a chance.\"</p><p>The wounded firefighter was \"fighting for his life\" after surgery and was stable, Norris said.</p><p>\"When you have an environment where you don't know where the bullets are coming from because of the trees and the shrubbery and what have you, it is daunting for police officers, let alone firefighters,\" Norris said.</p><p>Outpouring of support was swift in Coeur d'Alene, a city of 55,000 residents near the border with Washington.</p><p>Hours after the ambush, people gathered along Interstate 90 holding American flags to pay their respects as the two fallen firefighters' bodies were taken to the medical examiner's office in Spokane, Wash..</p><p>Gov. Brad Little on Monday ordered U.S. and Idaho state flags to be lowered to half-staff to honor the firefighters until the day after their memorial service.</p><p>\"All our public safety officers, especially our firefighters, bravely confront danger on a daily basis but we have never seen a heinous act of violence like this on our firefighters before,\" he said in a statement. \"This is not Idaho. This indescribable loss is felt deeply by all those in the firefighting community and beyond.\"</p><p>The Idaho House Republican Leadership said in a statement: \"We are horrified by the murder of two firefighters in Coeur d'Alene, and shocked by such a vicious attack on our first responders. We are praying for them, the injured, their families and their colleagues.\"</p><p>Though the shelter-in-place order was lifted, the sheriff's office cautioned residents to be prepared because the fire was still burning. The status of the fire was not immediately known Monday morning.</p><p>Canfield Mountain is a popular hiking and biking area on the outskirts of Coeur d'Alene, covered with trees and heavy brush and crisscrossed with trails that lead into a national forest.</p><p>Fire is always a concern for the region, said Bruce Deming, whose property abuts the trail system. When he noticed smoke on the ridge Sunday, he wondered why no firefighting helicopters were responding.</p><p>When a friend texted to tell him about the shooting, he realized why he wasn't seeing aircraft: \"Because they're concerned about being shot at,\" he said.</p><p>As deputies set up posts nearby, Deming pointed them to a trail that starts near his back door and leads directly to the site of the fire.</p><p>\"I just don't want to have to wake up in the middle of the night to figure if somebody's out prowling around my place,\" he said.</p><p>--</p><p>AP journalists Alanna Durkin Richer in Washington; Mead Gruver in Cheyenne, Wyo.; Josh Funk in Omaha; and Kathy McCormack in Concord, N.H., contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: WILDLAND firefighters arrive at the scene the day after a deadly ambush just north of Coeur D'Alene, Idaho.

Additionally, Weyerhaeuser aims to grow its annual EBITDA from natural climate solutions to $100 million and increase lumber production by 5% each year. These targets reflect Weyerhaeuser's focus on fostering growth while prioritizing environmental sustainability.</p><p>Weyerhaeuser also reiterated its leadership in Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance, with a goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2040. Furthermore, the company is committed to maintaining robust shareholder returns through a sustainable dividend policy. The recent analyst rating on Weyerhaeuser stock (WY) is a Hold, with a price target set at $28.00.</p><p>According to Spark, TipRanks' AI Analyst, Weyerhaeuser's overall stock score indicates a stable financial position, backed by strong cash conversion capabilities.

The company has recognized a gain from the sale but anticipates a tax liability of about $11 million USD as a result of the transaction. This sale reflects Weyerhaeuser's ongoing strategy to optimize its operations and focus on its core business areas.</p><p>Established in 1900, Weyerhaeuser is among the largest private owners of timberlands worldwide, managing approximately 10.4 million acres in the U.S. and additional public timberlands in Canada.

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply.

This investment is projected to expand engineered wood products capacity by 10 million cubic feet, positioning Weyerhaeuser to seize greater market share in the growing housing sector. While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.</p><p>Shareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program</p><p>Following completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.</p><p>Maintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges</p><p>Weyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.</p><p>Strengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility</p><p>The company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.</p><p>Capital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing</p><p>Management refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.</p><p>Focused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency</p><p>Excluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.</p><p>Expansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth</p><p>Weyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.</p><p>Unlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures</p><p>The announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.</p><p>Timberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base</p><p>Management advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.</p><p>Operational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures</p><p>Initiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.</p><p>Proactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities</p><p>Reserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties. By maintaining adequate coverage for contingent liabilities, Weyerhaeuser bolsters its balance sheet resilience. However, potential over-reserving may tie up capital unnecessarily and requires vigilant management assessment.</p><p>Prioritizing Workforce Stability Amid Labor Market Tightness</p><p>Recognizing a 4.1% unemployment rate as a constraint, Weyerhaeuser focused on hiring and talent retention across its segments. Stability in workforce availability ensures operational continuity and supports management's strategic initiatives. However, rising labor costs remain a potential margin-pressure risk-a critical area to monitor for sustained profitability.</p><p>SECTION 6 TODAY'S BEARISH SIGNALS</p><p>Price/Earnings of 44.6 &gt; Building Materials &amp; Fixtures sector (of 24 stocks) avg of 24.2:</p><p>- The price-to-earnings ratio of 44.6 indicates overvaluation compared with sector average of 24.2 and market average of 24.5.</p><p>6.1 PAST WEEK: MODERATE MOMENTUM DOWN </p><p>WY decreases 3.2% on average volume 1.1 times average.

According to news reporting originating from the University Indonesia by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Agroforestry projects in the Peat Hydrological Unit (PHU) area represent the largest peat forest management and support center for sustainable ecological growth. However, old habits such as littering and burning become complicated tasks for strategic forest management.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include University of Indonesia Directorate of Research And Development. <br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from University Indonesia: \"Components of past behavior, social norms, and risk management interventions should be adapted as the psychosocial cognitive part of a complex mitigation behavior cycle prediction. The integration of psychosocial cognitive strategies into sustainable development not only increases collective awareness and responsibility locally and supports the future management of global environmental health. Novelty: This study aims to provide a constructive understanding of the prediction of hybrid feedback loops cognitive maps in the behavioral cycle of burning and waste crisis mitigation using SCT, SME, CBSM, and social capital variable. This study used survey data on psychosocial cognitive assessments collected from communities involved in agroforestry projects in PHU, West Kalimantan. The psychosocial cognitive components of SCT, SME, CBSM, and social capital were measured using the Planning Environmental Behavior Index (PEBI). Data were analyzed using hybrid feedback loops model combining Bayesian simulation and logistic hierarchy to obtain the statistical efficiency logFC (Fold Change). Logistic regression analysis of psychosocial cognitive items in the SCT, CBSM, and SME components revealed a significant influence of norms (b = 0.26, t(124) = 2.47, r &lt; 0.05) and trust (b = 0.13, t(124) = 1.05, r &lt; 0.05). However, the network component (b = 0.09, t(124) = 0.37, r &gt; 0.20) did not significantly predict waste crisis and forest fire mitigation behavior. The SCT items showed hierarchical statistical significance: PPC (b = 0.39, t(124) = 3.27, r &lt; 0.05), RP (b = 0.19, t(124) = 2.07, r &lt; 0.05), and PEC (b = 0.44, t(124) = 2.24, r &lt; 0.05). Similarly, SME items significantly contributed to PPC (b = 0.46, t(124) = 3.33, r &lt; 0.05), RP (b = 0.24, t(124) = 2.51, r &lt; 0.05), and PEC (b = 0.59, t(124) = 3.48, r &lt; 0.05). CBSM predictions showed the significance of PEC control for the proportion stage of CR (b = 0.31, t(124) = 2.64, r &lt; 0.05) and ME (b = 0.44, t(124) = 2.24, r &lt; 0.05). Based on the hybrid feedback loop model, logistic regression of PEC items and social norms significantly predicted the mitigation behavior cycle, especially at the 'action' and 'outcome expectation' nodes.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The predictive findings suggest that PEC items and social norms influence the reinforcement of hybrid feedback loops at the 'action' and 'outcome expectancy' nodes in analyzing the cognitive map of the perceived mitigation behavior cycle.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Waste crisis and potential implications of forest Fires: Perspective from psychosocial cognition.

According to news reporting originating from Calgary, Canada, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Land Surface Temperature (LST) datasets play a crucial role in understanding the complex interplay between forest fires, climate variables, and vegetation dynamics.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Nserc. <br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from University of Calgary: \"This study is divided into two primary parts: the first part investigates the predictive performance of a machine learning framework based on CatBoost and XGBoost models in estimating LST across different land cover classes in Alberta, Canada. On the test set, for LST-Day data, CatBoost and XGBoost achieved Median Absolute Errors (MedAE) of approximately 1.434 \u00b0C and 1.425 \u00b0C, respectively. For LST-Night data, also on the test set, the MedAE values were approximately 1.186 \u00b0C for CatBoost and 1.176 \u00b0C for XGBoost. The second part explores the intricate relationships between climatic variables-LST, precipitation, and relative humidity-forest fire occurrences, and vegetation dynamics in various subregions. The findings revealed complex interactions, with high LST, reduced precipitation, and humidity associated with increased forest fire activity and subsequent changes in vegetation patterns, particularly in the Central Mixedwood, Dry Mixedwood, and Montane subregions. A notable potential association was identified between high LST, reduced precipitation and humidity, and increased forest fire activity in these areas.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"These climate change impacts and fire events were found to influence ecological processes, altering species composition, reducing biodiversity, and potentially disrupting ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling. These insights are crucial for informing adaptive forest management strategies aimed at understanding and mitigating the cascading effects of climate change on fire regimes and vegetation dynamics in Alberta's diverse landscapes.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: A multidimensional machine learning framework for LST reconstruction and climate variable analysis in forest fire occurrence.

Two were dead on arrival and the third was being treated for injuries, Anderson said. The wounded firefighter was \u201cfighting for his life\u201d after surgery and was in stable condition, Norris said.</p><p>The scene was sheer pandemonium as the brush fire burned and firefighters rushed to the scene only to come under heavy fire.</p><p>First responders made urgent calls for help on their radios: \u201cEverybody\u2019s shot up here ... send law enforcement now,\u201d according to one dispatch.</p><p>Gov. Brad Little said \u201cmultiple\u201d firefighting personnel were attacked.</p><p>\u201cThis is a heinous direct assault on our brave firefighters,\u201d Little said on X. \u201cI ask all Idahoans to pray for them and their families as we wait to learn more.\u201d</p><p>Norris said it appeared the sniper was hiding in the rugged terrain and using a high-powered rifle. He said he instructed deputies to fire back.</p><p>Just as the evening press conference was expected to begin, the bodies of the slain firefighters arrived in the nearby city of Spokane, Washington, escorted by a procession of fire and law enforcement vehicles. Firefighters and others saluted as the vehicles passed by.</p><p>An alert by the Kootenai County Emergency Management Office asked people to avoid the area around Canfield Mountain Trailhead and Nettleton Gulch Road, about 4 miles (6.5 km) north of downtown Coeur d\u2019Alene.</p><p>Though the shelter-in-place order was lifted, the sheriff\u2019s office cautioned residents to be prepared because the fire was still burning.</p><p>The FBI responded to the scene with technical teams and tactical support, Deputy Director Dan Bongino said.</p><p>The Idaho House Republican Leadership said in a statement: \u201cWe are horrified by the murder of two firefighters in Coeur d\u2019Alene, and shocked by such a vicious attack on our first responders. We are praying for them, the injured, their families and their colleagues.\u201d</p><p>Coeur d'Alene is a city of 55,000 residents near the border with Washington. Canfield Mountain is a popular hiking and biking area on the city's outskirts, covered with trees and heavy brush and crisscrossed with trails that lead into a national forest.</p><p>Fire is always a big concern for the region, said Bruce Deming, whose property abuts the trail system. When he noticed smoke on the ridge Sunday afternoon, he wondered why no firefighting helicopters were responding.</p><p>When a friend texted to tell him about the shooting, he realized why he wasn\u2019t seeing aircraft: \u201cBecause they\u2019re concerned about being shot at,\u201d he said.</p><p>As deputies set up posts nearby, Deming pointed them to a trail that starts near his backdoor and leads directly to the site of the fire.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want to have to wake up in the middle of the night to figure if somebody\u2019s out prowling around my place,\u201d he said.</p><p>___</p><p>Weber reported from Los Angeles.

Two were dead on arrival and the third was being treated for injuries, Anderson said. The wounded firefighter was \u201cfighting for his life\u201d after surgery and was in stable condition, Norris said.</p><p>The scene was sheer pandemonium as the brush fire burned and firefighters rushed to the scene only to come under heavy fire.</p><p>First responders made urgent calls for help on their radios: \u201cEverybody\u2019s shot up here ... send law enforcement now,\u201d according to one dispatch.</p><p>Gov. Brad Little said \u201cmultiple\u201d firefighting personnel were attacked.</p><p>\u201cThis is a heinous direct assault on our brave firefighters,\u201d Little said on X. \u201cI ask all Idahoans to pray for them and their families as we wait to learn more.\u201d</p><p>Norris said it appeared the sniper was hiding in the rugged terrain and using a high-powered rifle. He said he instructed deputies to fire back.</p><p>Just as the evening press conference was expected to begin, the bodies of the slain firefighters arrived in the nearby city of Spokane, Washington, escorted by a procession of fire and law enforcement vehicles. Firefighters and others saluted as the vehicles passed by.</p><p>An alert by the Kootenai County Emergency Management Office asked people to avoid the area around Canfield Mountain Trailhead and Nettleton Gulch Road, about 4 miles (6.5 km) north of downtown Coeur d\u2019Alene.</p><p>Though the shelter-in-place order was lifted, the sheriff\u2019s office cautioned residents to be prepared because the fire was still burning.</p><p>The FBI responded to the scene with technical teams and tactical support, Deputy Director Dan Bongino said.</p><p>The Idaho House Republican Leadership said in a statement: \u201cWe are horrified by the murder of two firefighters in Coeur d\u2019Alene, and shocked by such a vicious attack on our first responders. We are praying for them, the injured, their families and their colleagues.\u201d</p><p>Coeur d'Alene is a city of 55,000 residents near the border with Washington. Canfield Mountain is a popular hiking and biking area on the city's outskirts, covered with trees and heavy brush and crisscrossed with trails that lead into a national forest.</p><p>Fire is always a big concern for the region, said Bruce Deming, whose property abuts the trail system. When he noticed smoke on the ridge Sunday afternoon, he wondered why no firefighting helicopters were responding.</p><p>When a friend texted to tell him about the shooting, he realized why he wasn\u2019t seeing aircraft: \u201cBecause they\u2019re concerned about being shot at,\u201d he said.</p><p>As deputies set up posts nearby, Deming pointed them to a trail that starts near his backdoor and leads directly to the site of the fire.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want to have to wake up in the middle of the night to figure if somebody\u2019s out prowling around my place,\u201d he said.</p><p>___</p><p>Weber reported from Los Angeles. Associated Press journalists Mead Gruver in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and Josh Funk in Omaha, Nebraska, contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-57e4143642c5a0e98d134051a7147a8920250630</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G56-KS13-RRH5-C43J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"678\"/><timeReceived>12:59 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 30, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Additionally, Weyerhaeuser aims to grow its annual EBITDA from natural climate solutions to $100 million and increase lumber production by 5% each year. These targets reflect Weyerhaeuser's focus on fostering growth while prioritizing environmental sustainability.</p><p>Weyerhaeuser also reiterated its leadership in Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance, with a goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2040. Furthermore, the company is committed to maintaining robust shareholder returns through a sustainable dividend policy.

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply.

This investment is projected to expand engineered wood products capacity by 10 million cubic feet, positioning Weyerhaeuser to seize greater market share in the growing housing sector. While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.</p><p>Shareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program</p><p>Following completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.</p><p>Maintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges</p><p>Weyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.</p><p>Strengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility</p><p>The company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.</p><p>Capital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing</p><p>Management refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.</p><p>Focused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency</p><p>Excluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.</p><p>Expansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth</p><p>Weyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.</p><p>Unlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures</p><p>The announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.</p><p>Timberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base</p><p>Management advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.</p><p>Operational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures</p><p>Initiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.</p><p>Proactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities</p><p>Reserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties. By maintaining adequate coverage for contingent liabilities, Weyerhaeuser bolsters its balance sheet resilience. However, potential over-reserving may tie up capital unnecessarily and requires vigilant management assessment.</p><p>Prioritizing Workforce Stability Amid Labor Market Tightness</p><p>Recognizing a 4.1% unemployment rate as a constraint, Weyerhaeuser focused on hiring and talent retention across its segments.

According to news reporting out of Jiangsu, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"With the increasing impacts of global climate change, forest fires pose an increasingly severe threat to ecosystems and human societies. This study delves into the imperative realm of forest fire risk prediction, which is crucial in escalating threats exacerbated by global climate change.\" </p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Nanjing University, \"This study significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of the predictions by introducing a hybrid model integrating the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and the genetic algorithm (GA). Compared to traditional neural networks, the genetic algorithm-backpropagation neural network (GA-BP) model exhibits significant advantages in weight optimization, overcoming limitations of BP networks such as slow learning rates and susceptibility to local optima. The experimental results demonstrate that the GA-BP model, under various combinations of neuron counts and activation functions, improves accuracy by nearly 10% and reduces loss values by almost 47%.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"These outcomes emphasize the effectiveness of the GA-BP model in forest fire risk prediction, providing valuable insights and a robust framework for proactive risk management and ecosystem preservation amidst escalating threats of severe forest fires.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Climate Change Impacts On Wildfire Risk Indices Forecast Based On an Improved Genetic Neural Network Algorithm: a Case Study of Guangxi, China.

As wildfires have emerged into a global phenomenon with far-reaching impacts on the natural and built environments, FSM simulations provide crucial information to better understand and predict fire behavior in various landscapes. In this study, we tested Cell2Fire, a recently developed cellular automata-based FSM, against benchmarking models used in the U.S., Canada, and Chile. We experimented on synthetically generated landscapes (homogeneous and heterogeneous mix of fuels), applying Cell2Fire for the first time on U.S. landscapes, and found a high level of agreement between Cell2Fire and existing FSMs. However, FSMs may not always produce realistic simulations. In response, we used two optimization methods to improve the simulation\u2019s accuracy. First, we adopted a multi-objective optimization algorithm that scales the elliptical shape of the Cell2Fire\u2019s output based on rate of spread (ROS) and eccentricity. </p><p>Second, we optimized four adjustment factors related to the fire spread (head ROS, back ROS, flank ROS, and eccentricity) using blackbox optimization (i.e., derivative-free optimization), minimizing the discrepancy of the output with respect to real burn data. We assessed the effectiveness of the optimization on the 2001 Dogrib Fire in Alberta, Canada and found that the optimized Cell2Fire result more accurately predicted the real burn in comparison to Prometheus (standard Canadian FSM), increasing F1-score from 0.74 to 0.83. Further, Cell2Fire exhibited better computational efficiency, with simulation runtime increasing linearly compared to Prometheus\u2019 runtime increasing exponentially. From these results, users can adjust Cell2Fire and simulate more realistic burns and surpass the capabilities of benchmark FSMs, integrating local or custom-made FSM data to expand the simulator\u2019s application.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>Climate change has exacerbated fire-conducive weather conditions1,2, while urbanization and fuel accumulation from decades of fire exclusion have exposed our communities and environments to a greater risk of catastrophic wildfires3,4. The risk of these wildfires poses an immediate and direct impact on our communities, destroying buildings and property, damaging and irrevocably altering ecosystems, and claiming human lives and assets. The far-reaching devastation of wildfires serves as a reminder that we still need to better predict, mitigate, and fight against these hazards. As wildfires continue to occur worldwide5, 6\u20137, there is a pressing need to better understand the potential behavior and effects of fire8.</p><p>In light of these trends, we explore Cell2Fire9 a cellular automata fire growth simulator, which has been applied in Canada9, Spain10 and Chile11. This study presents the first application of the Cell2Fire in the U.S., simulating fire spread across both synthetic and real landscapes. In addition, we adopt an ellipse optimization algorithm12 that helps scale the elliptical shape of Cell2Fire\u2019s simulated outputs to resemble those of existing simulators more closely. We also use BlackBox Optimization (BBO)13 (i.e., derivative-free optimization) which optimizes adjustment factors for rate of spread (ROS) needed to fine-tune the simulation output with respect to real burn scars.</p><p>In fire management, FSMs can be used to simulate and predict wildfire propagation, which helps to better plan and mitigate against wildfire risk8,14. These models are often integrated into spatial decision support systems8,15 and are essential computational tools for operational wildfire management applications such as burn probability and wildfire risk mapping9,16, 17, 18\u201319, fire suppression19, 20\u201321, landscape management9,22, forest tactical management9,10,16,17, fuel management17,23, prescribed fire allocation24 and fire evacuation modeling25,26. Semi-empirical FSMs are often used in operational fire management, which are based on simplified abstractions of complex fire physics and use empirically modeled relationships tested with local fuel, topography, and weather conditions15,27. However, some semi-empirical FSMs are non-spatial and simulate only a single fuel type under constant input parameters (e.g., Behave28 and the Canadian forest Fire Behavior Prediction (FBP) system29). To spatially simulate fire spread over heterogeneous landscapes, semi-empirical models can be integrated with a spread simulator to propagate fire growth in a spatially-explicit manner. In particular, FarSite20 and Prometheus30 are two FSMs that can simulate 2D fire spread used in the U.S. and Canada, respectively, and are considered to be the best-performing in their regions31. FarSite uses Behave28 and Prometheus uses FBP29 to compute fire behavior outputs like rate of spread (ROS). Both FarSite and Prometheus, then, simulate fire growth based on Huygens\u2019 principle of elliptical propagation, which assumes that fire propagates as a wave of independent elliptical wavelets, where every point on the edge of the fire front acts as an independent source of secondary wavelets32. This theory has been extended to a set of partial differential equations to model fire growth across a heterogeneous landscape33 like in FarSite20. Despite their usage in operational wildfire management20,34, however, vector-based models can become computationally expensive for larger areas and longer time periods, in addition to causing fire crossovers and unburned islands in the simulations35. The computational efficiency of these models scales poorly for large-scale fires and simulations can significantly underestimate real burns. Post-processing would be required to address accuracy issues in the simulations but would require manual adjustments and expert judgment. For instance, FarSite struggles with prolonged fires under changing environmental conditions36 and Prometheus relies on adjustments to calibrate to different geographic locations, which further increases computational burden. Alternatively, Cell2Fire was initially developed based on the Canadian FBP system, enabling efficient simulations and the integration of decision-making models9. Fire spread in Cell2Fire occurs via cellular automata growth based on the head ROS (HROS), back ROS (BROS), and flank ROS (FROS) computed by the integrated FSM (i.e., FBP). Cell2Fire carries numerous advantages over existing models, including computing efficiency via parallel processing and its modular nature to allow the integration of different FSMs in the processing pipeline. In comparison to Prometheus, Pais et al. (2021) found that Cell2Fire can simulate up to 30 times faster and at a comparable accuracy (above 90% accuracy)9.</p><p>In this study, we first test Cell2Fire in the U.S. by evaluating against FarSite (i.e., benchmark FSM used in the U.S.) on homogeneous (i.e., single fuel model type) and heterogeneous fuels under constant weather conditions. Testing on heterogeneous landscape shows how well Cell2Fire can simulate spatially explicit fire spread over a diverse set of fuel types. While FSMs can reproduce expected fire behavior, the simulated outputs may not follow the actual propagation of real wildfires. Real wildfires pose multiple challenges including complex fuel mixes, variable weather, and large-scale fire spread, which are relevant to evaluate FSM performance. To address this discrepancy, we use the 2001 Dogrib Fire (Alberta, Canada) as a case study to apply BBO and enhance the accuracy of Cell2Fire simulations with respect to the real burn scar. We selected this case study due to the availability of high-quality, preprocessed datasets, which would be critical for evaluating Cell2Fire and BBO under realistic conditions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Results</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fire spread simulations on homogeneous landscapes</emphasis></p><p>We simulated fire spread on homogeneous landscapes for different wind speeds over a five-hour duration. We selected the four most common fuel model types found in Northern California (GR1: Short, sparse, dry climate grass; GR2: Low load, dry climate grass primarily grass; GS2: Moderate load dry climate grass-shrub; TU5: Very high load, dry climate timber-shrub). In Fig. 1, we show results from two fuel types (GR1 and TU5) under three different wind speeds (10, 30, 50 mph). The temporal evolution of the fire for Cell2Fire (colored) and FarSite (black outlines) is shown on the left panel, and the amount of under and over-estimation computed as a difference of FarSite and Cell2Fire on the right panel. Cell2Fire\u2019s outputs were similar to those of FarSite at lower wind speeds, as expected due to the low eccentricity and minimal impact of elliptical distortion. At high wind speeds (i.e., 50 mph), however, Cell2Fire tended to overestimate over time in fuels with high expected ROS like GR1. This overestimation trend is also visible in GR2 and, to a lesser extent, GS2 (See Supplementary Fig. S4). This result may be explained by how FarSite can cause severely elongated elliptical shapes due to the high eccentricity at high wind speeds12,20.</p><p>Fig. 1</p><p>Fire spread simulation outputs on homogeneous landscapes under constant wind speeds comparing Cell2Fire and FarSite simulations. Panels A to C represent simulation outputs for fuel type GR1, while panels D to F for fuel type TU5. For each fuel type, three wind speed scenarios are considered: 10 mph (panels A, D), 30 mph (panels B, E), and 50 mph (panels C, F). The colored regions represent the fire spread simulated by Cell2Fire over five hours. The black-line ellipses represent the corresponding final fire perimeter simulated by FarSite (i.e., perimeter at the 5th hour). The difference maps adjacent to each fire spread simulation illustrate the discrepancy between the final burn area of the two models. Red indicates overestimation by Cell2Fire, blue indicates underestimation, and white indicates no difference.</p><p>To better understand the differences in the Cell2Fire and FarSite simulations, the amount of under and overestimation in conjunction with error and accuracy metrics are depicted in Fig. 2 to show the difference between the simulations over different wind speeds, highlighting the amount of Cell2Fire\u2019s underestimation (blue) and overestimation (red). Figure 2B and D display the error (\u0394Burned pixels and RMSE) and accuracy metrics (F1-score and structural similarity index (SSIM)) over different wind speeds. In more detail, the accuracy assessment revealed a high level of agreement between Cell2Fire and FarSite as demonstrated by how F1-score and SSIM exceeded 0.9 and 0.95, respectively, for all fuel models and wind speeds. In general, F1-score continuously improved to 30 mph wind speed and plateaued or decreased at higher wind speeds. SSIM decreased slightly with higher wind speeds, while error metrics, RMSE and \u0394Burned pixels, reflected this trend and tended to increase.</p><p>Fig. 2</p><p>Accuracy and error assessment of fire spread simulations on homogeneous landscapes for fuel types GR1 and TU5.

Fire spread simulation results and error metrics are provided in Supplementary Figs. S5 and S6 for Cell2Fire-FBP results, as well as Table S9 for Cell2Fire-FBP error metrics, while Supplementary Figs. S10-S12 and Supplementary Table S10 show Cell2Fire-KITRAL results and error metrics. For Cell2Fire-FBP, all fuel models returned high F1-scores (F1-scoreavg=0.95) and low RMSE (RMSEavg=0.21); however, SSIM was relatively lower (SSIMavg=0.78) compared to Cell2Fire-Behave results. This can be explained by the smaller homogeneous landscape grids used for Cell2Fire-FBP, and the simulated fire\u2019s extent would exceed the defined grid. The exception is fuel model D2 (Green Aspen with BUI Thresholding), which yielded a very high SSIM (0.91), thus suggesting that Cell2Fire is capable of highly accurate simulations, regardless of the completion of the fire ellipse. Notably, Cell2Fire-FBP tended to overestimate the back of the ellipse and underestimate the front. For Cell2Fire-KITRAL, the majority of fuel models returned high accuracy and low error (F1-scoreavg=0.91, SSIMavg=0.92, RMSEavg=0.15). One exception is represented by the PCH1 fuel type (Dense mesomorphic grassland), where simulation led to less accurate results (F1-score = 0.83, SSIM = 0.61). Visualization of the simulation result shows severe underestimation at the back of the ellipse, which is likely due to the rigid shape, rather than being rounded and elliptical. Furthermore, simulations for PCH1 and PCH2 (Sparse mesomorphic grassland) exceeded the grid\u2019s defined size, which can explain the relatively high error and low accuracy results.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fire spread simulations on heterogeneous landscapes</emphasis></p><p>We tested Cell2Fire on heterogeneous landscapes from Santa Barbara, California (U.S.) under constant weather conditions without topography, and Fig. 3 displays the study area and fire spread simulation results with accuracy and error metrics. We selected this landscape because of the numerous fuel types (16 types) including the most common types found in California (GR2, GS2, TU5)37 and the heightened risk of wildfires occurring in this region of the U.S. Figure 3A is a Landsat-8 satellite image of the study area. Figure 3B shows the fuel map (30 m spatial resolution) and Fig. 3C plots the spatial distribution and pixel proportion of each fuel model types. Figure 3D displays the fire\u2019s hourly propagation over the 10-hour time period with FarSite\u2019s final fire perimeter (10 h-simulation). The difference between the two fire spread simulation results is shown in Fig. 3E and plotted as a measure of the total burned area over elapsed time in Fig. 3F overestimated the front and underestimated the flank and back of the final fire spread perimeter. The under and overestimation mostly occurred during the final few hours. For quantitative assessment, accuracy and error metrics were plotted and displayed in Figs. 3G-J. F1-score and SSIM were found to consistently be high (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">F</emphasis>1<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">average</emphasis> = 0.92 and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">SSIM</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">average</emphasis>=0.98), while RMSE increased proportionally with elapsed time, thus indicating that Cell2Fire simulations burned a similar area but tended to deviate over time. To enhance the robustness of the simulations, we conducted an uncertainty analysis by running various combinations of adjustment factors (HROS, BROS, FROS, eccentricity) to assess Cell2Fire\u2019s performance. We use refined search bounds for each adjustment factor and find that the simulated result ranges between F1 scores of 0.75 to 0.94 (See Supplementary Fig. S14). We add error bars to Figs. 3G-J for all recorded evaluation metrics.

We selected the Dogrib Fire because of its detailed fire behavior data and weather stream data provided as an open-source sample dataset with the Prometheus software download30. Simulation outputs based on real landscapes in Portezuelo, Chile under variable weather conditions are also provided in Supplementary Section S5. Figure 4A displays the landscape\u2019s FBP fuels, elevation, slope, and aspect. Then, Fig. 4B shows the final fire spread outputs from Prometheus, Cell2Fire, and Cell2Fire optimized with BBO together with the actual burn scar\u2019s perimeter. In Fig. 4C, the differences between each simulation output from Fig. 4B is show in terms of under and overestimation with respect to the actual burn scar. Lastly, in Fig. 4D, accuracy and error metrics were computed for the three instances (Cell2Fire, Prometheus, Cell2Fire with BBO) against the actual burn scar.</p><p>Similar to the previous experiments on homogeneous and heterogeneous landscapes, Cell2Fire was able to accurately emulate Prometheus (F1-score = 0.88) with low deviation (RMSE = 0.178 m/min) (See Supplementary Fig. S7A). However, merely mimicking benchmark FSMs is not sufficient to accurately predict the burn scar, as shown by the large underestimation in the instances \u201cPrometheus vs. Real\u201d and \u201cCell2Fire vs. Real\u201d in Fig. 4C. Comparing Cell2Fire with the real burn scar, the accuracy drops considerably (F1-score = 0.74, RMSE = 0.11 m/min). To address this issue, Cell2Fire was optimized using BBO and the ROS adjustment factors helped improved the simulation\u2019s accuracy considerably with respect to the real burn scar (F1-score = 0.83, RMSE = 0.079 m/min), which is also reflected by a reduction in underestimation in the northeast corner of the burn scar.</p><p>We also conducted uncertainty analysis for the Dogrib fire. First, we created 1,000 different weather stream files with randomly perturbed wind speed, relative humidity, and temperature values (perturbation range between 0 and 2). We started with weather parameters9 reflecting severe weather conditions in accordance with the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) System (See Sect. 6 in Supplementary Materials). To note, this is the same weather data used for simulations shown in Fig. 4. We discover that F1-scores for Cell2Fire ranges between 0.65 and 0.75, while Cell2Fire with BBO ranges between 0.74 and 0.83 (See Supplementary Fig. S15 in Supplementary Materials).</p><p>Fig. 4</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fire spread simulation on a real landscape based on the Dogrib Fire (2001)</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Canada</emphasis>.

To assess the relationship between adjustment factors and model performance, we analyze the Spearman correlation coefficient on the evaluation metrics for each adjustment factor (HROS, BROS, FROS, eccentricity). We find that eccentricity has the strongest influence on improving accuracy. HROS adjustment is weakly correlated while BROS and FROS have no significant influence. Furthermore, we computed feature importance using Shapley values38 on machine learning models trained on BehavePlus data and FBP data (See Supplementary Fig. S16 and Fig. S17, respectively, for SHAP summary plots). We filter the prepared input datasets for the US and Canada and train an XGBoost regression model to predict HROS, BROS, and FROS (See Supplementary Figs. S18 and S19 for train and test loss curves). The SHAP values reveal that wind speed, 1 H moisture content, and 1-hour fuel load was most influential on HROS predictions. For BROS and FROS predictions, 1-hour moisture content, fuel bed depth, and wind speed were the most important. For FBP, the fuel model type and wind speed were the most important features for HROS and FROS predictions. For BROS, fine fuel moisture code (FFMC) and fuel model type were the most important.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Discussion</emphasis></p><p>In this study, we applied Cell2Fire to simulate fire spread on homogeneous, heterogeneous, and real landscapes in various geographic regions (U.S., Canada, Chile). We generated accurate fire spread simulations comparable to the best-performing FSMs31 and enhanced Cell2Fire\u2019s simulated outputs to better reproduce real burn scars via data-driven optimization. In more detail, we optimized Cell2Fire by using BBO and found optimal adjustment factors for HROS, BROS, FROS, and eccentricity to generate more realistic fire spread simulations of historical burn scars, surpassing the capability of conventional benchmark models like Prometheus.</p><p>We confirmed that Cell2Fire can emulate benchmark FSMs accurately in homogeneous landscape scenarios. In the heterogeneous landscape scenario, the simulated output tended to be underestimated at the back and flanks as well as overestimated at the front of the burned area. This result can be explained by the homogeneous landscape examples at a wind speed of 10 mph (See Fig. 1), where we can see underestimation at the back and overestimation at the front of the fire ellipse. Nevertheless, we note that Cell2Fire recorded high F1 and SSIM scores, and the over and underestimation regions may appear to be magnified due to the input data\u2019s resolution (30-m resolution) and the figure\u2019s scale. We also confirmed that Cell2Fire was very effective in heterogeneous landscapes as well as even under variable weather and complex terrain in the 2001 Dogrib Fire instance. In particular, the accuracy improvements via optimization in the 2001 Dogrib Fire (F1-score increase from 0.74 to 0.83) reflects a significant reduction in underestimation (false positives and false negatives) with respect to the real burn scar. From a fire management perspective, the consequences of underestimation can be more severe than overestimation. Underpredicting can expose critical areas to heightened levels of uncertainty, thereby escalating risk to life and infrastructure in the unprotected areas. As a result, optimization helps Cell2Fire produce more reliable and realistic predictions to better inform decision-making.</p><p>Cell2Fire can help facilitate the development and experimentation of FSMs by fitting the models to updated ROS data and optimizing the simulator with more recent historical burn data. This opens the opportunity for users to use locally created fuel maps and FSM data, providing the flexibility to apply any existing FSMs, experimental FSMs, and even custom rule-based FSMs. To this end, the optimization option can be used as a computational tool for practitioners to find appropriate adjustments as they keep their fire management systems up-to-date by collecting new data such as records of wildfire burn areas. Furthermore, Cell2Fire can be combined with FSMs from different regions to expand the fire spread simulation framework on a global scale. Data democratization together with open-source code such as Cell2Fire help make fire spread simulations more globally applicable and more accessible to a greater diversity of users. For instance, many other countries have also developed their own FSMs such as Australia39, South Africa40, Portugal41 and other countries in Europe42. Some FSMs have been developed to work at a global scale43. Recent works attempted to map fire behavior data at a global scale, collecting 6,000 individual entries from 33 countries including Australia (25.6%), the U.S. (17.2%), Canada (8.1%), and South Africa (21.1%) as of May 201840. In particular, open-source datasets on cloud-based platforms such as Google Earth Engine can be used as proxy measurements to substitute for complex input features needed to compute FSMs. Future works should exploit these rich data inventories in conjunction with novel, multimodal remote sensing sensors. To note, FSMs can have inherent limitations since semi-empirical models are based on simplified physics (e.g., Rothermel) and are recorded from relatively mild, steady-state environmental conditions15. Hence, there is a need to develop more sophisticated FSMs that can reliably reflect extreme fire behavior8.</p><p>Applying Cell2Fire with BBO is effective for strategic fire management but may be limited for operational real-time applications. For instance, during wildfire operations, data needed for BBO may not be available (e.g., burn perimeter). One alternative option is to find optimal BBO parameters in advance by running simulations on past fires under similar geographic and environmental conditions. While this may help fine-tune Cell2Fire for specific cases, further analysis would be required to adapt Cell2Fire to different ecosystems and wildfire scenarios.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methods</emphasis></p><p>We provide a flowchart of the methodology used in this study in Fig. 5. In the following sections, we explain input datasets used to compute ROS in FSMs, input grids needed to run Cell2Fire, fire growth logic, and optimization techniques.</p><p>Fig. 5</p><p>Overview of study\u2019s workflow using Cell2Fire with optimization. Input variables for the FSMs of interest (e.g., Behave, FBP, KITRAL) are used to compute HROS, BROS, FROS. The FSM is integrated in Cell2Fire, where fire growth occurs via cellular automata and FSM logic. The FSM data can also be fitted (e.g., curve fitting, surrogate modeling using machine learning) for sensitivity analysis or ported into Cell2Fire to create custom FSMs. Users can apply ellipse optimization (i.e., multi-objective optimization of elliptical shape factors) to scale simulated outputs with respect to existing simulators like FarSite. Blackbox optimization can also be used to find optimal ROS adjustment factors when a reference shape is available (e.g., real burn scar).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Preparing input data for FSMs</emphasis></p><p>We first computed HROS, BROS, and FROS outputs from each FSM (i.e., Behave, FBP, KITRAL). We detail the parameter spaces in Supplementary Tables S6\u2013S8. We then combined the input features and the three ROS outputs in tabular form, such that each row represents data obtained from a single simulated run of the FSM. For Behave, we used the open-source Rothermel package in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">R</emphasis>44 to calculate ROS45. Input features included the fuel model type, fuel loads (1-hour, 10-hour, 100-hour, woody, herbaceous), moisture of extinction, surface area/volume ratios (1-hour, woody, herbaceous), fuel bed depth, wind speed, wind direction, slope. We also included fuel moisture content based on scenarios (D1L1 (very low dead and live fuel moisture), D2L2 (low dead and live fuel moisture), D3L3 (moderate dead and live fuel moisture), D4L4 (high dead and live fuel moisture)) from Scott and Burgan (2005)14. In total, we used 19 input features with varying combinations based on four features (fuel model, wind speed, wind direction, slope, moisture content scenario) to create 218,880 samples (40 fuel models, 19 wind speeds, 4 wind directions, 18 slope values, and 4 moisture content scenarios). Surface ROS using Behave is calculated using the Rothermel equation:1.</p><p>where R is the ROS at the flame\u2019s front, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">I</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">R</emphasis> is the reaction intensity, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03d5</emphasis>wind is the dimensionless wind factor, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03d5</emphasis>slope is the dimensionless slope factor, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03c1</emphasis>bulk is the bulk density,  is the effective heating number, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Q</emphasis>ig is the heat of pre-ignition45. For FBP, input features included fuel model code, wind speed, FFMC, Buildup Index (BUI), and slope factors29. Fuel model codes are associated with a set of parameters used to estimate the ROS, which is calculated by a combination of basic ROS derived from experimental results (i.e., extrapolation from field measurements for each fuel type), slope effects, moisture using the FFMC, and accounting for the amount of fuel available for combustion (BUI)29. In practice, we varied five main input variables (fuel model, wind speed, FFMC, BUI, and slope), obtaining a total of 180,000 samples (18 fuel models, 16 wind speeds, 5 FFMCs, 5 BUIs, 25 slope values). When computing ROS in the heading direction, the FBP system involves three steps: Calculate ROS using initial spread index and fuel type; modify ROS for slope factor; and modify ROS according to BUI. KITRAL was developed in Chile based on data collected from the previous 30 years. Input features included fuel model type, wind speed, moisture content, heat, fuel load, propagation factor inherent to each fuel, moisture content factor, slope factor, and wind factor. Surface ROS using the KITRAL system is estimated as:2</p><p>where <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">R</emphasis> represents surface ROS; <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">F</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">FM</emphasis> denotes a fuel model factor for no-wind, no-slope ROS conditions; <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">F</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">MC</emphasis> corresponds to a moisture content formula where humidity of the fine and dead particles as estimated from relative humidity and ambient temperature; <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">F</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">slope</emphasis> is a slope factor [%] based on an empirical equation that considers terrain slope spacing; and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">F</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">wind</emphasis> is a dimensionless wind factor. In total, 10 input features were used and four features (fuel model, moisture content, wind speed, slope) were varied to generate 110,019 samples (31 fuel models, 21 moisture content scenarios, 13 wind speeds, and 13 slope values).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Preparing input data for Cell2Fire</emphasis></p><p>For homogeneous landscapes, we selected four of the most common fuel models from the 40-class Scott and Burgan fuels14 found in California, namely, GR1, GR2, GS2, TU537. Homogeneous grids for Cell2Fire-Behave were cropped to either 100 by 100 or 500 by 500 pixels \u2013 the latter grid size for higher wind speeds and fuels with a higher expected ROS. Homogeneous grids for Cell2Fire-FBP and Cell2Fire-KITRAL were set to 20 by 20 pixels and 80 by 80 pixels, respectively. All homogeneous grids were set to a 100-meter spatial resolution. For the heterogeneous landscape scenario, we used the LANDFIRE 2016 landscape file, which includes a 30-meter resolution fuel map based on the 40-class Scott and Burgan classification14. For this study area, we tested constant topographic and weather conditions. We set a constant wind speed of six mph heading southeast and simulated the fire spread for 10 h. Lastly, we set the moisture content to the most extreme weather scenario (\u201cD1L1\u201d scenario in Scott and Burgan (2005)14 which corresponds to very low dead fuel moisture with fully cured herbaceous vegetation). For the real landscape scenario, the fuel map was acquired based on the Canadian FBP system at a 100-meter resolution. Topography was set based on the acquired elevation, slope and aspect at the same resolution. Weather stream data was acquired from the Yaha Tinda weather station situated nearby, and the ignition point was set at the coordinate (51.652876, \u2212115.477908) as in Pais et al. (2021b)9. The simulation burned for eight hours starting from October 16, 2001, such that the fire spread would capture the major burned area (i.e., 90% of the total burn).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Integrating FSM logic into Cell2Fire</emphasis></p><p>To run Cell2Fire in different regions, we first fitted ensemble models using input data from an FSM (i.e., Behave, FBP, KITRAL) and integrated the model as a binary executable file into Cell2Fire, where HROS, BROS, and FROS are predicted at each time step for each cell of interest. The input data and ROS outputs can be used to build custom fitted FSMs that can be created in Python and ported into C + + where Cell2Fire runs natively. Cell2Fire intakes regularly-sized grids of fuel, topography (elevation, slope, aspect), and canopy (canopy height, canopy base height, canopy bulk density, canopy cover), as well as a weather stream file defined at regular temporal intervals (wind speed, wind direction). Each cell contains attributes including the fuel type, elevation, slope, location as coordinates, and status for simulation logic (\u201cAvailable\u201d, \u201cBurning\u201d, \u201cBurned\u201d, \u201cTreated\u201d, or \u201cNon-Fuel\u201d). \u201cAvailable\u201d cells are burnable, \u201cBurning\u201d cells denote where fire can spread during the time step, \u201cBurned\u201d cells experienced previous burns, \u201cTreated\u201d cells are defined for harvest treatments, and \u201cNon-Fuel\u201d cells are non-burnable and do not ignite. See Supplementary Fig. S1 for a visualization of Cell2Fire\u2019s fire spread process.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ignition</emphasis>: Given an ignition point (ignition can also be pre-defined point(s) or randomly selected), the coincident cell is ignited, and the fire\u2019s growth may spread to its eight neighboring cells during the time step. In Cell2Fire, this cellular automata growth is modeled as an ellipse emanating from a burning cell to its eight neighbors. The geometry of this ellipse is determined by the HROS, BROS, and FROS, which is then used to compute ROS along each axis to its eight neighboring cells. In more detail, we compute the semi-major axis, semi-minor axis, and eccentricity of the ellipse as a function of ROS (See Sect. 3 Supplementary Materials for a more comprehensive explanation of the elliptical fire spread). We assume that the distance from the centroid of an ignited cell to the centroids of neighboring cells is computed as the straight distance influenced by a slope factor.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fire spread</emphasis>: Fire spread from a \u201cBurning\u201d cell can reach any of its eight neighboring pixels if the fire reaches the center of the adjacent, available pixel and exceeds a given ROS threshold based on the pixel\u2019s environmental conditions. Once the fire ignites the adjacent pixel(s), the status of the affected pixels is updated (i.e., \u201cAvailable\u201d to \u201cBurning\u201d), and the fire propagates until the specific ending criterion is reached (e.g., specified time, maximum simulation time, or no more fuel available). Hence, successful fire spread occurs when the ROS along an axis reaches the center of a neighboring cell, thus creating a new ellipse with the neighbor\u2019s cell as the focus.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stopping criteria</emphasis>: Fire spread ceases when the spread reaches a non-burnable fuel (e.g., Non-Fuel) or the input grid edge and there are no more neighboring cells available, the spread fails to successfully reach neighboring cells, or the simulation time period (defined in the weather stream file) has passed.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ellipse optimization and ROS adjustments</emphasis></p><p>Simulated outputs from cellular automata growth model may exhibit an angular elliptical shape in the fire\u2019s heading direction46, 47\u201348 (See Supplementary Fig. S2 for a visual explanation). To emulate existing vector-based FSMs and predict real burn scars more accurately, we adopted a two optimization approaches: (1) Multi-objective optimization using shape correction factors to enhance the ROS distributions at multiple angles12 by minimizing the mean squared error and (2) BBO methods13 to find optimal parameters of ROS and eccentricity adjustment factors by minimizing the Frobenius norm (i.e., computed between the reference burn and simulated output). Since the optimization algorithm depends on the eccentricity of the simulated output\u2019s elliptical shape (a function of wind speed), the optimization process can be applied universally to any fuel model type and geographic region.</p><p>For the ellipse optimization, we used five correction factors designed from ROS-based equations (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis>1,., <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis>5), as proposed by Ghisu et al. (2015)12. In more detail, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis>1 increases the maximum ROS, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis>2 modifies the ellipse\u2019s eccentricity (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">E</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">bar</emphasis>), <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis>3 modifies the dependency of ROS on the angle from effective wind direction in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">head</emphasis> direction, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis>4 modifies the dependency of ROS on the angle from effective wind direction in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">back</emphasis> direction, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis>5 modifies propagation speed in the back direction.89101112</p><p>A multi-objective optimization algorithm was used to optimize these <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis> factors and update the elliptical shapes based on eccentricity (a function of wind speed). In this study, we used the open-source <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Optuna</emphasis> hyperparameter optimization package49 to find optimal shape correction factors for different eccentricity values, starting from a circle (i.e., no wind conditions where eccentricity equals zero) up to the corner case when the eccentricity of the ellipse approaches a unit value and mimics a thin line in the main wind direction. We optimized the correction factors using mean squared error with the following logic and parameter spaces:</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"312\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"312\"/><thead><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">Minimize</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\">?<sub>s</sub></entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Subject to</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1 ? <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis><sub>1</sub> ? 2</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\">1 ? <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis><sub>2</sub> ? 2</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\">0 ? <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis><sub>3</sub> ? 1</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\">0 ? <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis><sub>4</sub> ? 1</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\">1 ? <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis><sub>5</sub> ? 2</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>where <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03bb</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">s</emphasis> is the shape factor and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> corresponds to correction factors for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> = 1 to 5.</p><p>For the BBO, we incorporated four adjustment factors for HROS, FROS, BROS, and eccentricity50. We initialize the optimization by setting all adjustment factors to a value of 1. Optimal factors are found via a simulator-optimization scheme using BBO13 algorithms to test a new set of factors until an -tolerance equal to 1<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">e</emphasis>\u22126 between ten consecutive solutions is achieved or if the algorithm reaches the maximum number of iterations. To obtain robust results, we repeated this process across all fuel types. For the 2001 Dogrib Fire, the best results in terms of the objective function and convergence time of the solution were obtained with the Bound Optimization BY Quadratic Approximation algorithm51. We used Frobenius norm as the objective function, which is computed between the real Dogrib Fire\u2019s burn scar and Cell2Fire\u2019s simulated burn scar generated using the updated set of adjustment factors during the optimization. These implementations are available as part of Cell2Fire for future or custom adjustments as needed by researchers and practitioners.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>The authors acknowledge the support of C3.ai through the grant Multiscale analysis for Improved Risk Assessment of Wildfires facilitated by Data and Computation.

According to news reporting from Prague, Czech Republic, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Forest fires significantly disrupt global ecosystems. Many forecasting techniques predict fire activity and allocate prevention resources, but various factors are missing from the assessments, and multi-criteria decision approaches alone are insufficient.\" </p><p><br/> Financial support for this research came from NAZV. <br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague, \"This work introduced a novel methodology combining artificial neural networks (ANN) with the analytical hierarchy process (AHP), fuzzy AHP multi-criteria methods, and spatial data to detect potential forest fire vulnerability areas using twenty variables. The results from AHP or fuzzy AHP, were processed using a multilayer perceptron with a backpropagation algorithm. The final ANN model has two objectives: first, to create a forest fire vulnerability with four classes (low, moderate, high, and very high), and second, to classify burned area sizes in regions highly or very highly vulnerable to fire. Evaluation metrics were also applied for validation. The fire model was tested using both literature review data and in situ observations. Comparative analysis showed that the burned area size model performed better than other machine learning methods, achieving an accuracy score of 89%. Meanwhile, the fire vulnerability model scored 82%. The study addresses the problem of prediction and provides an algorithm for classifying fire risk based on historical data in the Czech Republic, offering a master model for future forest management. Therefore, the ANN model, once trained, validated, and tested, does not require resetting and is effective for estimating forest fire vulnerability.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Moreover, it produces results quickly, providing rapid insights into complex forest ecosystems, saving time and enhancing understanding for decision-makers.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: New Forest Fire Assessment Model Based On Artificial Neural Network and Analytic Hierarchy Process or Fuzzy-analytic Hierarchy Process Methodology for Fire Vulnerability Map.

According to news reporting originating from Toronto, Canada, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"The Global Forest Fire Emissions Prediction System (GFFEPS) is a model that estimates biomass burning in near-real time for global air quality forecasting. The model uses a bottom-up approach, based on remotely sensed hotspot locations, and global databases linking burned area per hotspot to ecosystem-type classification at a 1 km resolution.\" </p><p><br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Environment and Climate Change Canada: \"Unlike other global fire emissions models, GFFEPS provides dynamic estimates of fuel consumption, fire behaviour and fire growth based on the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System, plant phenology as calculated from daily global weather and burned-area estimates using near-real-time Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) satellite-detected hotspots and historical burned-area statistics. Combining forecasts of daily fire weather and hourly meteorological conditions with a global land classification, GFFEPS produces fuel consumption and emission predictions in 3 h time steps (in contrast to non-dynamic models that use fixed consumption rates and require a collection of burned area to make post-burn estimates of emissions). GFFEPS has been designed for use in operational forecasting applications as well as historical simulations for which data are available. A study was conducted showing GFFEPS predictions through a 6-year period (2015-2020). Regional annual total smoke emissions, burned area and total fuel consumption per unit area as predicted by GFFEPS were generated to assess model performance over multiple years and regions. The model's fuel consumption per unit area results clearly distinguished regions dominated by grassland (Africa) from those dominated by forests (boreal regions) and showed high variability in regions affected by El Nino and deforestation. GFFEPS carbon emissions and burned area were then compared to other global wildfire emissions models, including the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS), the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED4.1s) and the Fire INventory from NCAR (FINN 1.5 and 2.5). GFFEPS estimated values lower than GFAS and GFED (80 % and 74 %) and had values similar to FINN 1.5 (97 %).\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"This was largely due to the impact of fuel moisture on consumption rates as captured by the dynamic weather modelling. Model evaluation efforts to date are described - an ongoing effort is underway to further validate the model, with further developments and improvements expected in the future.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: The Global Forest Fire Emissions Prediction System version 1.0.

As of 15 July, the cumulative total of scorched land stands at 231,539 hectares - 119 per cent above the long-term average  of 105,586 hectares for this time of the year.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In recent weeks, wildfires have forced tens of thousands of people to flee their homes and claimed at least three lives in T\u00fcrkiye, necessitated lockdowns in Catalonia, led to mass evacuations from Crete, and caused havoc around Marseille.

It stands at 1,230 as of 15 July, compared to the average of 478 for this time of year.</p><p>However, most of this increase was felt in February and March due to dry and warm conditions in western and central Europe. The same is true of the unusually high figure for total area burned.\u00a0</p><p>A European Commission official clarified that figures for burned areas after March are very similar to the long-term average.</p><p>Carter isn\u2019t totally sure why some fires are moving earlier in the year. But, broadly speaking, she attributes it to the trend of summers getting warmer and hotter for longer, due to the rise in greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels.\u00a0</p><p>                                                                                                                                            Smoke is seen by rail tracks during a wildfire Tuesday 8 July.

This dries forests out, making them more prone to fires, and meaning that larger areas go up in smoke.</p><p>Up to 16 July, the total estimated carbon emissions from wildfires across all EU countries are 1.9 megatonnes of carbon, according to Mark Parrington, senior scientist at Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS). That\u2019s based on CAMS\u2019 data from its Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS).</p><p>Emissions from wildfires feed into a devastating cycle, making forests even more vulnerable, and so fires more extreme.</p><p>Which countries have been particularly scarred by wildfires this year?</p><p>In T\u00fcrkiye, wildfires in late June and early July have resulted in record burned area figures for this time of the year, the EU Commission official says. This record figure has been driven by the large scale of some of the fires.</p><p>These huge blazes have pushed emissions to a record high in the 22 years of the GFAS dataset,\u00a0 Parrington adds. They are currently around twice the average for the time of year, as fire emissions typically increase at the end of July and into August for T\u00fcrkiye.</p><p>Fire emissions from the UK have also reached their highest annual total of the past 22 years, he says, following large fires in Scotland.</p><p>In wildfire-prone Greece, fires have resulted in a higher-than-usual total burned area for this time of year, too.</p><p>But it\u2019s Romania that leaps out of the bar chart when looking at the EFFIS data for the percentage of the country's area burned by wildfires. Around 23,000 hectares are burnt on average each year, while for 2025 the figure stands at 123,000 hectares.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related</emphasis><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Sea temperature in Portugal's Algarve reaches record highs as 'marine heatwave' hits</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Europe\u2019s summer is getting longer: Heat now lasts up to 5 months in cities like Athens and Tirana</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>Again, officials link this to the anomalous dry and warm fire-spreading conditions from February to March. Since April, burned area figures in Romania have stabilised.</p><p>It can seem \u201clike the whole of Europe is on fire,\u201d says Carter, \u201cbut actually northern Europe is fairly resilient to fire.\u201d</p><p>According to GFW\u2019s annual tree cover loss data, only 3 per cent of tree cover loss in Europe last year was due to fire; the vast majority was instead caused by forestry.\u00a0</p><p>But in southern Europe, it's a different story. The impact can be devastating, with huge proportions of forest loss caused by wildfires in Portugal, Greece, and Spain in recent years.</p><p>Some fires are becoming unfightable</p><p>Better forest management involves embracing a mosaic model, says Carter, with diverse levels of vegetation, and steering clear of flammable species like eucalyptus. Keeping moisture in the soil is key, as is creating fire breaks by removing any flammable material.</p><p>But in some areas, the combination of dry conditions and strong winds means \u201csome fires now are just not going to be able to be fought.\u201d</p><p>                                                                                                                                            Firefighters spray water as they attempt to douse the flames after a severe wildfire near Skagen, Denmark on 14 July.

Smoke from Canadian wildfires is impacting multiple U.S. states, even as far south as Florida. As over 203 active fires rage in Canada as of June 4, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center, wind carrying smoke from the fires have engulfed states in the eastern and central U.S. Many states are reporting moderate air quality levels, but conditions are worse in areas closer to the U.S.-Canadian border. Multiple states in the mid-to-upper Midwest have been flagged as unhealthy for sensitive groups and unhealthy for the overall population, regardless of health conditions, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's AirNow tracker. Areas of Wisconsin and northern Michigan are reporting \"unhealthy\" air quality levels. To check your state's air quality, visit AirNow's website, and plug in your zip code, city or state. Here's what to know as of Wednesday, June 4. Which states have poor air quality? Parts of Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan have air quality that is considered unhealthy for sensitive groups or unhealthy for all, according to AirNow. \"Children, active adults, and people with respiratory disease, such as asthma, should avoid outdoor exertion,\" according to the American Lung Association. \"Everyone else should limit prolonged outdoor exertion.\" Areas in the following states have air that is considered \"Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups,\" which includes people with health conditions like asthma: IndianaIowaIllinoisKansasMichiganMissouriMinnesotaOhioWisconsin Here, \"children, active adults, and people with respiratory disease, such as asthma, should limit prolonged outdoor exertion,\" according to the American Lung Association. Which states may see smoke from Canadian wildfires? See Canadian wildfire map Side effects of inhaling wildfire smoke Wildfire smoke can irritate one's eyes, nose, and throat and cause: Coughing Chest tightness Shortness of breath Dizziness Fatigue Particulate matter, a type of air pollutant that is made of small particles of solids or liquids that are suspended in the air, is one of the main components of wildfire smoke, as USA TODAY previously reported. According to Yale Medicine, the particles can be 10 micrometers, PM 10, or as small as 2.5 micrometers, PM 2.5, and the smaller one poses a lot of health risks. PM2.5 is so tiny it can easily pass people's usual defense mechanisms and dive deep into their lungs. Not only can it damage lung function, but it can also pass into the bloodstream and travel to other organs. The following is linked to exposure to the PM 2.5: Heart attack Stroke Lung cancer Decline in cognitive function Contributing: Janet Loehrke, Ramon Padilla, Karina Zaiets, Yoonserk Pyun; USA TODAY</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-6149002</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FYT-2XW3-RTJW-31TB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"489\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Central Florida Future: University of Central Florida</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 4, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Orlando</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>FL</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000057</classCode><className>AIR QUALITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001481</classCode><className>RESPIRATORY DISORDERS &amp;

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply.

This investment is projected to expand engineered wood products capacity by 10 million cubic feet, positioning Weyerhaeuser to seize greater market share in the growing housing sector. While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.</p><p>Shareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program</p><p>Following completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.</p><p>Maintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges</p><p>Weyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.</p><p>Strengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility</p><p>The company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.</p><p>Capital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing</p><p>Management refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.</p><p>Focused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency</p><p>Excluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.</p><p>Expansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth</p><p>Weyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.</p><p>Unlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures</p><p>The announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.</p><p>Timberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base</p><p>Management advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.</p><p>Operational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures</p><p>Initiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.</p><p>Proactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities</p><p>Reserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties. By maintaining adequate coverage for contingent liabilities, Weyerhaeuser bolsters its balance sheet resilience. However, potential over-reserving may tie up capital unnecessarily and requires vigilant management assessment.</p><p>Prioritizing Workforce Stability Amid Labor Market Tightness</p><p>Recognizing a 4.1% unemployment rate as a constraint, Weyerhaeuser focused on hiring and talent retention across its segments. Stability in workforce availability ensures operational continuity and supports management's strategic initiatives.

Phil Murphy, D-New Jersey, issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Acting Governor Way Announces Federal Emergency Management Agency Fire Management Assistance Grant Award to Support Response and Recovery Efforts to the Jones Road Wildfire</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Fire Management Assistance Grant Program Provides Reimbursement of Wildfire Emergency Response Costs</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TRENTON \\- Acting Governor Tahesha Way today announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) awarded New Jersey a Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG). This funding will directly support the Jones Road Wildfire response and recovery efforts in Ocean County. The Fire Management Assistance Grant Program is available to states, local, and tribal governments to mitigate, manage, and control fires on publicly or privately owned forests or grasslands, threatening such destruction as a major disaster.</p><p>\"The Jones Road Wildfire in Ocean County is estimated to have burned over 15,000 acres and continues to burn with 60 percent containment,\" said Acting Governor Tahesha Way. \"As our first responders attend to the fire, we are grateful to receive help from FEMA with the approval of the FMAG. This grant will ensure we are able to respond as quickly and capably as possible to reach full containment and recover in the aftermath of the fire.\"</p><p>\"I'm thankful that FEMA has approved our FMAG request. This support is vital to help us respond to and recover quickly from the Jones Road Wildfire and will effectively help us protect lives, homes, and communities,\" said New Jersey State Police Superintendent and State Director of Emergency Management Colonel Patrick J. Callahan. \"The FMAG also helps equip our heroic firefighters and first responders working tirelessly on the front lines. I'm grateful for our whole community partnership that enhances our capabilities and resilience during critical events.\"</p><p>\"This FMAG to New Jersey helps the state respond to the Jones Road Wildfire,\" said Andrew D'Amora, Acting Region 2 Administrator. \"FMAGs are made available by FEMA to assist in fighting fires that threaten to cause a major disaster. It will help cover eligible costs, like expenses for field camps, equipment use, materials, supplies and mobilization and demobilization activities attributed to fighting the fire. These grants do not provide assistance to individual home or business owners and do not cover other infrastructure damage caused by the fire. We remain in close contact with the state and will continue to prioritize building local and state capacities.\"</p><p>\"I wish to thank Senator Kim on behalf of the DEP's Forest Fire Service and the many state and local agencies that responded to the Jones Road wildfire,\" said New Jersey Environmental Commissioner Shawn M. LaTourette. \"As devastating as this wildfire was, the heroic efforts of the Forest Fire Service and our many partners on the ground protected many thousands of lives and averted what could have been extensive loss of property. This wildfire, the most significant to impact the state in many years, serves as a powerful reminder of the importance or partnerships across all levels of government - from federal agencies to state agencies and down to the local first responders who work tirelessly to protect their communities.\"</p><p>\"As I walked around the areas scorched by the fire, I wanted to ensure our brave firefighters and first responders had everything possible to help contain this disaster,\" said Senator Andy Kim. \"As Ranking Member of the Senate subcommittee that oversees FEMA, I'm grateful to be able to help bring federal support to help our state during a time of critical need.\"</p><p>For additional information about the Fire Management Assistance Grant Program (FMAG), visit <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fema.gov/assistance/public/fire-management-assistance\">https://www.fema.gov/assistance/public/fire-management-assistance</url>.</p><p>***</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://nj.gov/governor/news/news/562025/approved/20250425a.shtml\">https://nj.gov/governor/news/news/562025/approved/20250425a.shtml</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-9202792 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR9202792</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FNB-M0G3-RVS5-M2S5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"654\"/><timeReceived>8:17 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 25, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

New World Bank Report Urges Multi-Sector Approach for Cleaner Air.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">KATHMANDU, June 17, 2025 --Air pollution is the number one risk factor for death and disability in Nepal. Single-sector solutions are not sufficient to meet any clean air target. Public policy and investment need to optimize air quality actions across sectors, prioritizing those with the most cost-effective solutions, says the World Bank in a new report.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The report, Towards Clean Air in Nepal: Benefits, Pollution Sources, and Solutions, serves as a foundational assessment of air pollution in the country and the airshed of the Indo-Gangetic Plain and Himalayan Foothills (IGP-HF).</p><p>The Kathmandu Valley and the Terai are Nepal's air pollution hotspots, with no significant improvement over the past decade. Air pollution reduces life expectancy by 3.4 years for the average Nepali and causes approximately 26,000 premature deaths annually. In addition to health, air pollution impacts labor productivity, tourism, and the aviation sector. The economic cost of poor air quality is equivalent to more than 6 percent of Nepal's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) each year.</p><p>\"Clean air and economic growth are not in conflict. In fact, the cost of inaction on pollution is far greater than the cost of taking bold steps today,\" said Hon. Ain Bahadur Shahi Thakuri, Minister for Forests and Environment. \"From setting stricter industrial emission standards to promoting electric transport, the government is committed to cleaning Nepal's air.\"</p><p>The multi-sectoral and multi-regional nature of air pollution requires action on many fronts:</p><p>* Vehicle Emissions: Continuing to electrify vehicle fleets, including cars, motorcycles, buses, and trucks is critical to address air pollution. This needs to be complemented by strengthening the vehicle inspection and maintenance system and reducing road dust.</p><p>* Industrial Emissions: Support for cleaner technology and fuel adoption in industries--including electric and pellet boilers and furnaces in small and medium enterprises--will help promote cleaner industries. Industrial facilities such as brick and cement factories also need to be supported to burn cleaner and more efficient fuels.</p><p>* Household Cooking: Supporting households to adopt cleaner and, preferably, electric cookstoves is key to cutting household sources of air pollution. Biomass-fueled stoves create both indoor and ambient air pollution.</p><p>* Forest fires: Forest fire prevention by reducing the fuel load and developing effective awareness programs is critical for reducing the likelihood of forest fires. Effective response systems to put out fires are also needed.</p><p>* Transboundary pollution: Partnering effectively with neighboring countries is critical. Transboundary airflows carry pollutants across borders. The Indo-Gangetic Plain and Himalayan Foothills Region shares an airshed, meaning that pollutants can travel across borders, affecting air quality in multiple countries. Nepal's unique geographical location, particularly the bowl-shaped Kathmandu Valley surrounded by mountains, exacerbates the problem.</p><p>\"The World Bank is committed to helping Nepal strengthen its air quality improvement programs by leveraging financial and technical assistance and capacity-building support,\" said David Sislen, World Bank Country Division Director for Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. \"As a steadfast champion of clean air for better health and prosperity, the World Bank continues to tap into its extensive knowledge and experience from around the world to ensure that our efforts to support cleaner air in Nepal are impactful and sustainable.\"</p><p>***</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2025/06/17/air-pollution-is-the-number-one-health-risk-factor-in-nepal\">http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2025/06/17/air-pollution-is-the-number-one-health-risk-factor-in-nepal</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-9311934 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR9311934</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G2N-2N83-RTX9-W2BB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"657\"/><timeReceived>8:17 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 17, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

(NAM or the Company) is pleased to report assay results for antimony (stibnite) and gold mineralized grab samples from the Companys properties in the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador. A total of 286 grab samples were collected as part of the Phase 1 exploration program in May-June to locate and confirm priority areas of interest for follow-up work during Phase 2 of the exploration program in south-central Newfoundland (for more information, see Companys recent press releases click here). Phase 2 exploration work, mainly prospecting and sampling, is currently underway in the St Albans area of south-central Newfoundland.</p><p>Phase 1 Highlights //st 1. Grab samples returned up to 15.2% Sb from Antimony Ridge (St. Albans area); 2. High-grade Au assays included 1.52 g/t Au from the Citadel Property and 1.45 g/t Au from the Antimony Ridge Property; 3. Fort Property samples returned up to 131 g/t A g and 29.3% Pb 4. Rampart Property samples assayed up to 1.88 % Pb and 1.81% Zn , indicating new</p><p>Zn-Pb-Cu potential; and 5. Beaver Brook Area samples returned high Au and As values, including 274 ppb Au and 1,047 ppm As from the Sentinel Property and 118 ppb A u with elevated As and Sb from the Sentry Property.</p><p>Sampled locations are shown in Figures 1 to 4 and assay highlights are listed in Table 1.</p><p>Antimony, a critical metal: China, the worlds largest producer/refiner severely restricted antimony exports in December 2024, including a ban on shipments to the US, sending Antimony price to more than $60,000 per tonne, which more than quadrupled since early 2024. The antimony export ban created a supply shock for the strategic metal.</p><p>Harry Barr, NAM Chairman and CEO, comments, The results of our Phase 1 program, led by Axiom Group, are highly encouraging and demonstrate the potential of NAMs SbAu properties in Newfoundland. Surface sampling returned grades of up to 15% Sb, along with assays of up to 1.5 g/t Au, 131 g/t Ag, and 29% Pb. These results underscore the presence of a robust multi-metal system, where metals beyond antimony may enhance overall economic potential. Phase 2 follow-up work, which began in mid-August, is designed to expand on these discoveries while continuing to evaluate additional ground. We look forward to reporting further results as they become available and to advancing these properties in a disciplined, systematic manner at a time when both antimony and gold are trading at historically strong levels.</p><p>Phase 1 Results Summary</p><p>St Albans Area Properties</p><p>Phase 1 results confirm that the Bay dEspoir Group is highly prospective for structurally controlled AuSb mineralization within quartz veins, particularly within the Josephs Cove Formation. NAM is building on a newly emerging ~16 km AuSb trend that extends from Canstar Resources Swangers Cove Sb occurrence1 through the Antimony Ridge (MODS# 001M/13/Sb 002) and Golden Grit (MODS# 001M/13/Au 015) occurrences to the True Grit (MODS# 001M/13/Au 014) Au occurrence. //st * Antimony RidgeCitadel: A float sample (445108) grading 15.2% Sb was collected ~2 km southeast of the historical Antimony Ridge Sb occurrence, suggesting a broader overlapping AuSb zone than previously recognized. In addition, a quartz float sample (441194) from the SW portion of the Citadel property returned 1.52 g/t Au , representing the first-time high-grade gold has been documented in this area. This discovery corresponds with historical till anomalies, reinforcing the potential for additional gold discoveries within this trend ( Figure 1 ). * Fort Property: Located within the Riches Island Formation, the Fort property hosts quartz veins and broad zones of silicification within psammitic rocks. Samples 441234, 441235, and 441236 returned grades up to 29.3% Pb and 131 g/t Ag , with elevated barite. While Pb occurrences were historically documented in the area, these results represent previously undocumented PbAgBa occurrences and significantly upgrade the polymetallic potential of the property ( Figure 2 ). 1<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.canstarresources.com/news/canstars-high-grade-antimony-showing\">https://www.canstarresources.com/news/canstars-high-grade-antimony-showing</url> s-including-74-sb-at-golden-baie-highlight-potential-critical-minerals-upsi de-as-price-rises-on-chinas-export-restrictions //st * Rampart Property: A new occurrence of ZnPbCu mineralization was discovered (sample 441288) grading up to 1.88% Pb and 1.81% Zn . This demonstrates strong base-metal potential and occurs adjacent to Canstar Resources Golden Baie AuSb project in the Little River area ( Figure 3 ).</p><p>Summary: NAMs Phase 1 program in the St. Albans area both confirms the presence of high-grade Sb mineralization along a 16 km AuSb trend and identifies new gold, PbAgBa, and ZnPbCu occurrences. Collectively, these results highlight the multi-commodity potential of the Bay dEspoir belt and position the St. Albans properties as a key focus for Phase 2 exploration.</p><p>Beaver Brook Area Properties</p><p>The Beaver Brook Area properties are geologically significant as they lie within the same structural corridor that hosts the Beaver Brook Antimony Mine, one of North Americas largest primary Sb deposits. Mineralization at Beaver Brook is characterized by fracture- and fault-controlled, stibnitequartz veins developed within Silurian sedimentary rocks of the Indian Islands Group, structurally imbricated against the Ordovician Davidsville Group along major thrust faults (Lake and Wilton, 2006; Sandeman et al., 2018).</p><p>Phase 1 assays on NAMs nearby claims confirm this dual potential: //st * Sentinel Property: Boulder sample 441162 returned 274 ppb Au with arsenopyrite, identifying a new AuAs system along strike of the Beaver Brook Sb trend and adjacent to New Found Golds Queensway South Project. This is the first recognition of elevated gold values in this part of the trend and highlights exploration upside; * Sentry Property: Float sample 441104 returned 118 ppb Au with elevated Sb and As in an altered monzogranite, indicating significant mineralizing fluids in the area; and * Exploration Upside: The presence of mineralized float and boulders raises the question of whether these samples represent erosion from nearby undiscovered outcrops or glacial transport. A follow-up exploration strategy is currently in development for this region.</p><p>Summary: Phase 1 results demonstrate that NAMs Beaver Brook properties host potential for both Sb and Au systems, consistent with the broader Beaver Brook mineralizing environment.</p><p>Figure 1.

Field crews inserted certified reference materials (CRMs) and analytical blanks at a rate of approximately one QA/QC sample for every 20 primary samples, ensuring that ~5% of all submitted samples were independent quality control checks. The CRMs were sourced from industry-certified providers and selected to match, as closely as possible, the expected mineralization style and grade ranges. Analytical blanks consisted of barren quartz material used to monitor potential contamination during sample preparation and analysis.</p><p>All samples were individually sealed in heavy-duty plastic bags, labelled with unique sample numbers, and placed into rice bags for transport. Field crews maintained continuous possession of the samples until they were securely delivered by Company personnel to the SGS sample preparation facility in Grand FallsWindsor, Newfoundland. At this facility, the samples were weighed and prepared into pulps in accordance with SGSs standard procedures before being securely shipped internally to SGS Canadas Minerals laboratory in Burnaby, British Columbia, for complete assay analysis.</p><p>Analytical work included: //st * Gold (Au): 30-g Fire Assay with Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS) finish (GE_FAA</p><p>Internal laboratory QA/QC procedures at SGS included the insertion and analysis of certified reference materials, analytical blanks, and sample duplicates alongside the submitted samples to monitor analytical accuracy and precision.</p><p>Antimony and Gold Markets Commentary</p><p>Reuters reported on June 17th, 20252 that China severely restricted antimony exports, including a ban on shipments to the US, sending Antimony price to more than $60,000 per metric tonne, having more than quadrupled over the past year. As a critical metal, antimony's market dynamics are influenced by its applications in various industries and geopolitical factors. China's recent antimony export ban created a supply shock for the strategic metal. Approximately 70% of antimony is produced or refined in China. 2<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/battery-makers-sweat\">https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/battery-makers-sweat</url> -antimony-shortage-hits-after-chinas-export-curbs-2025-06-17/</p><p>Spot gold prices have traded as high as US$3,500 per ounce, likely driven by heightened global uncertainties and increased demand from institutional and retail investors. Central banks have continued their robust gold purchasing in 2025, adding 244 tonnes to their global reserves in Q1 and maintaining a strong pace into Q2, putting them on track for approximately 1,000 tonnes of purchases for the year. This sustained buying action underscores gold's role as a strategic asset amid economic instability and inflation concerns. Retail investors and family offices have also increased their gold holdings, seeking to hedge against market volatility. In Q1 2025, gold ETF inflows surged by 1,114% quarter-over-quarter, reaching 226.5 tonnes. Despite some outflows in May, year-to-date ETF inflows remain strong at over 322 tonnes, reflecting a continued revival in retail appetite for gold.</p><p>The convergence of these factors highlights the strategic importance of antimony and gold antimony on the current global economic landscape.</p><p>NAMs Strategic Antimony-Gold Land Position</p><p>NAMs properties in Newfoundland total approximately 20,000 hectares in 12 generally non-contiguous properties. Seven of these properties are in the St. Albans area, along the Antimony Ridge-Swanger and Golden Baie (a.k.a. Little River) Sb-Au mineralized trends (Figure 5 and Figure 6)). The remaining five properties are strategically located along the same geological trend as the past-producing Beaver Brook Antimony Mine and in proximity to New Found Golds Queensway South Gold Project (Figure 5 and Figure 7).</p><p>It is also noteworthy that the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador has recently been recognized by the Fraser Institute as a top-10 mining jurisdiction in their global rankings3.</p><p>3Source: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/annual-survey-mining-companies-2024\">https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/annual-survey-mining-companies-2024</url></p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>Dr. William Stone, P.Geo. and a Qualified Person for the purposes of National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects and a consultant to NAM, has reviewed and approved the scientific and technical disclosure in this press release.</p><p>The Qualified Person has not completed sufficient work to verify the historical information on the neighbouring properties.

The Company has three critical metal divisions: a Platinum Group Element division, a Lithium/Rare Element division, and a Gold-Antimony Division.</p><p>The PGE Division includes the 100% owned, multi-million-ounce, district-scale River Valley Project, one of North Americas largest undeveloped Platinum Group Element Projects, situated 100 km by road east of Sudbury, Ontario. In addition to River Valley, NAM owns 100% of the Genesis PGE-Cu-Ni Property in Alaska.</p><p>About NAMs Lithium Division</p><p>The Companys Lithium Division is one of the largest mineral claim holders in the Winnipeg River Pegmatite Field, where the Company is exploring for hard rock lithium and various rare elements such as tantalum, rubidium, and cesium. NAM is developing its lithium division in conjunction with its Farm-in/Joint Venture agreement with Mineral Resources Ltd. (MinRes), one of the worlds largest lithium producers. A minimum budget to maintain the Projects has been approved by Mineral Resources Ltd for May 2025 to April 2026. The Companies agreed to the minimum budget due to current lithium pricing and forest fire dangers in the immediate area</p><p>In April 2024, a $1.5M NSERC Alliance grant was awarded to a collaboration led by the University of Manitoba (Drs. Fayek and Camacho), with academic partners from Lakehead University (Dr. Hollings) and industry partners including New Age Metals and Grid Metals. This research is focused on advancing Canadas critical metals sector, with New Age Metals portion targeting its Bird River lithium properties. Approximately $107,000 of work is planned on New Ages properties in 2025. The early work will, subject to precautions for regional wildfire, will include core sampling and field visits starting this summer. The project will likely extend beyond the original 3-year term, due to its delayed start.</p><p>New Age Metals Inc. is supporting a successful $180K Mitacs research grant, awarded in 2023, through its $90K contribution (already accounted for and paid under the Mineral Resources joint venture). This academic partnership with the University of New Brunswick and the University of British Columbia is focused on understanding the origin and controls of lithium pegmatite mineralization in the Cat LakeWinnipeg River field. Fieldwork for the MSc. thesis has been completed and the post-doctoral research phase is ongoing at UNB. This collaboration provides access to top-tier scientific expertise and equipment, significantly reducing analytical costs and adding long-term value to the project.</p><p>On August 6, 2025, New Age Metals announced an additional investment in a 4th critical metal. NAM currently owns approximately 12.79% and holds warrants that, if exercised with todays issued and outstanding shares of MQM, would bring NAM to a 19.05% interest in MetalQuest Mining inc.</p><p>MetalQuest Mining inc. is developing one of North Americas largest iron ore projects, where approximately $120 million has been spent on the project. For more information, please visit MetalQuestMining.com .

Authorities arrested the 19-year-old from Waretown, New Jersey, and charged him with arson and aggravated arson in the fire that's still burning in southern New Jersey that they described as started with \"an improperly extinguished bonfire\" . Prosecutors said there's no attorney listed for him. It's peak forest fire season in the vast pine wilderness that covers more than 1 million acres - an area roughly as large as the Grand Canyon - and firefighters are contending with low humidity and the aftermath of a monthslong drought in the region. Though large tracts of the Pine Barrens are uninhabited, New Jersey is the nation's most densely populated state and officials have warned the fire could threaten developments nearby. </p><p>The fire had grown to more than 23 square miles Thursday, approaching what officials believe to have been the largest wildfire in the state in the last two decades. Authorities had said there were no injuries or deaths in the fire, but a commercial building and some vehicles had been destroyed. About 5,000 people had been evacuated but were permitted to return home Wednesday, officials said. \"This is still a very active fire,\" LaTourette said Wednesday. \"As we continue to get this under full control the expectation is that the number of acres will grow and will grow in a place that is unpopulated.\" An update is planned for later Thursday. The effects of the fire are beginning to be seen beyond the state. Higher-than-normal pollution levels were expected Thursday in New York City, Rockland and Westchester counties, and in Long Island's Nassau and Suffolk counties, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation advised Wednesday. The fire is roughly 54 miles south of New York City. It said \"going indoors may reduce exposure\" to problems such as eye, nose and throat irritation, coughing, sneezing and shortness of breath. The Ocean County Sheriff's Office in New Jersey also cautioned early Thursday about air quality, saying \"smoke will continue to permeate the area.\" It said emergency personnel will be on site for the next few days. In New York, dry conditions across the state are resulting in a \"high\" fire danger rating in several regions including New York City, Long Island, the Hudson Valley, Capital Region, and portions of the North Country, the state air quality advisory said. The rest of the state is at a moderate or low level of fire danger. Officials said the fire is believed to be the second-worst in the last two decades, smaller only than a 2007 blaze that burned 26 square miles. Acting New Jersey Gov. Tahesha Way declared a state of emergency Wednesday and officials said they've contained about 50 percent of the wildfire. Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, is on an official visit in Poland for a Holocaust memorial. He's due to fly back home on Friday. Video released by the state agency overseeing the fire service showed billowing white and black clouds of smoke, intense flames engulfing pines and firefighters dousing a charred structure. The Pine Barrens sit between Philadelphia to the west and the Atlantic coast to the east. The region, with its quick-draining sandy soil, is in peak forest fire season. The trees are still developing leaves, humidity remains low and winds can kick up, drying out the forest floor. The area had been under a severe drought until recently.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-000001966859dd1da59ff9fbab770000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FW1-97M3-RW3W-60C2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"604\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 24, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
