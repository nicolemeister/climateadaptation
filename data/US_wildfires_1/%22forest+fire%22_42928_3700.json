EPA, the groups are urging the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit to reject environmentalists' lawsuit seeking to reverse the agency's determination that the Motor City is in attainment with the 2015 ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"By authorizing the exclusion of monitoring data influenced by exceptional events, the statutory provisions sought to avoid imposing unnecessary and burdensome controls on local industrialized sources that are not responsible for a NAAQS exceedance,\" the American Petroleum Institute, American Chemistry Council, American Fuel &amp; Petrochemical Manufacturers. U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and the National Mining Association say in a joint May 2 amicus brief.</p><p>The groups add that the policy strikes \"an important balance between the [Clean Air Act's] goal of reducing and controlling air pollution to protect human health and the reality that air quality monitoring data is sometimes affected by unusual and uncontrollable events, including natural events such as wildfire.\"</p><p>And they note that Congress also \"sought to protect local, job-producing industrial activities from control requirements to address pollution for which they are not responsible.\"</p><p>Given that background, the industry groups urge the court to deny the environmentalists' petitions because, \"By recognizing that the ozone concentrations measured on June 24 and June 25, 2022, were due to an exceptional event, EPA's actions properly prevented imposition of onerous regulatory requirements that fail to address the wildfire-related ozone on those days and that would be ineffective3 at preventing future elevated ozone levels attributable to forest fire.\"</p><p>The Sierra Club's suit is the first to challenge application of EPA's exceptional events policy, just as the Biden administration is pledging to step up use of such waivers to address concerns that tough new particulate matter standards will drive significant new nonattainment designations, especially in areas that experience a lot of wildfires.</p><p>For example, last fall, the White House issued a multi-agency agreement for fighting wildfires and their smoke impacts that calls for efficient state use of EPA's exceptional-event waivers, as well as more \"prescribed\" burns to prevent uncontrolled fires and consideration of how such fires affect air quality attainment.</p><p>But environmentalists are concerned about broad application of EPA's exceptional events policy. The Sierra Club and Great Lakes Environmental Law Center filed suit last July challenging EPA's approval of Detroit's ozone attainment designation based on the exclusion of data gathered over two days during the Canadian wildfires in June 2022, at the East 7-Mile air monitor.</p><p>The groups brought the suit after they were unable to convince EPA to withdraw its proposed approval, based on warnings that going through with the plan would ease otherwise-mandated emission limits for automaker painting operations. They said they feared EPA prejudged its decision before the comment period closed to bolster auto industry development plants.</p><p>Legal Standard</p><p>Sierra Club argued in its Jan. 9 opening brief that the court should reverse the \"unlawful\" attainment designation, alleging that it is based on \"EPA's wholly unsupported conclusion that Detroit ozone readings above the health-based air quality standards on two days in the summer of 2022 were clearly caused by the 'exceptional event' of smoke from a wildfire 1,430 miles away.\"</p><p>Rather than taking meaningful steps to reduce ozone, \"EPA and [the Michigan Department of Energy, Great Lakes and the Environment] have prematurely declared the problem solved,\" the Sierra Club said when the consolidated cases were filed. \"The data says otherwise: ozone pollution in Detroit continues to plague the city and environmental justice communities will continue to suffer from asthma and other health problems if we simply ignore the problem.\"</p><p>But EPA is strongly defending its decision to apply the exceptional events policy in Detroit. \"Sierra Club's contrary arguments lack merit because they are based primarily on misunderstanding of the weight of the evidence approach that EPA uses to evaluate exceptional events submittals and on disagreements with EPA's scientific findings and conclusions,\" the agency said in an April 23 brief.</p><p>Several other industry groups are also backing EPA. The Midwest Ozone Group (MOG), a coalition that represents a host of manufacturers, utilities and others, argued in an April 30 amicus brief that the environmentalists' suit is misguided.</p><p>\"When asking to exclude data caused by smoke from Canadian wildfires, Michigan followed EPA's regulations and guidance and satisfied the EPA's requirements. The Sierra Club and its amici are dissatisfied with Michigan's demonstration, yet dissatisfaction is not a legal standard to support a petition for review of an EPA decision. Accordingly, this court should deny the Sierra Club's petition for review,\" MOG argued.</p><p>Additionally, the Michigan Manufacturers Association and the Southeast Michigan Council of Governments (SEMCOG) argue in an April 30 amicus brief that Sierra Club's interpretation of the exceptional events policy \"unreasonably conflicts with the objectives and purposes of the\" air law.</p><p>It \"advances an interpretation that would unreasonably require one of two hardships for states,\" including undertaking the heavy burden of implementing and maintaining reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules before they have been required, or for states to forego redesignation into attainment \"even though they have attained the NAAQS,\" that brief says.</p><p>\"So, even if the area attained the NAAQS without the RACT rules, it would be required to comply with them nonetheless. This places an undue burden either on the state or on industry or both, not just prior to redesignation to attainment, but for the foreseeable future.\"</p><p>The filing adds, \"Such nonsense fails to further the objectives of the\" air law because it would require industry to spend more time and money on RACT controls applicable to nonattainment when the area is in attainment. \"It would defy logic to require such rules when the Detroit area is already attaining.\" Under the Sierra Club's view, \"compliance does not have a payoff,\" it argues.</p><p>'F' In Air Quality</p><p>In a May 1 press release, the Sierra Club criticized SEMCOG, noting it submitted its brief arguing that additional pollution cuts are not needed to address ozone the same day the American Lung Association graded Southeast Michigan with an \"F\" in air quality.</p><p>The group notes that the council -- a planning agency tasked with implementing sustainability and climate change efforts -- joined with industry groups that benefit from pollution reduction inaction in the lawsuit.</p><p>Metro Detroit is ranked 33 out of 228 metropolitan areas for high ozone days, the group says.</p><p>\"When the cumulative impact of so much pollution is already having dramatic consequences, it is simply unacceptable to take a position in favor of more smog and more asthma,\" said Dolores Leonard, a local community activist.</p><p>The environmentalists also have amicus support, including a Jan. 18 brief from the Detroit Hamtramck Coalition for Advancing Healthy Environments and other local groups, which argues, \"The agencies should not be permitted to reclassify the Detroit region as reaching attainment levels by excluding multiple days of high ozone levels.\"</p><p>Also, Michiganders for Climate Action and health-based partners in a Jan. 16 brief asked the court to \"reverse EPA's erroneous decision to redesignation Detroit\" because the process for approving the redesignation request \"did not consider the public health and environmental justice circumstances in Detroit. If EPA's decision stands, it will allow sources of ozone to evade proven emissions reduction measures require3d under the [air law] at a time when respiratory health in Detroit is in crisis.\"</p><p>The 6th Circuit has not scheduled oral arguments in the case. -- Dawn Reeves (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:dreeves@iwpnews.com\">dreeves@iwpnews.com</email>)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EPADLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EPADLY2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BYR-4281-JBHM-S006-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">405432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1412\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Inside Washington Publishers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Daily Briefing</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"05\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>May 6, 2024</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"75\"><className>Business &amp;

You probably heard about psoriasis. It is a skin condition that affects millions of Americans, but there is a rare and serious form of psoriasis that you may not know about.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GIO BENITEZ (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Off-camera) Yeah, we're just learning about it, too. It is called generalized pustular psoriasis or GPP, and it's a chronic disease that requires proper diagnosis and management. Joining us now to help us learn more is our contributor Rocsi Diaz. Hey, Rocsi!</p><p>ROCSI DIAZ (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Off-camera) Today our sponsor, Boehringer Ingelheim is raising awareness for generalized pustular psoriasis. I sat down with their SVP of oncology and immunology, Victoria Brown and patient, Brandon, to help us understand more about living with this severe skin disorder. Take a look.</p><p>ROCSI DIAZ (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Off-camera) How did you learn that you had generalized pustular psoriasis?</p><p>BRANDON (BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM PAID SPOKESPERSON)</p><p>I was 11 months old when I was first diagnosed with GPP. It started off with a rash on my chest and my arms, and the next day, it had spread almost like a wildfire, from there to being on my back and my legs. So my parents rushed me to children's hospital, and from there, it was a little bit of a journey to getting the diagnosis. I was probably in the hospital for a good six months or so before they actually pinpointed what was going on. It's definitely been a challenge.</p><p>ROCSI DIAZ (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Off-camera) What is generalized pustular psoriasis?</p><p>VICTORIA BROWN (SVP ONCOLOGY &amp; IMMUNOLOGY BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM)</p><p>Generalized pustular psoriasis, or GPP, is a devastating and debilitating chronic skin disease. It's typically characterized by these flares or break through of disease activity that you see these pustules appear in areas of the body or widespread areas of the body and when not treated, it can lead to very serious complications, and in some cases, can be life-threatening.</p><p>ROCSI DIAZ (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Off-camera) What's the difference between GPP and plaque psoriasis?</p><p>GRAPHICS: PEOPLE LIVING WITH GPP COULD EXPERIENCE</p><p>GRAPHICS: HIGH FEVERS, CHILLS, BODY ACHES, SERIOUS INFECTIONS</p><p>VICTORIA BROWN (SVP ONCOLOGY &amp; IMMUNOLOGY BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM)</p><p>The difference is not only how the symptoms can appear on the skin, people living with GPP will often experience high fevers, chills, body aches, and often can lead to serious infections. Our skin is there to serve a purpose, to keep us healthy and when it's not fully intact, that can lead to infections of other organs of the body that can be very serious and need to be treated immediately. So while every person's experience with GPP will be different, it is really important if you or someone you know feels that they may be experiencing a flare or have symptoms of GPP, that they should talk to their doctor and seek medical attention right away.</p><p>ROCSI DIAZ (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Off-camera) So why is it important for people to get diagnosed and understand their symptoms?</p><p>VICTORIA BROWN (SVP ONCOLOGY &amp; IMMUNOLOGY BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM)</p><p>It goes beyond what you see on the skin. People living with GPP are suffering not only physical pain but very much emotional pain as well. Their ability to live their life to the fullest, it impacts their work, social relationships, etcetera, and it is this feeling of uncertainty, not knowing when a flare is going to occur, but also what's going on between flares, again, the pain, the systemic symptoms, they are leading to people feeling very isolated, and not able to fully enjoy life.</p><p>ROCSI DIAZ (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Off-camera) Your team is raising awareness for GPP, with the unwearable collection. Tell me about it.</p><p>VICTORIA BROWN (SVP ONCOLOGY &amp; IMMUNOLOGY BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM)</p><p>We're raising awareness really by sparking the conversation, that we developed the unwearable collection, in partnership with the renowned international designer, Bart Hess, really taking inspiration from people that are living with GPP to bring to life what it must feel like. Not only on the surface, but also kind of beneath the skin. We're inspired by the people talking about how it feels like a thousand paper cuts, or shards of glass, or a forest fire kind of running through the body, but also trying to visualize the concept of isolation and feeling trapped by the unpredictability of the disease. So by creating something very visual, we hope it will spark conversation for people to ask questions and understand the disease more.</p><p>VICTORIA BROWN (SVP ONCOLOGY &amp; IMMUNOLOGY BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM)</p><p>And unfortunately if they feel like it is something that they or someone they know could be living with, to seek health and support.</p><p>ROCSI DIAZ (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Off-camera) Victoria, thank you and Brandon so much for your time.</p><p>VICTORIA BROWN (SVP ONCOLOGY &amp; IMMUNOLOGY BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM)</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>ROCSI DIAZ (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Off-camera) Thank you to our sponsor Boehringer Ingelheim for that important highlight. Back to you guys.</p><p>GIO BENITEZ (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Off-camera) Wow.</p><p>EVA PILGRIM (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Off-camera) Oh, thank you Rocsi.</p><p>GIO BENITEZ (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Off-camera) Yeah.</p><p>EVA PILGRIM (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Off-camera) Well coming up here on \"GMA3\" chances are you have seen him on any number of prestige TV hits.</p><p>GRAPHICS: GMA3</p><p>GRAPHICS: COMING UP ON GMA3</p><p>GRAPHICS: IN STUDIO WITH TOBIAS MENZIES</p><p>GIO BENITEZ (ABC NEWS)</p><p>(Off-camera) Yeah, big star here.

Most commonly known as drones, they have been used since the 1900s, initially by the US military for target practice.</p><p>Military applications still dominate the global UAV market, but the achievements of UAVs in military operations have boosted demand for drones in North America, Middle East and the Asia-Pacific. UAVs are becoming a key element in the intelligence and surveillance operations of military and fast expanding in other combative areas as well.</p><p>The fast development of the UAV global market is having a big impact on a range of mainstream industries. Apart from defense, applications also include environmental management, crisis management, agriculture, policing and crowd monitoring, civil engineering, fisheries protection, disaster management, telecommunications maintenance, oil and gas exploration, mineral exploration, mine safety, geophysical surveys and mapping.</p><p>The UAV market has traditionally been narrowly focused, but it is rapidly diversifying. Given the pace at which technology and the effectiveness of aircraft are improving, and as sensor and automation technologies mature, commercial applications will rapidly grow over the next ten years.</p><p>Market Scope</p><p>The UAV sector is set to be the sector with the most dynamic growth in the aerospace industry globally in this decade. According to the Teal Group, global spending on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) programs is expected to more than triple over the next decade in military, commercial, and consumer markets.</p><p>In light of solid growth rates, the Teal Group forecasts global spending is expected to touch $20.3 billion by 2025. The civil UAS market is expected to grow faster than the military market over the next decade. The worldwide military UAS spending over the next decade is estimated to be US$216.5 billion. Of which, procurement spending will amount to US$162.2 billion and research spending will amount to US$72.5 billion. The US is expected to account for about 81% of the total military R&amp;D spending and about 48% of military procurement through to 2030.</p><p>The high level of military R&amp;D spending is forecast to be due to the bigger and higher-value systems procured by the US. The military UAS market growth will be led by unmanned combat aerial vehicles and high-altitude long endurance UAVs. The largest market segment over the next decade will be High Altitude Long Endurance UAVs, which will account for a third of the period's sales.</p><p>The civil UAS will be the most attractive market this decade as commercial applications take off and governments adopt UAVs for new roles in border security and public safety. The worldwide civil UAS market is expected to reach US$19.8 billion by 2031, from US$7.2 billion in 2022, according to the Teal Group. Over the coming decade, the civil market will grow at a CAGR of 9.1% and will generate US$139 billion in revenues. Civil UAS promises to be the most dynamic growth sector with the commercial segment expected to lead the growth.</p><p>The worldwide commercial UAS market is projected to reach $9.5 billion by 2028. Delivery is likely to emerge as the leading sector for commercial UAS market in the US by 2030. Teal Group predicts that Teal growth opportunities will be in middle-mile (e.g., factory to warehouse) transportation, rather than in the last-mile deliveries. This is primarily due to the complexities involved in regulating the last-mile deliveries, while the regulatory framework for middle-mile transportation is already in place. Globally, Agriculture will be the largest sector by 2030 led by more affordable UAS and heavy Chinese investments. This is also supported by UN projections which suggest the world's population to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, causing significant growth in agricultural consumption. Another key sector that will drive growth of the commercial UAS market is Industrial Inspection. Construction will be the largest portion of the Industrial Inspection market. All ten of the largest worldwide construction firms are deploying or experimenting with UAS fleets.</p><p>China has a clear leadership in the consumer UAS manufacturing and is now seeking to expand its capabilities to commercial UAS manufacturing. The aggressive growth of the UAV industry in China is attributable to the policy and regulatory support as well as significant investments from the Chinese government.</p><p>Currently, Sichuan, Hunan, Hainan and Jiangxi provinces in China are pushing forward the reform of low-altitude airspace management, giving support to the commercialization of drone application. China's civil drone market is estimated at $6.6 billion in 2022, according to Shenzhen-based research firm AskCI Consulting. The industrial drone market is also witnessing rapid growth. According to data from Shenzhen-based Qianzhan Industry Research Institute, the industrial drone sales is projected to increase from 27.3 billion yuan in 2020 to 265.8 billion yuan in 2026. Shenzhen has more than 1,500 drone companies with civilian UAV business licenses.</p><p>Data from the China UAV Industry Alliance shows that there are 1,200 companies registered within the UAV and drone market in China. Of which, only 10% have established international links, with the Asia-Pacific, Oceania and US the predominant focus. The Civil Aviation Administration of China released a plan that outlined several targets for the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) business in China by the years 2025, 2030, and 2035. These goals included the enhancement of rules and the expansion of airspace capacity for civilian UAVs.</p><p>As regulations governing the commercial use of drones become clearer both in China and internationally, sectors such as infrastructure, agriculture, and transportation emerge as the primary areas with significant growth potential. The expansion of drone utilization in agriculture aligns with its prioritization in Made in China 2025 vision.</p><p>Europe has fallen behind in the civil UAS market. It is now trying to catch up by enacting standardized airspace rules that will create a single market. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has established rules for small UAS across the European Union.</p><p>The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has become the first air transport safety regulator in the world to offer technical design guidance to urban planners and eVTOL manufacturers looking to build drone taxi vertiports across Europe. Europe also adopted 'European Drone Strategy 2.0' late last year aimed for the further development of the European drone market. Further, the implementation of the 'U-space' in January 2023, a European system to manage drone traffic safely, will lay the ground for increased operations. According to the European Commission, the drone services market in Europe could be worth \u20ac14.5 billion, and create 145,000 jobs, by 2030.</p><p>The increase in defense spending by various countries to strengthen their defense forces is leading to growth in the number of military UAV systems. These UAV systems are being used for applications such as surveying, mapping, transportation, combat operations and monitoring. The US and European governments have already begun new programs using UAVs for protecting land and sea borders. Many other international agencies including the UN and other peacekeeping agencies are also deploying unmanned aerial protection systems.</p><p>According to the US Presidential budget for fiscal 2025, the US Department of Defense aims to hasten the deployment of advanced combat drones as part of a broader push to modernize the force and pursue cutting-edge technology. The US Air Force wants an additional $150 million on top of the $392 million previously appropriated for its drone wingmen effort. Autonomous aircraft are ideal for completing suicide missions and protecting pilots.</p><p>The U.S. Army intends to request increased flexibility in funding for unmanned aircraft systems, as well as enhanced capabilities to counter them and electronic warfare tools in its upcoming budget. This strategic move is informed by the insights gained from Ukraine's resistance against Russia's invasion.</p><p>The United States is not the only nation that is increasing defense spending on unmanned aerial vehicles. In 2023, Germany approved major uptick in defense spending on armed drones. German military will purchase ammunitions worth EUR152 million to arm German drones. This will be the first deployment of weaponized UAVs in German military.</p><p>UK has unveiled its Future of Flight action plan aimed at introducing electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft in the skies by 2026. This plan outlines the integration of eVTOL services, projecting a significant boost of \u00a345 billion ($57.1 billion) to the national economy by 2030. The UK's The National Health Service has teamed up with private companies like Skyports Drone Services to prepare medical transport networks and other critical public operations.</p><p>UK's Defense Ministry announced the 'UK Defence Drone Strategy' and committed $5.7 billion towards the development of UAV technology in the country.</p><p>Ukraine has announced plans to double down on its deployment of drones in its efforts to counter Russian forces, pledging nearly $540 million of spending in 2023 for the production and procurement of UAVs.</p><p>France is investing \u20ac5 billion ($5.4 billion) in drones through 2030 as part of its military programming law. The goal is to develop a French loitering-munitions industry by the end of the decade and achieve swarm-flight capability. France has a target for the army to have 3,000 tactical drones by 2025. The French government is mainly looking to induct defense drones below 150 kg. Thales estimates the global market for drones of less than 150kg to be worth more than \u20ac2.5 billion, with growth rates of 14% per year.</p><p>Japan has announced a record $55.9 billion defense budget for fiscal 2024, which will include significant spending on armed drones. It intends to raise defense spending to 2 percent of GDP by 2027. The Japanese defense ministry aims to introduce unmanned vehicles that can be used directly in combat, rather than just for surveillance and intelligence gathering.</p><p>South Korea has announced plan to double its military drone fleet by 2026 in the face of growing threats from North Korean unmanned aerial vehicles. Korea plans to increase the funding for weapon modernization programs to 5% of the total state budget, up from the current level of 1%.</p><p>According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), military expenditures are on the rise around the globe. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has led to increase in defense funding especially for drones. Over the next decade, growth in the military market will increasingly shift towards international markets as more militaries incorporate UAVs into their forces.</p><p>Major drone providers from China and Israel have increased the manufacture and export of defense drones for foreign militaries. Many counties from Saudi Arabia to Myanmar and Iraq to Ethiopia, are stockpiling Chinese combat drones and deploying them on the battlefield. Recently in August 2023, Indonesia announced plans to buy 12 Turkish military drones for $300 million.</p><p>The introduction of specially built unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) also promises to drive growth over the next decade. The emergence of the commercial UAS market, growing demand from governments to better patrol borders, and continued consumer drone growth all promise to drive more than a quadrupling of the non-military market over the next decade.</p><p>With increasing UAV installations across the globe, there is rising need to defend against such systems as well. In May 2022, South Korea approved a project to install uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) defense systems at 45 bases across the nation to neutralize hostile drones. South Korean government will spend NT$4.3 billion (US$144.45 million) to purchase the UAV defense systems.</p><p>Market Share</p><p>The world UAV sector is highly concentrated with a small number of companies holding most of the market share compared to other industries. Our estimates show there are more than 500 companies globally, with more than 200 commercial UAV companies, while the other 300 develop UAV for the military industry. AeroVironment, BAE Systems, Elbit Systems, Finmeccanica, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Navmar Applied Sciences, Northrop Grumman, Safran, Textron, Thales, Boeing, Tital Aerospace, TAI, AIA and Aviation Industry Corporation of China are among the biggest players in the UAV market.</p><p>A number of start-ups have made their mark on the market in recent years, however, and are challenging the dominance of the incumbent players. Technology companies like Intel, Qualcomm, Microsoft, Apple as well as venture capitalists have poured more millions of dollars into startup investments.</p><p>Impact of COVID-19 on the UAV Sector</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every industry, although not in an equal way. Some industries have felt the impact very differently to others. The effect on the UAV market especially commercial drones have been on the positive side. According to Drone Industry Insights, drone companies are on a path towards steady growth over the next many years. Global drone market size is forecast to reach US$55.8 billion by 2030, from US$30.6 billion in 2022, implying a CAGR of 7.8%. The services sector will remain the biggest segment, while the hardware segment will be the fastest growing.</p><p>As the global economies were forced to shut down and implement strict shelter-in-place restrictions, the demand for unmanned aerial systems became higher. Further, the use of drones for transporting medical supplies proved a boon for the sector. Cargo, courier and warehousing are the sectors with the fastest adoption of drones. Many drone companies including Wingcopter, Zipline and Wing have been able to deliver and scale their solutions quicker than previously expected.</p><p>In April 2024, Zipline completed its one millionth commercial drone delivery. Zipline's autonomous drones have collectively flown over 70 million miles and delivered more than 10 million products across four continents. The company noted a notable surge in demand, prompting the recent enlargement of its Platform 2 (P2) system across the United States. This upgraded system will cater to additional partners, including Panera Bread, Memorial Hermann Health System, and Jet's Pizza, across various metropolitan regions like Seattle, Houston, and Detroit.</p><p>In January 2024, German UAV manufacturer and transport company Wingcopter announced the extension and expansion of its delivery project providing groceries to small, remote villages using drones.</p><p>England's National Health Service (NHS) is among those trailing the vehicles to deliver fragile medicines to cancer patients living on the Isle of Wight. Chemotherapy drugs can have short shelf lives and thus quick delivery by drones is a boon for patients.</p><p>Walmart said that it completed 6,000 drone deliveries in 2022 from 36 US stores in seven states. These deliveries were done from drone delivery hubs operated by DroneUp, Flytrex and Zipline. Walmart has 4,700 stores located within 90% of the US population making it uniquely positioned to offer drone delivery at scale.</p><p>In October 2023, Zipline announced a new partnership with healthcare giant Cleveland Clinic involving an evolving operation that will begin with drone delivery of medication directly to patients' homes. The aerial delivery of specialized medicines and prescriptions will be among the first uses of the partnership.</p><p>US-based Walgreens in partnership with Alphabet's Wing is targeting the drone delivery market. In April 2022, Walgreens announced that it will begin flying packages by drone to residents of Texas cities in partnership with Google's drone subsidiary, Wing.</p><p>US-based Matternet is another player targeting the medical delivery market. In September 2021, it launched the world's first city-wide drone delivery network for the rapid transport of medical goods in Abu Dhabi. The company will use drones to transport urgent, high-value goods such as COVID-19 vaccines, blood, and lab samples across the Abu Dhabi's health system.</p><p>In March 2024, Aerodyne Group announced that a cross-border drone delivery services between Malaysia and Singapore is being considered. The focus will be on critical deliveries such as urgent documents, high-value electronics, medical supplies, and perishable foods.</p><p>LEK Consulting notes that drones could account for a large portion of package delivery market by 2040. In December 2023, the Texas city of Arlington announced plans to launch a trial using drones and robotic ground vehicles to deliver packages from a local food bank to recipient homes in a bid to reduce the number of vans and emissions.</p><p>Scotland has launched world's first nation-wide medical drone delivery network with the completion of its first live trial flight near Glasgow. The ultimate goal is to create a fast, clean, and relatively inexpensive aerial transportation network to spirit medicines, lab samples, and other supplies to facilities across the nation.</p><p>According to research published in journal Patterns, drone deliveries could help reduce greenhouse emissions significantly. The paper states that greenhouse-gas emissions per parcel were 84% lower for drones than for diesel trucks. Companies such as Amazon have been testing the use of drones to deliver packages with an eye to reducing their environmental impact.</p><p>Market Trends</p><p>Start-ups Threaten Larger Incumbents</p><p>Over the past 20 years, the UAV sector has expanded and opened up to a whole new level of competition and innovation that had not been seen in the market. While large incumbents, especially the Big Three - Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman - have won a big slice of the available UAV deals, new and smaller entrants are increasingly winning against the big companies for UAV contracts, thus challenging their respective market positions.</p><p>A number of smaller start-up companies have burst onto the scene in recent years, threatening the market positions of the larger incumbents. Non-defense companies eager to diversify and get a slice of the fast-growing market have funded some start-ups.</p><p>In September 2024, Switzerland-based drone technology leader, Wingtra, raised $25 in its Series B1 funding round. This significant investment comes from a variety of prominent funds and family offices in the US, Switzerland, and Austria. Wingtra focuses on vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) drones with high precision, specifically designed for capturing top-quality aerial imagery.</p><p>Regulatory Uncertainties Overshadow the Segment</p><p>UAV vehicles have evolved swiftly in recent years, particularly since making the leap from military technology to consumer gadgetry. The technology they use could be useful for myriad business opportunities. For example, UAVs are being used in many sectors, like the agriculture, construction, energy, mining and entertainment, as well as geological surveys and, utility safety and maintenance, thanks to their ability to shoot aerial photos and video, as well as collect other data cheaply.</p><p>The growth of the UAV market, however, has drawn considerable attention from regulators and legislators eager to mitigate the complexities involved in the growth of the number of aeronautical vehicles in the skies. For instance, in the US there have been delays and confusion regarding the rules set by FAA. With the courts and Congress getting involved in regulation, clarity around the regulatory landscape is yet to emerge.</p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued new rules for the commercial drone industry. Under the new rules, the FAA will allow small drones to operate at night and over people and will require remote identification of the drones. The new rules went into effect on 21 April 2021. Remote ID will be required for all drones weighing 0.55 lb (0.25 kg) or more. Remote ID requires identification of drones in flight as well as the location of their control stations or takeoff point.</p><p>Further, in 2022, the FAA will require every newly produced drone weighing over 0.55 pounds to broadcast its location. In 2023, it will be illegal to fly drone without this broadcasting capability.</p><p>For fiscal FY 2022, FAA is requesting a total of over $100 million in funding for unmanned aircraft system (UAS) research, development, and integration. This includes $31.3 million for UAS implementation which incorporates FAA Drone Zone. The FAA Drone Zone is a cloud-based information technology platform that includes a UAS registration system, Part 107 authorizations and optional waivers, and UAS accident reporting.</p><p>FAA budget request also includes $24 million for UAS concept validation and requirements development, UAS flight information management, and urban air mobility.</p><p>The FAA plans to launch field tests of unmanned aircraft traffic management capabilities. The Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management (UTM) field test, which is set to launch in the spring 2022 and continue into 2023, is expected to lead to new policies and the development of updated industry standards for drones operating beyond visual line-of-sight (BVLOS).</p><p>The commercial potential of UAV continues to attract big investors and venture capital. For example, Amazon's is investing in its Amazon Prime Air program to create a delivery system utilizing UAVs.</p><p>Alphabet's drone-delivery subsidiary Wing launched a new mobile and web app, OpenSky, which is free to use and informs drone pilots about airspace restrictions, pre-plan flights, and get airspace approvals. Drone flyers can also use the app to check information on areas where they can and cannot fly.</p><p>This is just one of the many proposed uses for UAVs, however. Within the next ten years, it is expected that more than 32,000 drones will be flying for commercial operations worldwide. FAA projects that remote pilot certificates could grow almost 3x to 350,000 over the next five years.</p><p>For the US, the potential economic impact of UAVs, according to the Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, could reach approximately US$13.7 billion within the next three years and create more than 100,000 employment opportunities once the FAA drafts comprehensive drone regulations.</p><p>Despite some progress by FAA on establishing rules, it remains unclear. The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) delivered a report in January 2023 stating the need for FAA to more clearly communicate a strategy to integrate drones into the airspace. GAO notes that commercial drone use is likely to expand to 858,000 in 2026 from 622,000 in 2021.</p><p>The main conclusions of the report are that FAA needs to do better in both establishing and communicating a comprehensive strategy for broader UAV use, and in defining a uniform procedure for issuing waiver.</p><p>Wing's CEO Adam Woodwort in March 2023 reiterated the need to make drone regulations more pragmatic and predictable. He emphasized the need for drone regulations that support commercial operations. He noted that many of the current regulations make sense for passenger-carrying airplanes, but not for small aircraft with no people onboard.</p><p>In June 2023, China unveiled a list of new rules applying to drone flight by civilian users and these rules are set to come into force next year. The regulations ban people from using the devices to take pictures or video of military or defence industrial installations or secretive facilities. Drones cannot be used to gather and publish state secrets or unlawfully transfer information outside mainland China. It also bans non-Chinese drones and pilots who are not Chinese nationals from using the vehicles for surveying land. The country currently has a million registered civilian drones that fly around 20 million hours each year, according to data from China Daily.</p><p>The Buzz from Parcel-Toting Drones</p><p>In a few decades from now, we may look back and remember a time before flying robots delivered consumer orders. At least this might be the case if delivery drones turn out the way most retailers \u2014 as well as service providers - envision them. A delivery drone, or also known as a parcelcopter, is an UAV utilized to transport goods, packages, and foodstuffs, and recently, the delivery systems have been a hot future state plans among vendors.</p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has granted approval for Alphabet's Wing Aviation and Zipline International to concurrently operate their delivery drones above the Dallas and Fort Worth suburbs without the need for visual observers. Commencing in August 2024, these flights will represent the first instance of commercial drones operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) in the US, effectively overcoming a significant obstacle in drone delivery.</p><p>By 2023, Statista projects global drone delivery market to touch $1.6 billion. Asia-Pacific will be the largest market accounting for nearly 39% of the total, followed by North America (31%) and Europe (22%).</p><p>DroneUp, a leading expert in autonomous drone delivery, has successfully reduced the cost of drone deliveries to an impressive $7. The company has introduced a range of new technologies with the goal of making drone delivery more cost-effective for businesses such as retailers, fast-food restaurants, and healthcare providers.</p><p>In October 2024, Wing Aviation, the on-demand drone delivery division of Google, announced partnering with Serve Robotics to develop a last-mile food delivery solution that is both more efficient and eco-friendly. This innovative approach combines the use of drones and sidewalk robots.</p><p>In August 2024, DroneUp, a pioneering autonomous drone delivery firm in the United States, has set a new standard for the industry by successfully executing 500 deliveries in a single day. DroneUp set a new record with 40 deliveries per hour, each carrying up to 10 pounds.</p><p>Drone Industry Insights noted that services such as cargo, courier, intralogistics and warehousing were the fastest-growing drone market in 2021 and are likely to continue to remain so till 2026 with a CAGR of 24.3%. This is due to the increased popularity and demand of drone deliveries for both internal (intralogistics and warehousing) as well as external services.</p><p>Drone deliveries can cut emissions and reduce congestion on roads. According to Virginia Tech University, drone delivery could save the average consumer up to 56 hours per year, reduce vehicle traffic by 294 million miles per year and displace up to 113,900 tons of CO2 per year.</p><p>China-based ecommerce platform Meituan announced that it has completed more than 100,000 drone deliveries by 2022, an increase of more than 400% year-on-year. The company expects a greater number of drone deliveries going forward.</p><p>Alphabet's drone delivery service Wing is adding complex route management and self-loading capability for its drone delivery fleet that will make it capable of handling tens of millions of deliveries for millions of consumers by mid 2024.</p><p>Amazon is set to launch its drone delivery service in UK and Italy by the end of 2024. The expansion follows successful operations in the US, where the service has already delivered thousands of packages.</p><p>Given the large opportunity in the drone delivery market, the space is witnessing new entrants. In 2023, Japan Post announced its plans to expand and accelerate its mail drone delivery services in the country. It is now undertaking trials in populated zones in the country.</p><p>Singapore's civil aviation authority and transport ministry has chosen a private consortium of 13 members to develop the drone program. Under this program, the aim is to use drones for tasks that include delivering parcels, inspecting buildings and providing security. The companies involved in the project have carried our various pilots. These include drone parcel delivery as well as using drones to transport blood samples and specimens between hospitals and central laboratories. Drones are being tested for delivering parts and other materials to factories as well.</p><p>China is not too far behind in this race. DHL in partnership with China-based drone company EHang has launched drone delivery service in China. JD.com and Alibaba have tested the drone delivery system as well.</p><p>In September 2024, Matternet, the leading developer of urban drone delivery systems, has revealed that it has received a Light UAS Operator Certificate (LUC) from the Swiss Federal Office of Civil Aviation (FOCA). The LUC empowers Matternet to autonomously authorize new operations in Switzerland and the Federal State of Berlin, expediting the approval process for comparable operations across the European Union.</p><p>Putting the parcelcopter concept into service will take some time because of the many setbacks. The major setback for this concept in the US is that there is no specific flight system where there needs to be a specific path for the drone to travel and deliver in a populated area - and this needs to be solved. Once resolved, the big benefit should be that these delivery-by-drone systems could be commonplace within the next decade. Open season on the open skies could arrive sooner than expected.</p><p>Grocery Delivery: Exploring the Role of Drones</p><p>Drone delivery firm, Wing, released a  <url normalizedValue=\"https://blog.wing.com/2024/09/24-state-of-grocery.html\">report</url>  which suggests a significant shift in consumer preferences, with 60% of US consumers now favoring grocery delivery over in-store shopping. This marks a substantial increase from 45% just two years ago. Evidently, the convenience of online grocery shopping has captured the attention and spending of Americans. Projections indicate that the US grocery delivery market will exceed $150 billion in 2024, representing a 25% growth from 2023. This growth is attributed to advancements in delivery methods, particularly the use of drones, which are transforming logistics and offering a faster, more sustainable option.</p><p>Of particular interest is the breakdown of age groups. Millennials and Generation Z are at the forefront, with 70% of Millennials and 65% of Gen Z consumers having utilized grocery delivery at least once in the past three months. These demographics prioritize convenience and are willing to invest in time-saving services. Conversely, 40% of Baby Boomers have embraced grocery delivery, signifying a 15% increase since 2020.</p><p>Wing's report underscores the increasing role of drones in grocery delivery. While traditional ground-based deliveries are hindered by factors such as traffic, long distances, and labor costs, drones present a solution, reducing delivery times by up to 50%. In regions where drones are operational, delivery times have decreased from an average of 45 minutes to 20 minutes. Drones are particularly effective in remote areas, such as rural communities and neighborhoods with inadequate road infrastructure.</p><p>The study reveals that 80% of customers in rural regions found drone deliveries to be faster and more efficient compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, drone deliveries result in cost savings, with the potential to reduce operational costs by 30% due to lower fuel usage and decreased reliance on human labor. The study predicts that by 2026, drones could handle up to 25% of all grocery deliveries in the US, leading to billions of dollars in annual savings for the industry. The report also highlights the increasing willingness of 68% of grocery delivery customers to pay more for eco-friendly delivery options, including drone-based services. This underscores a notable trend towards sustainability in consumer preferences.</p><p>The Obsession with Armed Flying Robots</p><p>The use of a UAV as a weapon first became known in World War II. After the war, little development occurred in drone technology and most remotely piloted vehicles were used for target practice. The US military's first major spending on UAVs began after the Vietnam War, and over the past two decades, the country has become the world's pre-eminent user and supplier.</p><p>Military UAVs in the US have gone through meteoric growth over the past decade. Development has taken a quantum leap \u2014 from lab concept to battle-tested proven technology. Today, America's comparative advantage in UAVs, however, is being battered as technological know-how disseminates throughout the international system. While existing technology has started to lag, global competitors are playing catch up in research and development for drone technology.</p><p>As such, the Pentagon is expected to ramp up its investment in unmanned aerial vehicles in the coming years. The US Defense Department budget request for fiscal year 2023 mentions that unmanned weapons systems, such as drone ships, planes, and ground vehicles, will play an increasing role in future US military planning. The president's fiscal year 2023 defense budget requests new spending on unmanned/autonomous systems technology.</p><p>The Air Force request includes $187 million for enhancements to the MQ-9 Reaper combat drone and $111 million for work on the MQ-4C Triton high-altitude surveillance drone. The Navy and Marine Corps have also requested additional funding for UAVs. The Navy requested $1.2 billion for the MQ-25 Stingray drone, which is to be deployed on carriers and perform aerial refueling and surveillance functions.</p><p>No country has ramped up its UAV research in recent years faster than China, where every major company for the Chinese military has a research and development center and funding allocations dedicated to drones. In recent years, the country has pumped considerable amounts of funds and engineering brainpower into the technology, a field previously dominated by the US and Israel.</p><p>Much of the work done, however, remains secret, but the large number of drones created underlines not only the country's willpower to catch up in the sector by building comparable combat and surveillance models like the Predator and the Global Hawk but also the desire to trade the technologies globally. Its armed UAV CH-4, Wing Loong I and Wing Loong II have been rapidly gaining market share especially in developing countries such as Nigeria, Jordan, Algeria and Middle Eastern countries.</p><p>Israel, second after the US in drone technology, has flown armed UAV models but few details are available. India has also revealed its intention to develop drones that will fire missiles and fly at 30,000 feet, followed by Russia, which has revealed models of UAVs with weapons (although there is little evidence that they are currently operational).</p><p>The Lucrative UAV Micro Segment</p><p>The new generation of UAVs is being developed to improve monitoring of many kinds of systems. From tracking bush fires in Australia to observing traffic in the US, infrared cameras to track missing people at night, and laser spectroscopy used to monitor air pollutions, UAVs are using a lot of the new up-to-date miniature sensor technology.</p><p>All of this requires more focus on the integration of sensor systems in an airborne device that is severely constrained in power and weight. Changing the sensor architecture or even take the control sensors out entirely, allowing the size of the UAV to reduce dramatically. This has created a new class of ultra-small UAV sensors.</p><p>Lockheed Martin's Lockheed Sanders MicroSTAR series of prototypes is one of the many examples of a mini-UAV. The battery-operated MicroSTAR designs resembled kid's toys. The device has winglets instead of the single vertical plane tail, and a nose mounted propeller. MicroSTAR featured a five-gram navigation system that could give directions by the ground station but could also automatically keep on a heading or orbit a target.</p><p>The US army has been using mini UAVs for mission in Afghanistan and other areas. These mini-UAVs provide near-real time video that allows soldiers to better survey their surroundings and detect enemies in combat. FLIR System's Black Hornet is one such mini-UAV which weighs less than two ounces, can be deployed in less than one minute and has a range of over a mile. It is intended to eliminate battlefield blind spots thereby saving lives.</p><p>French drone maker Parrot is also an established player in micro-UAV space. It has been selected by Swiss army to develop and supply micro-drones as part of the Swiss Mini UAV Program.</p><p>Despite the advancements, the current micro-UAV market remains constrained, largely due to regulatory frameworks on unmanned operations in airspace. But once regulatory restraints are loosened and clarified, the potential of this technology will be unlocked. Mini UAVs are set to become one of the major contributors to both the economy and technology. Market growth, however, still very much depends on the pace of UAV development in different countries, thanks to the wide range of applications and the added value related to these unmanned machines.</p><p>Applications</p><p>Defense</p><p>Defense will continue to the largest market for UAVs for the foreseeable future. UAVs can play an important role in counter terrorism and counter insurgency activities. They can be deployed in highly dangerous missions thereby saving personnel lives. The UAVs are also being used in difficult terrains for intelligence gathering and surveillance. They provide high resolution images and videos which can significantly help ground troops. Drones have been used by militaries of many countries to conduct strikes against terrorists.</p><p>Transport</p><p>UAVs are increasingly used in transport activities such as e-commerce parcel delivery, food delivery and medicine delivery. Of these, e-commerce delivery is getting the maximum attention with large companies such as Amazon already doing pilot tests.</p><p>Another promising area for UAVs is the delivery of food. It could be used in heavily populated urban areas for food delivery by restaurants and also could be used to deliver foods to difficult terrains including oil rigs and remote islands. Medical logistics is another area where UAVs can be used to transport medicines and can also be used as flying defibrillators.</p><p>Infrastructure</p><p>UAVs can assist in the management of various kinds of infrastructure, specifically construction sites. In the pre- construction phase, drones can survey the land and provide accurate field data and images. They are able to capture high-resolution videos and images, which can significantly improve the speed and quality of the design process. In the construction phase, drones can inspect the sites and provide accurate information regarding the progress of the construction.</p><p>The data received could be used by investors and property owners to monitor if the project is progressing as per original schedule or not. Abu Dhabi has launched the trial stage of implementing drones as aerial monitoring and inspection tools for the city's engineering projects and construction sites.</p><p>US state of Arizona is mulling the use drones to inspect roads, bridges and other infrastructure. The state has introduced Drone Infrastructure Inspection Grant Act, that would dispense about $200 million to purchase drones and the other half to train pilots to fly them.</p><p>The FAA's rollout of the Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC) has helped standardize and expand the use of drones in construction. LAANC automates the application and approval process for airspace authorizations and is currently available near 500 airports across the country. LAANC is currently in beta and will be tested further before nationwide rollout.</p><p>An increasing number of construction firms and real estate developers in the Middle East are turning to drones amid the COVID-19 crisis. Drones are being used for progress monitoring and site mapping as companies try to speed up delivery of projects. In November 2020, New York's Department of Finance's property division said that it is looking into the use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems for tasks such as surveying tax lots, geographic information system (GIS) mapping and aerial photography.</p><p>Agriculture</p><p>One of the largest projected applications of UAVs in in agriculture. Drones can be used by farmers to monitor their crops. UAVs can survey farmland faster and at a lower cost than airplanes/satellites and also provide better data and images to farmers. The current altitude restrictions for UAVs limit the area that it can survey, but if the altitude restrictions ease a little, the area could expand and provide greater benefits to farmers.</p><p>Japan has been using UAVs for crop dusting for more than 20 years now and drones account for more than 90% of crop dusters. In the US as well, the adoption of drones in agriculture is increasing due to exemption from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) under the part 107 rule.</p><p>China's largest agriculture drone maker XAG is trying to automate rice farming in China with the launch of its drone-based direct seeding system called JetSeed. It could replace manual seed planting and raise efficiency amid a labor shortage due to COVID-19.</p><p>In January 2023, the United Kingdom's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has given operational authorization to China-based XAG's agricultural spraying aircraft P40 and V40. This is the first-time drone spraying and spreading has been legalized for use on UK farms.</p><p>Public Safety</p><p>This area again presents huge opportunities for UAVs. Drones can be used for law enforcement, search and rescue missions, firefighting and medical services. Civil governments are deploying an increasing number of unmanned systems.</p><p>The US and European governments have launched many new pilot programs to deploy UAV systems to protect borders. The United Nations and other peacekeepers are also deploying unmanned aerial systems to provide protection.</p><p>In the US, many agencies have acquired drones. Most of these agencies are police/sheriff departments followed by fire departments. In October 2022, the sheriff department of Las Vegas announced plans to deploy 400 drones as responders to rising gun violence. In Indiana and Maryland, police have successfully used drones to catch suspects and thieves. In Oakland, the fire department used drones to hot spots, which were not extinguished during a firefighting mission. The Los Angeles Fire Department has been using drones to make hot-spot identification and aerial mapping for wildfire response, as well as incident response for other search and rescue missions.</p><p>Further, drones can collect information, data and images on natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes and wildfires. UAVs have great potential for surveying storm damage and locating people after natural disasters. The US National Guard is using AI-powered drones to track wildfires in real time. The AI-backed drones can predict the area where fire is most likely to spread based on previous fires.</p><p>The US is using drones for border security as well. The drones support the border patrol team by providing enhanced intelligence, surveillance capabilities and reducing the risk to human operators on the ground.</p><p>Inspections</p><p>UAVs can be used for inspections in areas such as wind turbines, oil pipelines, power lines, railroads and more. Oil and gas companies can use a drone to conduct the required monthly inspection of their pipelines. Instead of hiring a helicopter, which is costly, companies can use drones to do the same at lower cost. Drone inspections can survey hundreds of miles of pipeline and pinpoint the location of the leaks, thereby reducing traditional surveilling costs by nearly 90%.</p><p>In November 2021, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines announced plans to use of drones for passenger aircraft inspection. The drones can inspect the aircraft for minor damage inflicted by events like hailstorms and lightning strikes.</p><p>Similarly, UAVs can inspect wind turbines, several hundred feet in the air, removing the need for an individual to physically reach the place. Netherlands-based wind energy company Vestas is using drones to conduct inspection of its 1,250 wind turbines. Archaeologists can use UAVs to inspect the sites and also patrol for looters. The city of London is using drones for surveys which are used for repairing and maintaining assets across the underground rail network.</p><p>Tank terminal operators in Germany are pivoting to drones for cost-effective and reliable tank roof inspections. The traditional method for inspecting floating roof tanks entails workers scaling tanks that are 25 meters tall to assess their condition. This process is both labor-intensive and poses significant risks for human error. Considering that tank terminals often house numerous tanks, carrying out manual inspections can be exceedingly time-consuming and hazardous.</p><p>Regulatory Environment</p><p>Drones are taking off in a big way. Once the preserve of the military, UAVs are now widely popular in the commercial sector, thanks to consumer-grade UAVs that become increasingly sophisticated and cheaper. Though regulatory obstacles could hinder growth prospects.</p><p>Currently, there are different sets of rules governing the uses of commercial UAVs around the world. In December 2020, the US FAA approved a new set of regulations governing commercial UAVs. The FAA will allow small drones to operate at night and over people and will require remote identification of the drones. This new regulation will bring a step closer to commercial drone use for agriculture, infrastructure repair, and eventually, even deliveries from companies such as Amazon.</p><p>Canada has had safety regulations in place that govern the use of UAVs. A recreational pilot operating a drone weighing less than 35kgs does not currently require either a license or a special flying permit. It, however, must follow a list of Transport Canada safety guidelines, such as staying nine kilometers from an airport, flying under 90 meters and always keeping the craft within eyesight.</p><p>Australia requires no registration of recreational drones. Recreational drone operators must comply with Civil Aviation and Safety Authority (CASA) rules that allow drones to be flown only within a visual line of sight. There are other restrictions on the maximum altitude, vicinity near airports and flying overcrowded places.</p><p>The regulations allow commercial operators to fly drones weighing less than 2kg without a license. Operators must still adhere to all the existing rules for recreational drone use such as not to fly within 5.5km of an airport, above 400 feet or within 30m of buildings, railways or vehicles, and always to have line of sight of the drone.</p><p>Drones that weigh less than 20kgs in the UK can fly in normal airspace for private use as long as the operator is not planning to use data or images from the flight acquired by flying close to people or objects. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) requires all UAVs to remain 150 meters from crowded events or large assemblies, 50m from an individual or building, and stay within line of sight, which is 500m horizontally and 122m vertically. Drones that weigh more than 20kgs are currently banned from flying in civilian airspace.</p><p>The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has established new rules on drones. Under the rules, drone operators will have to be registered with their national authority and the drones will need to have a direct remote identification system in place. The regulatory framework will ensure the protection of citizens' privacy rights while addressing security issues as well.</p><p>China is moving rapidly to establish regulatory framework for drones. In October 2020, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) announced the first Unmanned Civil Aviation Experimental Zones (UCAEZs) to help accelerate the drone industry in China. The new experimental zones are designed to not only offer the airspace for testing innovative drone applications, but to ease the process of developing drone businesses.</p><p>Challenges and Opportunities</p><p>Opportunities</p><p>UAV industry presents tremendous opportunities for investors, companies as well as government. UAV technology has reached a maturity point that has placed it at the forefront of aerospace manufacturing. As UAV companies around the world make drones more accessible, the UAV sector, despite the undeveloped regulatory framework, is set to develop into one of the most dynamic growth industries this decade. There are some 450 UAV companies worldwide behind this growing multibillion-dollar industry, with the number growing.</p><p>Both the military and commercial markets are set to grow rapidly in the next few years, as the US economy continues to recover, technology continues to diffuse around the world, as designs become more streamlined and efficient and as more industries adopt existing business processes for UAV use.</p><p>The non-military, especially the commercial drone segment, is set to grow the fastest with projections of mid to high teens growth over the next the next decade. The latest developments in computer vision, machine learning, cloud and data analytics are expected to push drone deployment in the mainstream commercial sector. In the US and many other places around the world, the regulations either remain too restrictive or are yet to be given a final shape, which has been a deterrent in the pace of UAV adoption.</p><p>With the explosion of interest in building and operating unmanned aircraft systems, the use of UAV technology is set to generate more high-tech jobs, with millions in tax revenues and tens of billions in economic impact.</p><p>UAV technology is moving ever faster forward as the market continues to flourish. Industry will need to consider how to best integrate UAVs into their businesses.</p><p>Challenges</p><p>Safety, privacy and regulatory barriers remain key challenges for the rapid adoption of UAVs. The most urgent challenge for the governments is to ensure that the drone operations remain safe.</p><p>Privacy is another key concern that needs to be addressed. UAVs collect massive amounts of data including video and images, which sometimes could result in the invasion of personal privacy. A livestream or a recording of individuals or buildings can easily be captured without consent. Also, even if the data collected is with consent, the transmission of data itself remains vulnerable to hacking. The growth and evolution of the UAV industry has outpaced the development of rules and systems to govern their use. This uncertainty weighs on innovation and commercial adoption unless there is more clarity on the rules.</p><p>Illegal use of UAVs for criminal activities is another big challenge. For instance, drug cartels have used drones to transfer illegal drugs in the US. These vehicles tend to fly for short periods at very low altitudes. This makes it very difficult to detect using conventional sensor systems. Also, UASs or drones could be a source of public nuisance. If a drone flying over a public place loses control and falls, it could cause substantial damage to the property as well as endanger lives.</p><p>In conclusion, the UAVs have raised a lot of concerns and it is up to policymakers to design and create laws that facilitate the good use of the technology while discouraging its harmful use.</p><p>Leading Companies</p><p>Aeronautics Ltd (acquired by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd.)</p><p>Aeronautics Ltd is an Israeli company that provides comprehensive Defense Solutions and has become known as one of the major global providers of security consulting services and defense applications.

These include the National Afforestation Programme, Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitat, Forest Fire Prevention and Management, Project Tiger and National Mission for a Green India. Funds under Compensatory Afforestation Management and Planning Authority are also utilized for conservation of forest and wildlife in the Western Ghats.</p><p>In order to protect and conserve Western Ghats, MoEFCC had constituted two Committees viz., the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP) headed by Prof. Madhav Gadgil and the High Level Working Group (HLWG) headed by Dr. K. Kasturirangan, to review the recommendations of the WGEEP. On the basis of the report of the HLWG, MoEFCC has brought out a draft notification on 10th March, 2014, declaring biologically and culturally diverse areas as Eco-sensitive Area, requiring protection and conservation. Considering the views and concerns of the respective State Governments and addressing the concerns and apprehensions of public/stakeholders, the draft of Western Ghats Eco-sensitive Area was re-notified for the fifth time on 6th July, 2022 and a Committee has also been specifically constituted to assist in consultation with the State Governments for finalizing the notification. The validity of the draft notification is till 30th June 2024.</p><p>This information was given by Union Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126053825</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68V5-DNR1-JCBF-S4BW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"293\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 31, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news reporting originating from Karadeniz Technical University by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Continuous monitoring of the forest road infrastructure and keeping track of the changes occurred are important for forestry practices, map updating, forest fire and forest transport decision support systems.\" </p><p><br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Karadeniz Technical University: \"In this context, the most of up to date data can be obtained by automatic forest road extraction from satellite images via machine learning (ML). Acquiring sufficient data is one of the most important factors which affect the success of ML and deep learning (DL). DL architectures yield more consistent results for complex data sets compared with ML algorithms. In the present study, three different deep learning (Resnet-18, MobileNet-V2 and Xception) architectures with semantic segmentation architecture were compared for extracting the forest road network from high-resolution orthophoto images and the results were analyzed. The architectures were evaluated through a multiclass statistical analysis based precision, recall, F1 score, intersection over union and overall accuracy (OA). The results present significant values obtained by the Resnet-18 architecture, with 99.72% of OA and 98.87% of precision and by the MobileNet-V2 architecture, with 97.76% of OA and 98.28% of precision.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Also the results show that Resnet-18, MobileNet-V2 semantic segmentation architectures can be used efficiently for forest road extraction.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Forest road extraction from orthophoto images by convolutional neural networks.

According to news reporting originating from IIT by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Forest fires would be a global disaster if they were not addressed seriously? From 2015 to 2021, the number of forest fires in India nearly tripled.\"</p><p><br/> The news editors obtained a quote from the research from IIT: \"According to FSI, the North Eastern Himalayas, one of UNESCO's 36 Biodiversity Hotspots, account for 36% of forest fires in India. This state is dominated by tribal population which practices shifting agriculture. It's 76.01% of total forest cover is highly prone to Forest fires. Despite this, there hasn't been any time-series research on forest fires in this region. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), Normalized Burnt Ratio (NBR), Aerosol Free Vegetation Index (AFRI 1600), and Land Surface Temperature may all be linked to forest fires (LST). For Mizoram, India, random samples were taken every 16 days using Landsat 8 satellite data across different land cover types, including dense forest, sparse forest, farmland, and bare land etc.\"<br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The study was conducted on a bimonthly basis from January 2016 to June 2021. The findings of this work show that an automated temporal analysis utilizing GEE may be used successfully over a wide range of land cover types, providing critical data for future monitoring of such threats.\"<br/> For more information on this research see: Google Earth Engine Based Temporal Analysis of Indices Used For Forest Fire Study in Mizoram, India. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences</emphasis>, 2022,XLIII-B3-2022():493-499.

President Yoon Suk Yeol declared the city on the east coast a \"special disaster zone\" to expedite repair and support. The dry forest caught fire due to a lengthy drought and rapidly spread through the high wind that interrupted the choppers' firefighting activities. The damage could have snowballed if not for the timely rain.</p><p>The latest wildfire has worsened from strong wind. The frequency of wildfires - 34 so far in the spring, including the massive forest fire in Seoul at Mount Inwang earlier this month - raises the alarm about climate change. Although climate change cannot be solved overnight, damage can be lessened through more thorough readiness.</p><p>Wildfires can frequently occur due to the dangerous mix of the dry climate and high wind. The fire that started off at Uljin, North Gyeongsang, in March last year reached as far as Samcheok, Gangwon, in the northeast due to high wind. Because of the expansive spread, extinguishing the fire had been tough. Although fire has become regular in the spring season, nothing has changed in our fire response system, as the latest fire shows.</p><p>Wildfires can be seasonal, as dry climates and high winds can occur every spring. The latest forest fire worsened due to the late arrival of the helicopter fleet. Residents of Gangneung had to pray for rain due to frustratingly slow chopper aid.</p><p>Authorities must study alternatives to respond to wildfires. President Yoon canceled his planned meeting with floor leaders of his People Power Party to address to fire issue. The government must come up with practical and detailed measures. In case firefighting helicopters cannot be mobilized due to high wind, making roads for ground support could be an idea. We can benchmark the Slovakian idea of digging wells in the mountains to get ready for fires. Since Seoul National University is experimenting with mitigation measures, we may know of the validity of applying such an idea to our forests.</p><p>The army, the police and even civilian backup also should be studied when firefighters are short. Authorities should study what kind of trees they must plant in the mountains, as some argue that pine trees dominant in Korean forests are susceptible to catching fire because they contain a relatively high level of resins and oils. Since most fires start from carelessness, punishment should be strengthened. We cannot rely on the mercy of Mother Nature when the danger of climate change is escalating.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASEANT-ASEANTRIB1404202300114</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASEANT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6815-X241-F00C-62DJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434137</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"441\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 ASEAN Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>ASEAN Tribune</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"29734\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"04\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>April 14, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Rotorcraft</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDI1Rjc4RTRCNEEyNEFEMjlCMTVGODg5OTg3NTZFQzE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkEyRTREQTdBRjkzNDE5OTk4ODAzMEY5MDkzRjlGRTE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp;

Forsgren that aircraft spraying pesticides over waters are point sources, a holding that, along with later rulings, led eventually to EPA writing a general permit for such activities and one that will almost certainly be relevant in the instant case.</p><p>The Forest Service's 2011 record of decision (ROD) to continue the aerial use of retardants references EPA's comments on the draft version of the EIS, saying the service \"has a determination from the EPA that [an NPDES] permit is not necessary for aerial delivery of fire retardant.\"</p><p>The EPA comment letter says pilots operating in compliance with the service's 2011 guidelines requiring a 300-foot buffer zone on either side of any surface water \"would presumably not be discharging fire retardant into waters of the United States and therefore\" an NPDES permit \"would not be required.\"</p><p>EPA added that while \"NPDES permits are not required for operators that are not discharging into waters of the US,\" the agency recommended the final 2011 EIS include a discussion of relevant CWA water quality standards and the potential for aerial application of fire retardant to contribute to exceedances of the standards, including water quality criteria to protect designated beneficial uses of surface waters, which the final EIS does.</p><p>'Factual Basis'</p><p>But FSEEE says \"the factual basis for the letter -- 'operators [] are not discharging into waters of the US'-- is simply not true\" because the Forest Service \"acknowledges hundreds of retardant discharges into waterways from misapplications and allowable exceptions.\"</p><p>\"An EPA opinion cannot amend the Clean Water Act, which requires a NPDES permit for the discharge of fire retardant from aircraft into waterways,\" the complaint says.</p><p>If fire retardant enters a waterway, direct effects include lethal and sublethal effects on aquatic species, which can include mortality of organisms, change in abundance and composition of aquatic communities, or adverse impacts to habitat, the complaint says.</p><p>From 2012 to 2019 there were 138 intrusions into threatened or endangered species habitat that required consultation, and as such, the expected rate of intrusions is assumed to be 17 per year, FSEEE says.</p><p>But it adds that retardant use is increasing, suggesting that more retardant will be discharged to navigable waters in the future. -- Lara Beaven (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:lbeaven@iwpnews.com\">lbeaven@iwpnews.com</email>)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EPADLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EPADLY2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66M5-PG51-JBHM-S2D7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">405432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-10-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"656\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Inside Washington Publishers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Daily Briefing</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"10\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>October 14, 2022</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Business &amp;

Inside the entryway, the floor was strewn with thick glass shards, religious booklets and offering envelopes.</p><p>Pastor Wade McCrae, who preaches to 250 congregants in person most Sundays with hundreds more watching online, said the sanctuary was undamaged.

And you think, \u2018This is bad\u2019. And you recover from that. And then another one hits, and you\u2019re like, \u2018ok that stings\u2019. But after about four or five, it starts to feel pretty overwhelming.\u201d</p><p>Portwood\u2019s house in Dekle Beach on the county\u2019s long undeveloped coastline was gutted by Hurricane Helene, though the structure still stands. Beyond his own home, Portwood said he\u2019s worried about the future of this county that is steadily having its tax base wiped off the map.</p><h>2 firefighters killed in South Carolina were struck by a tree</h><p>COLUMBIA, S.C. \u2014 Two firefighters killed during Hurricane Helene in South Carolina were struck by a tree, authorities said.</p><p>The tree hit their firetruck around 6:30 a.m. Friday about 4 miles (6 kilometers) west of Batesburg-Leesville, South Carolina Highway Patrol Cpl.

But he said the water release would likely flood roads and bridges that some residents use to access their homes.</p><p>\u201cIf they don\u2019t leave now, they\u2019re going to be stuck there for at least a day or multiple hours,\u201d Georgia Gov.

It\u2019s a place where Susan Sauls Hartway and her four-year-old Chihuahua mix Lucy could afford to live within walking distance of the beach on her salary as a housekeeper.</p><p>At least until her home was carried away by Helene.</p><p>\u201cI knew it would be bad, but I had no idea it was going to be this bad,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is unbelievable.\u201d</p><p>Friday afternoon, Hartway and Lucy wandered around their street near Ezell Beach, searching for where the storm may have deposited her home.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gone. I don\u2019t know where it\u2019s at. I can\u2019t find it,\u201d she said.</p><p>Born and raised in Taylor County, Hartway said there is nowhere in the world she would rather be, even after Helene. But she\u2019s watched as wealthier residents from out of state have bought up second homes here. She wonders how many of them will sell out \u2014 and what will happen to the locals who have nowhere else to go.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s so many people down here, they don\u2019t have any place to go now.

Best on Friday estimated that insurers will pay $5 billion or more to cover losses from Hurricane Helene.</p><p>That\u2019s not the total amount of loss, some of which is uninsured and some of which may be repaid with federal aid. Instead, it's the amount that insurance companies are on the hook for.</p><p>A.M. Best said insurers paid $2.5 billion to $4 billion in losses for Hurricane Idalia last year, and it expects losses from Helene to be more severe given its broader wind field and a path that hit more urban areas inland.</p><h>Curfew issued in western North Carolina community hit hard by Helene</h><p>ASHEVILLE, N.C. \u2014 Officials in a western North Carolina town have issued a curfew due to safety risks from flooded streets and downed power lines from what remains of Hurricane Helene.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous out there,\u201d Asheville Police Chief Mike Lamb said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have to be out, don\u2019t go out.\u201d</p><p>Lamb said the curfew would occur over a 12-hour period starting at 7:30 p.m. on Friday and Saturday.</p><p>No fatalities have been reported, although officials said any death count won\u2019t be released until family notifications have been made.</p><p>Buncombe County Manager Avril Pinder said hundreds of residents were forced to seek safety at shelters.</p><p>The county\u2019s 911 center received more than 3,300 calls over an eight-hour period Friday, and more than 130 swift-water rescues have been conducted, said county Emergency Services Assistant Director Ryan Cole. He said it took crews more than four hours to reach several homes that were hit by a mudslide.</p><p>\u201cThis is something that we\u2019re going to be dealing with for many days and weeks to come,\u201d Cole said. \u201cSo please be patient.\u201d</p><h>Former Tropical Storm John dissipates over Mexico</h><p>MEXICO \u2014 Former Tropical Storm John has dissipated over Mexico, but its remnants will continue to produce rain over the Mexican states of Guerrero and Michoac\u00e1n.</p><p>The storm made landfall twice in Mexico, first as a hurricane Monday and a second time as a tropical storm Friday.</p><h>Helene downgraded to a post-tropical cyclone</h><p>MIAMI \u2014 The U.S. National Hurricane Center has downgraded Helene from a tropical depression to a post-tropical cyclone.</p><p>Helene, a Category 4 hurricane when it made landfall in Florida late Thursday night, was 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of Louisville, Kentucky, at about 5 p.m. EDT. It was moving northwest at 17 mph (28 kph), according to the hurricane center.</p><p>The storm was expected to continue producing heavy rain in the area and cause severe flash-flooding as a result. Isolated tornadoes Friday evening were possible in Virginia and North Carolina, the hurricane center said.</p><h>Thousands ordered to evacuate after \u2018catastrophic failure\u2019 of a dam in eastern Tennessee</h><p>NASHVILLE \u2014 In eastern Tennessee, a \u201ccatastrophic failure\u201d of Waterville Dam spurred Cocke County Mayor Rob Mathis to hand down evacuation orders for all of downtown Newport, according to the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency. Newport is a city of about 7,000 people roughly 60 miles (97 kilometers) southwest of where dozens of people were being rescued from the roof of a hospital.</p><h>Over 1 million customers are still without power in South Carolina</h><p>COLUMBIA, S.C. \u2014 More than 1 million customers remained without power in South Carolina several hours after the remnants of Hurricane Helene left the state and the sun started to come out.</p><p>Utility officials warned power could be out for many for a long time. Crews were still assessing the damage and in some cases needed to cut their way through debris just to determine what was left standing.</p><p>\u201cYou will be frustrated. Tomorrow it\u2019s going to be 86 degrees and clear. You\u2019re going to say \u2018Why can\u2019t I watch the football game? Why can\u2019t my life be back to normal?\u2019 Life\u2019s not going to be back to normal until probably the middle of next week,\u201d Dominion Energy South Carolina President Keller Kissam said Friday.</p><p>The 1.2 million South Carolina customers without power represent more than 40% of homes and businesses in the state.</p><p>Gov. Henry McMaster said the storm moved east of where it was forecast and gave the state a bigger blow than expected.</p><p>\u201cWe urge everybody to be patient and keep your neighbors in your prayers,\u201d McMaster said.</p><h>4 people critically injured after a tornado touches down in North Carolina</h><p>ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. \u2014 Four people were critically injured and numerous others sustained minor injuries after a tornado touched down in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, officials said.</p><p>Three buildings received significant damage, including two restaurants and an auto service center, while a fourth building, a cafeteria, received minor roof damage, Nash County Communications Director Jonathan Edwards said Friday.</p><p>The damage appeared to be concentrated on Wesleyan Boulevard and Tiffany Boulevard. An 18-wheel tractor-trailer truck also flipped over in that area, but the driver was not hurt, Edwards said.</p><h>Death toll in Georgia rises to 15</h><p>ATLANTA \u2014 At least 15 people have died in Georgia from causes related to Hurricane Helene, according to Garrison Douglas, a spokesperson for Gov. Brian Kemp.</p><h>\u2018The word that just keeps coming to my mind is just devastated\u2019</h><p>PERRY, Fla. \u2014 Taylor County, Florida has had a rough couple of years.</p><p>Since August of 2023, the rural community along Florida\u2019s Big Bend has taken direct hits from three hurricanes \u2014 and seen the closure of its local paper mill, which for decades had been one of the economic lifelines for a county where one in six residents lives below the poverty line.</p><p>\u201cThe word that just keeps coming to my mind is just devastated,\u201d said Aaron Portwood, publisher of Perry Newspapers, which is based in the county seat of Perry. \u201cYou get hit with one thing. And you think, \u2018This is bad\u2019. And you recover from that. And then another one hits, and you\u2019re like, \u2018ok that stings\u2019. But after about four or five, it starts to feel pretty overwhelming.\u201d</p><p>Portwood\u2019s house in Dekle Beach on the county\u2019s long undeveloped coastline was gutted by Hurricane Helene, though the structure still stands. Beyond his own home, Portwood said he\u2019s worried about the future of this county that is steadily having its tax base wiped off the map.</p><h>2 firefighters killed in South Carolina were struck by a tree</h><p>COLUMBIA, S.C. \u2014 Two firefighters killed during Hurricane Helene in South Carolina were struck by a tree, authorities said.</p><p>The tree hit their firetruck around 6:30 a.m. Friday about 4 miles (6 kilometers) west of Batesburg-Leesville, South Carolina Highway Patrol Cpl. David Jones said.</p><p>The Saluda County Coroner\u2019s Office has not released the names of the firefighters.</p><p>At least 17 people have been killed in South Carolina as Hurricane Helene tore through the western part of the state.</p><h>A mudslide and floodwaters wash out interstate at the North Carolina-Tennessee state line</h><p>A mudslide and record floodwaters from the remnants of Hurricane Helene washed out a section of an interstate highway at the North Carolina-Tennessee state line, transportation officials said.</p><p>Photos and video posted on social media showed at least one lane of I-40 had collapsed above the swollen Pigeon River.</p><p>The Tennessee Department of Transportation said the interstate was closed in both directions.</p><p>The National Weather Service said a flash flood warning continued for the Pigeon River, which crested Friday morning about 3 feet (1 meter) above its previous record level set by the remnants of Hurricane Ivan in September 2004.</p><h>Georgia Power to make an emergency water release from a dam near Lake Rabun</h><p>ATLANTA \u2014 Georgia Power Co. is making an emergency release of water from a northeast Georgia dam following heavy rains from Hurricane Helene.</p><p>Georgia Emergency Management Director Chris Stallings said no residents who live near Lake Rabun in the state\u2019s mountainous northeast corner were in danger of being flooded. But he said the water release would likely flood roads and bridges that some residents use to access their homes.</p><p>\u201cIf they don\u2019t leave now, they\u2019re going to be stuck there for at least a day or multiple hours,\u201d Georgia Gov.

I assure you that we want to get your power back on just as safely and as quickly as possible.\u201d</p><h>A Florida congregation must rebuild again after Helene</h><p>PERRY, Fla. \u2014 The congregation at Potter\u2019s House Ministries church in Perry, Florida, was just weeks away from moving back into their newly renovated sanctuary after rebuilding in the wake of last year\u2019s Hurricane Idalia. Then Hurricane Helene peeled back the brand-new roof, scattering sheets of aluminum across the church grounds.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really heartbreaking,\u201d said parishioner Stephen Tucker, moved to tears as he surveyed the damage the morning after Helene made landfall. \u201cI know it\u2019s in God\u2019s will for this to happen. And it\u2019s by the grace of God that we\u2019re still here.\u201d</p><p>Tucker said it\u2019s been one blow after another for the community he\u2019s lived in all of his 51 years \u2014 a one, two, three punch from Idalia last August, then Debby a year later and now Helene, all making landfall within about 30 miles (48 kilometers) of each other in one county in this rural stretch of Florida\u2019s Big Bend.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like it never stops,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy Taylor County?\u201d</p><h>Multiple hospitals without power in south Georgia</h><p>ATLANTA \u2014 Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said multiple hospitals in south Georgia are without power after Helene knocked out both their primary power and their generators.</p><p>Kemp said trees had fallen densely in the eastern part of the state.</p><p>\u201cWe know we still have people trapped in homes that we\u2019re trying to cut our way into right now,\u201d Kemp told Fox News.</p><p>\u201cWe have a lot of resources that we have on the ground already,\u201d Kemp added. \u201cWe\u2019re calling up additional National Guard, and we\u2019re going to throw everything we got at it.\u201d</p><p>Kemp said wind damage is less severe in metro Atlanta.</p><p>\u201cThe storm really stayed straight or either moved to the east a little bit, which spared some of our state from being on the dirty side of the storm. So if there\u2019s any blessing in disguise, that\u2019s probably it.\u201d</p><h>\u2018We\u2019re blessed it's still standing'</h><p>VALDOSTA, Ga. \u2014 The hurricane\u2019s winds stripped away the siding from the steeple in front of Union Cathedral in Valdosta, Georgia, exposing its metal frame and littering the parking lot with shredded foam and plaster.</p><p>The storm also smashed plate glass windows by the front doors. Inside the entryway, the floor was strewn with thick glass shards, religious booklets and offering envelopes.</p><p>Pastor Wade McCrae, who preaches to 250 congregants in person most Sundays with hundreds more watching online, said the sanctuary was undamaged. Deacons were running errands to bring plywood and tools to cover the broken window. McCrae hoped to be able to hold services this Sunday.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re blessed it\u2019s still standing,\u201d he said.</p><h>20 people in Atlanta rescued overnight by firefighters</h><p>ATLANTA \u2014 Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens tells reporters that firefighters rescued about 20 people overnight from cars or apartments imperiled by swiftly rising floodwaters.</p><h>Residents in Florida\u2019s Big Bend region wake up to widespread power outages</h><p>PERRY, Fla. \u2014 Residents of Florida\u2019s Big Bend region woke up to widespread power outages Friday morning after Hurricane Helene made landfall overnight near the mouth of the Aucilla River.</p><p>Helene slammed ashore in the largely rural stretch of Florida as a Category 4 hurricane, becoming the third hurricane to batter that swath of the state in a little over a year.</p><p>As the sun rose over U.S. Highway 27 outside of Perry, cars dodged and weaved among downed pine trees that blocked portions of the road, some ensnarled in power lines.

According to news reporting originating from Tomsk, Russia, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Thunderstorms are the main natural source of forest fires. The ignition mechanism of trees begins with the impact of cloud-to-ground lightning discharge.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Russian Foundation For Basic Research. <br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Tomsk Polytechnic University: \"A common drawback of all predicting systems is that they ignore the physical mechanism of forest fire as a result of thunderstorm activity. The purpose of this article is to develop a physically based mathematical model for the ignition of a coniferous tree via cloud-to-ground lightning discharge, taking into account thermophysical, electrophysical, and physicochemical processes. The novelty of the article is explained by the development of an improved mathematical model for the ignition of coniferous trees via cloud-to-ground lightning discharge, taking into account the processes of soot formation caused by the thermal decomposition phase of dry organic matter. Mathematically, the process of tree ignition is described by a system of non-stationary nonlinear differential equations of heat conduction and diffusion. In this research, a locally one-dimensional method is used to solve three-dimensional partial differential equations. The finite difference method is used to solve one-dimensional heat conduction and diffusion equations. Difference analogues of the equations are solved using the marching method. To resolve nonlinearity, a simple iteration method is used. Temperature distributions in a structurally inhomogeneous trunk of a coniferous tree, as well as distributions of volume fractions of phases and concentrations of gas mixture components, are obtained.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The conditions for tree trunk ignition under conditions of thunderstorm activity are determined. As a result, a complex three-dimensional mathematical model is developed, which makes it possible to identify the conditions for the ignition of a coniferous tree trunk via cloud-to-ground lightning discharge.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Complex Three-Dimensional Mathematical Model of the Ignition of a Coniferous Tree via a Cloud-to-Ground Lightning Discharge: Electrophysical, Thermophysical and Physico-Chemical Processes.

The airports receiving funding are:</p><p>* * *</p><p>Bella Bella Campbell Island Airport</p><p>* to improve Runway 13-31 end safety area - $5,527,913</p><p>* * *</p><p>Campbell River Airport</p><p>* to purchase a 4 x 4 plow truck - $558,375</p><p>* * *</p><p>Castlegar, West Kootenay Regional Airport</p><p>* to rehabilitate and expand the taxiway and Apron 5 - $2,359,820</p><p>* * *</p><p>Kamloops Airport</p><p>* to rehabilitate Apron 1 - $2,091,362</p><p>* * *</p><p>Nanaimo Airport</p><p>* to purchase a loader - $346,860</p><p>* * *</p><p>Quesnel Regional Airport</p><p>* to purchase a sweeper - $491,500</p><p>* * *</p><p>Terrace-Kitimat, Northwest Regional Airport</p><p>* to replace omni-directional approach lights on Runway 15 - $108,599</p><p>* * *</p><p>Tofino-Long Beach Airport</p><p>* to purchase a loader - $533,631</p><p>* * *</p><p>The runway improvements in Bella Bella include the removal of rock and terrain that intrude into the takeoff and landing airspace, which is especially important should there be a runway excursion. The equipment in Campbell River, Nanaimo, Quesnel, and Tofino-Long Beach will be used in maintaining aircraft movement surfaces and for the removal and control of ice and snow from airside surfaces such as runways, taxiways and the apron.</p><p>The taxiway expansion project in Castlegar will allow for more space between aircraft, resulting in greater efficiency and safety when more than one aircraft is present. Multiple aircraft activity can occur in situations during aerial fire suppression activities directed by the provincial Forestry Air Tanker Base located in Castlegar, allowing the tankers to land and refill their water supply more quickly.</p><p>The replacement of omni-directional approach lights with LED in Terrace-Kitimat will result in brighter lights and cost savings.

Efforts should now be focussed on prevention rather than cure.</p><p>\"We are no longer capable of coping under current conditions with the current firefighting manpower, thus the importance of acting beforehand on prevention, rather than afterwards on firefighting and extinguishing,\" she said.</p><p>Records tumbled on the American continent this year as it went through a forest fire season in which nearly 80 million hectares (198 million acres) had burned by December 23.</p><p>That is one and a half times the surface area of Spain, and 10 million hectares (24 million acres) more than the average from 2012-2022 on the same date, according to the Global Wildfire Information System (GWIS).</p><p>Canada, where 18 million hectares (44.5 million acres) went up in smoke over the year, drove the increase.</p><p>The fires were caused by dryer and hotter weather conditions driven by climate change.</p><p>With 97 dead and 31 missing in fires in Hawaii in August, 34 killed in Algeria, and at least 26 dead in Greece, the year with more than 250 deaths overall was the deadliest of the 21st century, according to the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) run by the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium.</p><p>Vilain-Carlotti told AFP the rate of excess deaths risks increasing in the coming years, as wildfires come dangerously close to towns and cities.</p><p>In 2023 the wildfires engulfed not only areas usually susceptible to forest fires like Greece, Italy, Tunisia, and Algeria in the Mediterranean basin and North America and Australia, but also areas which are usually spared like Hawaii or Tenerife.</p><p>In August, Hawaii's historic royal seat of Lahaina was levelled by a wildfire.</p><p>As the fires spread even further, vegetation has less time to regrow, leaving the forests liable to lose their capacity to absorb carbon dioxide.</p><p>According to recent studies, the fires reduce the storage of carbon dioxide by around 10 percent, Solene Turquety, a researcher at France's LATMOS (Atmospheres, Environments, Space Observations Laboratory), said.</p><p>And as they burn, the trees suddenly release all of the CO2 that they have stored.</p><p>Since the beginning of 2023, wildfires have released some 6.5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, according to GWIS.</p><p>That compares to 36.8 billion tonnes from fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal and cement.</p><p>As a rule, around 80 percent of carbon generated by the forest fires is then reabsorbed by the vegetation which grows again the next season.</p><p>The remaining 20 percent then builds up in the atmosphere, contributing the climate change.</p><p>Apart from CO2, fires release a string of dangerous particles, from carbon monoxide to ash, soot, and organic carbon.</p><p>\"These emissions very heavily alter the air quality, over hundreds of kilometres (miles) in the case of the most intense fires,\" Turquety said.</p><p>She said there is \"an immediate health impact\" on top of \"the destruction of ecosystems, property and infrastructure\".</p><p>According to a study published in September in Nature, the populations of the poorest countries, in particular in central Africa, are by far more exposed to the air pollution caused by these fires than those in industrialised countries.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ibtimes.com/forest-fires-record-year-3721269\">Link to the original

Inside the entryway, the floor was strewn with thick glass shards, religious booklets and offering envelopes.</p><p>Pastor Wade McCrae, who preaches to 250 congregants in person most Sundays with hundreds more watching online, said the sanctuary was undamaged.

The latest data from the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre shows that, as of Wednesday, a total of 4,774 fires have occurred nationwide in Canada, with cumulative burned areas of more than 121,000 square kilometers. This data has far exceeded the country's historical record of 76,000 square kilometers burned in 1989, surpassing the land area of South Korea, and is 7.5 times the cumulative disaster areas of wildfires in China from 2000 to 2021.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In addition to endangering the lives and property of local residents, the ecological damage and the emission of greenhouse gases caused by the wildfires have had an immeasurable impact on the human living environment. Recently, Chinese scientists used scientific methods to assess it and concluded that, as of Wednesday, the carbon dioxide emissions from Canadian wildfires have reached approximately 1 billion tons. Chinese scientists involved in this research told the Global Times that this astonishing data indicates that the carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxides emitted by Canadian wildfires have had an undeniable impact on global climate warming. This has already developed into a global environmental event, rather than just wildfires happening in Canada, the scientists warned.</p><p>\"Remote sensing technology is an effective method currently used to estimate carbon emissions from large-scale wildfires. It can conduct rapid and accurate assessment of carbon emissions from wildfires,\" Liu Zhihua, a researcher at the Shenyang-based Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, who participated in this study, told the Global Times on Wednesday.</p><p>The scientists estimated that, as of Wednesday, the carbon dioxide emissions from Canadian wildfires had reached approximately 1 billion tons.</p><p>In addition, Chinese scientists have estimated through the emission factor method that the greenhouse effect of methane and nitrous oxide emitted from this wildfires is approximately equivalent to 110 million tons of carbon dioxide. Combined with the direct emission of 1 billion tons of carbon dioxide, the carbon dioxide emissions from Canadian wildfires is equivalent to about 1.11 billion tons. Liu believes that this figure is quite astonishing, as the carbon dioxide emissions related to fossil energy in Canada in 2021 were about 546 million tons, and the carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from this year's wildfires are nearly twice that amount. 1.11 billion tons of carbon dioxide have already exceeded Japan's total energy-related carbon dioxide emissions for the year 2021, according to Liu.</p><p>According to data from the Global Carbon Project, Japan's total energy-related carbon dioxide emissions in 2021 were 1.067 billion tons, ranking fifth globally.</p><p>However, the wildfire in Canada this time has surpassed that record. \"Furthermore, there is a concerning situation where about one eighth of the wildfires in Canada occur in permafrost areas, which could potentially promote the release of methane stored in the permafrost,\" Liu said.</p><p>In addition to causing serious harm to the climate through greenhouse gas emissions, this year's wildfires in Canada has also released air pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, organic aerosols, and black carbon. This will inevitably have an impact on the environment and harm human health.</p><p>\"Up to now, this wildfire has had significant cross-border impacts on air quality four times, namely from May 17 to 26, June 6 to 19, June 23 to 30, and July 15 to 20.</p><p>During these four instances of cross-border transmission, the air quality in the US was significantly reduced, with particulate matter exceeding 50 micrograms per cubic meter, leading to flight cancellations, school closures, and severe disruptions to production and daily life.</p><p>Among them, the second transmission process resulted in the most severe pollution weather in New York City since 1960. The third transmission process caused Chicago's air quality index to exceed the standard by 5.6 times on June 27, which will inevitably pose significant risks to the respiratory systems of local residents,\" Liu explained.</p><p>What is more serious is that due to the westerly circulation and weather dynamics, the PM2.5 released from the Canadian wildfire has also been transported across long distances.</p><p>Wang Zhe, an associate researcher at the Institute of Atmospheric Physics of the CAS, who participated in this study, told Global Times on Wednesday that research shows that PM2.5 released from the wildfires reached the Scandinavian Peninsula in Europe on May 25, spread to Iceland and Greenland on June 8, and affected mainland Europe on June 26. The atmospheric transport process from June 27 to 30 contributed more than 5 micrograms per cubic meter of PM2.5 in Europe. This transport process even affected North Africa and Asia, impacting a large area in the western part of China, contributing approximately 1-2 micrograms per cubic meter to PM2.5 concentrations in the western region of China, according to Wang.</p><p>\"Wildfires in Canada are indeed a global environmental event, and their ultimate impact will certainly be much more severe than the current data suggests,\" Wang said.</p><p>He further stated that this research outcome is only a preliminary assessment, and a comprehensive evaluation of the wildfires will be conducted once they are over. This evaluation will include the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on climate, the impact of particle emissions on the environment, and the effects on human health.</p><p>\"We are currently combining air pollution epidemiology to assess the impact of this wildfire on human health, because the particulate matter generated by the wildfire may be more harmful to the human body than traditional PM2.5. The impact could be 2 to 10 times greater, mainly because the small particles produced by the forest wildfires are more likely to enter our lungs and then enter our bloodstream. This not only affects the respiratory system but also the cardiovascular system. Therefore, we will also conduct a comprehensive assessment of the harm caused by this wildfire to the human body in the later stage,\" Wang noted.</p><p>Rapidly burning wildfires can cause extensive damage and death to vegetation, resulting in not only a loss of biodiversity but also the loss of habitat and food sources for animals. Additionally, wildfires can destroy the vegetation cover, leading to exposed soil surfaces and exacerbating the frequency of secondary disasters such as soil erosion, sediment runoff, and landslides.</p><p>Wang further pointed out that the recent Canadian wildfires may also have an impact on the frozen layers in the polar regions. For example, the emissions of organic aerosols and black carbon, if deposited on the surface of the Arctic sea ice, can cause rapid melting of the ice. Therefore, the impacts of this wildfire are very complex and a comprehensive assessment will be needed using more comprehensive Earth system models in the future.</p><p>In recent years, with the increasing impact of climate change and human activities, extreme forest fires have been occurring frequently all around the world.</p><p>For example, in 2019, the Amazon forest fires caused a burnt area of over 90,000 square kilometers in 10 months. In 2019-2020, the Australian bushfires led to a burnt area of 243,000 square kilometers in one year. In 2021, the wildfires in Russia resulted in a burnt area of 181,600 square kilometers.</p><p>The wildfire season in Canada usually lasts until October, and there is a possibility that the current wildfire will continue to spread. The academic community also believes that the scale of the disaster will further expand, surpassing the country's historical records.</p><p>For a long time, the Western academic community has considered fire disturbance a natural process that regulates forest ecosystems, benefiting the stability of ecosystem structure and function. However, Liu believes that in recent years, the frequent occurrence of large-scale wildfires has exceeded the range of natural variation and has evolved into a destructive disaster.</p><p>Frequent and severe wildfires not only rapidly deplete carbon reserves in vegetation and soil, but also alter the natural succession of forests, leading to ecosystem degradation into shrublands or grasslands, significantly reducing the carbon sequestration function of the ecosystem. Therefore, large-scale wildfires disrupt the balance of ecosystems, rather than being considered as traditional ecological disturbance processes, Liu explained.</p><p>\"The forest protection concept in European and American countries first focuses on the protection of people's lives and property, and secondly on important natural resource areas. As to the fires in remote areas, they preferring monitoring rather than interfering in as they believe that everything will eventually return to its original state after one or two hundred years, considering it as a natural evolutionary process,\" Liu said.</p><p>However, Liu noted that extreme environmental events are occurring frequently nowadays, which has exceeded the scope of natural changes and has evolved into a destructive ecological disaster. At this time, proper human intervention is needed.</p><p>If the fires go straight up to the tree crowns and become strong, the effectiveness of human intervention may be limited. Currently, wildfires in Canada spread very quickly and release a lot of energy, so the effectiveness of human intervention is limited.\" Liu explained to the Global Times.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that the forest area in China is approximately 2.31 million square kilometers, which is roughly two-thirds of the forest area in Canada. The forest coverage rate is about 24.02 percent. Such extensive distribution of forests has brought significant challenges to our country's forest fire prevention work. However, over the years, China has accumulated rich experience in forest fire prevention and control, successfully reducing the occurrence rate and disaster losses of forest fires, and significantly improving the comprehensive capacity for fire prevention and control, Liu said.</p><p>According to estimation, the average annual emission of carbon dioxide caused by forest fires in China from 2000-2021 was approximately 15 million tons, only account for 0.2 percent of the global forest fire emissions, demonstrating China's responsible role as a major country, Liu said.

The jurors are often a mix of scientists and artists, some of whom have their works in the \"Art About Agriculture\" permanent collection, a growing archive of art promoting agricultural awareness and appreciation displayed in public spaces across Oregon.</p><p>This year, the program received 386 submissions from 126 artists.</p><p>Agriculture defined</p><p>Portland mixed-media artist Nancy Helmsworth said she first learned about the exhibition from a friend and thought her work would fit with its themes and goals.</p><p>\"The OSU definition of 'agriculture' is a broad subject that touches the variety of natural resources that we find here in Oregon, and as an artist, I am inspired by some of those same features,\" Helmsworth said by email.</p><p>Helmsworth's artwork \"Devastation, after the forest fire. Is this our new normal?\" \u2014 Premore's curator selection for the 2024 tour \u2014 was an attempt to capture her \"discomfort with the increasing fires\" in the West, and worry about the inaction of political leaders in the face of the threats to human and natural resources posed by these fires.</p><p>\"My experience has indicated that those who do not live in the West really do not understand the oppressive nature of the smoke and the scale of destruction of the fires,\" Helmsworth wrote.</p><p>Helmsworth said the summer of 2023 proved to be a turning point, and continues to raise concerns about increasingly common wildfires and society's \"state of learned helplessness\" in the face of the destruction they cause.</p><p>The artwork, for which she found models in Cornelius Gijsbrechts' 1600s \"Vanitas,\" attempts to balance those concerns and vulnerabilities.</p><p>Gijsbrechts' \"realistic still life paintings were drawing attention to the transience of pleasure and the vulnerable, limited time of life,\" Helmsworth said.</p><p>\"I think that is the attitude I hope to convey in my mixed-media vignette. Life is fragile \u2014 let's notice what is happening.\"</p><p>These kinds of conversations, though difficult, are the kinds Premore said he encouraged student artists submitting for the first time to allow themselves to have in their work.</p><p>\"One thing I really appreciate about OSU is they have no hesitation at all in talking about the big topics,\" Premore said.</p><p>But even amid those difficult conversations is the opportunity to acknowledge and be awed by the natural world.</p><p>Retired physician and Eugene-based photographer Bryan Andresen's photograph, \"Open Range, Eastern Oregon,\" which is the face of the touring exhibition this year, is an example of this.</p><p>Andresen grew up around farms in Junction City and worked on farms in Iowa while attending college, as well as several other states while taking a year off from college.</p><p>In 2016, as an escape from a political landscape rife with negativity, Andresen returned to photography, in which he'd had some interest. His photography focuses heavily on the natural world; water, landscapes, the elements, plant and animal life.</p><p>\"Open Range, Eastern Oregon\" was serendipitously shot after he stopped a car full of friends to photograph the way light fell on a herd of cattle grazing along a highway in Eastern Oregon.</p><p>\"It's a little scary, but I feel honored,\" Andresen said about having the photograph featured throughout this year's exhibition tour.</p><p>Symbiosis</p><p>What do these two disciplines do for each other as they interact in this annual exhibition?</p><p>\"At a fundamental level, farmers are providing nourishment, which is pretty profound if you think about it,\" Andresen said, especially over the last century, when more Americans have been distanced from the difficult work that is food production as it has become more industrial.</p><p>Art, at best, serves as a reminder of the \"miracle of the transformation of soil, water, nutrition; there's something very sacred about that,\" Andresen said.</p><p>Because of the toil that food production entails, it is easy to forget there is something magical about how it all comes together.</p><p>\"I think art can perhaps provide a reminder both of beauty as well as provide some gratitude for them performing this profession,\" Andresen said.</p><p>This appreciation is only a very small fraction of the work that food production entails, but, he added, \"What is art but hopefully expanding our awareness and maybe gratitude for the lives we're going through?\"</p><p>Premore considers art as having the capacity to bridge the urban and rural divides in communicating agriculture.</p><p>While in the past the exhibit has focused heavily on showing in urban centers, Premore said he's been more focused on showing in more rural venues.</p><p>\"For instance, Oregon Coast School of Art, they didn't have a gallery, but I've been watching their progress as an art center,\" Premore said.</p><p>He contacted the founders asking if they had a gallery space to host the \"Art About Agriculture\" exhibition. They had a potential space and he helped them put together a grant application to secure $67,000 in funding to set up the gallery.</p><p>\"'Art About Agriculture' is going to be their first show,\" Premore said.</p><p>It will also be the final location of the tour, which begins Tuesday, May 7 at the Giustina Gallery at the LaSells Stewart Center at Oregon State. An opening reception is set for 5 to 7:30 p.m. Thursday, May 23.</p><p>The tour will run through June 26 at Oregon State before moving to the Rotunda Gallery, Barber Library at Central Oregon Community College in Bend, where it will be hosted from July 3 to Aug. 22. The opening reception will take place from 3 to 5 p.m. July 3.</p><p>At the Oregon Coast School of Art's High Street Gallery, the exhibition will be on display from Aug, 30 to Nov. 9, with the opening reception 5 to 7 p.m. Aug. 30.</p><p>Agricultural scientists appreciate seeing creative responses to the research they're doing, according to Premore.</p><p>\"It helps them see the research differently as well.

But after about four or five, it starts to feel pretty overwhelming.\u201d</p><p>Portwood\u2019s house in Dekle Beach on the county\u2019s long undeveloped coastline was gutted by Hurricane Helene, though the structure still stands. Beyond his own home, Portwood said he\u2019s worried about the future of this county that is steadily having its tax base wiped off the map.</p><h>2 firefighters killed in South Carolina were struck by a tree</h><p>COLUMBIA, S.C. \u2014 Two firefighters killed during Hurricane Helene in South Carolina were struck by a tree, authorities said.</p><p>The tree hit their firetruck around 6:30 a.m. Friday about 4 miles (6 kilometers) west of Batesburg-Leesville, South Carolina Highway Patrol Cpl.

But he said the water release would likely flood roads and bridges that some residents use to access their homes.</p><p>\u201cIf they don\u2019t leave now, they\u2019re going to be stuck there for at least a day or multiple hours,\u201d Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp told reporters at a morning news briefing. The dam is the third in a series owned by Georgia Power along the Tallulah River, which cuts a deep gorge through part of the area.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get water out so it doesn\u2019t cause dam failure,\u201d Stallings said. He was unable to say how long the water release would last, saying that would be up to technical experts.</p><p>Georgia Power didn\u2019t immediately respond to phone calls, emails and texts seeking information.</p><h>Dozens rescued by helicopter from a flooded Tennessee hospital inundated by Helene</h><p>NASHVILLE \u2014 Dozens of people were being rescued by helicopter from a flooded Tennessee hospital inundated by Helene.</p><p>Some 54 people were moved to the roof of the Unicoi County Hospital while water rapidly flooded the facility, <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/BalladHealth/status/1839722092889334266\">according to Ballad Health</url>.</p><p>The company said on social media that county officials had ordered an evacuation of the hospital Friday morning due to rising water in the Nolichucky River, including 11 patients.</p><p>Boats ordered up by the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency were unable to safely evacuate the hospital, which was taking on flood water, the company said.</p><p>As of midday, Ballad reported that an additional seven people remained in rescue boats as the hospital was engulfed by \u201cextremely dangerous and rapidly moving water.\u201d</p><h>Tornado damages businesses in North Carolina</h><p>ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. \u2014 A tornado was confirmed Friday in northern Rocky Mount, North Carolina, along U.S. Route 301, city communications specialist Robin Cox said.</p><p>There was damage to businesses in the area, but the city did not yet confirm if there were any injuries.

In Asheville, crews were trying to get to a mudslide involving four homes and an undetermined number of people were unaccounted for, he said.</p><h>Historic building collapses in downtown Savannah</h><p>ATLANTA \u2014 A historic building partially collapsed in downtown Savannah as Helene moved through the city.</p><p>The Savannah Fire Department says the third story of the three-story brick building collapsed into the second floor after 2 a.m. Friday morning. The top two floors hold apartments, while the bottom floor is home to the Ordinary Pub on Broughton Street, one of the main commercial streets in the city\u2019s historic downtown.</p><p>No injuries were reported, but fire officials declared the building unsafe to enter.</p><h>A falling tree kills a 2nd person in South Carolina</h><p>ANDERSON, S.C. \u2014 Authorities are reporting a second death in South Carolina from Helene.</p><p>A second person was killed Friday morning by a tree falling on a home in Anderson County, the Coroner\u2019s Office said in a statement.</p><h>\u2018I was so sad, it\u2019s my first apartment\u2019</h><p>ATLANTA \u2014 Jalen Cruz woke up around 1 a.m. \u2014 \u201cthankfully at the right time,\u201d he said.</p><p>Water was just starting to trickle into the kitchen of his Atlanta apartment. What started as a \u201clittle puddle\u201d swelled to ankle-high flooding at his ankles within 30 minutes, so he gathered some of his valuables to bring to his neighbor\u2019s upstairs.</p><p>At its peak, the water rose to his calves, the 25-year-old painter said, meaning he has furniture that\u2019s damaged, unfinished art submerged underwater and paint bubbling formed on his walls.</p><p>\u201cIt could\u2019ve been a lot worse,\u201d he said. Still, \u201cI was so sad, it\u2019s my first apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhysical stuff can be replaced but just to see the state of my first home, submerged in water,\u201d he said, looking back as brown water rushed downstream. \u201cThis is my baby.\u201d</p><h>Iconic lake from \u201cDirty Dancing\u201d overtops the North Carolina dam holding it back</h><p>RUTHERFORDTON, N.C. \u2014 Waters in the iconic lake used to film scenes from the movie \u201cDirty Dancing\u201d are overtopping the dam holding them back in North Carolina.</p><p>Emergency officials in Rutherford County have started evacuating people downstream from Lake Lure and are sounding emergency sirens.</p><p>Water has been periodically released from the dam this week, but there has been too much rain to keep up, officials said.</p><p>Authorities did not indicate if the dam itself was in danger.</p><p>Lake Lure was transformed into upstate New York\u2019s Catskill Mountains for several of the scenes in the 1987 film, including the dance scene where actor Patrick Swayze lifts Jennifer Grey out of the water.</p><h>Florida airports will reopen as state inspectors work to clear roadways</h><p>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 Airports in Florida that closed due to Hurricane Helene will be reopened on Friday, and inspectors were out examining bridges and causeways along the Gulf Coast to get them back open to traffic quickly, the state\u2019s transportation secretary said.</p><p>Airports in Tampa, St. Pete, Lakeland and Tallahassee planned to reopen for flights, and 2,000 miles of roadway have been cleared of debris so far, Jared Perdue, secretary of the Florida Department of Transportation, said Friday morning at a Tallahassee news conference.</p><p>\u201cSome of the causeways were underwater, so we have to inspect them and make sure they are safe to pass,\u201d Perdue said. \u201cWe had a lot of storm surge up and down the west coast. We had a lot of roads underwater.\u201d</p><h>A late-night evacuation in Atlanta with a newborn</h><p>ATLANTA \u2014 A neighbor knocking woke Marcus Benson on Thursday night after the rain outside \u2014 and exhaustion from a newborn baby \u2014 had lulled him to sleep. The water level was inching closer to the front door of their apartment, about eight steps up from ground level and high enough that he decided it was time to evacuate.</p><p>Benson said it took focus to get himself, his wife and his three-month-old baby through a flooded parking lot to get to the other side of their Atlanta apartment complex.</p><p>\u201cYou have your son in your arms above water trying to keep him up and you just push and try to get to safety,\u201d Benson said.</p><p>Benson doesn\u2019t know the status of his family\u2019s home but is glad they are safe.</p><p>Now they just have to \u201clet Mother Nature take its course,\u201d the Atlanta native said, adding that his hometown\u2019s \u201creally changed as far as weather\u2019s concerned.\u201d</p><h>Georgia Power expects outages to rise</h><p>ATLANTA \u2014 Kim Greene, the CEO of Georgia Power Co. told reporters Friday she feared outages would continue to rise for the 2.6 million customers of Georgia\u2019s only private electrical utility.</p><p>\u201cAll of that rain is leading to very saturated ground, and trees, unfortunately, will continue to fall,\u201d Greene told reporters during a news conference in Atlanta. \u201cSo we do expect the number of outages to continue to rise. I assure you that we want to get your power back on just as safely and as quickly as possible.\u201d</p><h>A Florida congregation must rebuild again after Helene</h><p>PERRY, Fla. \u2014 The congregation at Potter\u2019s House Ministries church in Perry, Florida, was just weeks away from moving back into their newly renovated sanctuary after rebuilding in the wake of last year\u2019s Hurricane Idalia. Then Hurricane Helene peeled back the brand-new roof, scattering sheets of aluminum across the church grounds.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really heartbreaking,\u201d said parishioner Stephen Tucker, moved to tears as he surveyed the damage the morning after Helene made landfall. \u201cI know it\u2019s in God\u2019s will for this to happen. And it\u2019s by the grace of God that we\u2019re still here.\u201d</p><p>Tucker said it\u2019s been one blow after another for the community he\u2019s lived in all of his 51 years \u2014 a one, two, three punch from Idalia last August, then Debby a year later and now Helene, all making landfall within about 30 miles (48 kilometers) of each other in one county in this rural stretch of Florida\u2019s Big Bend.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like it never stops,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy Taylor County?\u201d</p><h>Multiple hospitals without power in south Georgia</h><p>ATLANTA \u2014 Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said multiple hospitals in south Georgia are without power after Helene knocked out both their primary power and their generators.</p><p>Kemp said trees had fallen densely in the eastern part of the state.</p><p>\u201cWe know we still have people trapped in homes that we\u2019re trying to cut our way into right now,\u201d Kemp told Fox News.</p><p>\u201cWe have a lot of resources that we have on the ground already,\u201d Kemp added. \u201cWe\u2019re calling up additional National Guard, and we\u2019re going to throw everything we got at it.\u201d</p><p>Kemp said wind damage is less severe in metro Atlanta.</p><p>\u201cThe storm really stayed straight or either moved to the east a little bit, which spared some of our state from being on the dirty side of the storm. So if there\u2019s any blessing in disguise, that\u2019s probably it.\u201d</p><h>\u2018We\u2019re blessed it's still standing'</h><p>VALDOSTA, Ga. \u2014 The hurricane\u2019s winds stripped away the siding from the steeple in front of Union Cathedral in Valdosta, Georgia, exposing its metal frame and littering the parking lot with shredded foam and plaster.</p><p>The storm also smashed plate glass windows by the front doors. Inside the entryway, the floor was strewn with thick glass shards, religious booklets and offering envelopes.</p><p>Pastor Wade McCrae, who preaches to 250 congregants in person most Sundays with hundreds more watching online, said the sanctuary was undamaged. Deacons were running errands to bring plywood and tools to cover the broken window. McCrae hoped to be able to hold services this Sunday.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re blessed it\u2019s still standing,\u201d he said.</p><h>20 people in Atlanta rescued overnight by firefighters</h><p>ATLANTA \u2014 Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens tells reporters that firefighters rescued about 20 people overnight from cars or apartments imperiled by swiftly rising floodwaters.</p><h>Residents in Florida\u2019s Big Bend region wake up to widespread power outages</h><p>PERRY, Fla. \u2014 Residents of Florida\u2019s Big Bend region woke up to widespread power outages Friday morning after Hurricane Helene made landfall overnight near the mouth of the Aucilla River.</p><p>Helene slammed ashore in the largely rural stretch of Florida as a Category 4 hurricane, becoming the third hurricane to batter that swath of the state in a little over a year.</p><p>As the sun rose over U.S. Highway 27 outside of Perry, cars dodged and weaved among downed pine trees that blocked portions of the road, some ensnarled in power lines. Emergency workers were already on hand clearing debris before 8 am. The air smelled of pine needles and fresh wood \u2014 from the staggering trees shattered by the storm, some snapped in half like toothpicks.</p><h>Here\u2019s the latest on Hurricane Helene</h><p>Authorities rescued people trapped by floodwaters and more than 3 million customers were in the dark across much of the southeastern U.S. as <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/live/hurricane-helene-tracker-maps-updates?tab=00000192-29da-d351-a19f-fbfa4f260000\">Hurricane Helene</url> weakened to a tropical storm over Georgia early Friday after making landfall overnight in northwestern Florida as a Category 4 storm.</p><p>Helene came ashore amid warnings from the National Hurricane Center that <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/live/hurricane-helene-tracker-maps-updates\">the enormous system</url> could create <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/storm-surge-hurricane-helene-danger-18d2c9bbcda58855f09cef32b5a53e18\">a \u201cnightmare\u201d storm surge</url>.

(the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cPatriot\u201d) (TSX-V: PMET) (ASX: PMT) (OTCQX: PMETF) (FSE: R9GA) provides this update on its work programs and the impact of the current forest fire situation in Quebec the Company\u2019s operations. The Company commenced the 2023 summer-fall drill and surface exploration programs in late May at its wholly owned Corvette Property (the \u201cProperty\u201d or \u201cProject\u201d), located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of Quebec.</p><p>The 2023 summer-fall exploration includes both a drill and surface exploration program which commenced at the Property in late May. The multi-rig drill program is targeting further delineation of the CV5 and CV13 pegmatites, as well as drill testing of other previously identified spodumene pegmatite clusters (i.e., CV4, CV8-12, CV9, and CV10). The surface program comprises mapping of the known spodumene pegmatite clusters and local trends as well as prospecting and rock sampling across a large portion of the remaining 20+ km of prospective lithium pegmatite trend.</p><p>The recent restrictions imposed by the Quebec government, as a result of the regional forest fire situation, is directly impacting our exploration operations and, therefore, the Company has temporarily ceased drilling and surface exploration field activities until the situation improves. The Company continues to process drill core from holes completed at the Property in May 2023 as well as advance the exploration camp construction activities. The Company is actively monitoring the situation to ensure all Company activities are compliant with respective governmental decrees and to ensure the safety of personnel associated with the Property. The Company will provide further updates as information becomes available.</p><p>About Patriot Battery Metals Inc.</p><p>Patriot Battery Metals Inc. is a hard-rock lithium exploration company focused on advancing its district-scale 100% owned Corvette Property located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of Quebec, Canada. The Corvette Property is one of the largest and highest-grade hard rock lithium projects being explored, with over 50 kilometres of strike length over a 214 square kilometre land package and over 70 lithium bearing pegmatite outcrops identified to date.</p><p>The Corvette Property is situated proximal to the all-weather Trans Taiga Road and Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec power line infrastructure in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of Quebec.\u00a0The Property hosts significant lithium potential highlighted by the CV5 Pegmatite, which has been traced by drilling over a strike length of at least 3.7 km with spodumene pegmatite encountered as deep as 425 m vertical depth.</p><p>For further information, please contact us at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:info@patriotbatterymetals.com\">info@patriotbatterymetals.com</email>  or by calling +1 (604) 279-8709,or visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.patriotbatterymetals.com\">www.patriotbatterymetals.com</url>.

Chris Smith (R-Manchester) announced today that two Ocean County-based airports will receive federal funding to make airport improvements and improve safety thanks to legislation which Congressman Smith supported. Ocean County Airport in Lacey and Berkeley Townships will receive a grant in the amount of $294,000, and Lakewood Township will receive $144,000 for its municipal airport off Cedar Bridge Avenue.</p><p>The funding comes through the Airport Infrastructure Grant (AIG) program from Public Law No: 117-58 that Smith supported and voted for in 2021. In addition to the AIG program, the law provides funding for projects to repair and rebuild roads, bridges, rail lines, tunnels, lead-contaminated water pipes and more while boosting commerce, jobs and economic growth.</p><p>Smith had previously announced $30.2 million in funding for beach replenishment in Ocean County which came from the same legislation.</p><p>\"The FAA grant will support important upgrades to hangar space at Ocean County's airport,\" said Smith. \"Similarly, Lakewood Township plans to use its FAA grant to help enhance airport safety by removing obstructions and trimming trees.\"</p><p>Director of the Ocean County Board of Commissioners Joseph H. Vicari, who is the commissioner's liaison to the county's airport, welcomed news of the federal grant, which will provide enclosed and secure space for six small planes at Miller Airpark.</p><p>\"Ocean County appreciates the ongoing efforts of Congressman Smith to secure important funds for the Ocean County Airport,\" said Vicari. \"These funds will help in our efforts to maintain a safe and secure facility by making infrastructure improvements. The airport serves not only small private planes but is an essential part of our emergency response and is key to public safety.\"</p><p>Steve Reinman, Director of Economic and Industrial Development for Lakewood Township, said \"We are making numerous efforts to remove obstructions along the south end of the runway that will enhance safety and lead to more business activity in the airport.

Baird - Analyst</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Presentation</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">COLLEEN KUSY, ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD: Everyone, thanks for being with us for [day two] of the Baird Global Healthcare Conference. My name is Colleen Kusy. I'm one of the analysts here covering biotech at Baird. My pleasure to have with me the management team from Apellis Pharmaceuticals, including Co-Founder, CEO, Cedric Francois; and CFO, Tim Sullivan. Cedric, Tim, thanks for being with us this morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CEDRIC FRANCOIS, PRESIDENT, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, CO-FOUNDER, DIRECTOR, APELLIS PHARMACEUTICALS INC: Thank you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">COLLEEN KUSY: So for those who are less familiar, maybe just start with a brief company overview and then we can hop in the Q&amp;A.</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: So I believe this is a company that went public in 2017, so it's an old biotech companies. We have had the great fortune of getting two products approved late in 2021 and then last year in February of 2023. And the first drug is a drug called Empaveli, which first got approved for an indication called paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria or PNH insurers, where it was designed in the clinical trials to show superiority over the standard of care team called Soliris or Ultomiris.</p><p>And the concept there was that within the complement pathway, which is in our garden where we play a biologically that by going centrally in the cascade and having a broad effect of control over complement that we could improve on the benefits that Soliris and Ultomiris are providing to patients with PNH. And to put everything into context, anemia is a big problem.</p><p>Arguably one of the key problems in that disease and our patients with baseline hemoglobin level of approximately eight, we showed an improvement of close to four grams per deciliter is in that in our Phase 3 clinical trial. So in PNH has completely kind of changed the way that disease is perceived better understanding and of course, a new standard of care.</p><p>And then in February of last year, we got approved, which therefore read for geographic atrophy, geographic atrophy is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly in the Western world. And it is a disease where like a forest fire people start losing retina. Typically, you know around the age of 75. I mean it's really a disease of aging, of course, and we're in an irreversible process.</p><p>Ultimately, you end up being lines and it is a degenerative process neurodegenerative process for which no therapies were available and therefore, he was the first therapy to be approved for that indication so far is now approximately a year and a half on the market. I said one of the best launches in recent memory and again, has completely changed how that disease is now finally being handled in the retina community and then notably, just a month ago, we had another Phase 3 clinical readout for Empaveli.</p><p>Again, our drug in PNH, where we evaluated it in two indications called C3 glomerulopathy and immune complex membrane or proliferative glomerulonephritis S-antigen. And in these two indications, we had a readout has frankly, exceeded even our wildest expectations in the sense that and we had a readout that was arguably so good that patients most patients probably who go on this therapy in a timely fashion do not have to face transplantation or hemodialysis anymore.</p><p>And without a doubt, the best in class data ever shown in these disease indications. And we look forward to now hopefully next year making a highly available to these patients as well. So two drugs, both we believe on a path to blockbuster status and the pipeline that we haven't spoken a lot about in the middle of the whole commercial deployment in the last two years that we're very excited about too, and that we'll be talking more about in the second half of this year and early in 2025.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>COLLEEN KUSY: Fantastic. So yeah, let's dive into geographic atrophy. So yes, as you said, a year and a half into launch the first drug approved there, how is the market of GA and similar different to what you expected now that year and a half --</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: So first of all, it is a very unique place to be both in terms of the physicians that take care of patients with retinal diseases of the retina specialists as well as in the model of reimbursement that is used here in the United States, which is a buy and build model. So essentially, the retina doctors buy the products from us and then get reimbursed themselves from the payers, right.</p><p>So that whole system is a system that the retina community is used to, thanks to the anti-VEGF therapies that are on the market. So the reason why this launch went so well is that the retina community was ready to use this product, knew how to use it. How to get reimbursed, how to administer it and in a disease where I think quite frankly, most people including us, again, probably underestimated how meaningful it is.</p><p>An important is for patients that have this disease to be able to slow down the progression. And so very rewarding and wish several steps in front of us still, of course, I mean European process for approval, which has had its hiccups and a couple of other things. And then we look forward to next year to really I'm making this available to patients globally.</p><p>COLLEEN KUSY: Great. And so you put out some additional functional data in the last number of months, including some that some presentations at ASRS, kind of what is what are the data shown in And has that impacted physicians' perception of safe ovary and there further use?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Yes, this was this was really exciting for us, right? So what we have very clearly shown is that we can save retinal tissue to put that in perspective in patients with kind of the more important lesions were to sit outside of the center of the vision in those patients, you can slow down the disease process by as much as 42% in the third year of dosing. So very meaningful reductions in lesion size growth and we also have shown using an instrument called microperimetry that the retina that is saved can see legs.</p><p>So perceives life two kind of key components of a safety issue in this tissue is actually tissue that works. What is much harder to do is to then actually measure the functional impact at least over a period of one or two years where you say, okay, how does this impact reading, for example, how does this impact measurements that they have so much variability and so many interdependencies that it's hard to get any type of statistical signal out of these measures.</p><p>So that is something that was difficult for us because in on this, there's a kind of went back to that fact saying like, [Oh I am] sure you shift issue, but it doesn't do anything for patients, which is, of course, not true. And then in the third year of dosing, because we have an extension called the GILL extension study with that for the first time on these microperimetry measures on pre-specified endpoints, start seeing statistical differentiation from sham. So really exciting all kind of pointing in the same direction of what we had hoped would happen.</p><p>COLLEEN KUSY: And have you seen the physician perception change with this new data? Do you think there's still education that needs to happen in terms of the functional asset.</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: There's definitely still education to be done, right? I mean, this is still in the very early launch, I mean, really year-and-a-half into it and you know, I'd say a third of physicians have you not really embracing this as a new modality. The other two thirds, you know, are maybe less enthusiastic maybe on the sidelines still in many cases, kind of seeing what's going to happen, the evolution of this. So there's a lot of patients and a lot of physicians still need to be educated. We need to understand what the impact of these drugs are, and we look forward to doing that.</p><p>COLLEEN KUSY: Great. And on the safety science, and there is the eventual vasculitis that came out last summer, and we continue to see some rate of that today. How is does your understanding of the events have that changed and kind of where where do you think the perception of the safety profile is today?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Yeah, the great fortune we had was that these rare safety events did not stop physicians from prescribing our drug, right. So that, again is a reflection of the need that these patients have and the desire to be treated. But what that did is it allowed us to build such a huge denominator that we have a very clear understanding now of what the safety inventory in each brand and the bottom line is that it is limited to the increased risk is only there, we believe in the first injection.</p><p>It is at a rate of about one in 4,000, which is similar to the risk of getting infectious endophthalmitis. And you have to remember, I mean doing an injection in the eye is not something that you can do hundreds of thousands of times without ever running into issues. That risk of an intravitreal injection and getting an infection is approximately one in 4,000 every single time.</p><p>So the added risk here is only on that first injection. And about half of these patients have partial or even full recoveries as well. So you know understanding and having the knowledge now to communicate that to the retina community is something very valuable to us, allows us to start focusing on efficacy.</p><p>COLLEEN KUSY: And have you seen physicians change how they use a [foree] in light of the vasculitis? And How have the kind of use patterns changed?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Yeah. I think the again, as always is the case. I mean, people get their bearings start in a certain place. And then from there as they become comfortable start branching out, I think typically the patients that you know in the past year and a half have mostly been enrolls in treatment with. Therefore, we are patients that have advanced disease may have lost one.</p><p>I already another eye that is at risk now in the future, right. I mean, the goal is to go earlier and earlier, I mean, I can tell you is I have geographic atrophy in my first day, I want to get treated the second, it shows up because what we see with the stroke, which is so exciting, is that the longer you treat the more you slow down that Forest fair. So you really want to go as early as possible and not use this as a last resort.</p><p>COLLEEN KUSY: And on that topic, how do you think about the segments of the GA market? Who are the most likely that are on treatment now and how big are those separate segments?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: And so we think that approximately 15% of patients with GA that are actually being seen by retina docs have or are receiving treatment with either our drug or the competing drug. That is and I mentioned only the ones that are being seen by retina doctors because we believe that as many as another equal number of patients are not being seen by retina doctors.</p><p>So if you take that into account, it's probably closer to 7% to 8%. So really only scratching the surface. And again, a lot of room for growth and something where on one hand, we work with the retina community to educate them. On the other hand, we are also working with the general ophthalmologists and awareness outside of the retina practice.</p><p>COLLEEN KUSY: And have you seen those referrals from outside practices start coming in [yet]?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Yes. So that is absolutely happening again early days, but exciting trends there.</p><p>COLLEEN KUSY: And so on the more recent side of the launch, you've had a competitor come into the market now with the permanent J-code, can you just kind of qualify for us the type of headwinds you're seeing in terms of new patient starts with the new competitor?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Yeah. So as there is a drug that targets the complement pathway downstream from [safe or reach]. And so therefore, we controls within the complement cascade, both C3 as well, as his acquisition has survey on the C5 acquisition. We believe that that is reflected in a differentiated efficacy profile, which is really important. And so there is a is a drug that has a couple of advantages.</p><p>You know that physicians may have there as a perception of this. It shows it's more that it's less viscous because it's less concentrated things that make it easier for physicians. But the key thing here is that our drug is differentiated on efficacy.</p><p>So when the J-code came out to your point, there was a bit of a loss on the first injections. But what we see now is the messaging and that now that the balance has been struck between the two enrollment is shifting back towards (inaudible).</p><p>COLLEEN KUSY: What's been kind of driving that shift from that over the course of the change of the recent months as that settled in?</p><p>TIMOTHY SULLIVAN, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, TREASURER, APELLIS PHARMACEUTICALS INC: So I'll just say there's really been three factors that have been kind of headwinds for us that the first one would be the J-code, right, which has happened with us as well. We saw a jump in new starts with the J-code. And the second one is contracting, right. So they know there was some aggressive contracting that was going on. It started in the second quarter.</p><p>And then also I guess the last thing would be the general message around safety. So those three things really contributed to kind of what we what we felt those headwinds in the second quarter and those things don't disappear in the third quarter, right. Those are things we're still working through, but we are seeing positive signs.</p><p>And so what we've done to address that and what we're doing overall is to look at the entire market, growing the whole market also focusing, as Cedric said, on our safety, which we have as much as 42% slowing in the nonsense earlier population, which is it doubles what the hope was before we got it. Got our data. So we have an exceptionally strong message.</p><p>We also have our DTC campaign that we are at the stage I guess two or three of that is coming and then also focusing on the ophthalmologists and that pull through to the retina specialists. So we have a lot of a number of different plans in place to help grow the market.</p><p>COLLEEN KUSY: Makes sense. In terms of the patients that you have on treatment, can you talk about the compliance that you've seen so far? And has there been any kind of pickup in the time that patients are hitting the one year mark?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: No. I mean, compliance has been very good similar to anti-VEGFs, which is pretty remarkable regimen with anti-VEGFs. You get the benefit of seeing the immediate impacts, whereas with complement inhibitors, of course, it's kind of a long game, right, where you don't immediately see the impact, but in the long run, you benefit from selling retinal tissue?</p><p>COLLEEN KUSY: And then over the remainder of the year, how should we think about seasonality and other factors that will impact the launch launch trajectory.</p><p>TIMOTHY SULLIVAN: There really isn't anything we can grab onto from the anti-VEGF market that shows a seasonality in sort of this portion of the year. And again, this is our first year in sort of a I don't know if it's a normalized year, but it's our first kind of semi normal year so and we can't really point to any seasonality per [se]. I mean, you, of course, see things like big stretches of August where people are doing the back-to-school thing and whatever and doctors may not be. We obviously we have a few conferences or under one sight. So there's that, but nothing to really point to as sort of material.</p><p>COLLEEN KUSY: Would you thought you'd be in a position to provide revenue guidance in '25?</p><p>TIMOTHY SULLIVAN: I've never been asked that before I ask. I mean, look, we're definitely not going to be providing revenue guidance this year, and we're going to reconsider that for next year, but no promises yet.</p><p>COLLEEN KUSY: Understood. And then on the European side of things, yes, as you mentioned, some hiccups in that review. Now we're nearing the final review coming this month. Maybe talk about what, what kind of drove the slight shift in time line things originally 4Q now we'll get that decision in September?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Yeah. So the process has been interesting, as you know, and we went through an initial review and where I'd say the rapporteurs, a negative opinion was driven by the fact that there was no statistical evidence for that functional impact. And we then went through the appeals process that appeals process got interrupted. The clock was reset. We've invested previous reporters who can give you a negative opinion.</p><p>But we had a very good course circles, a heck meeting, which is an AdCom equivalent in Europe and where you know, we basically have unanimous support. And we also had then the prespecified end point that you mentioned earlier on function that came into the equation. So we'll see what's going to happen but reversing a decision at the EMEA is a very, very difficult thing to do. So we executed as well as we could, and we'll see what happens.</p><p>COLLEEN KUSY: Understand, is there anything we're able to [glean] from rapitories this time around that could inform the outcome?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: No, we'll have to wait.</p><p>COLLEEN KUSY: Understood. And assuming you guys do get approved and yes, I understood uphill battle, but talk about launch readiness in Europe.</p><p>TIMOTHY SULLIVAN: And we've been preparing for a long time since we've had that we actually we hired some people because we actually thought we were going to launch and the Valley in Europe. And so we actually kept some infrastructure then. And over the course of the last really three years, we've built out what is launch ready and structure and field force to some extent or based on where we would go first in Germany, for example, and then you move to from country to country.</p><p>So we've built that out in preparation for a launch, and we're kind of been at the starting line for a while now. But we have the infrastructure there. We don't need anything. It's really just a matter of waiting to see what happens.</p><p>COLLEEN KUSY: And if this were to be, you know, in this decision in Europe, is that kind of the final now, should we how should we think about the finality of this?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Yes, as the final note at the European level.</p><p>COLLEEN KUSY: And now moving into Valley to systemic pegcetacoplan, which I know, historically, you've been spending lots of time on GAAP. Now we have another indication and talk about. So you had the Phase 3 value data and C3G, ICMPGN that you referenced before, and I put that into context versus the other drug that's out there.</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: The competition situation just efficient. Yes, no, so let's put it in context of proteinuria, which is the surrogate primary endpoint. That's everybody relies on that because it's funded. It has a more immediate impact compared to EGFR that standard applied to CTG was evaluated by the competing drug, which is an upstream complement inhibitor that is administered administered orally for Delta and shows approximately a 30% improvement in proteinuria after six months.</p><p>In our six month evaluation, we saw a 68% improvement in proteinuria, which was associated with improvement on the EGFR as well. Nominally statistically significant at six months already, which was unexpected. And most importantly, combined with the C3C deposition, which is the histopathological hallmark of this disease melting away like snow for this and after approximately one month already.</p><p>So between all of these findings, I mean, it was I mean, every nephrologist that we have shown this towards that it's almost specific parts of the accumulated fees but it is really a and again, I think something that we've done well, in the past, we decided to take a broad patient population. So C3G, ICNPGN, pre-transplant, post-transplant adolescents, adults in all categories, we showed the same benefits. So very excited about, hopefully filing very soon and making this drug available. And towards the end of next year.</p><p>COLLEEN KUSY: Great. And yeah, I think the feedback I've received two as an EGFR, a little surprised that you would even see something so quickly at the six-month mark, and can you kind of talk about the response you're seeing there and how confident you are that separation will continue?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Yeah. So to understand where EGFR is complicated, is that the background is the slow decline in EGFR that you have in the normal disease state. And so what you need to do is stabilize the EGFR and then wait for that stabilization to differentiate itself itself from the slowing decline.</p><p>So typically, you know, that's something that can take two, three years to with most drugs to start manifesting itself, which would create very long trials, which is by proteinuria, came into play. So in this case, to have already an inkling of something happening at six months is very encouraging.</p><p>COLLEEN KUSY: Okay. As you mentioned the proteinuria as the approval end point kind of how confident are you that the FDA will accept the six month data? And how do you think the EGFR data will plan to their review?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Yeah. So the [Sunbelt] US specifically was asked to submit the 12 month data when they had their pre-NDA meeting. And so we don't know what the FDA will ask of us, all I can say is that we did have an end of Phase 2 meeting in which we agreed on the endpoint, and we have done and exceeded everything and everything, anything that was asked of us. So hopefully it will be sufficient to be allowed to file with the six month data.</p><p>TIMOTHY SULLIVAN: The other thing is that the EGFR data that goes away after six months because the placebo patients. So there is no more data, they can get really other than anecdotal.</p><p>COLLEEN KUSY: And as you mentioned, you enrolled a pretty diverse set of patients in the study. Do you feel as though you have enough data to support approval in both C3G in ICMPG on the study?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Well again, I think considering the strength of the data and going to the uniformity of the benefits, our hope, of course, that those indications will find themselves in the label.</p><p>COLLEEN KUSY: And as you mentioned several that is an oral versus a subcu injection for and the value. How would you expect employee to compete against an oral in this indication.</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Yeah. I think from the way, a lot of people were skeptical as we go towards the readout because the benefit of convenience was closer to the disproportionate, but something that I believe in indications like this are less important than the benefit that you get from the direct credit. I know you could say when you're early on newly diagnosed, you may be tempted by the convenience.</p><p>But when you start fasing the risk or the threat of hemodialysis, let alone, when you are transplanted, that is a very different set of circumstances. And so I think what we have seen not just in C3G and ICMPG [Belson] PNH is that the benefits of having an oral product 20 have a very serious disease. It is limited to a certain extent by the differentiation efficacy and when do you plan to present the value of data?</p><p>So we submitted a late-breaking abstract to Ipsen, which hopefully will be accepted and then we would present at the end of next month.</p><p>COLLEEN KUSY: And what's the guidance on the next interactions with the FDA and the filing timing?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: So we haven't guided. We will file early next year. And depending on what type of review process we get, if all goes according to plan, we may have an approval in the second half of next year.</p><p>COLLEEN KUSY: And so based on these data, then how does this change your view of other indications that the value might be a reason?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Well, the really exciting aspect of what we saw as C3G and ICMPG was the depth of the effect, and that is a combination of two elements. Number one, the power of [fixing Dakota] So I cannot I mean, there is not I challenge anyone to show me data on a better complement inhibitor on this planet. Olympics is equal to and we've now shown this differentiated against other complement inhibitors in three indications with not with small differences, but big differences.</p><p>The reason why that's interesting is that why pegcetacoplan is so good is still a little bit of the mystery even to us, right, but probably it's because the complement cascade is antiemetic in nature and we attack that complement cascade, not at one point, but at four distinct points by going after the [Congress's] activity. And so what you do is really buffer the effects of this enzymatic Cascade service kind of like you know, when when there's overactivation for whatever reason that may be larger than that one point trying to stop the flood from overwhelming. You have four different points. You can slow it down and stop it in the end.</p><p>And that's something that is reflected in the data that we have, of course. So that's point number one point number two is that clearly there is a concentration or at least to an engagement with a target and a bio-availability, integral Amir of this that is quite pronounced and that is something that we can now explore in other renal indications, again, with a special place of love for the post transplant segment income and said</p><p>COLLEEN KUSY: And on the earlier stage pipeline, you'll have some Phase 1 data later this year for APEL3000 and seven's your SI RNA silencing asset targeting C3. What can we expect from that Phase 1 readout? And what should what should investors be looking?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Yeah, so it's a safety study. Of course, it's the initial dose escalation. We haven't disclosed yet what we're actually going to do with the assay here in May, which we're very excited about. And again, in due time, we'll be talking about that. But the key thing is make sure that the drug safe evaluate how much C3 reduction we get in the system and then based on the data that we have, the evaluation as to whether this makes sense in a monotherapy setting or in combination with [MVAD] to create next-generation product.</p><p>COLLEEN KUSY: And then the in partnership with something you announced a couple of years ago. Any updates that we can be expecting in the future?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Yeah. That has been a very exciting collaboration for us. We've generated quite a large mass of the head have a now that we haven't spoken about yet, but that too in the next year and we'll start sharing a lot more on.</p><p>COLLEEN KUSY: And is there a certain indication that you think that would be most applicable? And are you keeping things broad at this point?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Right now, we're not discussing any details, but so much more to come.</p><p>COLLEEN KUSY: Understood. And then on the balance sheet, so you've made some strides this year to clean things up. Kind of talk about the current size of the balance sheet and higher selling your cash position?</p><p>TIMOTHY SULLIVAN: Yeah. Sometimes you know, when do you actually have to grow up as a company? And this I think at the moment, we kind of grew up a little bit because this is what took out our major cash flow items from a capital structure point of view that went beyond operations. We had big amortization payments for SFJ pharmaceuticals debt, which was created at the time when we put it in place, but it needed to be changed out.</p><p>And we did deal with [Sixth Street] to street and $375 million debt deal. And as you look at our operating expenses, sort of non taking out the non-cash operating expenses, when you look at the total, it's more or less like our revenue. And so the expenditures that we have now beyond that, our interest expense and then working capital, which is the payables, right. We sort of finance it the channel a little bit, right? And that's just the nature of the beast.</p><p>And so from the perspective of trying to make ourselves independent of the company, which you know, not every company really wants to do what we're doing. And we decided to go with [Six3], which is an exceptional group. And then we have an interest-only loan from them this $375 million that the term is until 2030. So that was a great deal for us. And that's the moment we are able to say we think we can build this company, independent of the capital markets.</p><p>COLLEEN KUSY: And so another kind of region advanced since Adam Townsend role had been expanded from Chief Commercial Officer to include Chief Operating Officer as well kind of what drove that slight change with the management team.</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Adam has done a fantastic job. Again. I think it was part of kind of taking on a larger role within the organization. Of course, operational in nature, we have all of the proper barriers between met affairs and the commercial deployments. And in the US David I just miss doing a fantastic job on taking on the commercial role?</p><p>COLLEEN KUSY: And then so just in the last minute here, and we've covered a lot today, but if you can kind of summarize for us why investors should be paying attention to pass over the next 6 to 12 months?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Well, we are a company that is on the best profitability with two potential blockbusters in the making that are going through great launches and a new indication from February coming around the corner and a pipeline that sets us up to them to enter into real new era us.</p><p>COLLEEN KUSY: Thank you for that summary. Thanks for being with us today.</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Thank you so much.</p><p>COLLEEN KUSY: Thank you.</p><p>[Refinitiv, an LSEG business, reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

The tool uses satellites to calculate how much water is lost to the air after being applied to farmland.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cThere are still gaps in the information and understanding between how much water we need and how much we are actually using,\u201d said Dr. AJ Purdy, a senior research scientist at CSUMB working on the project. \u201cThis project fills a big gap.\u201d</p><p>OpenET uses satellites from NASA, USGS, and others to measure evapotranspiration, or the amount of water that evaporates from soil combined with the water that transpires through plants \u2014 traveling from the roots and evaporating off the leaves. The satellites measure reflectance \u2014 energy from the sun that bounces off the Earth, which hits the satellites in different wavelengths that correspond to color. OpenET measures plant coverage, so it looks for green. It also takes the temperature of the land.</p><p>Using vegetation cover, the OpenET models can figure out how much evapotranspiration could potentially occur in a given area. The second set of models measures how much of the sun\u2019s energy goes to heating the ground, the air, or converting water from its liquid to its vapor form: evapotranspiration.</p><p>Using the OpenET Data Explore tool, a Salinas Valley farmer can scroll around a digital map, click on a particular field, and see that location\u2019s evapotranspiration data for the past few months or years. The tool shows farmers where water soaks into their crops, and where it evaporates away and is effectively wasted.</p><p>OpenET is named in reference to Open Science, the principle of making research products and processes widely available and easily accessible. With OpenET, the individual farmer can access the same information used by the state engineer. \u201cIt provides that consistent and reliable source that people can use to better understand how they fit in the water system that they are in, and allows them to make more informed choices moving forward,\u201d said Purdy.</p><p>However, there are still accessibility issues. If a farmer knows how much water they apply to the land, evapotranspiration information can help them irrigate to meet crop demands and minimize overwatering, effectively reducing water and energy use in agriculture. \u201cThat said, many farmers do not know their application rates or how to use ET numbers to estimate crop water needs,\u201d Aysha Peterson, an agroecologist at the Resource Conservation District of Monterey County, said in an email.</p><p>Peterson\u2019s team in the Resource Conservation District works with small-scale farmers and urban gardeners. She says that ET systems are not particularly accessible to many low-income communities of color because they require both knowledge of unit conversion and web-based tools, which are not often part of the farming culture practiced by the growers they work with. The District\u2019s irrigation scheduling workshops for local farmers more often discuss the use of \u201csoil moisture by feel\u201d and tensiometers, a tool installed in the ground that measures soil moisture without electricity. \u201cWe typically share about the ET method with most farmers and gardeners, just so that they know what is out there, but most people we work with opt for the first and/or second methods because they are more accessible,\u201d said Peterson.</p><p>While agriculture researchers and scientists work together to make this type of technology more accessible, it is also imperative that the data is accurate. To validate the satellite-based measurements, Purdy and his team use ground-based tools. When wind travels over the Earth\u2019s surface, air falls into eddies and tumbles across the land. Purdy\u2019s team measures wind speeds in three different directions with an eddy covariance tower, including vertically \u2014 away from the earth\u2019s surface. By measuring vertical wind speed and the amount of moisture in the air, they calculate how much water is leaving the earth\u2019s surface, and compare it to the satellite measurements. Alternatively, they can use a scale buried in the ground called a lysimeter, which uses weight to measure how much water evaporates from the soil above it.</p><p>With this grant, Purdy and his team hope that they can build out OpenET, including the addition of a forecast tool. \u201cIf you go to the Open ET website, you can get data from two or three days ago. But with this grant, we're working on building the capacity to actually provide a forecast for a week into the future,\u201d said Purdy. These forecasts could be built into irrigation scheduling tools already used by some farmers.</p><p>Agriculture guzzles the most water, but Open ET can also be used for forest fire mitigation. For example, researchers can study how quickly a forest recovers after a fire from a water-cycling standpoint, or measure how much water is in the plants, which helps predict how fast and hot forest fires will burn.</p><p>\u201cThese insights will not only improve the data and quality here, but pay dividends down the road as the project continues to grow,\u201d said Purdy.</p><p>To learn more about how OpenET works, listen to this podcast\u00a0 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://shorturl.at/gsF13\">https://shorturl.at/gsF13</url>) featuring Purdy.</p><p>\u00a92024 MediaNews Group, Inc.

A residential or commercial building with this level of risk would be considered uninsurable.71% (11,512) of high risk hospitals by 2100 will be in low and middle income countries.Limiting global warming to 1.8 degrees\u00a0celsius with a rapid phase out of fossil fuels would halve the damage risk to hospital infrastructure compared to a high emissions scenario.South East Asia has the highest percentage of hospitals at high risk of damage from extreme weather events in the world. With high emissions, almost 1 in 5 hospitals (18.4%) in South East Asia will be at high risk of total or partial shutdown by the end of the century.South Asia has the highest number of hospitals at risk.Hospitals located on coastlines and near rivers are most at risk.\u00a0</emphasis>\"Governments have a duty to populations to ensure the ongoing delivery of critical services. We urge all governments and health administrators to review this report and identify high risk hospitals in their jurisdiction so that they can take appropriate action,\" said Dr Mallon.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">About XDI</emphasis>The data behindXDI (Cross Dependency Initiative)has been helping global leaders price physical climate risk since 2007, making the group the world's longest standing independent specialist in physical climate risk and adaptation analytics.

But far from being an accident, that fire was \"prescribed\" like a healing medicine for the forest and carried out by a trained fire crew. In many types of forests, fire has been a common event for millennia. </p><p>And in Illinois, our prairies and oak forests have been burning at intervals since glaciers left the state. As a consequence, the plants and animals in our prairies and forests are not only adapted to fire, but actually dependent on fire to maintain their populations. When fire is removed from these fire-dependent landscapes, like it has been in southern Illinois for almost 100 years, these habitats begin to degrade. And that's been happening to oak-dominated forests in southern Illinois, like the forest at Giant City State Park. In the absence of fire, young oak trees are not regenerating, and many other forest plants are disappearing as several invasive plant species and shade-tolerant native tree species are taking over the understory of the forest. This can be an invisible problem to untrained eyes, but not to the animals that depend on a healthy oak forest to \"make a living.\" By reintroducing fire to our forests, in a controlled way, the decline of our oak ecosystems can be reversed, and Illinois Department of Natural Resources staff have recently started doing that at Giant City. Needless to say, starting and controlling a 200-acre forest fire is a complex job that involves a lot of planning, just the right kind of weather, and lots of hands-on-deck on the day of the burn. I was able to participate in the recent Giant City burn, most usefully as a photographer, and the unanimous conclusion of the fire crew was that the burn had been very successful. A successful prescribed fire stays controlled, of course, but is also burns in a way that preps the forest understory for the regrowth of native, fire-adapted species. And the ecological response to a prescribed fire in an oak forest can be amazing. The Stonefort area was first burned in 2016. Right after that burn, park staff recorded an increase in the population of buffalo clover, an Illinois threatened species. Research has shown that other native flowering plants benefit from prescribed fire, too! Of course, where there are flowers, there will be butterflies. And where there are butterflies, and especially caterpillars, there will be more birds. And so on, up the food chain. While the immediate aftermath of a forest fire can look pretty devastating, it's important to understand that far from being a bad thing, fires in oak forests are literally necessary to maintain a healthy forest. And when you drive back through the park in the spring, or hike the Stonefort trail, keep your eyes open for that buffalo clover, and those butterflies and those birds. * Mike Baltz has a PhD in biology from the University of Missouri and writes about changing the world from his home in Carbondale.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Mike Baltz photo Participants in the recent controlled burn strike a pose.

But far from being an accident, that fire was \"prescribed\" like a healing medicine for the forest and carried out by a trained fire crew. In many types of forests, fire has been a common event for millennia. </p><p>And in Illinois, our prairies and oak forests have been burning at intervals since glaciers left the state. As a consequence, the plants and animals in our prairies and forests are not only adapted to fire, but actually dependent on fire to maintain their populations. When fire is removed from these fire-dependent landscapes, like it has been in southern Illinois for almost 100 years, these habitats begin to degrade. And that's been happening to oak-dominated forests in southern Illinois, like the forest at Giant City State Park. In the absence of fire, young oak trees are not regenerating, and many other forest plants are disappearing as several invasive plant species and shade-tolerant native tree species are taking over the understory of the forest. This can be an invisible problem to untrained eyes, but not to the animals that depend on a healthy oak forest to \"make a living.\" By reintroducing fire to our forests, in a controlled way, the decline of our oak ecosystems can be reversed, and Illinois Department of Natural Resources staff have recently started doing that at Giant City. Needless to say, starting and controlling a 200-acre forest fire is a complex job that involves a lot of planning, just the right kind of weather, and lots of hands-on-deck on the day of the burn. I was able to participate in the recent Giant City burn, most usefully as a photographer, and the unanimous conclusion of the fire crew was that the burn had been very successful. A successful prescribed fire stays controlled, of course, but is also burns in a way that preps the forest understory for the regrowth of native, fire-adapted species. And the ecological response to a prescribed fire in an oak forest can be amazing. The Stonefort area was first burned in 2016. Right after that burn, park staff recorded an increase in the population of buffalo clover, an Illinois threatened species. Research has shown that other native flowering plants benefit from prescribed fire, too! Of course, where there are flowers, there will be butterflies and other pollinators. And where there are butterflies, and especially caterpillars, there will be more birds. And so on, up the food chain. While the immediate aftermath of a forest fire can look pretty devastating, it's important to understand that far from being a bad thing, fires in oak forests are literally necessary to maintain a healthy forest. And when you drive back through the park in the spring, or hike the Stonefort trail, keep your eyes open for that buffalo clover, and those butterflies and those birds. * Mike Baltz has a PhD in biology from the University of Missouri and writes about changing the world from his home in Carbondale.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Mike Baltz photo</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHDLY-0001223044</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61BD-CYC1-JBRC-V2NR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163823</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-11-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"511\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Paddock Publications, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Daily Herald</publicationName><edition>Daily Republican (Marion) Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"11\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>November 20, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>State Parks</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzAxRThENzk5NTQwNDY1MTkxMTgxQTAyRjgwOTE5OEE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N712190QM</classCode><className>STATE PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

He describes huckleberries, thimbleberries, gooseberries and tobacco that used to grow in the area, and which he hopes will return. Then, he explains how he wants to set fire to the forest. <br/>'Fire was major to keeping all of that stuff healthy,' he said.  <br/> Jesse Jackson, education programs manager for the Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians, explains how the tribe used fire and broadcast burns to maintain forest health. (Alex Baumhardt/Oregon Capital Chronicle) <br/>He and the tribe's foresters want to convince the federal agencies that still own thousands of acres surrounding the tribe's land to introduce some burning to those federal forests, too. A growing body of evidence from around the world corroborates what the Cow Creek and other indigenous groups have been saying for years: Starting low-severity fires across the forest floor - what's called broadcast burning - is the most effective way to contribute to forest health and to quell the risk of severe fires, like those seen in recent years in Oregon and across the West. <br/>But more than a century of intensive logging and development in Oregon, followed by replanting with tightly packed Douglas fir trees and years of stopping fire at all costs, has laid the groundwork for a present and future of fires that are bigger, hotter and moving faster. <br/>For Jackson and the tribe, burning and fire have long been fundamental parts of forest regeneration that create soil health, and less density and competition among trees. Fire was to be respected and harnessed, not feared or suppressed. Controlled burning was practiced by his ancestors for tens of thousands of years to prevent severe fire and to ensure the return of keystone plants and species that provided fibers and food. <br/> We've burned here since time immemorial. Anthropologists and archaeologists would say that we burned here for 20,000 to 40,000 years. I'll cross the line and say that the feds have definitely messed up in the last 200 years by not continuing land practices that we're here for - minimally - 20,000 to 40,000 years <br/> - Jesse Jackson, education programs manager, Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians<br/><br/><br/>Fire experts at state and federal agencies are coming around to some controlled fires. They agree broadly that broadcast burning needs to happen across millions of acres nationwide, and it needs to happen fast. A sense of urgency is growing among those in the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management and the Oregon Department of Forestry to undertake burning on more acreage, especially near cities and towns, to keep catastrophic fires from reaching areas where people, homes and communities could be lost. But with any fire comes smoke and the risk of flames spreading across property boundaries, making public acceptance of such a sweeping fire mitigation strategy difficult. <br/>And the forest service has not given up on trying to suppress all wildfire, meaning forests overdue for some low-severity fire won't get it, and could instead build up fuels feeding more severe and uncontrollable conflagrations. <br/> Living with fire <br/><br/>North of Roseburg, in the town of Oakridge, four severe wildfires during the last decade have changed locals' relationship to smoke and controlled burns. <br/>'People now welcome prescribed burning to reduce hazardous fuels,' said Sarah Altemus-Pope, head of the South Willamette Forest Collaborative[1], a group convening nonprofits, state and federal forest agencies and community members to prepare and respond to wildfires in the former timber town surrounded by the Willamette National Forest. <br/> Molly Juillerat, a district ranger for the US Forest Service in the Willamette National Forest (left) and Sarah Altemus-Pope, head of the South Willamette Forest Collaborative (right) in front of part of the forest that burned in a 2014 wildfire. (Alex Baumhardt/Oregon Capital Chronicle) <br/>The turning point for Altemus-Pope and the town of 3,100 came in 2022, when the Cedar Creek Fire moved too close for comfort. It lasted for three months, burned 127,000 acres and eventually led to a temporary evacuation of the entire town for several days. Residents spent nearly a month with air quality so poor it was considered among the worst in the world at the time, she said. <br/>Altemus-Pope, a former firefighter and smokejumper in Montana who grew up in Oakridge, helped forge partnerships with state and federal agencies for strategic thinning and burning around the city to make the landscape safer for firefighters to enter and secured funding for air conditioners and air filtration systems for low-income and elderly residents for smoky days. With funding from the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, the collaborative developed a smoke safety plan to ensure residents wouldn't be harmed in the process of doing controlled burns. <br/>'They realize they can have some limited exposure to smoke on their terms, or it can be lots of uncontrollable smoke from severe fires,' she said. <br/>In Oregon's recreation capital, Bend, this level of acceptance is beginning to sink in. The city is right up against the Deschutes National Forest and is dense with ponderosa and lodgepole pines that would have historically experienced low-intensity fire every five to ten years. Suppression over the last century has made much of the area around the city a tinderbox. <br/>Controlled burns help. On a Thursday in mid-May, the U.S. Forest Service burned 350 acres on private land near the forest to reduce fire risk. It was timed to ensure it would not last more than a day and that the wind would carry most of the smoke beyond the most populous parts of the city. <br/> Jodie Barram, co-coordinator for Oregon Living With Fire, stands atop Pilot Butte in Bend to answer questions about a prescribed burn taking place near the city. (Alex Baumhardt/Oregon Capital Chronicle) <br/>But the scale of such burning needs to accelerate to reduce fire risk near cities, and it can take up to eight years of planning before a prescribed burn takes place, said Jodie Barram, co-coordinator of Oregon Living With Fire, a multi-agency collaborative among local, state and federal governments. <br/>The forest service has to undertake a National Environmental Protection Act assessment, or NEPA assessment, to ensure critical habitat won't be harmed and that myriad public and forest health needs are considered. It could take another one to three years to finish mowing and mechanical thinning done in advance of a burn, often undertaken by logging companies that are allowed to take some marketable timber along with the smaller trees and plants they remove. <br/>There's also a load of information that state and federal agencies have to get out to area residents in advance of a burn and a near-constant need for more staff and competition to get firefighters to assist, and who are often pulled away to fight non-controlled fires. By the time everything is ready, the forest service could have a window of a few hours or a few days to do a burn given wind and weather conditions. <br/>Last spring, the forest service was able to complete controlled burns on 4,400 acres of the 1.6 million acre Deschutes National Forest. So far this year, it has burned about 800 acres. <br/>When it comes to suppression, the forest service has not made much progress. Despite the abundance of research showing forests must burn sometimes to maintain their health and diversity, the forest service continues to target keeping 98% of wildfires under 10 acres or less. <br/>Back on the Cow Creek's forestland, such an attitude toward fire control reflects the shortcomings of modern attitudes toward fire, according to Jackson. But it's not stopping the tribe from trying to bring the forest service onboard for a controlled, large-scale, cross-border burn across hundreds of acres in the area to keep their forests and surrounding forests healthy and fire resilient. If approved, it's possible the tribe could conduct among the first and largest cross-border broadcast burns in Oregon in the next few years. <br/>'We've burned here since time immemorial,' Jackson said. 'Anthropologists and archaeologists would say that we burned here for 20,000 to 40,000 years. I'll cross the line and say that the feds have definitely messed up in the last 200 years by not continuing land practices that we're here for - minimally - 20,000 to 40,000 years,' Jackson said.

The European Union is sending four firefighting planes from France and Italy to assist Greece, as blazes that destroyed homes outside Athens are still burning. </p><p>In the Swiss Alps, several villages have been evacuated due to a forest fire in the canton of Valais. Fires are breaking out as another blast of heat from the Sahara envelops the Mediterranean, bringing an all-time high of 113F to Catalonia in Spain on Tuesday. Rome hit a record 107F. The World Meteorological Organization, which verifies extreme temperatures, has said Europe's record of 119F, set in Sicily two years ago, could be tested. The heat that's stifling southern Europe is being repeated across the Northern Hemisphere, as global warming triggers extreme weather events from the U.S. to China. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies warned on Tuesday of the increasing frequency and intensity of heat waves, after 400,000 people died over the past decade from extreme climate and weather-related disasters. \"Heat waves are an invisible killer,\" Panu Saaristo, IFRC Emergency Health Unit team leader, said at a briefing in Geneva. \"Infants, the elderly, and people with chronic health conditions are at particular risk.\" In Italy, power consumption was expected reach a peak for this year on Tuesday. In France, the operations of the country's nuclear fleet could be curbed as warming rivers mean water can't be used to cool some reactors without threatening fish and other wildlife.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHDLY-0001467099</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHDLY2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68RF-Y841-DY6F-J0NP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163823</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"270\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Paddock Publications, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Daily Herald</publicationName><edition>WEB EditioneBlast EditionCLFM EditionMC1 EditionMC3 EditionMD1 EditionMF12 EditionML2 EditionNC EditionNC1 EditionNC14 EditionNC14C EditionNC2 EditionNC3 EditionNC4 EditionNL1 EditionNM1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 19, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Justin Andrew Wilke, 39, was convicted in July 2021 of conspiracy, theft of public property, depredation of public property, trafficking in unlawfully harvested timber, and attempting to traffic in unlawfully harvested timber.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to records filed in the case, between April and August 2018, Wilke conducted an illegal logging operation in the Elk Lake area of the Olympic National Forest, near Hood Canal. Wilke and a crew of associates removed maple trees from the National Forest and transported it to a mill in Tumwater, Washington. Wilke used forged permits to sell the wood. The type of maple harvested by the defendants is highly prized and used to produce musical instruments.</p><p>This prosecution was the first use of tree DNA evidence in a federal criminal trial. At the trial, a Research Geneticist for the USDA Forest Service, testified that the wood Wilke sold was a genetic match to the remains of three poached maple trees investigators had discovered in the Elk Lake area. The DNA analysis was so precise that it found the probability of the match being coincidental was approximately one in one undecillion (one followed by 36 zeroes). Based on this evidence, the jury concluded that the wood Wilke sold the mill had been stolen. The DNA evidence also concluded that Wilke had unlawfully harvested and sold wood from seven additional maple trees - but the precise locations of those trees have not been determined.</p><p>On August 3, 2018, Wilke led a group of two other individuals in deciding to cut a maple tree that contained a wasp's nest near the base of the tree. To remove the nest, the group sprayed insecticide and likely gasoline on the nest and then lit the nest on fire. The group failed to extinguish the fire, which developed into a wildfire later named the \"Maple Fire.\" The Maple Fire consumed more than 3,300 acres between August and November 2018 and cost approximately $4.2 million to contain. The other two members of the poaching group testified at trial that Wilke was standing next to the nest when it was lit on fire, and therefore appeared to have set the fire. However, because the fire was set at night, they were not able to see his exact actions, and testified that they did not know exactly how the fire started. The jury did not convict Wilke of the two federal counts related to the forest fire: setting timber afire and using fire in furtherance of a felony. The jury did convict Wilke of attempting to cut down the tree where the fire was set on the night of the fire.</p><p>Prosecutors recommended a 36-month sentence, noting that Wilke led the three-person tree-poaching ring that indisputably started the fire, and that Wilke likely set the fire himself based on the testimony at trial. At sentencing, Judge Benjamin H. Settle concluded that the evidence was clear and convincing that Wilke was present when the fire was set, that a member of Wilke's poaching crew set the fire, and that Wilke more likely than not personally set or directed one of his crew to set the fire. But Judge Settle noted that Wilke had made positive strides while on pretrial release, and that prison time is more difficult during the COVID pandemic. Judge Settle therefore imposed the 20-month sentence.</p><p>Wilke was also ordered to forfeit the proceeds of his illegal poaching. He will be required to pay restitution to the United States Forest Service. The exact amount will be determined at a later hearing.</p><p>The case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Seth Wilkinson and Will Dreher.

Justin Andrew Wilke, 39, was convicted in July 2021 of conspiracy, theft of public property, depredation of public property, trafficking in unlawfully harvested timber, and attempting to traffic in unlawfully harvested timber.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to records filed in the case, between April and August 2018, Wilke conducted an illegal logging operation in the Elk Lake area of the Olympic National Forest, near Hood Canal. Wilke and a crew of associates removed maple trees from the National Forest and transported it to a mill in Tumwater, Washington. Wilke used forged permits to sell the wood. The type of maple harvested by the defendants is highly prized and used to produce musical instruments.</p><p>This prosecution was the first use of tree DNA evidence in a federal criminal trial. At the trial, a Research Geneticist for the USDA Forest Service, testified that the wood Wilke sold was a genetic match to the remains of three poached maple trees investigators had discovered in the Elk Lake area. The DNA analysis was so precise that it found the probability of the match being coincidental was approximately one in one undecillion (one followed by 36 zeroes). Based on this evidence, the jury concluded that the wood Wilke sold the mill had been stolen. The DNA evidence also concluded that Wilke had unlawfully harvested and sold wood from seven additional maple trees but the precise locations of those trees have not been determined.</p><p>On August 3, 2018, Wilke led a group of two other individuals in deciding to cut a maple tree that contained a wasp's nest near the base of the tree. To remove the nest, the group sprayed insecticide and likely gasoline on the nest and then lit the nest on fire. The group failed to extinguish the fire, which developed into a wildfire later named the \"Maple Fire.\" The Maple Fire consumed more than 3,300 acres between August and November 2018 and cost approximately $4.2 million to contain. The other two members of the poaching group testified at trial that Wilke was standing next to the nest when it was lit on fire, and therefore appeared to have set the fire. However, because the fire was set at night, they were not able to see his exact actions, and testified that they did not know exactly how the fire started. The jury did not convict Wilke of the two federal counts related to the forest fire: setting timber afire and using fire in furtherance of a felony. The jury did convict Wilke of attempting to cut down the tree where the fire was set on the night of the fire.</p><p>Prosecutors recommended a 36-month sentence, noting that Wilke led the three-person tree-poaching ring that indisputably started the fire, and that Wilke likely set the fire himself based on the testimony at trial. At sentencing, Judge Benjamin H. Settle concluded that the evidence was clear and convincing that Wilke was present when the fire was set, that a member of Wilke's poaching crew set the fire, and that Wilke more likely than not personally set or directed one of his crew to set the fire. But Judge Settle noted that Wilke had made positive strides while on pretrial release, and that prison time is more difficult during the COVID pandemic. Judge Settle therefore imposed the 20-month sentence.</p><p>Wilke was also ordered to forfeit the proceeds of his illegal poaching. He will be required to pay restitution to the United States Forest Service. The exact amount will be determined at a later hearing.</p><p>The case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Seth Wilkinson and Will Dreher.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124833163</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6421-Y051-JCBF-S112-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"658\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 9, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
