Welcome, everyone. Thank you for attending. So I will be making some forward-looking statements today. Advise you to read this font size 2 at your leisure go forward.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But what's Liberty Gold all about? And first, so you have some context. I've taken over the leadership of the team from Cal Everett, I think, 11 months ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And so, the two questions that I asked before coming in and goes back to my formative years of being a financier adviser and principal investor is firstly, does the company have a coherent strategy or layout of coherent strategy that essentially can make shareholders money? The second being does it have the assets and the personnel to do so? And I would argue Black Pine, which is our flagship asset.</p><p>The company is focused on past-producing open pit heap leach assets. We have two of those in the Western Great Basin, as Brent mentioned. We have Black Pine, which is our flagship asset, and I would say, the company maker, which I'll spend the majority of our time on today, as well as we have a Goldstrike asset in Southern Utah, which again, is a past-producing asset.</p><p>So like what we heard from [just Caleb], we do have a very experienced team. And as I said, the two questions for myself coming in 30 years in the business, very, very much pleased to lead the Liberty Gold company go forward and create some significant value.</p><p>So from a corporate overview perspective, we do have, and we just announced a financing yesterday. If people did see it, we announced a financing of $5.7 million, which concurrently, we announced a royalty transaction. Now, we had an existing royalty with the company in 2016 for which vended in Black Pine, the flagship asset that I talked about. It's not a big royalty; it's a 50-basis-point royalty.</p><p>But what we did is a very smart transaction. We bought that royalty back for $3.5 million. We immediately turned around and resold that royalty to Wheaton Precious Metals with a very smart buyback option. So we're no worse off than we were last week in terms of the royalty. And in fact, we have an option for the next 6.5 years to take that royalty from 50 basis points to 25 basis points of the same implied cost.</p><p>What also came with the transaction is the $5 million Anchor investment from Wheaton Precious Metals. So in terms of the share outstanding, it's a little outdated. We won't close the financing until this Friday, so we'll move up to about 340 million shares outstanding. But we'd like to welcome in Wheaton Precious as they are now a significant shareholder, just over 5%.</p><p>In addition, we have, again, the long-term sticky shareholders that you would know being Franklin, Merck, VanEck, Amati, Konwave, and RCF.</p><p>In terms of the management insider participation, we think like owners every day and participating in this financing that I mentioned. We own about 5% of the company. Newmont's got a legacy position at 4.3%. You can see the analyst coverage on the right-hand side of the slide, again, very well covered by a lot of the analysts out there and very supportive, and all of them have been to the Black Pine project.</p><p>So Black Pine, again, this is Southern Idaho. And we've got a very large land position, as you can see at 50 -- 51 kilometers. We've have a permit right now for 24 of those kilometers. We expect to get the permit for next year to drill a lot of the areas that you can see in the gray.</p><p>And it's no accident. You can see the mineralization, about right up against the current permit areas. So we just really need that permit to be issued, so we can connect a lot of the gaps that you can see from Discovery Zone to the Back Range Zone that you can see in the northwest.</p><p>As I mentioned, this property was acquired in 2016 for approximately $1 million. We have excellent project access. In fact, the Interstate 84 you can see off to the northwest is just a couple of kilometers away. So that gets a nice check. The fact that we also have power right to the mine gate, as I said, this is a past producing mine. It was operated in the '90s when gold was vacillating between $250 and $270 an ounce, obviously, a very different environment now.</p><p>And other attributes in terms of as we go forward, there are no timber values here. There's no groundwater in the mineralized area. There's no surface water in the valley, so there's no rivers, streams, fish habitat. There's no threatened endangered species. Check, check, check, in terms of everything that you would think of from an environmental benign perspective.</p><p>But what we do have and what we've already secured is essentially process water for this operation. So we've secured through a series of transactions 100,000-ton per day processed water. Our base-case scenario or situation is to use about 50,000 tons per day. So we have ample water in case we do want to expand the footprint or expand the operation, provided that we see ourselves in a very strong gold environment go forward when this is in operation.</p><p>Lastly, we have very strong community support and community relationships. The closest community to the Black Pine assets is a community called Burley. Just so you can get a spatial understanding where this is, it's about three hours south on the highway from Boise, or it's two hours north from Salt Lake.</p><p>In terms of the mineral resource or the mineral endowment, we have 3.1 million ounces here at Black Pine, 2.6 million of that's in the indicated category. We released the mineral resource back in February, and we've been working very hard this year. We've got over 30,000 meters drilled this year and including some that we drilled in 2022. So about 35,000 more ounces will go into an updated mineral resource that we expect to put out or finish at the end of this year and expect to put out either late this year or early Q1.</p><p>You can see the topography by this isometric map. Again, the whole mountain is effectively mineralized, so that you've got some high-grade pockets surrounded by, again, the oldest low-grade [mineralized sea]. I think most importantly, over half of this resource is above 1 gram a ton. So again, there's certainly areas we're popping, and that's important when you think about the economics of the project go forward.</p><p>In terms of the work prep plan for 2023, as I mentioned, we have an RC program. Three of the drills were just demoed just a couple of weeks ago. We continue to drill our PQ, or core program, that will give us the geotech and metallurgical information that we'll feed into a pre-feasibility study.</p><p>The 5.7 million that will close on Friday, it's important to note that given our current cash balance and the last reported from financials, was up at $11 million, but we've been burning capital, given we've been drilling about last week we're about $7 million. So post this financing, we'll have about USD13 million. That funds us completely through the pre-feasibility study, which we expect to put out Q2, Q3 of 2024.</p><p>What importantly that will also do in terms of the pre-feasibility study is it allows us to essentially submit what's called a mine plan of operations to start the permitting process in Idaho. And so, what we did -- an announcement that we put out just last week, we submitted what's called the pre-planned mine of operations, or mining pre-plan of operations, that outlines the project's impacts, concept, infrastructure. We did a seeding study as you can see with some of the facilities here being the heap leach, the rock storage, and the ancillary facilities.</p><p>What we can do now as essentially because we've submitted this is we can have engagement with the regulatory agencies that will be responsible for the permitting of the project. The lead agency will be the US Forest Service, but there's obviously other cooperating agencies being the BLM, as well as the Idaho Energy and Mineral Resources Area. The purpose to do this is we obviously then can have some significant engagement prior to the submission of the mine plan of operations to understand any sort of sensitivities as we think about the impact of the operation go forward.</p><p>In addition, we appointed M3 as our lead engineer for the pre-feasibility study. And people who are not familiar with M3, they're really the gurus of heap leach operations, not only in the US, but they were involved in Camino Rojo project, and I see Jason here in the audience. They were also involved in the South Railroad projects. So they really, really do understand and know heap leach projects in the Great Basin. So that was a very good add for ourselves.</p><p>So what does that mean in terms of the permitting timeline? As I said, the plan is to get to a pre-feas. We can submit concurrently the mine, or shortly thereafter the mine plan of operations. What then happens is essentially get to what's called a notice of intent, which is filed in the federal registry.</p><p>What's happened since then in -- and it actually came through the debt ceiling legislation that came through a couple of months ago is now legislated that. When you go through the federal NEPA process, or the Environmental Protection Act process in the US, the agencies now have no more than 24 months to come to a record of decision. So once you're filed on the federal registry, there is a prescribed -- prior to this, it was an open-ended timing, but there's a prescribed 24 months to come to a record of decision.</p><p>And so, given again, what I've talked about from an environmental, the benign position, this is a past producing disturbed site. There's essentially no timber values here as well. There was a forest fire that burned some 13 years ago, that burned all the timber value.</p><p>We expect we could get to an environmental impact statement and a record of decision effectively 24 months after the submission and deemed complete of the planning of operations and the notice of intent, therefore, breaking ground somewhere of late 2027, early 2028.</p><p>And so, there's obviously a lot going on with respect to the company. I focused mainly on the Black Pine asset. But what we do have over the course of the next few months, we'll be releasing a number of results. We released a bunch of results just last week. The focus this year or the work plan this year was our strategy was to have both grade and economic filters on our drilling.</p><p>And what do I mean by that, the grade being higher than our resource grade near-surface opportunities, so we can maximize NPV and minimize the payback period as it relates to the pre-feasibility study going forward. So we've done a lot of that, and we've found a lot of near-surface high-grade.</p><p>We've also been drilling from an economic perspective, historic waste dumps that could supply or will supply some very, very low cost early revenue as it relates to the overall operation. In addition, we've been doing obviously the work that relates to both the geotech metallurgical work, the waste rock characterization, the environmental baseline studies, and everything that we require or need to essentially put the project into the permitting process.</p><p>So in summary, there's obviously a lot going on. This is a shift as it relates to this -- Liberty Gold was really viewed as an exploration story. This is a real evolution, a shift, where we're moving into the development status. And most importantly, the most consequential release, we'll be putting out in 2024 around our pre-feasibility study and we demonstrate to the market the economics currently, though, getting into the permitting process in Idaho.</p><p>So thank you very much for your attention, and I hope everyone enjoys the rest of the conference.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Thank you. I've been there. Like I said, that's one of the best places I've seen to build a mine.

With a few familiar songs and perhaps a trick of the light, a college theater in the Northeast Kingdom can transform into the setting for one of the most celebrated productions of the 1970s sexual revolution: 'The Rocky Horror Show.'\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> At Northern Vermont University-Lyndon, the musical 'cult classic' will soon be performed onstage, opening Thursday, April 20, and running through Sunday, April 23.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> ' I've loved the show since I first saw it when I was 14,' said Alex Hume, a member of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lyndonsga.com/twilight-players.html#:~:text=The%20Twilight%20Players%20is%20one,of%20the%20community%20can%20participate.\">Twilight Players</url> , NVU's theater club.

Furter on Monday, April 17. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger </p><p> 'The Rocky Horror Show,' written by Richard O'Brien, first debuted in 1973, combining the camp of sci-fi B movies with a serious message about LGBTQ+ liberation. At the time of its release, the show sparked controversy for its bold representation of queer and transgender identities, and just as quickly solidified <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/04/movies/rocky-horror-is-doing-the-time-warp-forever.html\">its place in queer culture</url> . In 1975, it was adapted into the film 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show.'</p><p> As NVU theater professor and director Michael Kane puts it, the show is 'like Frankenstein's lab meets gay pride parade. It was one of the first mainstream shows to explore a world that wasn't just a binary world.'</p><p> Kane, who grew up in East Burke, joined NVU-Lyndon as a theater professor in 2021. After the first year of the pandemic, he said, NVU students were eager to get involved in theater.\u00a0</p><p> 'It was as if there was a forest fire, and all these new shoots were rising up,' Kane said.</p><p> Kane said students were drawn to 'The Rocky Horror Show' this year because of its message and relevance to their lives.</p><p> 'There's a part of a song (in the show) where the refrain goes, 'Don't dream it, be it,' and that is so powerful,' he said. 'Sure, (the show is) silly and frivolous but underneath all that, it's a show about being who you want to be.'</p><p> Chance Rowe, a second-year student at the college who plays <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.rockyhorrorwiki.org/wiki2/index.php?title=Dr._Everett_Von_Scott#:~:text=Everett%20V.,in%20the%20Original%20London%20Cast.\">Dr. Everett Scott</url>  in the show, said they think Rocky Horror has been controversial because it portrays 'the freedom of owning a body' and 'being sexual and in tune with yourself.'\u00a0</p><p>  Chance Rowe as Dr. Scott sings on Monday, April 17. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger </p><p> 'Unfortunately, today,' Hume said, those things still feel 'like an act of rebellion.'</p><p> Rowe encountered 'The Rocky Horror Show' in 2016 in a YouTube recording of the production, falling in love with the show's actors, set and soundtrack.\u00a0</p><p> 'I really resonate with the song ' <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc80tFJpTuo\">Sweet Transvestite</url> ,'' they said, since it encourages 'being proud of who you are and of your own identity. I know who I am and am happy to be here, and that's the message I get from that song.'</p><p> While expressing admiration for the songs, Rowe and other cast members noted that 'Rocky Horror' does use some outdated language \u2014 words such as 'transvestite' and 'transsexual,' for example, which Rowe said are 'very much not how we should describe anyone nowadays.'</p><p>  The Twilight Players at Northern Vermont University-Lyndon run through a dress rehearsal for \"The Rocky Horror Show.\" Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger </p><p> The show's language proved somewhat divisive among LGBTQ+ students on campus, according to cast members, and some people opposed the production, in part, because of the outdated and potentially offensive language it employs.\u00a0</p><p> Yet, cast members said, the show provides an opportunity to witness such language within a historical context, and, for those who identify as transgender themselves, even reclaim it.\u00a0</p><p> As the NVU-Lyndon students gear up for the performance, many say they are eager to carry on the show's subversive legacy, particularly in the context of recent anti-queer violence. This year, a record breaking number of anti-LGBTQ+ \u2014 and specifically anti-transgender \u2014 bills have been introduced or passed in state legislatures across the United States, accompanied by increasingly hateful <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/07/cpac-anti-trans-rhetoric\">rhetoric</url>  and heightened <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hrc.org/resources/fatal-violence-against-the-transgender-and-nonbinary-community-in-2023?utm_medium=ads&amp;utm_source=GoogleSearch&amp;utm_content=HateCrimes-AntiLGBTQHateCrimes&amp;utm_campaign=GoogleGrant&amp;utm_source=GS&amp;utm_medium=AD&amp;utm_campaign=BPI-HRC-Grant&amp;utm_content=607605659474&amp;utm_term=hate%20crimes%20against%20lgbt&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAx6ugBhCcARIsAGNmMbhRpoJWILuIfMHYvi5zcEMJWZko1QOY_LnHRP0zHmGNKv1mzBoRUy8aAl3OEALw_wcB\">violence</url> .</p><p> 'It's always been political, showing queer identities in the media,' Hume said, 'especially now that in many states around our country, what (LGBTQ+ people) are doing and the things we're saying is looked at as criminal behavior.'</p><p>  The Twilight Players on Monday, April 17. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger </p><p> Politically, Vermont has 'protected the rights of these students and allowed them to celebrate their identities and sexuality,' Kane said in a press release. 'In other states, college students would have a lot of problems performing this show.'\u00a0\u00a0</p><p> For Hume, the rural setting of the college's campus draws assumptions about a lack of tolerance for LGBTQ+ people just as quickly as it subverts them.\u00a0</p><p> 'Up here in Vermont, there's far more goats than there are people,' Hume said, 'Compared to the rest of the country, you often think we're 'Oh, they must be very conservative, very harsh personality people', (but) these are very open, friendly people. I feel like this is the perfect landscape to put on the show.'\u00a0</p><p> Even so, Hume continued, 'we do have to think about (safety). Of course we're putting on the show, but what elements of ourselves do we need to protect while doing this?'</p><p>  Alex Hume as Dr. Frank N. Furter during a dress rehearsal for \"The Rocky Horror Show.\" Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger </p><p> 'We're just here to love people and be ourselves,' Rowe said, 'I feel like this show better helps other people to understand that and not see queer people as villainous.'</p><p> As opening night approaches, cast members express hope that their production of 'Rocky Horror' will resonate with viewers, no matter who they are.</p><p> Brett Violett, a junior playing the role of <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.rockyhorrorwiki.org/wiki2/index.php?title=Riff_Raff\">Riff Raff</url> , said one of the moments he connects with most happens as the narrator is closing out the final scene: 'The narrator comes on and (says), 'And crawling on the planet's face, some insects called the human race.

The 8-week program will run from June 27-August 18, Monday-Thursday, providing an excellent resource for kids and families living in the San Juan Islands. We have a 10-person crew led by 2 adult field guides on Orcas and San Juan Island.</p><p>The YCC is an opportunity for youth to not only spend the summer outdoors learning about local conservation and stewardship efforts, but actually improving wilderness areas across the islands. Youth will work closely with program staff, conservation professionals, and partner education programs on stewardship/restoration projects, inquiry-based experiential outdoor education, technical field skill building, and professional development. In doing so, YCC members gain applied job skills, an end of season stipend, and training that can help propel them into their future.</p><p>The program looks to provide a range of skills and knowledge for crew members that includes forest stand mapping, Traditional Ecological Knowledge of native plants, and wildfire risk reduction, wetland and riparian zone recovery, invasive weed removal, and trail building/brushing. Each stewardship project will be complemented by educational themes and hands-on activities that focus on: Team building &amp; anti-bullying; Sense of place; Localized food systems; Land management ethics; Marine, nearshore, and wetland environments; Endangered species recovery; Forest &amp; fire ecology; Art &amp; environmentalism</p><p>YCC crews strive to improve the health of our youth as well as the health of our environment which in turn leads to a healthy and balanced sustainable future.</p><p>Apply soon! Our applications will close May 12 and are available on the San Juan Islands Conservation District website. Families pay an activity fee between $0-$500 depending on what works best for them, and all students are paid an $800 stipend at the end of the season to celebrate their hard work. Our program provides a healthy mix of field science, natural and cultural history, leadership skills training, weekly themed curricula and high-impact service projects. We are excited for our 2022 season and hope you will apply!</p><p>If you are or know of someone who is interested in applying for YCC, please visit our website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sanjuanislandscd.org/ycc\">www.sanjuanislandscd.org/ycc</url> and contact Kelsey Kittleson, YCC Program Coordinator, at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Kelsey@sjicd.org\">Kelsey@sjicd.org</email></p><p>Copyright 2022 Islands Weekly</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ISLWEE-news20220507PXM4318133</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ISLWEE2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65D3-Y321-F0HF-835Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">475118</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-05-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"420\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

News: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ibtimes.com\">http://www.ibtimes.com</url> Delivered by Newstex)  <br/>Greece's raging fires claimed their first victim on Friday after a punishing week-long heatwave, while neighbouring Turkey came under rising pressure over its handling of its own devastating wildfires. </p><p><br/>Greece and Turkey have been fighting blaze upon blaze over the past week, hit by the region's worst heatwave in decades, a disaster that officials and experts have linked to increasingly frequent and intense weather events caused by climate change. <br/> A man pushes a bike along a road in the vicinity of a forest fire close to the Kemerkoy Thermal Power Plant in northen Turkey Photo: AFP / Yasin AKGUL  <br/>A UN draft report seen by AFP has warned that the Mediterranean region, which it called a \"climate change hotspot,\" will be hit by fiercer heatwaves, droughts and fires supercharged by rising temperatures. <br/>On Friday, a 38-year-old man from Ippokrateio, a town north of Athens hit by giant flames, died in hospital after being hit by a falling electric pole as he was riding a moped, the health ministry said, the first victim of the fires in Greece. <br/> Villagers were evacuated by sea by Turkish coastguards after a deadly wildfire engulfed the outer edges of the 35-year-old Kemerkoy thermal power plant storing thousands of tonnes of coal Photo: AFP / Yasin AKGUL  <br/><br/>In Turkey, some eight people have been killed and dozens more hospitalised. <br/> Flames rise from a fire spreading around Kapandriti, on the outskirts of Athens Photo: AFP / Louisa GOULIAMAKI  <br/> \"Our country is facing an extremely critical situation,\" Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said late Thursday, putting six out of 13 regions in the country under high alert. <br/> Techniques for fighting wildfires Photo: AFP / David LORY  <br/>\"We're facing unprecedented conditions after several days of heatwave have turned the country into a powder keg.\" <br/>North of Athens, a fierce blaze ate through vast areas of pine forest, forcing yet more evacuations of villages overnight and blowing thick, choking smoke all over the Greek capital. <br/> A dead animal lies amongst burnt trees on a hillside on Evia Island Photo: AFP / LOUISA GOULIAMAKI  <br/>In the small town of Afidnes, 30 kilometres north of the capital (12 miles), firefighters were seen standing on their truck in the dead of night, dousing flames that leapt high above them. <br/>In the morning, the fires had made way for desolation -- burnt cars, trees, and houses destroyed. <br/>In nearby Krioneri, the fire scorched homes, businesses and factories. <br/> A wildfire rages through the village of Afidnes, north of Athens - a blaze that firefighters had hoped to control but which regained strength after destroying large areas of pine forest Photo: AFPTV / Will VASSILOPOULOS  <br/>\"The fire in uncontrollable,\" said resident Vassiliki Papapanagiotis. \"I don't want to leave, my whole life is here.\" <br/>Part of a motorway linking Athens to the north of the country has been shut down as a precaution. <br/> A person watches a fire fighter dousing flames from the top of a

to the Kemerkoy Thermal Power Plant in northen Turkey Photo: AFP / Yasin AKGUL  <br/>Deputy Civil Protection Minister Nikos Hardalias said that out of 99 fires reported on Thursday, 56 were still active. <br/>At least 450 Greek firefighters were fighting the blaze. <br/>Around 82 French firefighters -- both military and civilian -- arrived on Thursday evening, a French official said. <br/>France was also due to send two water-bombing planes, as was Sweden, while Romania was to dispatch 112 firefighters and 23 vehicles and Switzerland three helicopters, a spokesman for the Greek firefighters told AFP. <br/>Israel, too, is planning to send back-up. <br/>In neighbouring Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has come under withering criticism for being slow or unwilling to accept some offers of foreign assistance after revealing that Turkey had no functioning firefighting planes. <br/>According to the presidency, 208 fires have flared up since July 28, and 12 were still ablaze on Friday. <br/>More evacuations took place on Friday in five Turkish provinces, including tourist hotspots Antalya and Mugla, according to NTV. <br/>The Turkish government is also facing pressure after the opposition referred to a report which showed only a fraction of the budget for forest fire prevention had been spent. <br/>The General Directorate of Forestry (OGM) spent only 1.75 percent of nearly 200 million Turkish lira ($23 million) allocated for forest fires in the first six months of 2021, main opposition party MP Murat Emir said, referring to numbers apparently from the state agency's own report, which he submitted in a parliamentary question. <br/>\"This is a situation that one could go as far as to describe as treachery,\" he told AFP. <br/>Events like these will become even worse, the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned in a draft report due out next year seen by AFP. <br/>The draft predicts that temperatures across the Mediterranean are likely to rise faster than the global average in the decades to come. <br/>\"Every heatwave occurring today is made more likely and more intense by human-caused climate change,\" Friederike Otto, associate director at the University of Oxford's Environmental Change Institute, told AFP. <br/>Extreme heat is the most pressing threat facing the Mediterranean region as heatwaves \"are by far the deadliest extreme events in Europe,\" he said. <br/></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The grants are from the Idaho State Department of Agriculture Specialty Crop Block Grant program and the Idaho Global Entrepreneurial Mission (IGEM) Commerce program.</p><p>The new Idaho awards focus on climate effects pertaining to the potato industry, the utilization of pulsed electric field technology (PEF) to benefit the wine industry, and PEF system application in the barley malting process with the aim to increase processing efficiency and resource conservation in breweries.</p><p>The $125,000 \"smoke potato\" grant funded by the Idaho State Department of Agriculture Specialty Crop Block Grant (ISDA SCBG) program will support a diverse team of researchers including: Professor Mike Thornton of the University of Idaho Parma Research and Extension Center; University of Idaho Economics Professor Emeritus Joe Guenther; Director of the Caldwell-based University of Idaho Food Technology Center, Josh Bevin; McCain Foods USA Manager of Agronomy, Addie Waxman; and Boise State University Professor and Chair of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Owen McDougal.</p><p>The team will grow different varieties of potatoes under conditions simulating rangeland and forest fire smoke, harvest the potatoes for storage and processing, conduct chemical analysis and quality value assessment, and determine the economic impact of climate-induced smoke on the Idaho potato industry.</p><p>Funding from a second ISDA SCBG grant for $164,783 will fund McDougal's partnership with Jim Gratzek at Food Physics Group to optimize PEF treatment of white and red grapes grown at Lanae Ridge Vineyard, Sawtooth Vineyard, and Williamson Orchards and Vineyard, with the intent to improve quality (i.e., color, clarity, body, aroma, flavor, etc.) in wines produced by Cinder Wines, Telaya Wine Company, and Split Rail Winery.</p><p>The third award, funded by the IGEM Commerce program, will provide $160,357 to demonstrate the enhancement to barley germination rate and efficiency, water conservation and energy reduction, achieved using PEF system technology. The partnership between McDougal and Gratzek will serve to benefit the industry partner, Anheuser Busch, the largest processor of malted barley in the United States.

The fire burned nearly 38,000 acres overnight, and brought the small community of Forks together in an immediate desperate effort to save the town. The fire had a long-term impact on the community, changing the logging industry in the area for many years to come.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After the Fire</p><p>The fire had 620 million board feet of timber in its path. By a crash program of logging, five-sixths of this timber was salvaged with timber companies bringing in logging crews from other areas because it was imperative the timber be processed before pests attached themselves to the charred trees. Soon a million feet a day was being logged and 160 logging trucks were averaging three trips each a day into Port Angeles. Some operators dumped their logs at Pysht where they were boomed and towed to mills at Tacoma and Everett. Forks boomed - the housing shortage became acute and many new homes were built - there were jobs for everyone who wanted work. Rayonier Incorporated chemists under the stress of necessity, made an important breakthrough. Previously it had been impossible to use burned timber for pulp. The chemists found a method to remove the charcoal and logs from the Calawah Burn went into the pulp digesters. Salvage was completed in 1956 and the burned-over area was restocked by seeding and planting of young trees.</p><p>Losses to the Fire</p><p>The fire covered an area of approximately 38,000 acres, a combination of privately owned, state land, and national forest land. In Forks, several homes, businesses, and shops were destroyed. Some logging equipment and machinery was also lost to the fire, and logging railroad tracks were destroyed. In spite of the overall devastation of the area and the property damage, there was no loss of life.</p><p>During the Fire</p><p>The Forks Fire started around 3 a.m. on September 20, 1951, in the Olympic National forest near Camp Creek, flaring up from the Sol Duc fire. The fire, fanned by high winds, traveled 18 miles in less than 8 hours. Residents of Forks awoke that morning with the rapidly moving fire on the horizon and threatening the town.</p><p>Burning a path nearly three miles wide, witnesses told of flames 500 feet in the air, with embers and ashes landing in the town of Forks. As the town became threatened, crews mobilized to cut fire breaks to stop the fire and save the town. Residents of the town were evacuated, leaving town with what prized possessions they could carry, and no guarantee that the town would survive the fire for their return.</p><p>Before the Fire</p><p>The summer of 1951 was extremely dry, with rainfall less than 15% of normal. June, July and August of 1951 recorded a total of 1.15 inches of rainfall in Forks, compared to the normal average for the same months of 8.20 inches of rain. The extreme dry conditions brought several forest fires in the northwest, from Oregon to British Columbia.</p><p>On August 6, a fire started near Camp Creek, apparently caused by sparks from a logging train on the Port Angeles and Western Railroad. The fire burned for several days before being brought under control, covering nearly 1,600 acres. Spot fires continued to be a problem for several weeks after the fire was controlled, and firefighters regularly patrolled the fire area.</p><p>On September 20, a sudden drop in humidity and a strong easterly wind allowed a hot spot to erupt into a fire that spread rapidly, burning thousands of acres and dramatically changing the small community of Forks, Washington.</p><p>More photos and information including videos can be found at content.lib.washington.edu/cmpweb/exhibits/forksfire/index.html</p><p>Copyright 2022 Forks Forum</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FORFOR-news20220922PXK4375712</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FORFOR2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66FR-X2Y1-JD2C-J0FR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">475085</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"625\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Black Press Inc.

Two volunteer firefighters have been hospitalised in a critical condition, local media reported. <br/> In Turkey, some eight people have been killed and dozens more hospitalised during 10 days of fire. <br/> Techniques for fighting wildfires Photo: AFP / David LORY  <br/> A dead animal lies amongst burnt trees on a hillside on Evia Island Photo: AFP / LOUISA GOULIAMAKI  <br/>\"Our country is facing an extremely critical situation,\" Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said. <br/>\"We're facing unprecedented conditions after several days of heatwave have turned the country into a powder keg.\" <br/> A wildfire rages through the village of Afidnes, north of Athens - a blaze that firefighters had hoped to control but which regained strength after destroying large areas of pine forest Photo: AFPTV / Will VASSILOPOULOS  <br/>North of Athens, a fierce blaze tore through vast areas of pine forest, forcing yet more evacuations of villages overnight and blowing thick, choking smoke all over the Greek capital. <br/>Text alerts were sent out to people in Athens warning of \"extreme fire danger in the coming days\". <br/> A person watches a fire fighter dousing flames from the top of a truck as a fire spreads around the village of Afidnes, some 30 kilometres north of Athens Photo: AFP / LOUISA GOULIAMAKI  <br/>In the small town of Afidnes, 30 kilometres (12 miles) north of the capital, firefighters were seen standing on their truck in the dead of night, dousing flames that leapt high above them. <br/>In the morning, the fires had left desolation in their wake -- burnt cars, trees, and houses destroyed. <br/> A man pushes a bike along a road in the vicinity of a forest fire close to the Kemerkoy Thermal Power Plant in northen Turkey Photo: AFP / Yasin AKGUL  <br/>In nearby Krioneri, the fire scorched homes, businesses and factories. <br/>\"The fire is uncontrollable,\" said resident Vassiliki Papapanagiotis. \"I don't want to leave, my whole life is here.\" <br/>Part of a motorway linking Athens to the north of the country has been shut down as a precaution. <br/>Around 5,000 residents and tourists were evacuated in the southern Peloponnese town of Gytheio, the ERT channel reported. <br/>Deputy Civil Protection Minister Nikos Hardalias said that out of 99 fires reported on Thursday, 56 were still active. <br/>At least 450 Greek firefighters were fighting the blaze, along with water-dropping air support and reinforcements from France, Switzerland, Romania, Sweden, Israel and Cyprus. <br/>In Turkey, 208 fires have flared up since July 28, and 12 were still ablaze on Friday, according to the presidency. <br/>In one particularly critical event earlier this week, winds whipped up a flash fire that subsumed the grounds of an Aegean coast power plant in Turkey storing thousands of tonnes of coal. <br/>More evacuations took place on Friday in five Turkish provinces, including tourist hotspots Antalya and Mugla, according to NTV. <br/>President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has come under withering criticism for being slow or unwilling to accept some offers of foreign assistance after revealing that Turkey had no functioning firefighting planes. <br/>The Turkish government is also facing pressure after the opposition referred to a report which showed only a fraction of the budget for forest fire prevention had been spent. <br/>The General Directorate of Forestry (OGM) spent only 1.75 percent of nearly 200 million Turkish lira ($23 million) allocated for forest fires in the first six months of 2021, main opposition party MP Murat Emir said, referring to numbers apparently from the state agency's own report. <br/>\"This is a situation that one could go as far as to describe as treachery,\" he told AFP. <br/>Extreme fires like those in Greece and Turkey will become even worse, the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned in a draft report due out next year seen by AFP.

In doing so, the association made history: two of the four officers who will lead NASF in fiscal year 2023 are women.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Kacey KC, state forester of Nevada, will lead NASF as president in 2023. As the state forester and firewarden for the Nevada Division of Forestry (NDF), KC is responsible for the delivery of wildland fire protection and private forest landowner technical assistance statewide.</p><p>\"It is an honor and privilege to serve my colleagues as president of NASF,\" KC said. \"I am most looking forward to helping the association develop partnerships at the national level that will improve collaboration on the ground where state foresters are already the leading conveners of shared stewardship and cross-boundary land management efforts.\"</p><p>\"Our work won't stop there. In 2023, I also intend to set a plan in motion from Washington, D.C., that will empower all of NASF's 59 members with new tools for employee retention and recruitment,\" KC continued. \"State foresters employ 27,000 men and women in any given year and the demands on that workforce are growing while the candidate pool for forestry and wildland fire jobs contracts. There's no one solution to this problem--one size has never fit all for our members--but I am confident we can make a difference for state forestry agencies on this issue in the coming year.\"</p><p>KC was appointed Nevada state forester and firewarden in 2018. She started her career with NDF in 2002 with the nursery and seedbank program and worked for the next ten years with state, local, and federal partners to reduce wildfire fuels in the state. With the Nevada Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, KC worked with partners, landowners, and industry through the Sagebrush Ecosystem Program to find a collaborative and sustainable approach to sagebrush ecosystem management in the state. KC returned to forestry in 2015 as the deputy administrator of operations managing the natural resource, wildland fire management, aviation, and conservation camp programs.</p><p>KC is a Nevada native, University of Montana forestry graduate, and a Peace Corps alum. She was recently selected to serve as the state forester representative on the National Wildfire Mitigation and Management Commission and is a driving force behind the Nevada Shared Stewardship program.</p><p>NASF also elected Scott Phillips, state forester of South Carolina, as the association's new vice president and Ellen Shultzabarger, state forester of Pennsylvania, as its new treasurer. Christopher Martin, state forester of Connecticut, will serve on the executive committee as immediate past president. Each will serve a twelve-month term.</p><p>As her first order of business, KC appointed the following state foresters to chair NASF's standing committees:</p><p>FOREST MARKETS COMMITTEE, Chair: Russell Bozeman, State Forester for the Mississippi Forestry Commission</p><p>FOREST RESOURCE MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE, Chair: Tim Lowrimore, State Forester for the Georgia Forestry Commission</p><p>FOREST SCIENCE AND HEALTH COMMITTEE, Chair: Peter Church, State Forester for the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, Bureau of Forest Fire Control and Forestry</p><p>URBAN AND COMMUNITY FORESTRY COMMITTEE, Chair: John Erixson, State Forester for the Nebraska Forest Service</p><p>WILDLAND FIRE COMMITTEE, Chair: George Geissler, State Forester for the Washington Department of Natural Resources</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.stateforesters.org/newsroom/state-foresters-elect-new-leadership-make-history/\">https://www.stateforesters.org/newsroom/state-foresters-elect-new-leadership-make-history/</url></p><p>[Category: Agriculture]</p><p>Contact: Whitney Forman-Cook, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:wforman-cook@stateforesters.org\">wforman-cook@stateforesters.org</email></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>C20-RajeshS-7950992 C20-RajeshS</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7950992</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66FG-BRT1-JC11-14HN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"668\"/><timeReceived>9:00 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"09\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>September 22, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Rick Larsen (WA-02) voted to lower the cost of health care and prescription drugs for working families and seniors, make a historic down payment to combat climate change and cut the deficit by $300 billion. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed the House by a final vote of 220 to 207 and now heads to the President's desk to be signed into law.</p><p>\"Thanks to the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the economy is no longer on the mend - it is on the move. These critical investments ensure all Washingtonians benefit from the economic recovery by making health care and prescription drugs more affordable, creating millions of green jobs, lowering energy costs and combating climate change,\" said LarSen.</p><p>The IRA addresses many of Larsen's priorities to lower costs for working families and seniors and combat climate change, including:</p><p>Lowering the Cost of Prescription Drugs and Health Care</p><p>* Enables Medicare to directly negotiate the price of prescription drugs with drug companies</p><p>* Caps out-of-pocket prescription drug costs at $2,000 per year for Medicare beneficiaries</p><p>* Caps insulin copays at $35 per month for Medicare beneficiaries</p><p>* Extends for three years the Affordable Care Act tax credits included in the American Rescue Plan that enabled 11,000 more people in the Second District and 95,000 people statewide to newly enroll in affordable health insurance plans.</p><p>Delivering the Largest Investment to Combat Climate Change in U.S. History</p><p>* Taken together, provisions in the bill will reduce carbon emissions by roughly 40 percent by 2030.</p><p>* Invests in domestic energy production and manufacturing, including:</p><p>o $27 billion to support deployment of technologies to reduce carbon emissions, especially in disadvantaged communities</p><p>o $5 billion to support healthy forests, forest fire resiliency, forest conservation and urban tree planting</p><p>o $3 billion to support the purchase and installation of zero-emission equipment and technology at ports like the Port of Everett</p><p>o $3 billion for the U.S. Postal Service to purchase zero-emission vehicles</p><p>o $2.6 billion to conserve and restore coastal habitats around Puget Sound and other marine ecosystems</p><p>o $1 billion for cleaner heavy-duty vehicles like school and transit buses and garbage trucks</p><p>o $300 million to speed up production and adoption of cleaner aviation fuel</p><p>o Consumers will receive discounts for electric vehicles at the point of sale, rather than waiting for a tax credit rebate.</p><p>Lowering the Deficit and Making Biggest Corporations Pay Their Fair Share</p><p>* Makes a historic down payment on deficit reduction of approximately $300 billion</p><p>* Strengthens IRS enforcement against wealthy tax cheats and closes tax loopholes exploited by the wealthiest few</p><p>* Implements a 15 percent corporate minimum tax - which applies only to the 150 corporations earning over $1 billion in profits that pay less than 15 percent in taxes</p><p>For more information on the Inflation Reduction Act, go to: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/inflation_reduction_act_one_page_summary.pdf\">https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/inflation_reduction_act_one_page_summary.pdf</url>.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://larsen.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2695\">https://larsen.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2695</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CODUPB-COSHM812223N3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:665C-8VK1-DYVR-P1K0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"529\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 12, 2022</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Rick Larsen, D-Washington, issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rep. Rick Larsen (WA-02) voted to lower the cost of health care and prescription drugs for working families and seniors, make a historic down payment to combat climate change and cut the deficit by $300 billion. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed the House by a final vote of 220 to 207 and now heads to the President's desk to be signed into law.</p><p>\"Thanks to the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the economy is no longer on the mend - it is on the move. These critical investments ensure all Washingtonians benefit from the economic recovery by making health care and prescription drugs more affordable, creating millions of green jobs, lowering energy costs and combating climate change,\" said Larsen.</p><p>The IRA addresses many of Larsen's priorities to lower costs for working families and seniors and combat climate change, including:</p><p>Lowering the Cost of Prescription Drugs and Health Care</p><p>* Enables Medicare to directly negotiate the price of prescription drugs with drug companies</p><p>* Caps out-of-pocket prescription drug costs at $2,000 per year for Medicare beneficiaries</p><p>* Caps insulin copays at $35 per month for Medicare beneficiaries</p><p>* Extends for three years the Affordable Care Act tax credits included in the American Rescue Plan that enabled 11,000 more people in the Second District and 95,000 people statewide to newly enroll in affordable health insurance plans.</p><p>Delivering the Largest Investment to Combat Climate Change in U.S. History</p><p>* Taken together, provisions in the bill will reduce carbon emissions by roughly 40 percent by 2030.</p><p>* Invests in domestic energy production and manufacturing, including:</p><p>- $27 billion to support deployment of technologies to reduce carbon emissions, especially in disadvantaged communities</p><p>- $5 billion to support healthy forests, forest fire resiliency, forest conservation and urban tree planting</p><p>- $3 billion to support the purchase and installation of zero-emission equipment and technology at ports like the Port of Everett</p><p>- $3 billion for the U.S. Postal Service to purchase zero-emission vehicles</p><p>- $2.6 billion to conserve and restore coastal habitats around Puget Sound and other marine ecosystems</p><p>- $1 billion for cleaner heavy-duty vehicles like school and transit buses and garbage trucks</p><p>- $300 million to speed up production and adoption of cleaner aviation fuel</p><p>- Consumers will receive discounts for electric vehicles at the point of sale, rather than waiting for a tax credit rebate.</p><p>Lowering the Deficit and Making Biggest Corporations Pay Their Fair Share</p><p>* Makes a historic down payment on deficit reduction of approximately $300 billion</p><p>* Strengthens IRS enforcement against wealthy tax cheats and closes tax loopholes exploited by the wealthiest few</p><p>* Implements a 15 percent corporate minimum tax - which applies only to the 150 corporations earning over $1 billion in profits that pay less than 15 percent in taxes</p><p>For more information on the Inflation Reduction Act, click here (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/inflation_reduction_act_one_page_summary.pdf\">https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/inflation_reduction_act_one_page_summary.pdf</url>).</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://larsen.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2695\">https://larsen.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2695</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7918554 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7918554</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:664Y-HC41-DYG2-R1FP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"545\"/><timeReceived>9:10 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 13, 2022 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Stender, a husband-and-wife team who have owned their property on Shumont Mountain in rural Buncombe County since 1986.</p><p>Jeannette was a public school teacher for two years, taught physical education for twenty-two years at the O'Quinn's School in Charleston, South Carolina, ran the Episcopal bookstore at the Cathedral of St. Luke at St. Paul for nine years, and founded a daycare at Christ School for taking care of faculty children for seven years.

They live in a very special place called Cabin-Knot near the top of Shumont Mountain in the southeast corner of rural Buncombe County, North Carolina. The sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touch of their homes are special. They almost lost their homes and more, but by the grace of God and the labors of many, they will live to tell many more adventures.</p><p>\"Let's let them tell a little in their own words:</p><p>\"'Our old home has changed,' explained Brooster. 'This morning when I looked down the creek, all of the bushes we used to hide in are gone. The ground is black. There are no berries anywhere for us to eat. I'm afraid we'll have to move to the other side of the mountain.'</p><p>\"'Oh, Brooster,' said Jenny sadly. 'I really don't want to move the kids from our woods, but we must find food!'</p><p>\"'We'll be alright. We still have our family. We'll find another meadow with lots of berries.

Dozens of wildfires are ablaze across the country, including at least eight major ones.</p><p>\"Prepare your papers, the animals you can take with you, some belongings,\" the Gironde municipality of Belin-Beliet said on Facebook before evacuating parts of the town.</p><p>In the nearby village of Hostens, police had earlier been door to door telling residents to leave as the fire advanced. Camille Delay fled with her partner and her son, grabbing their two cats, chickens and house insurance papers.</p><p>\"Everyone in the village climbed onto their rooftops to see what was happening - within ten minutes a little twist of smoke became enormous,\" the 30-year-old told Reuters by telephone.</p><p>Firefighters said more evacuations were likely. Even so, some Hostens residents were reluctant to abandon their homes.</p><p>\"It's complicated to go with the dogs and we cannot leave them here,\" said Allisson Horan, 18, who stayed behind with her father.</p><p>\"I'm getting worried because the fire is in a plot of land behind ours and the wind is starting to change direction.\"</p><p>Numerous small roads and a highway were closed.</p><p>Heatwaves </p><p>More than 57,200 hectares have gone up in flames so far in France this year, nearly six times the full-year average for 2006-2021, data from the <url normalizedValue=\"https://effis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/apps/effis.statistics/estimates\">European Forest Fire Information System</url> shows.</p><p>\"The fire is creating its own wind,\" senior local official Martin Guespereau told reporters, adding that efforts to fight it were made more difficult by how unpredictable it was.</p><p>Sweden and Italy are among countries preparing to send help to France, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said.</p><p>He repeated calls for everyone to be responsible - nine out of 10 fires are either voluntarily or involuntarily caused by people, he said.</p><p>The Gironde wildfire is one of many that have broken out across Europe this summer, triggered by heatwaves that have baked the continent and brought record temperatures.</p><p>In Portugal, nearly 1,200 firefighters backed by eight aircraft have battled a blaze in the mountainous Covilha area some 280 km (174 miles) northeast of Lisbon that has burned more than 3,000 hectares of forest since Saturday.</p><p>Spain and Greece have also had to tackle multiple fires over the past few weeks.</p><p>The Gironde was hit by major wildfires in July which destroyed more than 20,000 hectares of forest and temporarily forced almost 40,000 people from their homes.</p><p>Authorities believe the latest inferno was a result of the previous fires still smoldering in the area's peaty soil.</p><p>Fires were also raging in the southern departments of Lozere and Aveyron. In the Maine et Loire department in western France, more than 1,200 hectares have been scorched by another fire.</p><p>(Reporting by Stephane Mahe in Hostens and Layli Foroudi in Paris; additional reporting by Benoit Van Overstraeten; writing by Richard Lough, Ingrid Melander; editing by Jane Merriman, Alexandra Hudson and Mark Heinrich)</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WLINJN-ij679950</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WLINJN2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:664H-7FB1-JBH5-P4M9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465774</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"590\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2022 Wells Media Group, Inc.

(Division N funds were designated as being for an emergency requirement)./62 The amount is in addition to funds made available by the CR for LIHEAP with reference to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance account in Division H of P.L. 117-328 at a rate of operations of $1.5 billion.</p><p>LIHEAP provides funds via formula to states, tribes, and territories to assist low-income households with their home energy needs, including heating and cooling costs, crisis assistance, weatherization assistance, and services (such as counseling) to reduce the need for energy assistance. For FY2023, regular LIHEAP program operations were funded by a combination of regular annual appropriations provided in Division H and emergency-designated appropriations provided in Division N, both in the same law (P.L. 117-328)./63 That is, the emergency-designated funds provided in Division N were made available for payments under existing LIHEAP program authorities.</p><p>Section 133 - Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and Related Programs/64</p><p>Under Division FF (\"Health and Human Services\"), Section 6102, of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (P.L. 117-328), funding for the TANF block grant, the TANF contingency fund, Healthy Marriage and Responsible Fatherhood Grants, and matching grants for TANF and child welfare activities within the U.S. territories was scheduled to end on September 30, 2023.

The first paragraph of the LIHEAP heading of Division N of P.L. 117-328 provided $1 billion for the program, the Continuing Appropriations and Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act (P.L. 117-180) provided $1 billion, and the IIJA (P.L. 117-58) provided $100 million. The CR does not include the funding provided in the first paragraph of the LIHEAP heading of Title VIII of Division N of P.L. 117-328, nor does it include the funding in P.L.117-180.

Until noon Saturday the fire was kept to the right hand side of the San Diego-El Centro highway. Then it broke bounds, jumped the 90-foot state highway east of the resort hotel in Pine Valley and headed for Laguna junction. threatening for a time to enter the Laguna mountain area.</p><p>The resort hotel, garage and store were saved Saturday after the fire had raged along the lower end of the valley and was advancing toward the settlement, when firefighters rigged up a pump in the swimming tank of the resort. Using 1,500 feet of inch and a half hose they poured more than 2000 gallons of water on the flames and saved the settlement.</p><p>Elliott made reconnaissance trips yesterday over the burning area in an airplane, piloted by George K.

No injures have been reported.</p><p>The fire, 70% contained as of Monday afternoon, is expected to be completely under control later this week - but could consume about 15,000 acres before then, New Jersey Forest Fire Service Chief Greg McLaughlin said at a news briefing Monday afternoon.</p><p>The cause of the fire remains under investigation, but McLaughlin said officials have ruled out natural causes.</p><p>\"The majority of our forest fires are human caused and it's important to recognize that because it places it within our power to avoid circumstances like this,\" said Shawn LaTourette, commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.</p><p>McLaughlin said there was \"really extreme fire intensity\" throughout the day Sunday due to dry conditions and high winds. The fire moved back and forth across the Mullica River. Firefighters were unable to make a direct attack on the fire and instead had to start backfires to burn vegetation around the perimeter.</p><p>\"The fire moved in different directions.

Yet despite the president's apparent commitment to acting on his campaign promise, activists have offered a chilly reception[1] to the proposal. </p><p><br/>For weeks, the White House has indicated that Biden was nearing action on student loan forgiveness and it began to offer contours of a plan that could see up to $10,000 forgiven[2] for eligible borrowers. But if there was hope this plan would assuage critics, it doesn't appear to be having the desired effect. <br/>The administration has come under fire from activists and Democrats alike[3], who have demanded action be taken and criticized what they perceive as Biden dragging his feet on the issue. <br/>Derrick Johnson, the President of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), criticized Biden's proposal as insufficient to addressing the problem of massive student debt. He likened the idea of forgiving only $10,000 on student loans to 'pouring ice water on a forest fire.' <br/>.@POTUS[4], canceling $10,000 in student loan debt is like pouring a bucket of ice water on a forest fire. <br/>Here's why (a thread): \u2014 Derrick Johnson (@DerrickNAACP) May 27, 2022[5] Johnson also zeroed in on the move's insufficiency at helping Black borrowers, who he said bear a heavier student debt burden. He warned that without greater action, there is a risk that up to 37.5% of Black borrowers may end up defaulting on their loans compared to 12% of white borrowers. <br/>\"$10,000 in cancellation would be a slap in the face,\" Johnson said in a statement[6]. \"President Biden, it's not about whether you can do it; it's about whether or not you have the will to do it.\" <br/>Angus Johnston, a historian of student activism at the City University of New York, also blasted Biden's debt cancellation plans, particularly its focus on means testing which he said could exclude many poorer borrowers from forgiveness. <br/>\"The truly ridiculous thing about Biden's means testing plan is that it creates a whole new bureaucratic nightmare for basically no benefit. The cap is set so high that only a tiny number of borrowers would be excluded,\" Johnston wrote on Twitter. <br/>So you put up a bunch of hurdles to poor people getting relief, you slow down and gum up the process, you spend a bunch of government money administrating it, and for what? To get a line in a speech about fiscal prudence that's a lie that doesn't actually shift any votes. \u2014 Angus Johnston (@studentactivism) May 27, 2022[7] <br/>The Debt Collective, an activist group that pushes for student loan forgiveness, has labeled the plan \"inadequate\" for its scale and inclusion of means testing. It also warned that millions of Americans would be left out of the program in its current shape. <br/>If you are lucky. Millions would NEVER get the promised cancellation if this is the shit plan they go with <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co\">https://t.co</url> /i5yNAUxU4E[8] \u2014 The Debt Collective _ (@StrikeDebt) May 27, 2022[9] <br/>The White House has not yet released a final version of its student loan proposal, but some experts assert that $10,000 would be useful in easing the burden of debt payments after almost two years of deferment because of the pandemic. <br/>'Student loan debt has been a huge burden for years,\" Rebecca Safier, a student loan expert at student-loan management site Student Loan Hero, told CNBC[10] in January 2021. \"So any kind of student loan forgiveness that could ease the burden would be helpful for student loan borrowers.\" <br/>Despite his promise to take action on student loans as a candidate, Biden has been seemingly reluctant to push forward. Addressing arguments from his own party that he could unilaterally erase student debts through executive action, Biden has expressed doubts on his ability to do so and has put the onus on Congress to act. <br/>At the same time, Biden has been recalcitrant about wider debt forgiveness because he believes it would disproportionately benefit higher earners or students who attended elite universities. <br/>'The idea that you go to Penn and you're paying a total of 70,000 bucks a year and the public should pay for that? I don't agree,' the president said in an interview [11]with the New York Times. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc\">https://www.cnbc</url> .com/2022/05/27/advocates-slam-bidens-move-to-cancel-10000-in-student-debt.html [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/05/27/biden-student-debt-borrower/\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/05/27/biden-student-debt-borrower/</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ibtimes.com/democrats-press-biden-new-letter-release-memo-outlining-power-forgive-student-debt-3384041\">https://www.ibtimes.com/democrats-press-biden-new-letter-release-memo-outlining-power-forgive-student-debt-3384041</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/POTUS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">https://twitter.com/POTUS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/DerrickNAACP/status/1530205000571437058?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">https://twitter.com/DerrickNAACP/status/1530205000571437058?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/arsheffey/status/1530191238703505410?s=20\">https://twitter.com/arsheffey/status/1530191238703505410?s=20</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/studentactivism/status/1530166432457273348?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">https://twitter.com/studentactivism/status/1530166432457273348?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw</url> [ 8]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/i5yNAUxU4E\">https://t.co/i5yNAUxU4E</url> [ 9]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/StrikeDebt/status/1530199358725038082?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">https://twitter.com/StrikeDebt/status/1530199358725038082?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw</url> [ 10]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/22/experts-weigh-in-on-10000-in-student-debt-forgiveness.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/22/experts-weigh-in-on-10000-in-student-debt-forgiveness.html</url> [ 11]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ibtimes.com/biden-steps-back-student-loan-debt-forgiveness-leading-major-criticism-3205916\">https://www.ibtimes.com/biden-steps-back-student-loan-debt-forgiveness-leading-major-criticism-3205916</url></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

According to news originating from Terengganu, Malaysia, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"The spatial and temporal distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in three sediment cores from Brunei Bay, Southern South China Sea was investigated. The total concentrations of 16 priority PAHs ( PAH) and their alkyl-substituted derivatives ranged from 10.4 to 376 ng g and 30.7 to 2263 ng g, respectively.\"</p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the University of Malaysia Terengganu, \"PAH biomarker diagnostic ratios and principal component analysis (PCA) combined with absolute principal component score (APCS) and multiple linear regression (MLR) were performed to apportion the source contribution. The results revealed mixed inputs of fuel combustion residues and uncombusted petrogenic products. The downcore PAH profile revealed that the highest peaks could be related to past human activities using biofuel and coal during the industrialization/agriculture revolution period.\"<br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The 1,7/(2,6+1,7)-dimethylphenanthrene ratio also highlighted wood combustion during forest fire outbreaks, which appeared to coincide with the past climate events.\"<br/> This research has been peer-reviewed.<br/> For more information on this research see: Spatial and temporal trends of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in sediment cores of Brunei Bay, East Malaysia. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Marine Pollution Bulletin</emphasis>, 2022;179:113670. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Marine Pollution Bulletin</emphasis> can be contacted at: Pergamon-elsevier Science Ltd, The Boulevard, Langford Lane, Kidlington, Oxford OX5 1GB, England.

It was reported Tuesday night, and multiple fire agencies staffed the fire overnight. However, extremely steep terrain and dense brush slowed progress during the night, ODF said.</p><p>Temperatures of about 99 degrees in the area took their toll on at least one firefighter Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>\"We did have a firefighter suffering from a heat-related illness out on the line. We stopped and got medical help,\" ODF Spokeswoman Natalie Weber said Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>The firefighter received medical care at a temporary helicopter base where helicopters fighting the Wards Creek Fire are taking off and landing, she said.</p><p>\"We certainly do what we can to protect our firefighters,\" Weber said, but noted that exposure to heat and smoke is one of the dangers of the job.</p><p>While fighting fires, firefighters aren't covered by Oregon's new laws that went into effect this year to help protect workers from excessive heat and smoke.</p><p>ODF reported no evacuation notices Wednesday due to the fire.</p><p>Weber said Wednesday afternoon that no structures are threatened by the fire so far.</p><p>On the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest, firefighters continued searching for new fires and attacking confirmed starts Wednesday.</p><p>On the High Cascades Ranger District, firefighters contained the Meadow, Maude, Ethel, Outn and Bunchgrass fires and will continue work to contain two additional fires.</p><p>While hiking out of the Sugar Fire, Crew 62 spotted new smoke in the area and was hiking in to attack it. The fires are scattered across a very broad area ranging from near Crater Lake National Park south to near Fish Lake, officials said.</p><p>Wednesday helicopter operations included extracting firefighters from remote fires that have been successfully contained, and returning them to staging for rapid reassignment to new fires, officials said.</p><p>Tuesday night, an aerial detection flight was completed over areas affected by Tuesday's lightning on the Siskiyou Mountain Ranger District, the Gold Beach Ranger District and the Kalmiopsis Wilderness Area. Significant rain accompanied the lightning, which gives firefighters a little extra time to locate and attack any new fires. However, the rain doesn't eliminate the threat of new fires. Sometimes a week or more may go by between the ignition and detection of holdover lightning fires, officials said.</p><p>ODF's Southwest Oregon Detection Center in Central Point is fully staffed and workers were searching for signs of fire and smoke via a system of mountain-top cameras, ODF reported.</p><p>The Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest continued to help with the Clover Fire on the Fremont-Winema National Forest and the Alex Fire on the Klamath National Forest.</p><p>Fire danger is rated as extreme on Forest Service and ODF-protected land in Southern Oregon.</p><p>\"Despite the rain received in some areas, fuels will dry out quickly with the heat and wind,\" the Forest Service said in a press release.</p><p>___ (c)2022 the Mail Tribune (Medford, Ore.)

The annual event, held Tuesday, partners students, largely from grades 3-8, with more than 30 volunteer judges - many of whom are current or former educators, academics and scientists - from the Santa Fe Alliance for Science.</p><p>The result is a room full of experts - some of whom possess numerous advanced degrees, have built storied careers at Los Alamos National Laboratory or Sandia National Laboratories, or fit the \"mad scientist\" archetype. They encourage students to get excited about science, technology, engineering and mathematics, said Santa Fe Alliance for Science President and STEM fair judge Kathy Brechner.</p><p>\"It's really a good opportunity for them for public speaking and presenting themselves to adults because an astrophysicist [to] a third grader can be a very scary thing,\" Brechner said.</p><p>The STEM fair is the culminating event of the district's winter season of science fairs, said Angie Walker, Santa Fe Public Schools' STEM coordinator.</p><p>Student projects examined everything from petri dishes of growing cultures to miniature solar-powered windmills, their findings displayed on colorful trifold poster boards or online presentations.</p><p>One student built an app designed to provide users with tourist information about particular cities.</p><p>Another analyzed how the material of different kinds of water bottles, including plastic, stainless steel and clay, affect the quality of water. A third covered soil from the Hermits Peak/Calf Canyon Fire with different materials to see which limited water runoff and rejuvenated the soil best.</p><p>In addition to teaching academic STEM content, Walker said the projects allowed students to explore their interests and develop skills necessary to complete and present research, including perseverance, self-direction, delegation and teamwork.</p><p>\"When students have the opportunity to do a project that they really feel ownership over, it can really influence their educational mindset,\" she said.</p><p>This year's fair also marked the first time the school district partnered with Santa Fe Community College, which hosted the fair and introduced many students to facilities available on campus, including the planetarium. Walker said she hopes the venue creates another theme for students: A college education, like STEM inquiry, is accessible to them.</p><p>\"They're important, and their educational journey is important,\" she said.</p><p>Judgment time isn't meant to be stressful. The alliance's goal is to offer students from varied backgrounds an opportunity to get creative in producing original projects, said Bill Earl, who helped organize judges.</p><p>Judges are encouraged to point out things they liked and things students might consider changing in their experiments, Brechner added.</p><p>Micaelah Balladares and Sami Gonzales, seventh graders at El Dorado Community School, presented their project - an experiment designed to test if sunlight improves memory - to judge John Dressman, a former educator and longtime science enthusiast.</p><p>The two young scientists asked two research subjects - their mothers - to remember random questions, like, \"What's your second favorite color?\" or \"If you could travel anywhere in the world, where would you go?\" after a 10-minute break. Then the girls graded their subjects' responses on a scale from 1, meaning they completely forgot, to 5, meaning they recalled the precise wording of the question. They repeated the process every day, morning and night, for 10 days.</p><p>Dressman applauded Micaelah and Sami's use of controlled environments and memory tests and encouraged the girls to imagine the applicability of their project on workplace design: Would workers be more capable or productive in offices with sunlight access?</p><p>He also suggested a few potential improvements. Their grading system could become more objective, Dressman said, perhaps dependent on the number of words the subjects placed correctly when recalling the questions.</p><p>And they'd need a larger group of test subjects to add to the validity of their experiment, he said, a task that can be a challenge even for professional social scientists.</p><p>The top three projects in each grade level were awarded trophies and gift cards.</p><p>But handing out prizes isn't the main reason the alliance and its team of judges come back each year, Brechner said.</p><p>\"Our goal is really to get them excited about science,\" she said of students. \"...

(AP) \u2014 The ongoing bird flu outbreak has cost the government roughly $661 million and added to consumers' pain at the grocery store after more than 58 million birds were <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-business-bird-flu-flu-animals-189a7c08d848047f00b3f7b5bec39e67\">slaughtered</url> to limit the spread of the virus.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In addition to the cost of the government response that the USDA tallied up and rising prices for eggs, chicken and turkey, farmers who raise those animals have easily lost more than $1 billion, said an agricultural economist, though no one has calculated the total cost to the industry yet.</p><p>The bad news is that with the outbreak entering its second year and the spring migratory season looming, there is no end in sight. And there is little <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-health-environment-and-nature-iowa-agriculture-9245d97453568576bd0b564f9c52c343\">farmers</url> can do beyond <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/science-health-business-iowa-agriculture-f5a5c6fbf1d6b551413fb249086fdbec\">the steps they have already taken</url> to try to keep the virus out.</p><p>Unlike past years, <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-flu-prices-animals-1ec0f5a8e5485300fe117f87f8470f06\">the virus that causes</url> highly pathogenic avian influenza found a way to survive through the heat of last summer, leading to a <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-minnesota-animals-flu-animal-2f02b2d35e82feb05273d9a72e898170\">rise in cases</url> reported in the fall.</p><p>The outbreak is already more widespread than the last major bird flu outbreak in 2015, but it hasn't proven as costly yet partly because the government and industry applied lessons learned eight years ago.</p><p>\u201cThe past year has been devastating for the turkey industry as we experience, unequivocally, the worst HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) outbreak in the industry\u2019s history,\u201d National Turkey Federation spokeswoman Shelby Newman said.</p><p>In the current outbreak, 58.4 million birds have been slaughtered on more than 300 commercial farms in 47 states. That is because any time the virus is detected, the entire flock on that farm \u2014 which can number in the millions \u2014 must be killed to limit the spread of the disease. Only Hawaii, Louisiana and West Virginia have yet to report a case of bird flu. Iowa \u2014 the nation's biggest egg producer \u2014 <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-business-iowa-bird-flu-4c49e56a8c84c425c308e97617e31066\">leads the nation</url> with nearly 16 million birds slaughtered.</p><p>In 2015, about 50 million chickens and turkeys were slaughtered on more than 200 farms in 15 states.</p><p>That previous outbreak remains the most expensive animal health disaster in U.S. history. The federal government spent nearly $1 billion to deal with infected birds, clean up barns and compensate farmers. It cost the industry roughly $3 billion as farmers incurred additional costs and lost money when they didn\u2019t have any birds on their farms.</p><p>This bills continue to pile up this year as cases spread, and that includes the cost to consumers.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-business-213d845ae92814bf3189eec9c1ccf902\">Egg prices shot up</url> to $4.82 a dozen in January from $1.93 a year earlier, according to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://ag.purdue.edu/cfdas/resource-library/average-food-prices/\">latest government figures</url>. That spike prompted calls for a <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/inflation-commodity-markets-jack-reed-business-1b32cb587f20a8d44eaf707f72635e70\">price-gouging investigation</url> although the industry maintains that the combination of bird flu and significantly higher feed, fuel and labor costs is what\u2019s driving prices so high.</p><p>The price for a pound of chicken breast was $4.32 in January. That\u2019s down slightly from last fall when the price peaked at $4.75, but it is up significantly from the year before when chicken breasts were selling for $3.73 per pound.</p><p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn\u2019t track retail turkey prices the same way as part of its inflation data, but the Agriculture Department says the wholesale price of turkey went from $1.29 per pound last January just before the bird flu outbreak began to $1.72 per pound last month.</p><p>The number of birds slaughtered peaked last spring at almost 21 million in March, leaving farmers leery of what they must face in the months ahead. University of Georgia virus researcher David Stallknecht said there is some hope that this spring might not be quite as bad because turkeys and chickens may have developed some immunity to the virus.</p><p>The key problem with bird flu is that the highly contagious virus is spread easily by <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-business-minnesota-environment-0ec6d3f11b09ddd023d7d5d50ab7f8c1\">wild birds</url> through their droppings and nasal discharges. Despite the best efforts of farmers, it is hard to keep the virus out.</p><p>Farmers have gone to great lengths by requiring workers to shower and change clothes before entering barns, sanitizing trucks that enter a farm and investing in separate sets of tools for every barn. Some farms have even upgraded barn ventilation and installed laser systems to discourage wild birds from congregating.</p><p>\u201cWe recommend all producers redouble their efforts to protect their birds through good biosecurity practices,\u201d said Lyndsay Cole, a spokeswoman for the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service that's leading the government's response.</p><p>Farmers began following those steps after the 2015 outbreak, and this outbreak has only reinforced the need to tighten biosecurity.</p><p>\u201cAmerica\u2019s egg farmers continue to double-down on biosecurity protocols to protect our flocks and maintain a stable egg supply. We are grateful that there has been little to no farm-to-farm spread in this current outbreak,\u201d said Oscar Garrison, senior vice president of food safety and regulatory affairs at the United Egg Producers trade group.</p><p>Poultry and egg producers, partnering with the government, are parsing this outbreak for new lessons in keeping birds healthy.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really the key \u2013 early detection. It\u2019s kind of like a forest fire - the earlier you detect it, the easier it is to contain and eradicate,\u201d National Chicken Council spokesman Tom Super said.</p><p>Officials say bird flu doesn\u2019t represent a significant threat to human health. Human cases are extremely rare and none of the infected birds are allowed into the nation\u2019s food supply. And properly cooking poultry to 165 degrees Fahrenheit will kill any viruses.</p><p>There has only been <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-health-environment-colorado-b98906e0a1899bb1f92da30a7b1dbe28\">one human case</url> of bird flu confirmed during this outbreak and that was a man who had been helping slaughter and remove infected birds from a Colorado farm. He recovered from the illness after a few days.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-2c9ca4b3d04f3c0269a1fee233daa3a620230219</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67KG-HGF1-JC5B-G392-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304479</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-02-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"938\"/><timeReceived>5:03 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

Philmont Scout Ranch is BSA Scouts&amp;amp;#8217; premier high adventure camp and the largest youth camp in the world serving nearly one million participants since 1938. The Scout Ranch covers 214 square miles of vast wilderness with trails that climb from 6,500 feet to as high as 12,441 feet. During their trek, the crew from BSA Scouts Troop 209 hiked 70.5 miles over 12 days. The group of Scouts and their advisors carried everything they needed to survive during the trek on their backs while hiking from camp to camp. They participated in backcountry programs along the way including historic homesteading, making railroad ties, forest fire education, western shooting, forest ecology, western lore and spar pole climbing. The trek included a conservation project where the Scouts learned and participated in the upkeep of Philmont&amp;amp;#8217;s ecosystem. Along the trek, Scouts endured tough challenges including backpacking in bear and mountain lion territory, steep climbs, and often-inclement weather. The pinnacle of this inspiring experience was a climb to the summit of Baldy Mountain, the highest peak in the Cimarron Range at an elevation of 12,441 feet.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Back row, left to right: Daniel Narey, Mitch Picchiotti, Tom Narey, Michael Hansen, William Plizga, Jim Szczupaj Front row: Luke Litchfield, Evan Castro-Sarno, Tony Pluta, Philmont staffer, Nathan Szczupaj, John Glass, Jack Conneely Philmont Staff</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHDLY-0001319342</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHDLY2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:641P-3VB1-DY6F-J3M7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163823</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"221\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Paddock Publications, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Daily Herald</publicationName><edition>WEB EditioneBlast Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 6, 2021 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>SCOUT ASSOCIATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CEAJ</classCode><className>HIKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DBBS</classCode><className>BACKPACKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001191</classCode><className>CLIMBING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009FY2</classCode><className>ECOLOGY &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CFNH</classCode><className>MOUNTAIN CLIMBING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001838</classCode><className>WILDERNESS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001871</classCode><className>YOUTH CLUBS &amp; ACTIVITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009OG7</classCode><className>MAMMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX000264</classCode><className>WILD CATS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GX559</classCode><className>CHICAGO, IL, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS147</classCode><className>NEW MEXICO, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000A3D7</classCode><className>ROCKY MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The nation sweltered, setting records for temperature, duration, and drought that stand unchallenged today even with the help of fearmongering greens and their inaccurate climate model machines. <br/> That's a problem for Marxists hoping to scare you into accepting a planned economy[1] via an expanded regulatory state; based on the lie that you are responsible for the weather. <br/> Related: US Forest Fire Data Tampering - They Dissapeared 57-Years of Inconvenient Truth[2]. <br/> Especially when the weather doesn't cooperate, and maybe you are a lost cause. But they can mold future generations into the proper mindset, so WRBA has had the Environmental Protection agency erase the American Dust Bowl Era[3]. <br/><br/> That long-standing heat wave index chart has now been replaced by a new chart which simply'disappears'any notion of the great heat wave period of the 1930s. The EPA erased the previous data, substituting data more favorable to an alarmist narrative, as Figure 2 below shows. <br/><br/> Here's the change graphed (also available here[4]). <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://granitegrok.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Before-After-EPA-Dust-Bowl-vanished.png\">https://granitegrok.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Before-After-EPA-Dust-Bowl-vanished.png</url><br/><br/> The EPA has reduced it to a much more convenient bump. Yeah, it was warm, but not like today. <br/> No, not at all like today. And there are dozens of books and at least a few movies on what it was like, so I have to ask. When can we expect WRBA's Winston Smiths to erase those and possibly their creators along with them to ensure the lie has legs? <br/> Don't laugh. The political rule they seek cannot last absent that sort of police state politics. Disappearing people becomes as easy as an agency tweaking data to justify an exercise of state power. <br/> And no, being black, or gay, or the right sort of feminist will not protect you from them. <br/> That's what we've been trying to tell you all these years. <br/> The post Biden's EPA 'Erases' the 1930s 'cuz 'Climate Change'[5] appeared first on Granite Grok[6]. <br/> [ 1]: <url

And there is little farmers can do beyond the steps they have already taken to try to keep the virus out.               </p><p>Unlike past years, the virus that causes highly pathogenic avian influenza found a way to survive through the heat of last summer, leading to a rise in cases reported in the fall.               </p><p>The outbreak is already more widespread than the last major bird flu outbreak in 2015, but it hasn't proven as costly yet partly because the government and industry applied lessons learned eight years ago.               </p><p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The past year has been devastating for the turkey industry as we experience, unequivocally, the worst HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) outbreak in the industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history,\u00e2\u20ac National Turkey Federation spokeswoman Shelby Newman said.               </p><p>In the current outbreak, 58.4 million birds have been slaughtered on more than 300 commercial farms in 47 states. That is because any time the virus is detected, the entire flock on that farm \u00e2\u20ac\u201d which can number in the millions \u00e2\u20ac\u201d must be killed to limit the spread of the disease. Only Hawaii, Louisiana and West Virginia have yet to report a case of bird flu. Iowa \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the nation's biggest egg producer \u00e2\u20ac\u201d leads the nation with nearly 16 million birds slaughtered.               </p><p>In 2015, about 50 million chickens and turkeys were slaughtered on more than 200 farms in 15 states.               </p><p>That previous outbreak remains the most expensive animal health disaster in U.S. history. The federal government spent nearly $1 billion to deal with infected birds, clean up barns and compensate farmers. It cost the industry roughly $3 billion as farmers incurred additional costs and lost money when they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any birds on their farms.               </p><p>This bills continue to pile up this year as cases spread, and that includes the cost to consumers.               </p><p>                 Egg prices shot up to $4.82 a dozen in January from $1.93 a year earlier, according to the latest government figures. That spike prompted calls for a price-gouging investigation although the industry maintains that the combination of bird flu and significantly higher feed, fuel and labor costs is what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s driving prices so high.               </p><p>The price for a pound of chicken breast was $4.32 in January. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down slightly from last fall when the price peaked at $4.75, but it is up significantly from the year before when chicken breasts were selling for $3.73 per pound.               </p><p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t track retail turkey prices the same way as part of its inflation data, but the Agriculture Department says the wholesale price of turkey went from $1.29 per pound last January just before the bird flu outbreak began to $1.72 per pound last month.               </p><p>The number of birds slaughtered peaked last spring at almost 21 million in March, leaving farmers leery of what they must face in the months ahead. University of Georgia virus researcher David Stallknecht said there is some hope that this spring might not be quite as bad because turkeys and chickens may have developed some immunity to the virus.               </p><p>The key problem with bird flu is that the highly contagious virus is spread easily by wild birds through their droppings and nasal discharges. Despite the best efforts of farmers, it is hard to keep the virus out.               </p><p>Farmers have gone to great lengths by requiring workers to shower and change clothes before entering barns, sanitizing trucks that enter a farm and investing in separate sets of tools for every barn. Some farms have even upgraded barn ventilation and installed laser systems to discourage wild birds from congregating.               </p><p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We recommend all producers redouble their efforts to protect their birds through good biosecurity practices,\u00e2\u20ac said Lyndsay Cole, a spokeswoman for the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service that's leading the government's response.               </p><p>Farmers began following those steps after the 2015 outbreak, and this outbreak has only reinforced the need to tighten biosecurity.               </p><p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s egg farmers continue to double-down on biosecurity protocols to protect our flocks and maintain a stable egg supply. We are grateful that there has been little to no farm-to-farm spread in this current outbreak,\u00e2\u20ac said Oscar Garrison, senior vice president of food safety and regulatory affairs at the United Egg Producers trade group.               </p><p>Poultry and egg producers, partnering with the government, are parsing this outbreak for new lessons in keeping birds healthy.               </p><p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really the key \u00e2\u20ac\u201c early detection. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s kind of like a forest fire - the earlier you detect it, the easier it is to contain and eradicate,\u00e2\u20ac National Chicken Council spokesman Tom Super said.               </p><p>Officials say bird flu doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t represent a significant threat to human health. Human cases are extremely rare and none of the infected birds are allowed into the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s food supply. And properly cooking poultry to 165 degrees Fahrenheit will kill any viruses.               </p><p>There has only been one human case of bird flu confirmed during this outbreak and that was a man who had been helping slaughter and remove infected birds from a Colorado farm. He recovered from the illness after a few days. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNWS-m5588178</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67K8-HJH1-DXK2-M4Y7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">439934</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"999\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 American Banking and Market News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>American Banking and Market News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"02\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>February 18, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>Tax Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>Corporations Engaged in Farming</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0I4QkEzOTVFOEMwNDBCMThDRDgyMkM5MzAzQUQ0RDg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjU1QUYzRTdGNkU2NDkwMkE4MjM2MzI1Q0MwNDM1Njg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>STX000914</classCode><className>INFLUENZA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST0009FJL</classCode><className>AVIAN INFLUENZA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000044</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL PRICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CFER</classCode><className>ANIMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002059</classCode><className>DISEASE REPORTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00097WX</classCode><className>FOOD PRICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DIJW</classCode><className>PRICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DMKX</classCode><className>BUSINESS REPORTS &amp;

They got higher prices and lower real wages. Inflation began to rise to the fastest level in 40 years the month after Democrats passed the $2 trillion bill. Inflation was 1.7 percent in February of 2021 - the month before passage of this boondoggle.</p><p>\"The economy shrank 1.5 percent in the first quarter of 2022, 4.4 percentage points lower than where the Congressional Budget Office said it should be prior to passage of this boondoggle. The labor force participation rate is still below pre-COVID levels. The deficit in 2021 was $517 billion higher than the Congressional Budget Office said it would have been before passage of this boondoggle. At $2.78 trillion deficit, it was the second highest deficit in the history of this nation. Interest Rates are rising faster than seen in 30 years.\"</p><p>During his opening remarks, House Budget Committee Republican Leader Smith presented the committee with examples of the ridiculous waste that has been perpetrated under the American Rescue Plan - including:</p><p>*$1,400 checks to Japanese citizens living in Japan</p><p>*$783 million worth of stimulus checks to prisoners</p><p>*$4 million for a bird sanctuary</p><p>*$7 million to social media influences to promote seafood</p><p>*$140 million for a luxury hotel development in Florida</p><p>*$20 million to modernize fish hatcheries in Maine</p><p>*$2 million to plant trees in New York</p><p>*$4 million for beach bathrooms and parking lots in South Carolina</p><p>And the list goes on. Go to: or on the image below to hear Smith expose additional examples of abuse and misuse of taxpayer dollars under the American Rescue Plan.</p><p>Republican witness Stephen Moore, Chair of the Save America Coalition at the America First Policy Institute and Distinguished Fellow in Economics at the Heritage Foundation, confirmed that the American Rescue Plan was the match that lit the current \"forest fire\" of inflation.</p><p>Given record inflation, the second highest deficit in American history, and the decline in real wages, Smith asked Mr. Moore about the American Rescue Plan's effect on the economy. Mr. Moore confirmed the real stimulus for the economy in 2021 was President Trump's Operation Warp Speed and the vaccine it produced in record time, allowing businesses to reopen and Americans to go back to work.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CODUPB-COH1P806142022</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65PC-2HK1-DYVR-P1X4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"475\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"06\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>June 14, 2022</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Dominion has been pursuing a $1.6 billion lawsuit[2] against Fox, which is readying for a trial date in April. The network's evidence of Bartiromo's state of mind goes to the legal standard of actual malice, which would force Dominion to prove that Bartiromo either knowingly lied or acted with reckless disregard for the truth in airing 2020 election conspiracy theories. <br/>To make that argument, Fox has unearthed Bartiromo's communications with Fratto, a partner at the heavyweight PR shop Hamilton Place Strategies. The network's multi-pronged argument is that Bartiromo had been on the fence about Trump's theories, invited Dominion on the air to tell its side, and pushed back on conspiracy theory peddler Sidney Powell after being pressed. <br/>In a series of emails attached as exhibits to their latest brief, Fox unveiled Bartiromo's emails with Fratto, who appeared at one point to praise the host's pushback. <br/>'I saw the interview snd [sic] i know that everyone who questions Powell is being attacked - I hope it's not too crazy,' Fratto wrote on Nov. 20, 2020. 'I truly don't understand why she believes this Venezuela connection. It's just not at all true snd [sic] never has been. It's so weird.' <br/>A day later, Bartiromo offered to put Dominion's CEO on the air. Fratto gave an exasperated reply about Powell's conspiracy theories. <br/>'Do you want me to have dominion ceo on?' Bartiromo wrote, noting that Powell was 'pushing on this.' <br/>Less than a half-hour later, Fratto fired off a response. <br/>'The only relevant evidence is that the machines worked, again, everywhere they're being used,' Fratto wrote on Nov. 21, 2020, before turning to Powell. 'This woman is harassing employees and they're getting death threats. That's why they're protecting they're [sic] LinkedIn accounts.' <br/>'This is madness,' Fratto added. <br/>Related Coverage: <br/>Less than a week after the email exchange, Dominion started publicly disclosing the death threats[3] against its employees. Dominion employees described threats on their lives in litigation[4]. <br/>The emails also suggest that Bartiromo and Fratto have a long journalist-source history. Roughly a week before this exchange, Fratto expressed his admiration for Bartiromo, whose storied career in broadcast dates back decades to her time as an executive producer at CNN Business. Bartiromo broke boundaries as a female journalist in a typically male-dominated field of financial journalism at CNBC, the network she called home from 1993 to 2013, when she moved to Fox Business. <br/>During the Trump era, many criticized Bartiromo's 'softball[5]' interviews of the former president and seeming embrace of his conspiracy theories. <br/>Fratto told Bartiromo that Powell's theories were beneath a journalist of her caliber. <br/>'Maria - you know how much I admire you, personally and professionally,' Fratto wrote on Nov. 16, 2020. 'More than admire - you are my friend and I'm not questioning your ethics or judgement. What Rudy is saying is verifiably false, and the same for Sidney Powell \u2014 it's tinfoil hat conspiracy stuff. And I think they need strong pushback with facts. I'm not saying you should ignore the story, but Rudy is literally making things up as he goes.' <br/>Bartiromo noted that certain Democrats complained about Dominion software in the past. <br/>Fratto said that the bipartisan criticism proved his point. <br/>'This company is NOT owned by or a tool of 'radical leftists' \u2014 if they were, the radical leftists wouldn't have come after them last time,' he said. <br/>On Tuesday morning, Delaware Superior Judge Eric M. Davis prepared for the trial, currently slated[6] for April 17, 2023. He said that he wouldn't sequester the jury, but he would seek to limit their access to outside information about the case. The court is sending out 1,800 jury notices, accompanied by a letter informing them that the trial is expected to last six weeks. <br/>The judge made clear, however, that he isn't interested in potential jurors' politics. <br/>'The issue in this case is whether Fox News or Fox Corp defamed Dominion,' he said. <br/> Sign up for the Law&amp;Crime Daily Newsletter for more breaking news and updates[7] <br/>Judge Davis scheduled a separate hearing for arguments on summary judgment motions on March 21. During that hearing, Dominion will argue that the evidence is so strong that a trial wouldn't be necessary for them to prevail. Fox will argue that they are so weak that they shouldn't make it to trial. <br/>The post 'I'm not sure what to think': Fox uses Maria Bartiromo's persistent doubts about election as defense in

According to news reporting from Harbin, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Open biomass burning (OBB) is one of the major factors that influences the regional climate environment and surface vegetation landscape, and it significantly affects the regional carbon cycle process and atmospheric environment. The Amur-Heilong River Basin (ARB) is a fire-prone region in high-latitude boreal forests.\" </p><p><br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Harbin Normal University: \"In this study, we used fire radiative power (FRP) obtained from a Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to estimate OBB emissions from the ARB and established a long-term series (2003-2020) with a high spatiotemporal resolution and a daily 1 km emissions inventory. The results show that the annual average emissions of CO [ [2] ] , CO, CH [ [4] ] , NMHCs, NOx, NH [ [3] ] , SO [ [2] ] , BC, OC, PM [ [2.5] ] , and PM [ [10] ] were estimated to be 153.57, 6.16, 0.21, 0.78, 0.28, 0.08, 0.06, 0.04, 0.39, 0.66, and 0.85 Tg/a, respectively. Taking CO [ [2] ] as an example, grassland fire in the dry season (mainly in April and October) was the largest contributor (87.18 Tg/a), accounting for 56.77% of the total CO [ [2] ] emissions from the ARB, followed by forest fire prone to occur in April-May (56.53 Tg/a, 36.81%) and crop fire during harvest season (9.86 Tg/a, 6.42%). Among the three countries in the ARB, Russia released the most total CO [ [2] ] emissions (2227.04 Tg), much higher than those of China (338.41 Tg) and Mongolia (198.83 Tg). The major fire types were crop fires (40.73%) on the Chinese side and grass fires on the Russian (56.67%) and Mongolian (97.56%) sides. Over the past decade, OBB CO [ [2] ] emissions have trended downward (-0.79 Tg/a) but crop burning has increased significantly (+0.81 Tg/a). Up to 83.7% of crop fires occurred in China (2010-2020), with a concentrated and southward trend. Comparisons with the Global Fire Emission Dataset (GFED4.1s), the Fire INventory from NCAR (FINNv2.2), and the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFASv1.2) showed that our newly established emission inventory was in good agreement with these three datasets in the ARB.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"However, this multi-year, daily 1 km high-resolution emission inventory has the advantages of detecting more small fire emissions that were overlooked by coarse-grid datasets. The methods described here can be used as an effective means of estimating greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions from biomass combustion.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: High-Resolution Daily Emission Inventory of Biomass Burning in the Amur-Heilong River Basin Based on MODIS Fire Radiative Energy Data.

According to news reporting out of Amritsar, India, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Forest fires are a significant threat to the ecological system's stability. Several attempts have been made to detect forest fires using a variety of approaches, including optical fire sensors, and satellite-based technologies, all of which have been unsuccessful. In today's world, research on flying ad hoc networks (FANETs) is a thriving field and can be used successfully.\" </p><p><br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Guru Nanak Dev University: \"This paper describes a unique clustering approach that identifies the presence of a fire zone in a forest and transfers all sensed data to a base station as soon as feasible via wireless communication. The fire department takes the required steps to prevent the spread of the fire. It is proposed in this study that an efficient clustering approach be used to deal with routing and energy challenges to extend the lifetime of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in case of forest fires. Due to the restricted energy and high mobility, this directly impacts the flying duration and routing of FANET nodes. As a result, it is vital to enhance the lifetime of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to maintain high system availability. Our proposed algorithm EE-SS regulates the energy usage of nodes while taking into account the features of a disaster region and other factors. For firefighting, sensor nodes are placed throughout the forest zone to collect essential data points for identifying forest fires and dividing them into distinct clusters. All of the sensor nodes in the cluster communicate their packets to the base station continually through the cluster head. When FANET nodes communicate with one another, their transmission range is constantly adjusted to meet their operating requirements. This paper examines the existing clustering techniques for forest fire detection approaches restricted to wireless sensor networks and their limitations. Our newly designed algorithm chooses the most optimum cluster heads (CHs) based on their fitness, reducing the routing overhead and increasing the system's efficiency. Our proposed method results from simulations are compared with the existing approaches such as LEACH, LEACH-C, PSO-HAS, and SEED.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The evaluation is carried out concerning overall energy usage, residual energy, the count of live nodes, the network lifetime, and the time it takes to build a cluster compared to other approaches. As a result, our proposed EE-SS algorithm outperforms all the considered state-of-art algorithms.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Wildfire Monitoring Based on Energy Efficient Clustering Approach for FANETS.

After creating one of modern TV's most iconic characters in \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" Sarah Michelle Gellar returns to the supernatural genre with Paramount+'s \"Wolf Pack\" (streaming weekly on Thursdays), a new werewolf drama from \"Teen Wolf\" creator Jeff Davis.  When we meet Gellar's character, arson specialist Kristin Ramsey, she's interrogating a group of high schoolers about their possible connection to a massive forest fire. Kristin only appears in a few minutes of the series' first two episodes but plays a crucial role in the story as the season goes on.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It's definitely a slow build,\" Gellar says. \"I liken it to 'The Sixth Sense,' how you have to watch the whole movie, get to the end, and then go back and realize, 'Oh, I didn't see this, this and this.' There's bread crumbs throughout the beginning episodes where you might see less of me, and you have to sort of put it together to really understand why I'm there.\"</p><p>Gellar, 45, an executive producer on \"Wolf Pack,\" tells us more about the show, \"Buffy\" and the viral resurgence of \"Scooby-Doo.\" (Edited and condensed for clarity.)</p><p>Question: You've said that initially, you had no intention of saying yes to \"Wolf Pack.\" After \"Buffy,\" were you offered a lot of supernatural films and TV series?</p><p>Answer: Absolutely. Supernatural and thriller (projects) still offer the most exciting roles for women: You get to be vulnerable, and you get to fight. But when you have a show like \"Buffy\" it's very hard because inevitably you're going to face comparisons. One of the beauties about \"Buffy\" was that the monsters were metaphors for the horrors of adolescence. And this (show) was really the first time someone came to me again using the monsters as metaphors for what we face now: anxiety, loneliness and the idea of finding your pack.</p><p>Did you pay homage to Buffy with Kristin?</p><p>Buffy was always known for her boots, and Kristin Ramsey also has a boot situation going on. That's the biggest nod, but they're different boots: Buffy always wore knee-high boots, and Kristen wears more combat (style).</p><p>Rodrigo Santoro (\"Westworld\") plays a father who goes missing during the wildfire. As the adults on set, did you two  ever flip into \"mom and dad\" mode with your younger co-stars?</p><p>Yes, although I don't know if it's so much \"mom and dad\" as mentor. When I was growing up, I didn't have someone on set really looking out. And I said to the kids very early on, \"I'm here. Please come to me and have that open line of communication.\" So it's been great, even from (things like) changing the food on set, which I did. The food was a little rough for actors who are in bikinis throughout the entire season. Not myself - Rodrigo and I said we knew we made it when we were the only people in the scene not in bikinis.</p><p>You said last month that you worked on \"an extremely toxic male set\" earlier in your career. As an executive producer on \"Wolf Pack,\" were there ways you tried to create a safer, more collaborative environment?</p><p>To be clear, I had multiple experiences: some extremely known and some may be less known. It really was very prevalent, and I wasn't just referencing one job - for goodness sake, I worked with James Toback (a director accused of sexual misconduct since 2017 by hundreds of women).</p><p>But the most important (thing) is to hear how (cast and crew members are)  feeling. It doesn't mean you can change everything. Feelings aren't fact, but they have to be understood.</p><p>You introduced your kids (ages 13 and 10) to \"Buffy\" during quarantine. Did you make it through all seven seasons?</p><p>They watched 1 through 5. We  jumped around on 6 and then we got to the second half of 7. My daughter is a true teenager. Buffy and Angel (David Boreanaz) is all she wanted to see. And my son just wanted fight sequences.</p><p>You and your husband, Freddie Prinze Jr., starred in two live-action \"Scooby-Doo\" movies, which are having a moment online. Have you noticed people are nostalgic for them?</p><p>I have, and I needed time. It wasn't the movie that we set out to make. Initially, we were going to make this PG-13, irreverent statement on \"Scooby-Doo\" where Shaggy was the stoner we all knew he was and Fred was sleeping with everyone. Then all of a sudden, it became this very PG movie, (and) it's really hard to start something and see it change into something else. But now with distance, I love it. It makes me laugh and I'm proud of it.</p><p>I always say I'm so lucky because I have multiple characters that people dress up as for Halloween. To me, that's the marker. It's not an award, it's not viewers, it's not magazine covers - it's that on Halloween, I'll get sent (photos of) multiple people dressing as characters I've played.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Sarah Michelle Gellar returns to the supernatural genre with Paramount+'s \"Wolf Pack.\"</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Robert Hanashiro/USA TODAY</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Gellar stars as Kristin Ramsy in \"Wolf Pack\" on Paramount+.

According to news reporting out of Thessaloniki, Greece, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Our study was conducted in the suburban forest of Thessaloniki (Seich Sou), which constitutes one of the most significant suburban forests of Greece and is located northeast of Thessaloniki.\"</p><p><br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki: \"In 1997, more than the half of the forest area was destroyed by a wildfire, while recently (May 2019), a significant insect outbreak by the bark beetle * * Tomicus piniperda* * was detected. The insect action still goes on, while the infestation has destroyed so far more than 300 ha of forest area. Extensive selective logging and removal of infected trees from the forest were carried out in order to mitigate and restrict the outbreak spread. In the current study, silt-fenced erosion plots were installed on representative locations of disturbed (by fire and insect action) and undisturbed areas, in order to quantify the effect of the above-mentioned forest disturbances on soil erosion and correlate the height and intensity of precipitation with the soil erosion rate. The results show that there was no statistically significant increase in soil erosion in the areas of insect outbreak compared with the control plots. However, there was a statistically significant increase in soil erosion in areas where logging works had been applied as an infestation preventive measure.\"<br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"In addition, the study revealed that 25 years after the forest fire, the erosion rate is still at higher level compared with the undisturbed forest areas. This study could be considered as one of the first attempts to evaluate the impact of an insect outbreak infestation on soil erosion, while there is also a great lack of information concerning the assessment of long-term post-fire effects on the soil erosion of a forest ecosystem.\"<br/> For more information on this research see: Insect Outbreak and Long-Term Post-Fire Effects on Soil Erosion in Mediterranean Suburban Forest. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Land</emphasis>, 2022,11(911):911.

It's a concept that the team at the residential rehab program United Recovery Project (URP) is well aware of. Over 95% of URP's incredible staff are in recovery themselves. Even company co-founder and current CEO Bryan Alzate has over 14 years in recovery and is no stranger to the dangers of depression that many addicts face.</p><p>\"My job is to spark flames,\" says Alzate, \"When an addict thinks they've lost hope and they can't go on, our goal at URP is to reignite hope. We want to create Little Sparks all over the world and help fan them into flames. We want to give addicts a new sense of hope that the battle is worth it. That there are things in this world worth fighting for, no matter how bleak it may seem in the moment.\"</p><p>Alzate has applied this mindset throughout URP's activities. Along with a suite of rehab services, the entrepreneur also hosts the popular podcastHELL HAS AN EXIT\u2014 which is in the top 1.5% of the most popular podcasts in the world.</p><p>In response to ongoing growth, URP has also recently moved to an all-in-one campus after acquiring fellow rehab center Genesis House. The gorgeous compound is situated on three acres of land covered in trees, greenery, and amenities, including a large pool and volleyball and basketball courts.</p><p>\"The opioid epidemic is one of the greatest crises of our time,\" says Alzate, \"We're trying to do our part in providing real, life-changing hope to those who think they've lost everything. We're not trying to put out a forest fire here. We're focused on starting our own fires, one spark at a time.\" It's a message that is resonating with countless addicts and their families across the nation, even during one of the darkest times in the history of America's ongoing struggle with drug addiction.</p><p>About United Recovery Project: URP was founded in 2016 in Hollywood, Florida. The addiction treatment program prides itself on offering an all-inclusive selection of programs that can be tailored to each client's needs. URP is in the process of expanding to other states, as well \u2014 including new facilities in Laguna Hills, CA \u2014 where it hopes to offer ongoing substance abuse help to those who need it as well as their loved ones.

Every branch and every leaf, every inch of trunk and every tendril of unseen root contains carbon pulled from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. And as long as it stays stored away inside that forest, it's not contributing to the rising concentrations of carbon dioxide that cause climate change. So it's only natural that we might want to use forests' carbon-storage superpower as a potential climate solution in addition to reducing human greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But climate change itself might compromise how permanently forests are able to store carbon and keep it out of the air, according to a new paper by researchers at University of Utah and UCSanta Barbara. The study considered how different regions and tree species will respond to climate change. The authors found a wide range of estimates for the amount of carbon that forests in different regions might gain or lose as the climate warms. Importantly, the researchers found that regions most at risk of losing forest carbon through fire, climate stress or insect damage are precisely those regions where many forest carbon offset projects have been set up.</p><p>\"Forest health and carbon-storage potential is evolving rapidly due to climate change,\" said co-author Anna Trugman, an assistant professor at UCSanta Barbara. \"The balance of increasing productivity from higher CO2 levels and accelerating losses from disturbances will determine the fate of forests as a carbon sink.\"</p><p>But the models also revealed significant risks of losing carbon from forests through the triple threat of fire, climate stress and insect damage. Without these stresses, forests might be able to pack away 9.4 petagrams of carbon nationwide by the end of the 21st century. A petagram is equal to a quadrillion grams about 25 times the mass of all humans on Earth. However, with these risks, the models projected a net gain in forests of between 3 and 5 petagrams.</p><p>The study appears in Nature Geoscience. The authors also created an interactive tool showing aboveground, live carbon storage potential in forests across the contiguous United States by the end of the century.</p><p>\"This tells us there's a really urgent need to update these carbon offsets protocols and policies with the best available science of climate risks to U.S. forests,\" said University of Utah's William Anderegg, the study's senior author.</p><p>A multi-perspective modeling approach</p><p>The researchers hoped to forecast changes in the amount of aboveground carbon storage in forests of different regions in the U.S. Aboveground carbon refers to any living parts of a tree that are above ground, including wood and leaves or needles.</p><p>Scientists can look at the future of forests under climate change in a few different ways. They can consider historical and future projections of the climate, or examine datasets from long-term forest plots. They can also use machine learning to identify which climate niches different tree species most prefer. Or they can use complex models that include interactions between the ecosystem and the atmosphere.</p><p>Anderegg and colleagues, including first author Chao Wu, chose all of the above. \"Each different method has inherent advantages and limitations,\" said Wu, a postdoctoral scholar at University of Utah. \"No model is perfect.\"</p><p>\"By bringing in many different approaches and different model types and comparing them,\" Anderegg said, \"we can get a sense of what the different models are telling us and how we [can] learn to improve the models. And we might have much more confidence if all of the models and all of the approaches tell us the same story in a given region.\"</p><p>The researchers found that, although the models' forecasts differed in some ways, they showed some consistency in predictions of how different regions' carbon storage might change in the future. The Great Lakes and Northeastern U.S., for example, as well as parts of the Southeastern U.S. and the northern Rockies, consistently showed carbon gains in future projections.</p><p>But the models also revealed significant risks of losing carbon from forests through the triple threat of fire, climate stress and insect damage. Without these stresses, forests might be able to pack away 9.4 petagrams of carbon nationwide by the end of the 21st century. A petagram is equal to a quadrillion grams about 25 times the mass of all humans on Earth. However, with these risks, the models projected a net gain in forests of between 3 and 5 petagrams.</p><p>The researchers also applied their analysis to 139 current projects aiming to offset carbon emissions by increasing the carbon stored in forests. \"For carbon offsets to be effective,\" Anderegg said, \"they have to store carbon for a pretty long amount of time multiple decades to centuries. So if fire's burning them down or insects are wiping out different areas, it could vastly undermine their effectiveness as climate change solutions.\"</p><p>Depending on the model method and the climate scenario, the researchers found that large numbers of carbon offset forest projects, particularly in the Southeastern U.S. and on the West Coast, are projected to lose carbon by the end of the century.</p><p>What we still need to know</p><p>The results highlight that different climate and ecological models have different strengths and weaknesses, and considering them together reveals the areas of research needed to improve climate projections.</p><p>Tree demographic models, for example, include simulations of forest dynamics as old trees die and new trees grow. \"But these current models didn't consider the disturbance-vegetation feedback,\" Wu said, referring to the different types of vegetation besides trees that appear following a disturbance like a forest fire and how they might influence the odds of another disturbance. \"Also they didn't consider CO2 fertilization,\" or the potential for rising carbon dioxide levels to actually improve plant growth.</p><p>The authors identified three research questions that could help elucidate the situation. First is the extent to which plants and trees might benefit from rising CO2 concentrations, as the compound is vital for photosynthesis. Second is a need for better data on climate-driven tree mortality from fire, climate stress and insects to inform their understanding of these threats. Last, scientists need a better account of how biomes will shift. For example, some forests may be able to grow back after a disturbance, but others may transition to grasslands and be lost entirely. \"These are some of the biggest unknowns that the field is really racing to tackle,\" Anderegg said.</p><p>In the meantime, while science works to understand how climate change affects forests, society can help by slowing the pace of climate change. \"Working to tackle climate change as quickly as possible and move to a lower carbon future massively decreases the risks that forests are likely to face in the 21st century,\" Anderegg said, \"and increases the potential benefits that we might get from forests.\"</p><p>About UCSanta Barbara</p><p>The University of California, Santa Barbara is a leading research institution that also provides a comprehensive liberal arts learning experience.

According to news reporting from Beijing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"The advances in developing more accurate and fast smoke detection algorithms increase the need for computation in smoke detection, which demands the involvement of personal computers or workstations. Better detection results require a more complex network structure of the smoke detection algorithms and higher hardware configuration, which disqualify them as lightweight portable smoke detection for high detection efficiency.\"</p><p><br/> Financial support for this research came from Natural Science Foundation of China.<br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Beijing Forestry University, \"To solve this challenge, this paper designs a lightweight portable remote smoke front-end perception platform based on the Raspberry Pi under Linux operating system. The platform has four modules including a source video input module, a target detection module, a display module, and an alarm module. The training images from the public data sets will be used to train a cascade classifier characterized by Local Binary Pattern (LBP) using the Adaboost algorithm in OpenCV. Then the classifier will be used to detect the smoke target in the following video stream and the detected results will be dynamically displayed in the display module in real-time. If smoke is detected, warning messages will be sent to users by the alarm module in the platform for real-time monitoring and warning on the scene. Case studies showed that the developed system platform has strong robustness under the test datasets with high detection accuracy.\"<br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"As the designed platform is portable without the involvement of a personal computer and can efficiently detect smoke in real-time, it provides a potential affordable lightweight smoke detection option for forest fire monitoring in practice.\"<br/> For more information on this research see: An Embedded Portable Lightweight Platform for Real-Time Early Smoke Detection. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sensors</emphasis>, 2022;22(12):4655. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sensors</emphasis> can be contacted at: Mdpi, St Alban-Anlage 66, Ch-4052 Basel, Switzerland.

After creating one of modern TV's most iconic characters in \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" Sarah Michelle Gellar returns to the supernatural genre with Paramount+'s \"Wolf Pack\" (streaming weekly on Thursdays), a new werewolf drama from \"Teen Wolf\" creator Jeff Davis.  When we meet Gellar's character, arson specialist Kristin Ramsey, she's interrogating a group of high schoolers about their possible connection to a massive forest fire. Kristin only appears in a few minutes of the series' first two episodes but plays a crucial role in the story as the season goes on.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It's definitely a slow build,\" Gellar says. \"I liken it to 'The Sixth Sense,' how you have to watch the whole movie, get to the end, and then go back and realize, 'Oh, I didn't see this, this and this.' There's bread crumbs throughout the beginning episodes where you might see less of me, and you have to sort of put it together to really understand why I'm there.\"</p><p>Gellar, 45, an executive producer on \"Wolf Pack,\" tells us more about the show, \"Buffy\" and the viral resurgence of \"Scooby-Doo.\" (Edited and condensed for clarity.)</p><p>Question: You've said that initially, you had no intention of saying yes to \"Wolf Pack.\" After \"Buffy,\" were you offered a lot of supernatural films and TV series?</p><p>Answer: Absolutely. Supernatural and thriller (projects) still offer the most exciting roles for women: You get to be vulnerable, and you get to fight. But when you have a show like \"Buffy\" it's very hard because inevitably you're going to face comparisons. One of the beauties about \"Buffy\" was that the monsters were metaphors for the horrors of adolescence. And this (show) was really the first time someone came to me again using the monsters as metaphors for what we face now: anxiety, loneliness and the idea of finding your pack.</p><p>Did you pay homage to Buffy with Kristin?</p><p>Buffy was always known for her boots, and Kristin Ramsey also has a boot situation going on. That's the biggest nod, but they're different boots: Buffy always wore knee-high boots, and Kristen wears more combat (style).</p><p>Rodrigo Santoro (\"Westworld\") plays a father who goes missing during the wildfire. As the adults on set, did you two  ever flip into \"mom and dad\" mode with your younger co-stars?</p><p>Yes, although I don't know if it's so much \"mom and dad\" as mentor. When I was growing up, I didn't have someone on set really looking out. And I said to the kids very early on, \"I'm here. Please come to me and have that open line of communication.\" So it's been great, even from (things like) changing the food on set, which I did. The food was a little rough for actors who are in bikinis throughout the entire season. Not myself - Rodrigo and I said we knew we made it when we were the only people in the scene not in bikinis.</p><p>You said last month that you worked on \"an extremely toxic male set\" earlier in your career. As an executive producer on \"Wolf Pack,\" were there ways you tried to create a safer, more collaborative environment?</p><p>To be clear, I had multiple experiences: some extremely known and some may be less known. It really was very prevalent, and I wasn't just referencing one job - for goodness sake, I worked with James Toback (a director accused of sexual misconduct since 2017 by hundreds of women).</p><p>But the most important (thing) is to hear how (cast and crew members are)  feeling. It doesn't mean you can change everything. Feelings aren't fact, but they have to be understood.</p><p>You introduced your kids (ages 13 and 10) to \"Buffy\" during quarantine. Did you make it through all seven seasons?</p><p>They watched 1 through 5. We  jumped around on 6 and then we got to the second half of 7. My daughter is a true teenager. Buffy and Angel (David Boreanaz) is all she wanted to see. And my son just wanted fight sequences.</p><p>You and your husband, Freddie Prinze Jr., starred in two live-action \"Scooby-Doo\" movies, which are having a moment online. Have you noticed people are nostalgic for them?</p><p>I have, and I needed time. It wasn't the movie that we set out to make. Initially, we were going to make this PG-13, irreverent statement on \"Scooby-Doo\" where Shaggy was the stoner we all knew he was and Fred was sleeping with everyone. Then all of a sudden, it became this very PG movie, (and) it's really hard to start something and see it change into something else. But now with distance, I love it. It makes me laugh and I'm proud of it.</p><p>I always say I'm so lucky because I have multiple characters that people dress up as for Halloween. To me, that's the marker. It's not an award, it's not viewers, it's not magazine covers - it's that on Halloween, I'll get sent (photos of) multiple people dressing as characters I've played.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Sarah Michelle Gellar returns to the supernatural genre with Paramount+'s \"Wolf Pack.\"</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Robert Hanashiro/USA TODAY</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Gellar stars as Kristin Ramsy in \"Wolf Pack\" on Paramount+.

According to news reporting originating from Shimla, India, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Pine needle waste biomass is a troublesome forest biomass from the mid Himalayan region. Every year, it causes number of forest fire incidents causing a significant damage to the Himalayan ecology and environment.\"</p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Department of Environment, Science and Technology Govt. of HP, Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC), University Grants Commission, India.<br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Himachal Pradesh University, \"However, this forest waste biomass may be utilized to produce various value-added products, including biofuels. Pine needle waste biomass (PNWB) obtained from the Himalayan forests was chopped, ground, and subjected to physico-chemical pre-treatments (1.0% NaOH + Microwave (900 W for 12 min) that resulted in 72.58 +/- 0.46% wt/v lignin removal. Saccharification of the resultant lignin-free PNWB with xylanase from Bacillus pumilus XRLS and cellulase from Bacillus subtilis CPS-66 enzymes (2:4 U/g of pine needles) for 48 h at 45 degrees C produced 25.64 +/- 2.36 mg/ml of fermentable sugars. Subsequent 1.51 co-fermentation of PNWB fermentable sugars with Schizosaccharomyces sp. EF-3 and Kluyveromyces marxianus MTCC 1498 produced 17.65 g/l ethanol with 86.6% purity and 91.22% fermentation efficiency.\"<br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Findings of the present study suggest that pine needle waste biomass from the forest could be utilized as an important bioresource for bioethanol production, which will not only help in protecting the Chir-Pine forests from devastating forest fires but will also help in protecting the biodiversity and environment.\"<br/> This research has been peer-reviewed.<br/> For more information on this research see: Co-fermentation of Forest Pine Needle Waste Biomass Hydrolysate Into Bioethanol. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Biomass Conversion and Biorefinery</emphasis>, 2022. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Biomass Conversion and Biorefinery</emphasis> can be contacted at: Springer Heidelberg, Tiergartenstrasse 17, D-69121 Heidelberg, Germany.

In his position, he independently performs all drafting and detailing work associated with the development and preparation of highway plans from preliminary sketches to final plans. He also trains lower level technicians and makes field trip investigations to study existing terrain, location, drainage, and any physical problems to ensure that they can be considered in the preparation of design plans, among many other duties.</p><p>Jason is considered to be the squad expert for Auto-TAB and Bluebeam, two of the many software programs that staff in the highway design units use. Jason is always available with a quick response to any questions regarding these programs.</p><p>Jason is a current member of the district's Innovations Council which provides a formal venue to solicit, evaluate, implement and communicate suggestions received from employees to improve performance and processes in the district.</p><p>He is currently volunteering to staff the Incident Command Center during winter weather. This required Jason to work over various holidays and travel to and from the office during those winter weather events.</p><p>Jason was a member of and served as chairperson of the district's Employee of the Month (EOM) committee for three years. Jason went above and beyond while on the EOM committee, volunteering to serve as chairperson for an extra two years over the one-year requirement for that position. Jason was a vital part in ensuring that previous Employee of the Year recognition ceremonies went off without a hitch. He was also instrumental in streamlining the voting process and providing modernization to the committee. Upon stepping down from being the EOM chairperson and member of the committee, Jason continued to assist and guide the new EOM chairperson.</p><p>Jason, a six-year PennDOT employee, lives in South Williamsport with his wife Lisa and their daughter Lillian. Jason is also a Forest Fire Warden with the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. An avid outdoorsman, he volunteers with Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, Lycoming Creek Anglers Association and the Tiadaghton Forest Fire Fighters Association.</p><p>Congratulations to Jason Barrett, the PennDOT District 3 office Employee of the Month for February 2021.</p><p>MEDIA CONTACT: Kim Smith, 570-368-4344 or <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:kiasmit@pa.gov\">kiasmit@pa.gov</email></p><p>### For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:contentservices@htlive.com\">contentservices@htlive.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USFDNW-PR3697940</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USFDNW2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61X4-9621-F12F-F4R6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">282801</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-02-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"452\"/><timeReceived>9:31 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 HT Media Ltd.

In some cases, long hose lines had to be laid from the river Elbe and Kirnitzsch. In others, water tankers had to be transported to the areas affected by the flames.  <br/>\"The fire is under control in general but the danger is not over yet, because there are embers that flare up again and again,\" emphasized Philipp Haase, deputy Forest Fire Protection Officer of the state of Brandenburg. <br/>He said he expected operations to last for another week before all embers were extinguished.  <br/>During the firefighting operations in the Saxon Switzerland National Park, one female firefighter was injured when a fire hose burst. The woman had to be taken to a hospital, according to the spokesman of the District Office of Saxon Switzerland-Eastern Ore Mountains.  <br/>Tourists were advised not to enter the eastern area of the national park and that they would be legally prosecuted if they didn't adhere to the warning.  <br/>Police on Wednesday reported around 40 people had to be asked to leave the area, while charges were filed against 10 who had gone down specifically cordoned-off pathways. <br/>How did the fire spread?  <br/>The wildfires had sparked in the Bohemian Switzerland National Park in the Czech Republic over the weekend and had expanded to the Saxon Switzerland National Park on Monday.  <br/>The fires come amid extreme dry conditions across Germany and after a punishing heat wave. <br/>With temperatures rising to above 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), wildfires were breaking out in many regions of southern Europe. <br/>los/msh (dpa, AFP) <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DEWL109989165893853510825976100037</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7827</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:661C-1M31-F03R-N0S8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567698</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"541\"/><timeReceived>4:15 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Deutsche Welle Europe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"07\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>July 27, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Most of the carbon lost in this fire would have been from soil, not trees. (Photo by Cristina Santin, author provided) <br/>The vast boreal forests of the Northern Hemisphere stretch from Scandinavia through Siberia, Alaska and Canada. They cover a tenth of the world's land but hold one-third of the land's carbon[1], stored mainly in organic-rich soils and in trees. Now, a new study in the journal Science[2] provides further evidence that emissions from wildfires in high northern latitudes are already increasing at an alarming rate. </p><p><br/>In these forests, the cold climate and often waterlogged ground means fallen tree bark, needles and other dead organic matter takes a long time to decompose. This has allowed the soils to accumulate carbon over thousands of years after the ice sheets retreated at the end of the last ice age. Since then, these ecosystems have mainly been shaped by wildfires ignited by lightning. <br/><br/>The boreal forest forms a near-continuous ring of trees around the world's northern latitudes. (United Nations FAO[3] graphic, CC BY-SA[4]) <br/><br/> These fires release some of the carbon stored in trees and in the upper layer of soil back into the atmosphere. The release of soil carbon is hugely significant. It means a boreal forest fire will release 10 to 20 times more carbon compared to a similarly sized fire in other ecosystems where fires consume mainly vegetation and where the soil itself does not contain enough carbon to burn. <br/>However, these boreal forests might burn only once a century, sometimes even less often than that. This is much longer than in most other fire-prone ecosystems, and the extra carbon stored in soils and trees in the long period between fires normally exceeds the losses from fires. For the past 6,000 or so years this delicate relationship between carbon uptake and release was quite stable[5] and boreal forests served as a globally important carbon sink. <br/>But global heating, which is particularly pronounced in the Northern Hemisphere's high latitudes, is threatening the balance. Soaring temperatures have lengthened the fire season[6] and increased the frequency and severity of wildfires and there is growing evidence that as the interval between fires shortens, more carbon is being released from organic soils in boreal forests than the ecosystems can reabsorb. <br/> Satellites can spot gas emitted by wildfires <br/><br/>That's where the latest study in Science[2] comes in. The researchers, mostly based in China, used satellite observations of wildfire smoke plumes to look for carbon monoxide, which is invisible to the naked eye but shows up at certain infrared wavelengths. Carbon monoxide isn't itself a greenhouse gas, but if you know how much of it there is, you can infer the amount of carbon dioxide in wildfire smoke as well. <br/>This contrasts with the more conventional methods employed by current wildfire emission models. These also use satellites, but record active fires or burned areas simply by comparing before and after images. They then factor in a range of assumptions on how much vegetation would typically have been consumed and how much carbon is emitted per area of different types of vegetation and soil burned. <br/><br/>Fires like these are now releasing more carbon than is stored in the period in between.

It also has potential to give us a more detailed understanding of the differences in wildfire carbon emissions between different ecosystems. A dramatic increase <br/><br/>The new study showed a significant increase in emissions from boreal fires over the past two decades. Things were particularly dramatic in 2021, when they comprised a record 23% of global vegetation wildfire emissions, more than twice their contribution in a more typical year. <br/>If this trend continues, the boreal forest may very soon become the dominant source of global emissions from biomass burning, overtaking the notorious tropical peatland fires (such as those in Indonesia in 2015[7]) in terms of global significance and adding further to the 'fire-carbon-climate warming' feedback. <br/>The 2021 fire season was made particularly extreme by simultaneously hot and dry conditions both in North America and northern Europe and Asia. If such weather patterns do become more frequent, leading to more fires in the boreal region, these forests may reach a 'wildfire tipping point'. A study examining the extreme fires of 2014 in boreal north-west Canada demonstrated that some areas were already turning from carbon sinks into net emitters[8]. This new study covering the entire boreal biome suggests this ecosystem as a whole - from Siberia to Canada - is rapidly approaching this tipping point. <br/>This article is republished from The Conversation[9] under a Creative Commons license.

No residents were injured, but a pig breeding farm burned down and several animals died.</p><p>The state\u2019s explosive ordnance disposal service has designated a small area near the village of Rehfeld as a site where old ammunition could be buried, deputy forest fire protection officer Philipp Haase told dpa. Two German military firefighting helicopters were on site trying to extinguish the flames from the air because firefighters were not allowed to access the area for fear that the ammunition could explode.</p><p>Authorities said it was not clear when the fire could be brought under control. More than 350 firefighters were battling the flames and around 300 people from various villages had to be evacuated.</p><p>\u201cThe situation is still serious. We still have pockets of fire,\u201d local district fire chief Steffen Ludewig told dpa.</p><p>Further southeast, firefighters from several countries have joined forces to battle a fire in a national park in northern Czech Republic that has spread to the state of Saxony in neighboring Germany.</p><p>The fire in the Bohemian Switzerland park broke out on Sunday and was mostly contained before windy weather caused it to spread again on Monday afternoon and overnight. Despite their efforts, firefighters said the fire had spread from 30 hectares earlier Tuesday to 1,000 hectares.</p><p>No injuries have been reported, but around 100 people had to be evacuated Tuesday evening from the Czech town of Vysoka Lipa.</p><p>Earlier, some 80 people have been evacuated from the border town of Hrensko, and more from the village of Mezna, where the flames have destroyed or damaged several homes, firefighters' spokesman Lukas Marvan said.</p><p>Dozens of German children were evacuated from a summer camp on the Czech side of the border and transported back to Germany.</p><p>Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala and Interior Minister Vit Rakusan were visiting the area on Tuesday.</p><p>Rakusan said some 400 firefighters have been in action and the blaze was not under control by midday Tuesday.</p><p>\"The situation is very serious,\u201d Rakusan said adding that several neighboring countries had responded to the Czech Republic's call for help to extinguish the fire.</p><p>Poland and Slovakia said they were sending helicopters while Italy offered special Canadair planes designed for firefighting.</p><p>The German military announced it would send four helicopters to the border region to help fight the flames, dpa reported.</p><p>The Czech Hydrometeorological Institute said the smoke has spread 100 or more kilometers (60 miles or more) from the fire.</p><p>___</p><p>Kirsten Grieshaber reported from Berlin.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow AP\u2019s climate coverage at <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment\">https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-d0b2b71b59b7ea396a45d670ea74cce720220726</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6613-F4Y1-DYMD-63DV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"560\"/><timeReceived>6:12 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"07\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>July 26, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

No residents were injured, but a pig breeding farm burned down and several animals died.</p><p>The state\u2019s explosive ordnance disposal service has designated a small area near the village of Rehfeld as a site where old ammunition could be buried, deputy forest fire protection officer Philipp Haase told dpa. Two German military firefighting helicopters were on site trying to extinguish the flames from the air because firefighters were not allowed to access the area for fear that the ammunition could explode.</p><p>Authorities said it was not clear when the fire could be brought under control. More than 350 firefighters were battling the flames and around 300 people from various villages had to be evacuated.</p><p>\u201cThe situation is still serious. We still have pockets of fire,\u201d local district fire chief Steffen Ludewig told dpa.</p><p>Further southeast, firefighters from several countries have joined forces to battle a fire in a national park in northern Czech Republic that has spread to the state of Saxony in neighboring Germany.</p><p>The fire in the Bohemian Switzerland park broke out on Sunday and was mostly contained before windy weather caused it to spread again on Monday afternoon and overnight. Despite their efforts, firefighters said the fire had spread from 30 hectares earlier Tuesday to 1,000 hectares.</p><p>No injuries have been reported, but around 100 people had to be evacuated Tuesday evening from the Czech town of Vysoka Lipa.</p><p>Earlier, some 80 people have been evacuated from the border town of Hrensko, and more from the village of Mezna, where the flames have destroyed or damaged several homes, firefighters' spokesman Lukas Marvan said.</p><p>Dozens of German children were evacuated from a summer camp on the Czech side of the border and transported back to Germany.</p><p>Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala and Interior Minister Vit Rakusan were visiting the area on Tuesday.</p><p>Rakusan said some 400 firefighters have been in action and the blaze was not under control by midday Tuesday.</p><p>\"The situation is very serious,\u201d Rakusan said adding that several neighboring countries had responded to the Czech Republic's call for help to extinguish the fire.</p><p>Poland and Slovakia said they were sending helicopters while Italy offered special Canadair planes designed for firefighting.</p><p>The German military announced it would send four helicopters to the border region to help fight the flames, dpa reported.</p><p>The Czech Hydrometeorological Institute said the smoke has spread 100 or more kilometers (60 miles or more) from the fire.</p><p>___</p><p>Kirsten Grieshaber reported from Berlin.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow AP\u2019s climate coverage at <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment\">https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-d0b2b71b59b7ea396a45d670ea74cce720220726</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6613-F5B1-JC5B-G3NM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"559\"/><timeReceived>6:12 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"07\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>July 26, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
