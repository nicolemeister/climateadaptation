According to news reporting out of Beijing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Forest fires constitute a widespread and impactful natural disaster, annually ravaging millions of hectares of forests and posing a severe threat to human life and property. Accurate quantitative prediction of forest fire spread is essential for devising swift risk management strategies and implementing effective firefighting approaches.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Fundamental Research Funds For The Central Universities; King Saud University. <br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from China Academy of Building Research: \"In response to this imperative, this study introduces a Forest Fire Spread Behavior Prediction (FFSBP) model, encompassing two integral components: the Forest Fire Spread Process Prediction (FFSPP) model and the Forest Fire Spread Prediction (FFSRP) model. The FFSPP model involves the prediction of the direction and speed of forest fire spread, achieved through a fusion of the Cellular Automata model and the Wang Zhengfei model. On the other hand, the FFSRP model focuses on forecasting the extent of the burned area, leveraging machine learning methods. To validate the efficacy of the proposed models, a real case study is undertaken using the '3.29 Forest Fire' incident in China. The FFSPP model is validated against this case, while the FFSRP model is assessed using a real fire dataset obtained from Montesinho National Forest Park in Portugal. Results from the validation process reveal that during the natural development period of the '3.29 Forest Fire,' the FFSPP model predicts a burned area of 286.81 hm<sup>2</sup>, with an associated relative error of 28.94%. This relative error is notably smaller than those observed in the Farsite and Prometheus fire behavior simulation models.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Additionally, the FFSRP model demonstrates commendable predictive performance, particularly in the context of small and medium-sized fire scenarios. These findings underscore the potential of the FFSBP model as a valuable tool in enhancing forest fire prediction accuracy and facilitating more robust risk mitigation and firefighting strategies.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: A Forest Fire Prediction Model Based on Cellular Automata and Machine Learning.

The fires have threatened buildings, caused evacuations, and forced road closures.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The trend is continuing in November with four more igniting this week: blazes Thursday in Evesham, Burlington County, and Glassboro, Gloucester County; one Wednesday near a shooting range in Jackson Township, Ocean County; and, one Wednesday in Wharton State Forest in Camden County.</p><p>A fire of undetermined size broke out Thursday afternoon at Glassboro Wildlife Management Area in Gloucester County near Carpenter Avenue. New Jersey Forest Fire crews were busy constructing a fireline and plan on conducting a backfiring operation, which means strategically burning fuel such as dead branches and brush in the fire's path to slow its advance.</p><p>Thursday morning's blaze, which the fire service has dubbed the Bethany Run Wildfire, ignited along 75 acres at the border of Evesham Township in Burlington County and Voorhees Township in Camden County and had grown to 200 acres, with zero percent contained, by the afternoon. The fire broke out along a wooded area of Kettle Run Road in Evesham Township near the popular Black Run Preserve and a residential area, threatening 104 buildings, 12 of which were evacuated. A helicopter capable of dropping 350 gallons of water was deployed. Sycamore Avenue was closed, as was Kettle Run Road from Braddock Mill Road to Hopewell Road. Smoke from the fire could be seen from Philadelphia.</p><p>The fire service dubbed Wednesday's the \"Shotgun Fire,\" because it started near a shooting range. Initially, the fire was 175 acres, but spread to 300 acres in the Pinelands near Colliers Mills Wildlife Management Area in the area of Stump Tavern Road in Jackson Township. As of Thursday morning, 40% had been contained. Six buildings had been threatened and evacuated, before people were allowed back in Wednesday night. However, Stump Tavern Road remains closed from Route 571 to Route 528. Firefighters remain on the scene, which is under investigation.</p><p>And a 45 acre wildfire broke out Tuesday morning in Waterford Township, within Wharton State Forest, near Tremont Avenue and Burnt Mill Road. Smoke drifted over Atco, Berlin and Waterford, causing some concern among residents. That fire was quickly contained.</p><p>Major wildfires, ones that reach 100 acres or more, are typically rare in fall.</p><p>In October alone, the Forest Fire Service responded to 507 incidents statewide. It was the driest October on record for the state, causing a high degree of fire danger. The conditions have continued with most of the state listed in severe drought and portions of South Jersey as in an extreme drought.</p><p>\"When conditions become this dry, the simplest things can start a wildfire,\" said Bill Donnelly, State Forest Fire Warden and Chief of the Forest Fire Service. \"In my 30-year career with the Forest Fire Service, I can't recall a time when we faced such a prolonged period of dry weather with no relief in sight.\"</p><p>October saw its share of major wildfires, including one that started Halloween in Downe Township, Cumberland County, in the Bayshore area. Dubbed, the Halloween Wildfire, it burned 137 acres near Railroad Ave. and was 90% contained by Sunday. Crews battled the blaze for days.</p><p>The dryness continues with little real relief forecast over the next week, except for a chance of showers Sunday night.</p><p>Indeed, the latest map issued Thursday by the U.S. Drought Monitor shows that parts of Ocean, Burlington, Atlantic, and Cumberland Counties have entered into an extreme drought period. The map is produced by the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p><p>On Thursday, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection said it would hold a hearing Tuesday on the \"unprecedented statewide dry conditions and rapidly worsening water supply indicators, including severely depleted groundwater levels and streamflow.\" After the hearing with state water supply officials, the department will determine whether to declare a water supply drought warning, which lead for the state to ask water suppliers to cut back. The state declared a drought watch in October and asked residents to voluntarily cut back water use.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:fkummer@inquirer.com\">fkummer@inquirer.com</email></p><p>FrankKummer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHIDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHIDLY2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DCC-B871-DYJT-249V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247246</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"741\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Philadelphia Daily News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 8, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"67\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0EyOTJDQzRFNDdENDI4MEI4N0E4NTBDQzVGOTVDNDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N115300CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008WSA</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001839</classCode><className>WILDLIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000313</classCode><className>CLOSINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001840</classCode><className>WILDLIFE CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N115300CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GX602</classCode><className>PHILADELPHIA, PA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GS146</classCode><className>NEW JERSEY, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

They're the same roads used by thousands of families and commercial truckers who cross into Mexico and back each day.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Diseases know no borders,\" said Ocaranza, El Paso's top public health doctor, \"so as people are mobile, they're going to be coming and receiving medical attention in El Paso but they may be living in Juarez.\" It took a couple of months, but El Paso now has the highest measles case count in the state outside of West Texas with 38. Neighboring Ciudad Juarez has 14 cases as of Monday.</p><p>North America's three biggest measles outbreaks continue to balloon, with more than 2,500 known cases; three people have died in the U.S. and one in Mexico. It started in the fall in Ontario, Canada; then took off in late January in Texas and New Mexico; and has rapidly spread in Chihuahua state, which is up to 786 cases since mid-February.</p><p>These outbreaks are in areas with a notable population of certain Mennonite Christian communities who trace their migration over generations from Canada to Mexico to Seminole, Texas. Chihuahua health officials trace their first case to an 8-year-old Mennonite child who visited family in Seminole, got sick and spread the virus at school. And Ontario officials say their outbreak started at a large gathering in New Brunswick involving Mennonite communities.</p><p>Mexican and U.S. officials also say the genetic strains of measles spreading in Canada match the other large outbreaks.</p><p>\"This virus was imported, traveling country to country,\" said Leticia Ru\u00edz, director of prevention and disease control in Chihuahua.</p><p>North and South American countries have struggled to maintain the 95% measles vaccination rate needed to prevent outbreaks, said Dr. Jarbas Barbosa, director of the Pan American Health Organization. And a recent World Health Organization report said measles activity in the Americas region is up elevenfold from the same time last year and that the risk level is \"high\" compared to the rest of the world's \"moderate\" level.</p><p>Measles cases have been confirmed in six of the region's countries \u2014 Argentina, Belize, Brazil, Canada, the United States and Mexico \u2014 and investigating the disease's spread is labor-intensive and pricey. The response to each measles case in the U.S. costs an estimated $30,000 to $50,000, according to Dr. David Sugerman, a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientist.</p><p>Measles at the U.S.-Mexico border</p><p>The cases in Ciudad Juarez have no direct connection to the Mennonite settlement in Chihuahua, said Rogelio Covarrubias, a health official in the border city. The first measles case in El Paso was in a child at Fort Bliss, Ocaranza said.</p><p>More than half of El Paso's cases are in adults, which is unusually high, and three people have been hospitalized. The health department is holding vaccination clinics in malls and parks and says hundreds have gotten a shot. The vaccines are free \u2014 no questions asked, no matter which side of the border you live on.</p><p>Communication about measles between the two health departments is \"informal\" but \"very good,\" Ocaranza said. Covarrubias said his team was alerted last week to a case of someone who became sick in El Paso and returned home to Juarez.</p><p>\"There is constant concern in Ciudad Juarez \u2026 because we have travelers that pass through from across the world,\" Covarrubias said. \"With a possible case of measles without taking precautions, many, many people could be infected.\"</p><p>Measles at the U.S.-Canada border</p><p>Michigan health officials said the outbreak of four cases in Montcalm County are linked to Ontario.</p><p>The state's chief medical executive, Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, expects to see more cases. Michigan has a 95% vaccination rate for measles, mumps and rubella, but it hides weak spots \u2014 counties with 70% vaccination rates and individual schools where just 30% of kids vaccinated.</p><p>\"If we think about measles as a forest fire, we've got these burning embers that are floating in the air right now,\" Bagdasarian said. \"Whether those embers result in another wildfire just depends on where they land.\"</p><p>In Canada, six out of 10 provinces have reported measles cases. Alberta has the second-most with 83 as of April 12, according to government data.</p><p>Case counts in Ontario reached 1,020 as of Wednesday, mostly in the southwest part that borders Michigan. In one of the hardest-hit regions, Chatham-Kent Public Health officials announced a public exposure at a Mennonite church on Easter Sunday.</p><p>\"It sometimes feels like we're just behind, always trying to catch up to measles,\" Dr. Sarah Wilson, a public health physician for Public HealthOntario. \"It's always moving somewhere.\"</p><p>Janetsky reported from Mexico City. Shastri reported from Milwaukee.</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

The fires have threatened buildings, caused evacuations, and forced road closures.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The trend is continuing in November, with four more igniting this week: blazes Thursday in Evesham, Burlington County, and Glassboro, Gloucester County; one Wednesday near a shooting range in Jackson Township, Ocean County, that continues to burn; and one Wednesday in Wharton State Forest in Camden County.</p><p>A fire of undetermined size broke out Thursday afternoon at Glassboro Wildlife Management Area near Carpenter Avenue in Gloucester County. New Jersey Forest Fire Service crews were busy constructing a fire line and plan on conducting a backfiring operation, which means strategically burning fuel such as dead branches and brush in the fire's path to slow its advance.</p><p>Thursday morning's blaze, which the fire service has dubbed the Bethany Run Wildfire, ignited along 75 acres at the border of Evesham Township in Burlington County and Voorhees Township in Camden County and had grown to 200 acres, with 0% contained, by the afternoon. The fire broke out along a wooded area of Kettle Run Road in Evesham Township near the popular Black Run Preserve and a residential area, threatening 104 buildings, 12 of which were evacuated. A helicopter capable of dropping 350 gallons of water was deployed. Sycamore Avenue was closed, as was Kettle Run Road from Braddock Mill Road to Hopewell Road. Smoke from the fire could be seen from Philadelphia.</p><p>The fire service dubbed Wednesday's blaze the \"Shotgun Fire\" because it started near a shooting range. Initially, the fire was 175 acres, but spread to 300 acres in the Pinelands near Colliers Mills Wildlife Management Area in the area of Stump Tavern Road in Jackson Township. As of Thursday morning, 40% had been contained. Six buildings had been threatened and evacuated before people were allowed back in Wednesday night. However, Stump Tavern Road remained closed as of Thursday from Route 571 to Route 528. Firefighters remained on the scene, which is under investigation.</p><p>And a 45-acre wildfire broke out Tuesday morning in Waterford Township, within Wharton State Forest, near Tremont Avenue and Burnt Mill Road. Smoke drifted over Atco, Berlin, and Waterford, causing some concern among residents. That fire was quickly contained.</p><p>Major wildfires, ones that reach 100 acres or more, are typically rare in fall.</p><p>In October alone, the Forest Fire Service responded to 507 incidents statewide. It was the driest October on record for the state, causing a high degree of fire danger. Those conditions have continued, with most of the state listed in severe drought and portions of South Jersey in an extreme drought.</p><p>\"When conditions become this dry, the simplest things can start a wildfire,\" said Bill Donnelly, state forest fire warden and chief of the Forest Fire Service. \"In my 30-year career with the Forest Fire Service, I can't recall a time when we faced such a prolonged period of dry weather with no relief in sight.\"</p><p>October saw its share of major wildfires, including one that started Oct. 31 in Downe Township, Cumberland County, in the Bayshore area. Dubbed the Halloween Wildfire, it burned 137 acres near Railroad Avenue and was 90% contained by Sunday. Crews battled the blaze for days.</p><p>The dryness continues with little real relief forecast over the next week, except for a chance of showers Sunday night.</p><p>Indeed, the latest map issued Thursday by the U.S. Drought Monitor shows that parts of Ocean, Burlington, Atlantic, and Cumberland Counties have entered into an extreme drought. The map is produced by the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p><p>On Thursday, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection said it would hold a hearing Tuesday on the \"unprecedented statewide dry conditions and rapidly worsening water supply indicators, including severely depleted groundwater levels and streamflow.\" After the hearing with state water supply officials, the department will determine whether to declare a water supply drought warning, which lead for the state to ask water suppliers to cut back. The state declared a drought watch in October and asked residents to voluntarily cut back water use.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:fkummer@inquirer.com\">fkummer@inquirer.com</email></p><p>FrankKummer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHIINQ-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHIINQ2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DCC-B871-DYJT-24CM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"748\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Philadelphia Inquirer</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 8, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"68\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"68\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0EyOTJDQzRFNDdENDI4MEI4N0E4NTBDQzVGOTVDNDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>Forest Lands</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTkzOTc4NEQ2MTQwNDg0Q0E0NDNFRkRDRDU1QUE0OEU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

We found that Michigan had 3,102 crimes - 1,209 felonies and 1,893 misdemeanors. Over a five-year period, from 2008 to 2013, the Legislature expanded the criminal code, adding an average of 45 new crimes to the books annually.</p><p><br/>Our research also showed that many of Michigan's 3,102 crimes were redundant, unnecessary, outdated or downright silly. For example, the state prohibited walkathon endurance contests, dancing to \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" or mocking a person who refused a duel.<br/>A 1927 law required people who purchased poultry for resale to keep detailed records on official forms from the secretary of state. Failure to maintain the proper paperwork was a misdemeanor and could be punished with a $100 fine and 90 days in jail. We asked the Secretary of State's Office for a copy of the poultry form. The agency had no such form, and the person we spoke with had never heard of the requirement.<br/>Most people agree on the major crimes: We want society to prevent or punish murder, assault, theft, fraud and destruction of property. But with many crimes on the books, the state creates a risk for well-meaning people who unknowingly break the law. Have you ever transported a Christmas tree without the bill of sale? If so, you might be guilty of a misdemeanor.<br/>It's worth asking: \"Should this be a crime?\" Perhaps a civil penalty would be sufficient. Silly crimes are bad enough, but many criminal prohibitions carry heavy penalties, which affect a person's liberty and livelihood and increase the state's criminal justice costs.<br/>In 2015, then-Gov. Rick Snyder called for \"smart justice\" reforms to Michigan's criminal system, suggesting that we repeal archaic or duplicative crimes. The Michigan Legislature established a working group, identifying dozens of crimes to cut. Eventually, Snyder signed a seven-bill package. The state eliminated crimes related to dueling, refusing to fight a forest fire, trampling on huckleberry bushes, cursing in front of women or children, using the term \"lost manhood\" in advertising, and paperwork requirements for people camping on state land.<br/>One crime, however, triggered loud and passionate engagement. A 1945 law makes it a misdemeanor to sell baby chicks, rabbits or ducklings that had been dyed or artificially colored, presumably an Easter holiday tradition. We could find no record of prosecution in Michigan.<br/>At the hearing to repeal that law, animal rights groups, the state department of agriculture and a 14-year-old from Saginaw opposed the bill. \"If they want colored animals, they should stick to Peeps,\" the teenager told the Detroit Free Press. Many other laws got repealed, but lawmakers dropped this bill faster than a pink rabbit on Easter Sunday.<br/>Identifying and removing a handful of crimes from the books was hard work, even though most of these laws had no organized advocates. It's a much greater challenge when money and entrenched interests are in play.<br/>\"No government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size, so government programs once launched never disappear,\" said Ronald Reagan. \"Actually, a government program is the nearest thing to eternal life we'll ever see on this earth.\"<br/>Whether it's Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's attempt to fund road repairs though cuts to other programs or President Donald Trump's effort to shrink bloated federal agencies through the Department of Government Efficiency, these efforts face fierce opposition. Reagan was right: It is nearly impossible to end a government program. It's good that elected leaders are trying.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-219286</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FJ6-CJM3-SG3B-R0WV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"623\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 Mackinac Center, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Mackinac Center For Public Policy</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 10, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><className>Criminal Law &amp;

By sending Ukraine special equipment to combat emergencies and eliminate their consequences, Western leaders ignored the safety of their populations.\u00a0<br/>Since January 7, 2025, devastating forest fires have been raging in the southwestern United States, the fire spreading at incredible speed has burned out huge areas, razing entire neighborhoods to the ground. The son of the elected US President Donald Trump Jr. linked the difficulties in extinguishing large-scale forest fires in California to the transfer of equipment and consumables to Ukraine for extinguishing fires. On the social network X, Trump Jr. drew attention to the fact that in 2022, the Los Angeles Fire Department donated some of its supplies to Ukraine.\u00a0<br/>Like the United States, European countries have repeatedly sent fire-fighting vehicles, equipment and gear necessary for extinguishing fires to Ukraine since 2022, including special vehicles, kits for safe work at height, breathing apparatus, and personal fire protection equipment. </p><p>Thus, in the spring of 2022, France transferred 27 units of fire-fighting and rescue equipment and emergency rescue equipment to the State Emergency Service of Ukraine, Italy provided 41 trucks, three special vehicles and a trailer, Germany sent seven MAN and Mercedes-Benz fire trucks, and Portugal sent special equipment, equipment and gear.<br/>The consequences of short-sighted extravagance for European countries that rushed to provide Ukrainian rescuers with equipment needed in the event of natural disasters were not long in coming. The summer of 2022 turned out to be abnormally hot on the European continent. Thermometers recorded temperature records, and fires methodically destroyed square kilometers of forests in Western European countries and forced local residents and tourists to leave their homes and vacation spots.\u00a0<br/>The forest fire that broke out in July 2022 in the southern region of France, Gard, was called a \"megafire\" by French rescuers - the fire engulfed 600 hectares (1,500 acres) and was extinguished by more than 900 firefighters with the support of aviation. In the Gironde department, a natural fire of 14 thousand hectares was extinguished by 1 thousand 700 firefighters. Due to the fires, more than 16 thousand people were evacuated, many of them lost their homes and all property. In addition to buildings, agricultural lands were damaged. At the same time, Portugal was suffocating from the heat and forest fires. More than 3 thousand firefighters and 30 aircraft extinguished the forests burning in the country that have injured 29 people, including 12 firefighters and 17 civilians.<br/>In Italy, where wildfires are common during hot, dry summers, the number of fires in 2022 was almost three times higher than the average. In the second month of the unusually hot summer, Italian firefighters had to put out fires from Tuscany to Trieste. In August, German rescuers took up the baton - more than 6,500 firefighters tried to extinguish forest fires in Saxony for more than a week. At that time, local authorities were hoping for rain to save the tough situation.<br/>In September 2022, a state of emergency was declared due to a large forest fire in the Harz Mountains in northern Germany, with hundreds of firefighters battling the blaze for several days. In September 2024, another large forest fire broke out in the Harz Mountains. Around 500 people were evacuated from the affected area. Around 100 firefighters, two planes and a helicopter were deployed to extinguish the fire.<br/>Uncontrolled forest fires continued in Europe in 2023, the hottest year on record, and in 2024. Often, rescue efforts to prevent a catastrophe or at least minimize the scale of the disaster were in vain. In July 2024, a fire destroyed almost 20,000 hectares of forested area in southwestern France. In Italy, a strong forest fire destroyed the Monte Mario nature reserve in Rome. Wildfires in the Aveiro and Viseu regions of Portugal in September 2024 burned tens of thousands of hectares of forest and shrubland - according to the European Copernicus system, the area of burned territory on the Portuguese mainland exceeded 121 thousand hectares. As a result of the fires, seven people died and dozens of houses were destroyed.<br/>There are not many forests left on the European continent, and the loss of even a portion of them can cause an ecological catastrophe. It will take several decades for new forests to be planted and grow, and sigificiant procent of miraculously surviving birds and animals will die untill then. The problem is also aggravated by economic damage. According to the report \"The Economy for Disaster Prevention and Preparedness in the Member States and the European Union\", published by the World Bank, the total cost of forest fires in Europe in 2023 was 77 billion euros. In its statement, the World Bank emphasized that Europe is warming faster than any other continent and is highly vulnerable to the growing risks associated with climate change.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fires in California</emphasis><br/>In 2022, American television network ABC 7 reported that Los Angeles County fire crews collected surplus equipment stored in a warehouse for their Ukrainian colleagues. The article says that California firefighters sent hoses, nozzles, helmets, body armor and other personal protective equipment to Ukraine as part of a nationwide campaign. Local authorities supported the rescuers' desire to help Ukrainian firefighters and expressed confidence that county residents would appreciate this step.<br/>In May 2023, another batch of humanitarian aid was sent from the United States to Ukrainian rescuers. This time, American firefighters handed over two fire and rescue vehicles - a fully automated, digitally equipped, remotely controlled fire truck and an articulated boom lift. In August of the same year, a fire broke out on the Hawaiian island of Maui, which became the deadliest in the last 100 years. With strong winds, the fire quickly reached the tourist town of Lahaina and completely destroyed it. The fire claimed the lives of 115 people, more than 1,000 went missing, 4,500 were left homeless, and the damage from it is estimated at $6 billion.\u00a0<br/>Currently, American firefighters are giving all they can trying to extinguish fires in the state of California. The fire has spread from forest areas to densely populated areas of Los Angeles County. As of January 16, at least 27 people have died, more than 170 thousand people have received a notice of mandatory evacuation, more than six million are under serious threat of fires in a large area of Southern California. The damage from the natural disaster is estimated at $200-275 billion.<br/>American TV host Charlie Kirk has accused the White House of giving too much aid to Kyiv, while Californians affected by the fires need support. \"On the day that Americans in Los Angeles watch their homes, pets, and businesses burn and could use some help, the Biden administration is preparing to send Ukraine another $500 million. This is why they lost,\" Kirk wrote on social media X.<br/>Kirk`s statement is a message that should understand all the leaders of the world who have prioritized the interests of another nation: the population will not support a leadership that does not care about the safety of its own country.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-214645</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DYB-VMY3-RVYB-800D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1246\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 Mises, Canada All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Ludwig Von Mises Institute Of Canada</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"01\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>January 21, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Power &amp;

According to news reporting from Beijing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Forest fires, as severe natural disasters, pose significant threats to ecosystems and human societies, and their spread is characterized by constant evolution over time and space.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include National Key R&amp;D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Beijing Forestry University: \"This complexity presents an immense challenge in predicting the course of forest fire spread. Traditional methods of forest fire spread prediction are constrained by their ability to process multidimensional fire-related data, particularly in the integration of spatiotemporal information. To address these limitations and enhance the accuracy of forest fire spread prediction, we proposed the AutoST-Net model. This innovative encoder-decoder architecture combines a three-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (3DCNN) with a transformer to effectively capture the dynamic local and global spatiotemporal features of forest fire spread. The model also features a specially designed attention mechanism that works to increase predictive precision. Additionally, to effectively guide the firefighting work in the southwestern forest regions of China, we constructed a forest fire spread dataset, including forest fire status, weather conditions, terrain features, and vegetation status based on Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Himawari-8 satellite.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"On this dataset, compared to the CNN-LSTM combined model, AutoST-Net exhibits performance improvements of 5.06% in MIou and 6.29% in F1-score. These results demonstrate the superior performance of AutoST-Net in the task of forest fire spread prediction from remote sensing images.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: AutoST-Net: A Spatiotemporal Feature-Driven Approach for Accurate Forest Fire Spread Prediction from Remote Sensing Data.

They're the same roads used by thousands of families and commercial truckers who cross into Mexico and back each day.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Diseases know no borders,\" said Ocaranza, El Paso's top public health doctor, \"so as people are mobile, they're going to be coming and receiving medical attention in El Paso but they may be living in Juarez.\" It took a couple of months, but El Paso now has the highest measles case count in the state outside of West Texas with 38. Neighboring Ciudad Juarez has 14 cases as of Monday.</p><p>North America's three biggest measles outbreaks continue to balloon, with more than 2,500 known cases; three people have died in the U.S. and one in Mexico. It started in the fall in Ontario, Canada; then took off in late January in Texas and New Mexico; and has rapidly spread in Chihuahua state, which is up to 786 cases since mid-February.</p><p>These outbreaks are in areas with a notable population of certain Mennonite Christian communities who trace their migration over generations from Canada to Mexico to Seminole, Texas. Chihuahua health officials trace their first case to an 8-year-old Mennonite child who visited family in Seminole, got sick and spread the virus at school. And Ontario officials say their outbreak started at a large gathering in New Brunswick involving Mennonite communities.</p><p>Mexican and U.S. officials also say the genetic strains of measles spreading in Canada match the other large outbreaks.</p><p>\"This virus was imported, traveling country to country,\" said Leticia Ru\u00edz, director of prevention and disease control in Chihuahua.</p><p>North and South American countries have struggled to maintain the 95% measles vaccination rate needed to prevent outbreaks, said Dr. Jarbas Barbosa, director of the Pan American Health Organization. And a recent World Health Organization report said measles activity in the Americas region is up elevenfold from the same time last year and that the risk level is \"high\" compared to the rest of the world's \"moderate\" level.</p><p>Measles cases have been confirmed in six of the region's countries - Argentina, Belize, Brazil, Canada, the United States and Mexico - and investigating the disease's spread is labor-intensive and pricey. The response to each measles case in the U.S. costs an estimated $30,000 to $50,000, according to Dr. David Sugerman, a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientist.</p><p>&lt;h2&gt;Measles at the U.S.-Mexico border&lt;/h2&gt;</p><p>The cases in Ciudad Juarez have no direct connection to the Mennonite settlement in Chihuahua, said Rogelio Covarrubias, a health official in the border city. The first measles case in El Paso was in a child at Fort Bliss, Ocaranza said.</p><p>More than half of El Paso's cases are in adults, which is unusually high, and three people have been hospitalized. The health department is holding vaccination clinics in malls and parks and says hundreds have gotten a shot. The vaccines are free - no questions asked, no matter which side of the border you live on.</p><p>Communication about measles between the two health departments is \"informal\" but \"very good,\" Ocaranza said. Covarrubias said his team was alerted last week to a case of someone who became sick in El Paso and returned home to Juarez.</p><p>\"There is constant concern in Ciudad Juarez ... because we have travelers that pass through from across the world,\" Covarrubias said. \"With a possible case of measles without taking precautions, many, many people could be infected.\"</p><p>&lt;h2&gt;Measles at the U.S.-Canada border&lt;/h2&gt;</p><p>Michigan health officials said the outbreak of four cases in Montcalm County are linked to Ontario.</p><p>The state's chief medical executive, Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, expects to see more cases. Michigan has a 95% vaccination rate for measles, mumps and rubella, but it hides weak spots - counties with 70% vaccination rates and individual schools where just 30% of kids vaccinated.</p><p>\"If we think about measles as a forest fire, we've got these burning embers that are floating in the air right now,\" Bagdasarian said. \"Whether those embers result in another wildfire just depends on where they land.\"</p><p>In Canada, six out of 10 provinces have reported measles cases.

Experiments conducted on the VisDrone2019 dataset demonstrate that the average detection accuracy of the MASW-YOLO algorithm is 38.3%, which is augmented by 7.9% through the utilisation of the original YOLOv8n network. Furthermore, the number of network parameters is reduced by 19.6%.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>Recent years have seen unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology experience rapid development, resulting in an expansion of its application fields and an increase in the diversity of its functionalities. These devices have found applications in civil, transportation1 and military domains, underscoring their growing importance. The flexibility and mobility of UAVs provide significant advantages over traditional visual devices and offer a broad range of potential applications. The utilisation of drones has the potential to facilitate the execution of perilous tasks. In the event of a disaster, the deployment of drone detection technology can expedite the comprehension of the situation on the scene, thereby enhancing the efficacy of rescue operations. Furthermore, the potential applications of drone detection technology extend to the domains of traffic monitoring, military operations, and the tracking of live sporting events. The significance of drone detection technology is indisputable.</p><p>The emergence of deep learning target detection approaches has resulted in a variety of detection models, the most common of which are single-stage and two-stage. The two-stage model is designated a two-step detector and is characterised by its increased computational demands, in addition to its capacity for high detection accuracy. Conversely, single-stage models, also designated as one-step detectors, do not necessitate the generation of candidate regions. They achieve quicker inference speeds and frame rates while maintaining a given degree of accuracy. Consequently, in scenarios where resources are limited, single-stage models can also achieve satisfactory performance. In contrast, the single-stage model is more appropriate for UAV target detection, including the SDD2 algorithm, the YOLO3,4 series of algorithms, and so forth. Among these, YOLO has become the most widely used target detection model through continuous updating, iteration and development.</p><p>Whilst the integration of UAV imagery with target detection algorithms to facilitate automatic target detection offers certain advantages, it is also confronted with significant challenges, primarily including the following:</p><p>The capacity to detect targets of minimal size. In the context of UAV-perspective detection targets, which are characterised by their densely arranged nature and small size, the convolutional layer of the deep learning model exhibits a limited sensory field. This limitation results in the underutilisation of spatial features, thereby hindering the effective detection of small targets.</p><p>It is vital to understand that UAV hardware resources are restricted. It is imperative to ensure the number of network parameters is adequate, in conjunction with the requisite detection accuracy. This necessitates a multifaceted approach, wherein the optimization of effects is pursued while maintaining equilibrium.</p><p>Dense object occlusion problem. UAVs are shooting at high altitude, there are a substantial of occlusion situations, and the occluded objects are often unrecognisable, thereby compromising the efficacy of the underlying algorithm.</p><p>In order to surmount these challenges, an increasing number of researchers are concentrating their efforts on the detection of small targets. Existing small target detection algorithms have been shown to demonstrate sub-optimal performance in a number of scenarios, including those involving sensory fields, insufficient feature fusion and dense occlusion. Furthermore, these algorithms are not capable of reducing the model\u2019s complexity to a satisfactory degree. To address the key issues in target detection from a UAV perspective, this study introduces MASW-YOLO, an algorithm based on the YOLOv8n model for UAV viewpoint feature detection, enhancing target detection accuracy while ensuring model efficiency. The following are the principal contributions of this paper:</p><p>1) The efficacy of the Multi-Scale Convolution Attention (MSCA)5 attention mechanism in enhancing the detection of small targets has been demonstrated. The features of different sensory fields are captured by parallel multi-scale convolutional kernels, which are dynamically weighted in combination with the channel attention mechanism to enhance the model\u2019s ability to perceive multi-scale targets. The deep convolution operation has been demonstrated to enhance local detail extraction, with a particular emphasis on small target regions. The issue of feature weakening in small targets due to low resolution is resolved, and the detection accuracy of targets of various sizes (particularly small objects) is enhanced.</p><p>2) Reconstruct the neck network through the AFPN module. Form a multi-scale collaborative mechanism with MSCA. The traditional PAN + FPN6 is replaced by the Asymptotic Feature Pyramid Network (AFPN)7. The combination adopts a hierarchical progressive feature fusion technique to improve the interaction of non-adjacent hierarchical features, as well as the completeness and flexibility of multi-scale feature fusion. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the AFPN forms a multiscale feature synergy mechanism with MSCA, whereby the response value of MSCA becomes the input of AFPN, and the multi scale feature fusion of AFPN further amplifies the advantages of MSCA.</p><p>3) The efficacy of target occlusion detection can be enhanced by incorporating the Soft Non-Maximum Suppression (Soft-NMS)8 module. This approach addresses the challenge of low target occlusion detection accuracy in complex scenarios. In the NMS stage, the Soft-NMS module employs confidence attenuation as opposed to direct exclusion for boxes that overlap with the box of highest score, thereby ensuring the retention of potential targets. It has been demonstrated that using this strategy greatly enhances target occlusion detection performance in high-density scenarios.</p><p>4) The loss optimisation with Wise Inter section over Union (Wise-IoU)9 involves the substitution of the original Completing Inter section with CIoU10 in YOLOv8 with finer geometric constraints. Additionally, the Wise-IoU loss function dynamically adjusts the regression weights. This results in accelerated convergence of the model and enhanced accuracy of the bounding box prediction, particularly in cases where target deformation or scale change is significant.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Background and related works</emphasis></p><p>Deep learning has accelerated the development of target identification methods based on this cutting-edge learning theory, which have been used in a number of image detection domains. It is evident that considerable attention has been focused on the YOLO algorithm.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction to the YOLO algorithm</emphasis></p><p>Recent years have seen the YOLO series of algorithms undergo continuous updates, reaching the 12th generation. YOLOv811 has achieved significant advancements in target detection, establishing an optimized equilibrium between computational efficiency and recognition precision. Its performance is particularly notable in practical applications across various domains.</p><p>The YOLOv8 model retains the scaling factor concept of YOLOv5 and is divided into five versions: YOLOv8n, YOLOv8s, YOLOv8m, YOLOv8l, and YOLOv8x. The versions differ in the width and depth of the network, with the n to x versions becoming more complex.Targeting resource-constrained aerial systems, our methodological enhancements concentrate on YOLOv8n, the most algorithmically lean implementation in the YOLOv8 family. The YOLOv8n model is composed of three components: the backbone, the neck, and the header network, which consists of three-scale decoupled output prediction layers. The backbone extracts features through convolutions, C2f, and SPPF12. The neck integrates FPN and PAN multi-scale features13. The detection head of YOLOv8 employs two branches to extract information through two 3 \u00d7 3 convolutions and one 1xl convolution, respectively. This contributes to increasing the breadth and depth of feature extraction, which raises the robustness and accuracy of detection.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related work</emphasis></p><p>Many scientific advances have been made in the field of target detection in recent years. In the domain of remote sensing image processing, Qian14 et al. proposed a UTS strategy to provide a generic solution for HOD to OOD BBR loss migration. They also proposed FRIoU loss on top of RIoU loss to improve the detection accuracy while optimizing the training process by dynamically weighting the samples. Furthermore, Qian15 et al. proposed two novel methods, Complete Pseudo Soft Labeling (CPSL) and Invariant Multi-Instance Learning (IMIL), with the aim of resolving issues pertaining to neighbouring instances misclassification and error accumulation, respectively, in the domain of Weakly Supervised Object Detection (WSOD). These methods were then combined with affine transformation to enhance the model\u2019s resilience and achieve SOTA performance in remote sensing WSOD tasks.</p><p>In the field of UAV image detection, Xue16 et al. refined the UAV image target detection algorithm YOLOv7-drone, building upon YOLOv7-tiny. They enhanced the feature fusion mechanism within the network and augmented the accuracy of small target detection by incorporating a novel small target detection layer. Chen17 et al. proposed a target detection algorithm, YOLO, that improves the YOLOv8 _RC, which achieved some performance improvement while the number of parameters decreased. Boshra Khalili18 et al. proposed SOD-YOLOv8, inspired by efficient GFPNs, which enhances multipath fusion in YOLOv8 to improve the performance of the model. Pan19 et al. proposed a BDC-YOLOv8 detection model that incorporates a dedicated detection head for small targets, incorporating the CBAM attention mechanism to improve the detection accuracy. Dong20 et al. demonstrated an improved Cross-YOLO algorithm to make an enhanced version of YOLOv8, proposing to enhance the FPN by Cross-FPN to improve the detection accuracy. Zhu21 et al. implemented the CBAM attention mechanism in YOLOv5s with a view to resolving the issue of detecting blurred images from the perspective of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. Lyu22 et al. optimized feature fusion at different scales by modifying the neck network structure of YOLOv8.</p><p>In the domain of safety detection, Li23 et al. proposed an algorithm that combines three fundamental techniques: the use of GD for feature extraction, the modification of the detection head, and the optimization of the loss function to improve the speed and precision of deep forest fire detection. Jiao24 et al. employed a migration learning strategy for the labeling and training processes, which resulted in a substantial enhancement in the accuracy of helmet detection, a crucial aspect in ensuring the personal safety of workers.</p><p>In the domain of medical image processing, Sun25 et al. proposed SSW-YOLO to improve the detection performance of blood cells. Tan26 et al. presented LymoNet, a cervical lymph node detection algorithm that utilises an advanced attention mechanism module to achieve SOTA performance, offering a highly promising solution.</p><p>The deep learning models in each of the aforementioned domains are designed for small target detection, and all have been enhanced in terms of accuracy. However, the performance of the detection algorithm is subject to certain limitations. In the case of a single image detection target, the full potential of the detection algorithm cannot be realised, resulting in a limited effect. Furthermore, when confronted with complex backgrounds and small targets, the anticipated performance is not achieved, thereby reducing the robustness of the model in practical applications. Moreover, the restricted resources available to the UAV platform present a challenge in achieving a lightweight model that retains accuracy. Consequently, further research and enhancement of these limitations are imperative. These limitations motivate the proposal of the MASW-YOLO algorithm, which improves detection accuracy while keeping the model line-weighted.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methodology</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MASW-YOLO model</emphasis></p><p>This paper\u2019s objective is to enhance the efficacy of small target detection from the perspective of a UAV. Additionally, it seeks to address the challenges of false and missed detection. The following paper sets out a proposal for an improved MASW-YOLO model based on YOLOv8n, in view of the characteristics of small target detection under UAV viewpoint. As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the network structure is illustrated. Firstly, the detection accuracy of small targets is enhanced by fusing the MSCA attention mechanism to strengthen the local detail extraction, with a particular focus on small target regions. Secondly, the neck network is reconstructed to form a multiscale feature synergy mechanism. The neck network adds the AFPN, which encourages direct feature fusion between non-adjacent layers. The AFPN overcomes the multiscale weakening of the non-adjacent layers\u2019 fusion effect and establishes a multiscale feature synergy mechanism with MSCA. The response value of the MSCA becomes the input of the AFPN, and the multiscale feature fusion of the AFPN further amplifies the advantages of the MSCA. It is evident that the detection accuracy of occluded objects is enhanced by the flexible non-extremely large value suppression Soft-NMS module. In this module, candidate frames that overlap with the highest scoring frames are subjected to confidence attenuation rather than direct elimination in the NMS stage. Consequently, some potential targets are retained. Finally, the WIoU is used to replace YOLOv8\u2019s original CIoU loss function, with the goal of improving flexibility to detection targets with varying dimensionalities and morphologies.</p><p>Fig. 1</p><p>MASW-YOLO Structure diagram. </p><p>Source: It was made by ourselves using \u201cVisio\u201d.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Multi-scale convolution attention mechanism</emphasis></p><p>In addressing the challenges posed by the UAV viewpoint feature detection target\u2019s limited size and the presence of occlusions, effective feature information extraction is paramount to enhance the detection performance. In this study, we suggest enhancing the network structure by including the MSCA mechanism into the backbone network design, as illustrated in Fig. 2.</p><p>Fig. 2</p><p>MSCA structure diagram. </p><p>Source: It was made by ourselves using \u201cVisio\u201d.</p><p>MSCA employs a large convolutional kernel decomposition and a multi-branch parallel architecture, thereby ensuring the MSCA attention mechanism\u2019s capacity to capture multi-scale targets and aggregate multi-scale channel information27.</p><p>The MSCA attentional mechanism enhances features through a three-fold structure. First, depth-separable convolution efficiently integrates local area features. Second, the parallel multi-scale strip convolution module extracts contextual semantic information across the sensory field by decomposing both horizontally and vertically. Finally, the point-by-point convolution layer establishes cross-channel feature associations, thereby realizing efficient interactions and weight assignments of the channel dimensions. Initially, MSCA performs convolutional operations on each channel of the input feature map through 5 \u00d7 5 convolutional kernels, thus capturing spatial dimensional feature information. Thereafter, the convolved information of each channel is fused, allowing the information of each channel to be aggregated. Subsequently, these convolved channel information are fused. The employment of a deep convolution design has been demonstrated to be an effective method of reducing the number of total parameters in the network model. Furthermore, it has been shown to skillfully realise the separation of channel and spatial information through the strategy of feature extraction in the spatial dimension first and then integrating the information of each channel, while maintaining the number of channels of the feature map unchanged.</p><p>Secondly, multi-branch deep strip convolution28 simulates the traditional n \u00d7 n standard 2D convolution through multiple branches, each using convolution kernels of different sizes 1 \u00d7 n and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> \u00d7 1. In addition, stripwise convolution improves the detection of small targets by extracting stripwise features that may be missed by mesh-like convolution, enabling the model to capture more contextual information at different scales. Furthermore, the employment of smaller convolution kernels ensures the maintenance of lightweight computation.</p><p>Finally, 1 \u00d7 1 point-by-point convolution is used to model the relationship between different channels in the feature. The output of this process is then employed as the weighting of the convolutional attention, with the purpose of re-weighting the inputs of the MSCA. This technique helps to focus the model\u2019s attention on relevant elements.</p><p>It can be described by a mathematical formula as:12</p><p>where F denotes the input features, Att and Out denote the attention map and output, respectively. is an element-by-element matrix multiplication operation, DW-Conv denotes deep convolution, and Scalei (i\u2208{0,1,2,3}) denotes the ith branch in Fig. 2.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Asymptotic feature pyramid network</emphasis></p><p>The structure of the Progressive Pyramid Network (AFPN) is illustrated in Fig. 3. The black arrow denotes the convolution operation, while the cyan arrow indicates the adaptive spatial feature fusion.AFPN employs a step-by-step incremental approach to integrate different levels of features in the feature extraction process of the Backbone network29. Specifically, AFPN first processes the bottom-level features, then gradually introduces the middle-level features, and finally fuses the high-level abstract features. The significant semantic dissimilarity between the features at each level, most pronounced between the bottom layer and the high-level features, suggests that direct overall fusion of multi-layer features, such as C2, C3, C4 and C5, may result in suboptimal fusion outcomes. Consequently, the direct fusion scheme is deemed suboptimal. The AFPN\u2019s step-by-step fusion design, however, has been shown to effectively bridge the semantic gap between features of different layers. To illustrate this, the semantic information of C2 and C3 is first integrated, thereby bringing their semantic information closer together. Subsequently, the semantic information of C3 and C4 is amalgamated, thus reducing the semantic discrepancy between C2 and C4. The layer-by-layer progressive fusion approach enhances semantic consistency, thereby improving the fusion effect and detection performance. This progressive feature fusion method has significant advantages in mitigating the differences in semantic information at non-adjacent levels, optimising the feature integration capability of the pyramid network, and providing higher-quality multiscale feature characterisation for subsequent tasks.</p><p>Fig. 3</p><p>Asymptotic Feature Pyramid Network (AFPN) architecture. </p><p>Source: It was made by ourselves using \u201cVisio\u201d.</p><p>The AFPN is comprised of the following modules: the Convolutional Block (CB), the Basic Block (BB), and the Adaptive Spatial Fusion (ASFF)30. The CBS module\u2019s job is to slice and extend the input feature maps in channel dimensions, hence enhancing the model\u2019s sensory field and successfully retrieving feature map information. This method enhances target detection performance. The BasicBlock module lightens the model and minimizes the number of parameters, allowing it to perform feature extraction more efficiently. The ASFF module, i.e. the adaptive spatial fusion operation, fuses multiple feature maps of different layers. The AFPN module has been shown to be capable of capturing multi-scale information more effectively by dynamically selecting and fusing multiple layers of feature maps. At the same time, it is able to inhibit information contradiction between features at different levels, thereby improving the effectiveness of feature fusion and the robustness and accuracy of the model in complex scenes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Soft non-maximum suppression module</emphasis></p><p>In the context of target detection, an algorithm is employed to generate one or more detection borders for designated object classes within an image. These borders are then used to classify and score the objects within their respective confines. Conventional object detection methods characteristically employ a multi-scale sliding window technique to traverse the image and compute feature scores for each window, thereby distinguishing between foreground and background31. However, this approach is hindered by a significant drawback: the high correlation between neighbouring windows. This results in a high rate of false positives in the detection results. To address this issue, the NMS is commonly used in the post-processing stage by filtering out bounding boxes with large overlapping regions and low confidence, thus retaining the boxes that are most likely to contain the target object. While NMS is effective in reducing false alarms, it can, however, excessively hinder effective detection when confronted with scenarios involving dense occlusion or multiple targets in close proximity, particularly when two high-quality but partially overlapping target frames are erroneously removed due to overlap, resulting in missed detections.The NMS score reset function is depicted in Eq. (3):3</p><p>In the context of the UAV viewpoint feature detection task, the occurrence of omission and false detection due to target occlusion is a prevalent phenomenon. In order to address this issue, the present paper replaces the traditional NMS algorithm in the baseline model with flexible non-maximal suppression (Soft-NMS).Soft-NMS dynamically processes the scores according to the degree of overlap of the neighbouring detection frames by adjusting the score decay mechanism instead of simply setting the scores of the overlapping frames to zero directly32. Specifically, when the overlap region between a certain detection frame and a high-quality detection frame (denoted as M) is large, its score is drastically cut down; while when the overlap region is small, its score has less impact, thus retaining the detection results more flexibly.</p><p>This methodology enables enhanced control of the detection outcomes and mitigates the occurrence of missed detections due to over-suppression.The Soft-NMS score reset function is delineated in Eq. (4):4</p><p>In this equation, \u2018si\u2019 denotes the variance of the decay function, \u2018Nt\u2019 is the threshold for adjusting the decay function, and \u2018iou (\u00b5, bi)\u2019 is the intersection and juxtaposition ratio of the true and predicted frames. The traditional score adjustment function may cause the score mutation problem due to discontinuity when reaching the non-maximal inhibition threshold. To address this challenge, a Gaussian penalty function is incorporated into the optimization process. The Gaussian penalty mechanism is such that when the candidate box does not overlap at all with the highest-scoring box M, there will be no cut in its score; and as the overlap increases, the penalty is gradually increased so as to achieve smooth score adjustment. The incorporation of the smoothing property of the Gaussian function ensures a more continuous and gradual change in penalty strength with overlap degree, thereby effectively preventing the occurrence of score disconnection. The modified score reset function is shown in Eq. (5):5</p><p>As demonstrated in Fig. 4 and as indicated in Eq. 5, Soft-NMS is comprised of three adjustable parameters, namely the threshold coefficient (Nt), the score reduction coefficient (si), and the score threshold (score). It is evident that the variation of these parameters has a substantial impact on the performance of Soft-NMS in diverse tasks.</p><p>Fig. 4</p><p>Soft-NMS flowchart. </p><p>Source: It was made by ourselves using \u201cVisio\u201d.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WIoU loss function</emphasis></p><p>The YOLOv8 network utilises a prediction method to calculate the edge coordinate loss LCIoU33 (see Eqs. 6\u20139). This calculation is performed using the CIoU, which is determined as outlined in the following Eq. 6789</p><p>The location is defined by the following: \u03b1 is a weighting function that is utilised to balance the importance of differing samples or targets, with the objective of more accurately measuring the model performance. v is an aspect ratio metric function that is employed to measure the aspect ratio consistency.</p><p>The CIoU loss function has been demonstrated to improve the model\u2019s ability to mimic the target\u2019s shape by including a corrective factor34. It also takes into account the target frame\u2019s diagonal distance, increasing the accuracy of the target detection model in localizing the target.The CIoU loss function effectively speeds the convergence of prediction frame regression by using the bounding box\u2019s aspect ratio as an extra penalty term in the loss computation. However, when the projected frame\u2019s aspect ratio is linearly related to the real frame, it may lead to unsynchronized adjustment of the width and height in the regression process. This paper introduces WIoU to replace the CIoU loss function. WIoU mitigates the width-height inconsistency problem that occurs during the regression process through a more flexible focusing method, thus improving the accuracy and stability of the box regression.The WIoU is calculated as shown in Eq. (10) :10</p><p>In Eq. (10), the distance focusing mechanism RWIoU is employed to amplify the LIoU of the ordinary modest anchor frame with RWIoU \u2208 [1,e), which will significantly increase the value of LIoU. Conversely, the non-monotonic focusing coefficient r, on the other hand, is employed to adjust the degree of focusing of the common mass anchor frame as a parameter that regulates the degree of matching of the predicted frame with the real labeled frame. Unlike monotonic focusing coefficients, non-monotonic focusing coefficients allow dynamic adjustment of the degree of matching over a range of different IoU values, resulting in a more fine-grained assessment of model performance.RWIoU35 is defined as in Eq. (11) and r is defined as shown in Eq. (12):1112</p><p>where \u03b2 is the outlier degree anddenotes the dynamic sliding average, when the dynamic sliding average is large, it may lead to slow parameter updating, making the results of the bounding box regression overly conservative, making it difficult to adapt to changes in the position of the detection target, and leading to the detection frame deviating from the true position of the detection target.</p><p>In instances where the dynamic sliding average is minimal, there is a possibility that the parameter update will become excessively sensitive. This, in turn, can result in significant fluctuations in the results of the bounding box regression, thereby causing the detection frame to fluctuate around the target. Consequently, this can lead to an inability to accurately capture the precise position of the target. It is therefore vital to select an appropriate dynamic sliding average in order to maintain the accuracy and stability of the detection frame and ensure that the bounding box can regress to the location of the target with precision. It is also important to note that \u03b1 and \u03b4 are used as hyper-parameters, and that adjusting these hyper-parameters can improve the performance and generalisation ability of the model.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Experimental</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Datasets</emphasis></p><p>The experiment under consideration is trained using the VisDrone201936 dataset, the object types and size distributions of which are illustrated in Fig. 5.</p><p>Fig. 5</p><p>Object types and size distribution in the VisDrone2019 dataset. </p><p>Source: The figure is a graph of the results of our own training with the model on the VisDrone2019 dataset.</p><p>The VisDrone2019 dataset is a target detection dataset from the viewpoint of a UAV produced by a team from Tianjin University and other teams.The dataset was collected with a UAV under different conditions, including the number of how many, the complexity of the background environment, the daytime and nighttime, as well as the number of species.The dataset represented by the different conditions of VisDrone2019 is shown in Fig. 6.</p><p>Fig. 6</p><p>Representative image of VisDrone2019. </p><p>Source: The photographs originate from the VisDrone2019(<url normalizedValue=\"https://github.com/VisDrone/VisDrone-Dataset\">https://github.com/VisDrone/VisDrone-Dataset</url>).</p><p>The VisDrone201936 dataset contains targets of various sizes, which are categorized into 10 distinct categories.

Similarly, the mAP@0.5\u20130.95 metric exhibited an improvement, increasing from 17.4 to 17.8%. Additionally, there was an augmentation in the number of parameters, which rose from 3.01 million to 3.10 million. This finding suggests that the MSCA module captures the characteristics of different receptive fields through the multi-scale convolutional kernel, thereby enhancing the model\u2019s multi-scale target perception, including the perception of small targets. This makes it easier to improve local detail features and improve the model\u2019s detection accuracy.</p><p>The utilisation of both MSCA and AFPN modules results in an enhancement of mAP@0.5 from 30.4 to 30.5%, and in an increase of mAP@0.5\u20130.95 from 17.4 to 17.6%. Concurrently, Params undergoes a reduction from 3.01 M to 2.42 M. The application MSCA is located at the end position of the backbone network, which is connected to the neck network. The positional structure of these two forms a feature processing pipeline, with the refined feature output of MSCA becoming the input of AFPN. The multi-scale integration of AFPN further amplifies the advantages of MSCA. In instances where the implementation of the AFPN asymptotic pyramid network mAP@0.5 value does not yield enhancements, but rather exhibits a decline in performance that defies intuitive expectations, separate experimental investigations have consistently demonstrated that the training outcomes consistently surpass those of the baseline model when the training number is 150.</p><p>Following the integration of Soft-NMS with the MSCA and AFPN modules, there was an observed enhancement in performance metrics. Specifically, the mAP@0.5 increased from 30.4 to 37.7%, while the mAP@0.5\u20130.95 rose from 17.4 to 24.3%. Concurrently, the parameter size was reduced from 3.01 M to 2.42 M. The incorporation of Soft-NMS has been demonstrated to improve the model\u2019s ability to detect small targets and reduce the occlusion issue caused by missed detections, thereby markedly enhancing detection accuracy.</p><p>The employment of the MSCA, AFPN, Soft-NMS, and WIoU modules in unison, otherwise designated as the MASW-YOLO algorithm, has been demonstrated to enhance the mAP@0.5 value by 7.9%, the mAP@0.5\u201395 value by 7.1%, the accuracy rate by 12.9%, the Recall by 1.7%, the FLOPs by 1.0G, and the Params by 0.59 M by 19.6%.The WIoU loss function has been shown to be instrumental in enhancing the detection accuracy.

As can be discerned from the original image (a), the scene is depicted as being situated in a city street, which is characterised by a high degree of congestion. The lower right quadrant of the original image is demarcated by a red circle, indicating an automobile obscured by a tree. The vehicle is not detected in figure (h), yet it is identified by the benchmark model in figures (d), (g), and (i). This illustrates the impact of the ablation experiments in a more intuitive manner. Furthermore, the enhanced model exhibits a reduced incidence of miss detection in instances of occlusion. The lower right corner of the figure (h) detected by the benchmark model misidentifies the occluded object as a bicycle, while the remaining models do not misidentify the object. This more intuitively demonstrates the advantages of MASW-YOLO. As demonstrated by the visualization images obtained from the ablation experiment, MASW-YOLO exhibits performance superior to that of the baseline model with respect to both missed detections and misdetections in the occlusion case.

In the subsequent analysis, the YOLOv7_tiny algorithm demonstrated a performance mAP@0.5 of 27.1 and Params of 6.02 M. This result indicates a lower detection accuracy in comparison to the YOLOv5n algorithm and a higher number of network parameters. The YOLOv5n algorithm, however, exhibits superior performance metrics in this regard.</p><p>We then proceeded to analyse the more advanced YOLOv8n, YOLOv9t, and YOLOv10n algorithms. In this analysis, YOLOv8n, as an early release of the YOLO series, outperformed the other algorithms in all detection metrics, with a mAP@0.5 of 30.The YOLOv8n network demonstrates a superior performance in target detection under UAV viewpoint, as evidenced by its higher accuracy of 4%, surpassing all other algorithms examined. This superiority is further accentuated by its reduced number of network parameters, which is a notable advantage over other networks. Consequently, this paper has been selected to enhance its performance based on the YOLOv8n network algorithm.</p><p>The most advanced algorithm models at present are YOLOv11n and YOLOv12n, with the latter being the latest series released this year. The performance of the YOLOv11 algorithm is indicated by a mAP@0.5 of 29.1% and Params of 2.58 M, while the performance of the YOLOv12 algorithm is indicated by a mAP@0.5 of 28.5% and Params of 2.52 M. As a newly released algorithm model, its detection accuracy on the VisDrone2019 dataset is somewhat lacking.</p><p>Finally, the MASW-YOLO model demonstrates a strong advantage in terms of detection accuracy, achieving an mAP@0.5 of 38.3% and an mAP@0.5\u20130.95 of 24.5%. It is also notable that the parameter count is maintained at 2.42 M. This finding indicates that MASW-YOLO exhibits superior performance in comparison to all other algorithms, while concurrently preserving the lightweight nature of the model. This attribute confers a distinct advantage in practical applications. In addition, the improved model has an FPS of 107.5 frames, which is 40.3 frames lower than the benchmark model, and is lower than many of the latest algorithm models, but still has a higher FPS, has relatively high real-time, and can be applied to practical applications.</p><p>To further illustrate the efficiency of the present algorithm, two state-of-the-art models from the extant literature are selected for comparison, namely PSO-YOLO42 and YOLO-S3DT43.

The findings of the enhanced model for each category demonstrate that the model has considerably elevated the detection accuracy for diminutive targets such as pedestrians, bicycles, and motorcycles. For instance, the mAP@0.5 value for pedestrians has been augmented from 31.5 to 36% in the baseline model. The findings indicate that the enhanced model demonstrates superior resilience in scenarios involving smaller targets. Furthermore, the capacity to detect vehicle targets has been enhanced, with the highest mAP@0.5 value recorded at 72.6% for the car class. The following presentation will demonstrate the performance of the detection system when applied to the automobile class. In summary, the MASW-YOLO model demonstrates superior performance in target detection across all categories when compared to the established benchmark. This outcome serves to substantiate the efficacy of the enhanced algorithm employed.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Visualization and comparison of test results</emphasis></p><p>In order to further explore the improvement effect of the MASW-YOLO model and to visualise the comparison in the test set of VisDrone2019, this paper selects two sets of images of a bright scene and a dim scene, and compares the detection effect of YOLOv8n with that of MASW-YOLO. The results are displayed in Fig. 11, wherein Fig. 11(a) and (b) depict the images of bright and dark scenes, respectively, Fig. 11(c) and Fig. 6(d) illustrate the recognition effect of the baseline model in bright and dim scenes, and Fig. 11(e) and Fig. 11(f) demonstrate the recognition effect of MASW-YOLO in bright and dim scenes.</p><p>Fig. 11</p><p>Comparison results chart. </p><p>Source: The photographs originate from the VisDrone2019(<url normalizedValue=\"https://github.com/VisDrone/VisDrone-Dataset\">https://github.com/VisDrone/VisDrone-Dataset</url>).</p><p>As demonstrated in Fig. 11, the detection image from the bright scene reveals that the lower right corner is more dense, with a significant number of motorized vehicles and bicycles parked. Notably, the baseline model failed to detect the bicycles among them, while the MASW-YOLO model successfully identified them. As evidenced by the detection images under low-light conditions, the benchmark model erroneously identifies the tractor in the center of the road as a bicycle and failed to identify the motorcycle. In contrast, our enhanced algorithm successfully detects the motorcycle in the upper left corner. A comparison of the figures reveals that the proposed algorithm in this paper outperforms the benchmark algorithm in terms of leakage and misdetection of small objects from the UAV perspective. Furthermore, the majority of the confidence levels are higher than those of the benchmark algorithm.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conclusion</emphasis></p><p>The present study proposes an enhanced UAV viewpoint target detection algorithm, termed MASW-YOLO, which is based on YOLOv8n. This algorithm addresses the challenges posed by the detection of small target objects and partial occlusion in UAV viewpoint feature detection. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by its ability to enhance the capability of UAV viewpoint feature detection through the incorporation of a multi-scale convolutional MSCA attention mechanism, the modification of the network structure of necking network by using an asymptotic pyramidal network AFPN, the replacement of the non-maximum suppression NMS of the baseline model with a flexibly non-extremely large value suppression Soft-NMS, and the optimization of the loss function. The experimental results demonstrate that the MASW-YOLO algorithm exhibits superior performance in the detection and localization of feature targets in comparison to the YOLOv8n algorithm. In comparison with the YOLOv8n, the model enhances the average accuracy mAP@0.5 by 7.9%. Moreover, the MASW-YOLO algorithm is more practical due to the creation of a lightweight model, which facilitates its application in UAVs with limited resources.</p><p>Notwithstanding the advances made in the model, there remains a necessity for continuous optimisation and enhancement. The following research areas have been identified as priorities for future study:</p><p>The model is subject to continuous optimization. A continuous comparison should be made between the improved model and the latest algorithmic model. In addition, further innovations should be mined with the aim to optimize the model and improve its performance.</p><p>It is imperative to improve the model\u2019s capability for generalisation. The operational scope of UAVs is extensive, and the geometry and dimensions of the targets detected within their field of view exhibit significant variability. Consequently, the primary objective is to improve the model\u2019s generalizability, allowing for larger use in practical contexts.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>This work is supported by Anhui Province Key Research Program Project (No. 202304a05020049).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><p>[1].Di Feng, C.

According to news reporting originating from Oregon State University by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Forest fires pose an escalating threat, demanding effective communication strategies for communities.\" </p><p><br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Oregon State University: \"While past research underscores the importance of community involvement and transparent communication, the dominance of social media in today's media landscape calls for a reassessment. This study investigates the utilization of social media, specifically Facebook, by the Oregon government during the 2022 fire season in Cedar Creek and Double Creek regions. Through Facepager, 4576 posts and comments were collected and then analyzed using the multi-coder approach and Vader Algorithm focusing on post frequency, thematic content, and user sentiments. The result reveals that positive sentiment polarity scores were observed with 0.61 and 0.71 for Cedar Creek and Double Creek respectively, however, the thematic and post-frequency analysis suggests a need for government agencies to diversify content, emphasizing scientific aspects and addressing community concerns.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The findings offer valuable insights for enhancing risk communication strategies, promoting informed public engagement, and guiding effective government communication in wildfire scenarios.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Enhancing Forest Fire Communication: A Case Study of Oregon Government Social Media.

According to news originating from Nanjing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Historical forest fire risk databases are vital for evaluating the effectiveness of past forest management approaches, enhancing forest fire warnings and emergency response capabilities, and accurately budgeting potential carbon emissions resulting from fires. However, due to the unavailability of spatial information technology, such databases are extremely difficult to build reliably and completely in the non-satellite era.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Nanjing Forestry University: \"This study presented an improved forest fire risk reconstruction framework that integrates a deep learning-based time series prediction model and spatial interpolation to address the challenge in Sichuan Province, southwestern China. First, the forest fire danger index (FFDI) was improved by supplementing slope and aspect information. We compared the performances of three time series models, namely, the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), Prophet and long short-term memory (LSTM) in predicting the modified forest fire danger index (MFFDI). The best-performing model was used to retrace the MFFDI of individual stations from 1941 to 1970. Following this, the Anusplin spatial interpolation method was used to map the distributions of the MFFDI at five-year intervals, which were then subjected to weighted overlay with the distance-to-river layer to generate forest fire risk maps for reconstructing the forest fire danger database. The results revealed LSTM as the most accurate in fitting and predicting the historical MFFDI, with a fitting determination coefficient (R2) of 0.709, mean square error (MSE) of 0.047, and validation R2 and MSE of 0.508 and 0.11, respectively.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Independent validation of the predicted forest fire risk maps indicated that 5 out of 7 historical forest fire events were located in forest fire-prone areas, which is higher than the results determined from the original FFDI (2 out of 7). This proves the effectiveness of the improved MFFDI and indicates a high level of reliability of the historical forest fire risk reconstruction method proposed in this study.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Reconstructing historical forest fire risk in the non-satellite era using the improved forest fire danger index and long short-term memory deep learning-a case study in Sichuan Province, southwestern China.

According to news reporting from Silchar, India, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Understanding the spatiotemporal distribution of forest fires and future predictions is very important for management strategies.\" </p><p><br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Assam University: \"To identify the present status of forest fires in the Kingdom of Thailand and their risk in the future, ten-year forest fire data were used, and a forest fire hotspot was prepared. A geospatial technique was used in the study to characterize the parameters of forest fires in the country and identify future forest fire risk areas. Most of the forest fires in the country were found to be seasonal. Deciduous forests in higher elevations and on moderate slopes were most vulnerable to forest fire. The level of aridity, soil moisture, temperature, precipitation, vegetation status, and topography influenced the spatiotemporal distribution of forest fires in the country. Greater than 50% of fire risks were observed in 22 administrative divisions, and 17 of the 209 protected areas are also in the high-risk category.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The final forest fire hotspot map can be used in policy development and successful management strategies. A better monitoring strategy should be used in the fire hotspot areas as a precautionary measure to minimize the anthropogenic causes of forest fires.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Forest fire in Thailand: Spatio-temporal distribution and future risk assessment.

However, detection is challenged by small crack size, complex morphology, large scale variation, and uneven spatial distribution, further exacerbated by UAVs\u2019 limited onboard computational capacity. To tackle these issues, we introduce an efficient and lightweight small-target detection model, namely YOLO-LSN, which is built upon the optimized YOLO architecture.Firstly, we introduce a Lightweight Dynamic Alignment Detection Head (LDADH) for multi-scale feature fusion, precise alignment, and dynamic receptive field adjustment, optimizing crack feature extraction. Secondly, the Small Object Feature Enhancement Pyramid (SOFEP) enhances detail representation of small cracks in complex backgrounds.Furthermore, we propose a weighted combination strategy of Normalized Wasserstein Distance (NWD) and IoU loss, balancing sensitivity to zero-overlap instances and robustness against scale deviations, thereby improving localization accuracy and generalization capability. Experiments show a 12% mAP@0.5 improvement and 17% reduction in parameters on a self-built mining crack dataset, with further validation on VisDrone2019 (mAP@0.5: 0.422, + 11.6%), Validating its effectiveness for UAV-based small-object detection, the model offers an efficient, reliable solution for geological hazard warning and mining safety.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>The continuous expansion of mining activities has made mining-induced surface cracks one of the significant geological phenomena affecting the safety of mining operations. Surface cracks not only compromise the stability of the mining area\u2019s environment but may also trigger severe geological hazards, such as subsidence.</p><p>and landslides, which pose substantial risks to surrounding infrastructure and the safety of local populations. Additionally, surface subsidence and cracks can lead to structural damage and collapse of surface buildings, resulting in economic losses. They may also induce spontaneous combustion of residual coal in mined-out areas, leading to coalfield fires1, 2, 3, 4, 5\u20136. Therefore, the rapid and accurate detection of mining-induced surface cracks is of paramount importance for understanding the movement patterns of overlying strata, ensuring the safe production of coal mines, and implementing comprehensive environmental management in mining areas.</p><p>Traditional methods for detecting mining-induced surface cracks, such as manual visual inspections, ground-based observations, and remote sensing image analysis, face several challenges, including low detection efficiency, high labor costs, and the inability to meet the demands of large-scale real-time monitoring5. Manual visual inspection is not only time-consuming and labor-intensive but also difficult to implement in complex terrains or adverse weather conditions, with the results being highly susceptible to subjective factors. While ground-based observations offer higher accuracy, they are limited to small, key areas and cannot cover the entire mining influence zone, with the added disadvantage of high equipment deployment costs7. Remote sensing image analysis, although capable of large-scale monitoring, is constrained by image resolution, revisit cycles, and weather conditions, making it difficult to capture dynamic changes in cracks in real-time8. Furthermore, traditional methods face significant challenges in data integration and analysis, making it difficult to achieve automated processing and intelligent analysis of multi-source data9. With the expansion of mining activities and the increasing demands for environmental protection and safety, there is an urgent need to introduce efficient, precise, and intelligent monitoring technologies, such as UAV-based remote sensing and deep learning-based image recognition methods, to enhance the automation and real-time monitoring capabilities of surface crack detection.</p><p>In recent years, with the rapid development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology, UAV-based aerial imagery for surface crack monitoring has gradually become an effective alternative. UAVs can efficiently capture high-resolution surface images and cover large monitoring areas, providing rich data support for surface crack detection in mining areas. Zhang et al. (2022)10 employed UAV photogrammetry and particle flow theory to analyze the surface crack characteristics of the 8092 work face in a coal mine in Ordos. The study found that the visual interpretation method based on UAV images achieved a crack recognition accuracy of 95%, and elucidated the distribution patterns and formation mechanisms of the cracks. However, the UAV images used in this study had a ground resolution of 5.6 cm/pixel, which made it difficult to detect tiny cracks. Additionally, the photogrammetric process is prone to interference from weather conditions, lighting changes, vegetation cover, and terrain undulations, potentially leading to degraded image quality and, consequently, reduced crack recognition accuracy. Although UAV aerial photography provides an efficient means of data acquisition for surface crack monitoring, due to limitations in flight altitude and resolution, cracks that may extend for tens of meters on a macro scale often appear as thin, discontinuous linear features in aerial images, with widths occupying only a few pixels, representing a typical small-object detection problem. Furthermore, these cracks exhibit characteristics such as low contrast, complex shapes, and significant scale differences, and are often obscured by complex backgrounds or surface features like rocks, further complicating the detection process.</p><p>Existing object detection algorithms, particularly those based on deep learning, such as the YOLO series11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18\u201319, although demonstrating excellent performance in most object detection tasks, still face challenges in detecting small targets like tiny cracks in complex backgrounds. This is due to insufficient feature extraction, leading to issues such as missed or false detections. Zhong (2024)20 et al. proposed SPD-YOLOv8, a small-object detection algorithm for UAV images in complex scenes. This method introduces the SPD-Conv module, replacing traditional strided convolutions and pooling operations in YOLOv8s, thereby enhancing the retention of small-object features. It also reconstructs the feature extraction and fusion network, incorporating a small-object detection layer and MPDIoU loss function, which improves detection accuracy. However, the introduction of the small-object detection layer results in a model that is still not lightweight, with high computational overhead, making it difficult to meet the deployment requirements for edge devices. Furthermore, its ability to fuse multi-scale features in complex backgrounds is limited, and it struggles with adapting to targets that exhibit large scale variations or severe occlusions. Additionally, traditional YOLO models typically use non-maximum suppression (NMS) for post-processing, leading to some inference delays, which limits their application on UAVs and other mobile devices. Therefore, we chose YOLOv10, a real-time end-to-end object detection model proposed by a research team from Tsinghua University21, as our baseline in the YOLO series. This model employs a consistent dual-assignment strategy, avoiding the need for NMS to eliminate duplicate prediction boxes during inference, significantly reducing post-processing time. It achieves the fastest inference speed while maintaining detection accuracy comparable to other models in the same category.</p><p>To address the challenges of detecting small targets such as complex crack shapes, significant scale differences, and the need for model lightweighting in mining-induced surface crack detection, we propose the YOLO-LSN model, an efficient and lightweight solution for small-object detection. This model enhances multi-scale feature fusion and reduces the number of parameters through the innovative Lightweight Dynamic Alignment Detection Head (LDADH). The LDADH leverages a shared convolution module and replaces traditional batch normalization (BN)23 with Group Normalization (GN)22 for stable training with small batch sizes. To further improve detection performance, we incorporate a Task Decoupling Module and dynamic alignment mechanism, along with DCNV224 deformable convolution and Scale25 layers to enhance the model\u2019s adaptability to various crack scales and shapes.In addition, we propose a Small Object Feature Enhancement Pyramid (SOFEP) that enhances fine-grained feature capture. The P2 feature layer is processed with the SPD-Conv26 module to generate features rich in small-object information, which are then fused with the P3 layer, boosted by the CSP-OmniKernel module for improved feature representation and sensitivity to cracks.Furthermore, we introduce a weighted combination of the NWD27 regression loss and the IoU28 loss functions to address the gradient vanishing issue of IoU in zero-overlap cases and its insensitivity to target size deviations, thereby optimizing small target localization accuracy.</p><p>The main contributions of this paper are as follows:</p><p>Propose a Lightweight Dynamic Alignment Detection Head (LDADH) for multi-scale feature fusion and model lightweighting.</p><p>Introduce a Small Object Feature Enhancement Pyramid (SOFEP) to improve fine-grained small-object feature capture.</p><p>Employ a weighted combination of NWD and IoU loss functions for enhanced small target localization accuracy.</p><p>We have constructed a mining-induced surface crack image dataset, which covers various complex terrains and crack targets of different shapes. Small targets (less than 32 \u00d7 32 pixels) account for 96.06% of the dataset, filling the data gap in small-scale crack detection in high-resolution aerial imagery.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 introduces related work on crack detection, and Sect. 3 provides a detailed description of the proposed YOLO-LSN architecture. Section 4 presents the experimental details, with a comparison of the proposed method\u2019s performance against several benchmark models, validating the robustness and lightweight nature of YOLO-LSN. Section 5 concludes the paper and outlines directions for future research.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related works</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Recent progress and research trends in crack detection techniques</emphasis></p><p>In recent years, with the rapid development of computer vision and deep learning technologies, UAV-based and image processing methods for crack detection have gradually become a research hotspot. Particularly in the field of mining-induced surface crack detection, challenges such as complex crack shapes, background interference, and small target sizes have imposed higher demands on detection algorithms.</p><p>To improve the adaptability to the complexity of crack shapes, Wang et al. (2024)29 proposed a crack detection method based on an anchor-free framework. By analyzing the texture features of cracks and contextual information, they optimized the YOLOX-x algorithm and introduced a semantic enhancement module to improve the recognition ability for elongated cracks. Although the anchor-free design reduces the dependence on hyperparameters, the method may suffer from false detections or missed detections in scenarios with dense or intersecting cracks, and it has limited capability in detecting the continuity of extremely elongated cracks.</p><p>For crack detection in complex backgrounds, Dang et al. (2024)30 proposed a UAV-based road crack detection algorithm, RCYOLO. This algorithm extracts tubular crack features by introducing the C2f_DSConv module and combines the SimAM attention mechanism31 with the dyhead detection head32, effectively addressing the issue of missed detections for small targets. Experimental results show that RCYOLO improves mAP@0.5 by 5.9% over YOLOv8 on a custom dataset, providing a valuable technical reference for crack detection in complex backgrounds. Additionally, Wang et al. (2024)33 proposed a computer vision-based intelligent crack detection and classification model. By improving the detection layer, anchor boxes, neck structure, and cross-layer connections of YOLOv5, the model achieves certain improvements in crack detection performance. However, its adaptability to multi-scale cracks is limited, especially in detecting small cracks (less than 32 \u00d7 32 pixels), where detection accuracy still needs improvement. Tang et al. (2024)34 proposed an improved YOLOv5s algorithm, which enhances crack detection accuracy under complex road conditions by re-clustering anchor points using the k-means + + algorithm, and incorporating the CBAM attention module35 and the CIoU_Loss loss function36. Although the optimization of anchor boxes and the loss function improved detection, it does not account for the impact of dynamic environments on detection.</p><p>In the optimization of multi-scale crack detection algorithms, Zhang et al. (2024)37 proposed a multi-scale crack detection algorithm based on USSC-YOLO. By introducing ShuffleNet V238, the Coordinate Attention mechanism (CA)39, and the Swin Transformer module40, the algorithm significantly reduces computational overhead and improves the detection accuracy of small target cracks. Experimental results show that the algorithm improves mAP@50 and mAP@[50:95] by 6.3% and 12%, respectively. However, its real-time performance is average, making it difficult to meet the needs of UAV high-speed inspections, and its robustness for crack detection under non-uniform lighting conditions is insufficient. Xue et al. (2024)41 proposed a lightweight Mini-YOLOv5s algorithm, which reduces model computational complexity and parameters by introducing the DP-C3 module, GDConv module42, ECA-C3 module, and CARAFE upsampling operator43. However, the excessive compression of parameters leads to a decline in the model\u2019s generalization ability for complex crack shapes (e.g., branching cracks). Furthermore, Zhou et al. (2024)44 proposed an improved wood crack detection algorithm based on YOLOv8, ICDW-YOLO. By incorporating a dual-layer attention mechanism and dynamic gradient enhancement features, it enhances the detection capability for small target cracks, achieving an mAP50-95 of 79.018%. However, the algorithm struggles with suppressing interference from complex backgrounds, potentially leading to false recognition of non-crack structures.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Performance limitations of existing crack detection models and research motivation</emphasis></p><p>A review of the existing literature reveals that most current studies focus on optimizing isolated components of model structures, while lacking an effective synergy among detection accuracy, lightweight design, and adaptability to complex scenarios. The specific limitations are summarized as follows:</p><p>Wang et al. (2024) proposed an anchor-free improved YOLOX algorithm, which performs well in detecting elongated cracks. However, it suffers from false positives and missed detections in scenes with dense or intersecting cracks. Tang et al. enhanced the YOLOv5s architecture by incorporating CBAM and CIoU_Loss, achieving improved precision in static pavement detection. Nevertheless, the method still lacks sufficient generalization capability in dynamic or complex conditions.</p><p>Modules such as SimAM, CBAM, and Coordinate Attention (CA) have been widely adopted to enhance the saliency of crack features. Dang et al. combined SimAM with DyHead, significantly improving small object detection performance. Zhou et al. designed a dual-layer attention structure to enhance the detection capability of YOLOv8. However, most of these approaches do not adequately consider the trade-off between the computational overhead introduced by attention mechanisms and the real-time performance required in practical scenarios.</p><p>Zhang et al. introduced USSC-YOLO by integrating ShuffleNet V2 and Transformer modules, which achieved promising detection accuracy. However, its real-time performance was compromised due to the increased computational complexity. Xue et al. proposed Mini-YOLOv5s, utilizing modules such as DP-C3 and GDConv to significantly compress model size. Nevertheless, the model\u2019s ability to recognize complex crack patterns declined as a result.</p><p>Many algorithms still face challenges in maintaining stable performance under adverse conditions, such as drastic illumination changes, occlusion, or complex background textures. For example, ICDW-YOLO performed well in detecting wood cracks but lacked robustness in suppressing pseudo-cracks. RCYOLO incorporated both feature extraction and attention mechanisms, yet it did not address scale adaptivity or robustness against motion blur.</p><p>In summary, while existing methods have achieved breakthroughs in specific performance dimensions, they often face trade-offs in others\u2014particularly struggling to simultaneously ensure high accuracy for small object detection, robustness in complex environments, and real-time efficiency. To address these challenges, the YOLO-LSN model proposed in this paper is designed to overcome the limitations of conventional approaches by striving for an effective balance among detection accuracy, model lightweightness, and adaptability to diverse mining-induced crack scenarios, thereby enhancing the overall practical performance of crack detection systems.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Proposed alogorithm</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YOLO-LSN network overview</emphasis></p><p>As shown in Fig. 1, YOLOv10 is an end-to-end real-time object detection model proposed by the Tsinghua University team in 2024. It aims to address the excessive reliance of the YOLO series on Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), thereby achieving more efficient inference performance. Its overall architecture follows the classical three-stage design of Backbone\u2013Neck\u2013Head. The backbone network consists of several key modules, including the Conv module, SCDown module, C2f module, C2f-CIB module, and the PSA self-attention mechanism, enabling efficient feature extraction and multi-scale information fusion. The neck adopts an FPN-PAN structure to integrate multi-scale features from the backbone. In the detection head, a lightweight decoupled design is employed, combined with a dual-assignment strategy, which effectively alleviates the performance bottleneck caused by overdependence on NMS in traditional YOLO models.</p><p>Based on the YOLOv10 architecture, we propose an improved model named YOLO-LSN (YOLO-Lightweight Structure for NWD). While maintaining the advantages of efficiency and an end-to-end structure, YOLO-LSN introduces three key enhancements targeting small object detection and crack recognition tasks:</p><p>In the backbone, YOLO-LSN inherits the structure of YOLOv10, fully retaining the C2f module and the multi-scale feature extraction path to ensure sufficient feature representation capability.</p><p>In the neck, we introduce the SPD-Conv module to enhance the P2 feature layer, improving the representation of small object features. The processed features are then fused with the P3 layer and further enhanced by the CSP-OmniKernel module, which strengthens the model\u2019s sensitivity to fine-grained crack features.</p><p>In the head, a Lightweight Dynamic Alignment Detection Head (LDADH) is designed to improve adaptability to cracks of varying scales and shapes, while significantly reducing model complexity to meet lightweight deployment requirements.</p><p>Additionally, we incorporate a loss function based on the Normalized Wasserstein Distance (NWD), which is more suitable for small object detection and effectively improves the localization accuracy for tiny targets.</p><p>Fig. 1</p><p>YOLO-LSN network architecture diagram.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lightweight dynamic alignment detection head (LDADH)</emphasis></p><p>Fig. 2</p><p>Structure Diagram of Lightweight Dynamic Alignment Detection Head (LDADH).</p><p>To address the challenges in mining-induced surface crack detection, such as complex crack shapes, significant scale differences, and the need for model lightweighting, we propose a Lightweight Dynamic Aligned Detection Head (LDADH), as shown in Fig. 2. The LDADH first employs a Shared Convolution module for multi-scale feature fusion. This module consists of two convolution layers with Group Normalization (GN) stacked together, achieving multi-level information fusion through feature concatenation, significantly reducing the model\u2019s parameter size. Traditional YOLO detection head convolution layers typically use Batch Normalization (BN). However, BN performs well in large-batch training but has limited effectiveness in small-batch scenarios, especially when high-resolution mining-induced surface crack images are used as input. Therefore, we replace BN with GN, where GN divides the feature channels into multiple groups (in this paper, Num_Groups = 16), and normalizes the mean and standard deviation independently within each group. As shown in Fig. 3, the case for Num_Groups = 3 is illustrated. The statistics in GN depend only on the group-wise channels and spatial dimensions of the current sample, eliminating the dependency on batch size, thereby maintaining stability during small-batch or single-sample training. Additionally, GN retains local dependencies between channels through the grouping strategy, enhancing the model\u2019s ability to capture fine-grained features.The core computational steps are as follows:</p><p>Grouping: The channel dimension C is divided into G groups, with each group containing C/G channels.</p><p>Statistics Calculation: For each group, the mean  and standard deviation  are calculated along the spatial dimensions (H, W) and within the channels of the group.</p><p>12</p><p>Normalization and Affine Transformation:</p><p>3 where  and  are the learnable affine parameters within the group.</p><p>Fig. 3</p><p>Illustration of group normalization.</p><p>The input features then pass through the Task Decoupling Module, which decomposes the input features into independent classification branches (ClsFeat) and regression branches (RegFeat) using a dynamic weight adjustment mechanism, in order to optimize object classification confidence and localization accuracy, respectively. Specifically, the input features are first processed by global average pooling45 to extract global context information. Then, they pass through two convolutional layers (La_conv1 and La_conv2) and nonlinear activation functions (ReLU and Sigmoid) to generate dynamic weights. These dynamic weights are element-wise multiplied with the convolutional kernel weights to generate task-specific kernels (Task-specific weights). After the convolution operation with the task-specific kernels, the features undergo group normalization and activation functions to further enhance feature representation. The decoupled classification features (ClsFeat) and regression features (RegFeat) are then output, which are used for object classification and localization tasks, respectively.</p><p>In the classification branch, the features pass through the Confidence Calculation module to generate classification probabilities (ClsProb), which are used to adaptively adjust the classification feature weights, ensuring that high-confidence objects correspond to high localization quality.This module consists of a two-stage convolutional structure. First, the decoupled intermediate feature feat is passed through a 1 \u00d7 1 convolutional layer to compress the channel dimension and extract discriminative semantic information across channels. Subsequently, a 3 \u00d7 3 convolutional layer is applied to fuse local spatial contextual features. The output is then activated by ReLU and Sigmoid functions to generate a normalized probability map ClsProb \u2208 [0, 1], which represents the confidence level of each pixel belonging to the foreground target.Based on this, the model performs an element-wise multiplication between the classification features (ClsFeat) and the classification probability (ClsProb) to construct an explicit task-alignment mechanism. This mechanism not only enhances the representation of high-confidence regions, but also effectively suppresses background noise and interference from low-confidence areas. As a result, it improves the consistency between classification scores and regression quality, thereby alleviating the conflict between classification and regression tasks.In the regression branch, the features first pass through the Spatial Offset Convolution module to generate the offsets (Offset) and masks (Mask), where the mask is constrained by a Sigmoid activation to limit the deformation range. Both are input to the dynamic deformable convolution (DyDCNv2) module, which adaptively adjusts the sampling locations and weights of the convolution kernels, achieving feature space alignment and receptive field optimization. The DyDCNv2 is formulated as:4</p><p>Where:  represents the input feature map;  denotes the sampling region of the convolution kernel;  is the coordinate of the sampling point within the sampling region;  is the weight of the convolution kernel at position;represents the learnable offset; and  is the learnable spatial weight.</p><p>To address the diverse shapes of mining-induced surface cracks (e.g., elongated, tortuous, or irregular shapes), DyDCNv2 dynamically adjusts the distribution of sampling points through learnable offsets, significantly improving the localization accuracy of irregular edges. In the final prediction phase, the regression features (RegFeat) are responsible for predicting the bounding box positions, while the classification features (ClsFeat) are responsible for predicting the object classes. To tackle the issue of extremely small crack targets being easily ignored in high-resolution mining-induced surface crack images (5472 \u00d7 3648 resolution), we introduce a Scale-Aware Module. Combined with the regression features (RegFeat), it enhances the model\u2019s ability to adapt to cracks of different scales through multi-scale feature fusion and dynamic adjustments.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Small object feature enhancement pyramid (SOFEP)</emphasis></p><p>Fig. 4</p><p>Structure diagram of small object feature enhancement pyramid.</p><p>In object detection tasks, the detection performance of small objects is often limited on traditional P3, P4, and P5 detection layers. Traditional solutions typically enhance the detection capability for small objects by introducing the P2 detection layer. However, this approach often leads to issues such as a significant increase in computational cost and extended post-processing time. To address this problem, we propose an improved feature pyramid structure based on FPN-PAN (Feature Pyramid Network-Path Aggregation Network), called the Small Object Feature Enhancement Pyramid (SOFEP). As shown in Fig. 4, this structure retains the original backbone architecture while introducing two key modules, SPD-Conv and CSP-OmniKernel, to fully exploit and semantically fuse the small-object information from the P2 layer, thereby enhancing the overall feature representation capability.Unlike the conventional approach of adding the P2 detection layer, we process the P2 feature layer using the SPD-Conv module to generate features rich in small-object information and fuse them with the P3 layer. SPD-Conv consists of Space-to-Depth (SPD) layers and stride-less convolution layers, replacing traditional strided convolutions and pooling operations. This retains more fine-grained information, significantly improving the model\u2019s performance in handling small-sized objects. As shown in Fig. 5, the case for scale = 2 is illustrated. The SPD-Conv process can be summarized by the following formula:</p><p>Space-to-Depth Transformation:5</p><p>Where each sub-feature map is composed of:6</p><p>and concatenated along the channel dimension.</p><p>Stride-less Convolution (stride = 1):7</p><p>which is used to reduce the number of channels while preserving feature information.</p><p>To further enhance feature representation, we combine the idea of CSPNet46 with the Omni-Kernel network based on image inpainting47, and propose the CSP-OmniKernel module. The CSP structure divides the input features into two parts: one part undergoes feature enhancement through the Omni-Kernel module, while the other part is directly retained as a residual connection. Finally, the features processed by the Omni-Kernel module are concatenated with the original features, preserving both global and local information. The Omni-Kernel module performs multi-scale feature extraction through a multi-branch structure, using 1 \u00d7 3, 3 \u00d7 1, and 3 \u00d7 3 convolution kernels to capture the horizontal, vertical, and global features of cracks, respectively, while 1 \u00d7 1 convolutions enhance local detail information.</p><p>To further improve sensitivity to cracks, the Omni-Kernel module introduces a Frequency Domain Gating Mechanism (FGM). This mechanism uses Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to convert features into the frequency domain, where frequency-domain attention dynamically enhances the high-frequency edge information of cracks while suppressing background texture interference. The features are then reconstructed back into the spatial domain using Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT). Additionally, the module incorporates Spatial Channel Attention (SCA)48 and Frequency Channel Attention (FCA)49 mechanisms, which dynamically adjust feature weights in both spatial and channel dimensions, highlighting key crack areas and enhancing the model\u2019s channel sensitivity to target features. Finally, multi-branch features are fused through residual connections, preventing gradient vanishing and accelerating model convergence, significantly improving the feature representation ability for small targets.</p><p>Fig. 5</p><p>Illustration of SPD-Conv (scale = 2).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NWD regression loss function</emphasis></p><p>To address the issues of gradient vanishing in zero-overlap scenarios and excessive sensitivity to small target position deviations in Intersection over Union (IoU)-based detection box similarity metrics, we introduce the NWD (Normalized Wasserstein Distance) regression loss function, which is more suitable for small-object detection. NWD models the bounding boxes as two-dimensional Gaussian distributions and calculates the normalized Wasserstein distance between the two distributions to assess their similarity. This approach better captures the subtle differences of small objects, thereby improving the model\u2019s localization accuracy.</p><p>Firstly, the modeling of a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution is performed by representing the bounding box as a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution. The bounding box , where  are the coordinates of the center of the bounding box, and  and are the width and height of the bounding box, respectively. The commonly used formula for a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution is:8</p><p>where ,, with =(x, y) representing the coordinates of the Gaussian distribution, and denoting the matrix transpose. and  represent the mean vector and covariance matrix of the Gaussian distribution, respectively.</p><p>Next, the normalized Gaussian distance is calculated. After modeling, the Gaussian distribution is denoted as , with the formula.After modeling, the Gaussian distribution is denoted as  for , and the Gaussian distance between these two bounding boxes is calculated using the following formula:9</p><p>The distance formula is normalized to the similarity measure formula as follows:10</p><p>However, using only the NWD loss function can slow down the convergence speed of the model. Therefore, considering this, we combine the IoU loss function and the NWD loss function through a weighted sum to form a new regression loss function. The formula is as follows:11</p><p>This loss function significantly enhances the model\u2019s localization ability for small targets and demonstrates stronger adaptability and accuracy in complex scenarios.</p><p>Meanwhile, to further validate the effectiveness of the NWD regression loss in small object detection tasks, We conducted a comparative study to evaluate the detection performance under three different regression loss configurations: (1) a baseline scheme using only the traditional IoU regression loss; (2) a scheme that completely replaces IoU with NWD for bounding box regression; and (3) a joint loss scheme proposed in this study, which combines IoU and NWD through weighted fusion.</p><p>The experiments were conducted on a self-constructed dataset of mining-induced surface crack images. Evaluation metrics include mAP@0.5 and mAP@0.5:0.95, with the results presented in Table 1.</p><p>Table 1</p><p>Comparative experiments on three different loss functions.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"296\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"112\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"208\"/><thead><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">Loss Function Type</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\">mAP@0.5</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\">mAP@0.5:0.95</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">loU</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.486</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.265</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">NWD</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.381</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.18</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">loU + NWD</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.497</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.27</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>The experimental results show that using the NWD loss alone yields lower accuracy compared to IoU, while the combined IoU and NWD loss achieves the best performance on both mAP@0.5 and mAP@0.5:0.95, reaching 0.497 and 0.270 respectively. This effectively improves small object detection performance and validates the advantage of the joint regression strategy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Experiment and analysis</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Experimental environment and training parameter settings</emphasis></p><p>In this experiment, the CPU used is an AMD R7-7840 H, and the GPU is an NVIDIA 4060 with 8GB of VRAM.

The model\u2019s complexity is measured by the number of parameters and floating-point operations (FLOPs). True Positives (TPs) refer to cases where both the prediction and the actual label are positive. False Negatives (FNs) occur when the actual label is positive but the prediction is negative, while False Positives (FPs) occur when the actual label is negative but the prediction is positive. True Negatives (TNs) represent cases where both the prediction and the actual label are negative. The formulas for calculating precision and recall are as follows:1112</p><p>Intersection over Union (IoU) is a commonly used evaluation metric in object detection and image segmentation, used to measure the overlap between the predicted bounding box and the ground truth box. It is calculated by dividing the area of intersection between the predicted box and the ground truth box by the area of their union. The IoU value ranges from 0 to 1, with a higher value indicating a greater overlap between the predicted result and the ground truth. The formula for calculating IoU is as follows:13</p><p>The overall performance of a model is typically measured by Average Precision (AP), which represents the prediction accuracy above a specific IoU threshold. The calculation of AP involves precision and recall, and the AP value is the area under the precision-recall (P-R) curve. The mean average precision (mAP) is the average of the AP scores across all classes. mAP@0.5 refers to the average precision when the IoU threshold is 0.5, while mAP@0.5:0.95 refers to the average precision across multiple IoU thresholds ranging from 0.5 to 0.95. The formula for calculating mAP is as follows:14</p><p>In addition, to evaluate the model\u2019s real-time performance in practical application scenarios, Frames Per Second (FPS) was introduced as an evaluation metric. FPS indicates the number of image frames the model can process per second; a higher value implies faster detection speed and stronger real-time capability. This metric is particularly crucial for lightweight detection models deployed in resource-constrained environments, such as edge computing or mobile devices.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Experimental results and analysis</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Comparative experiments</emphasis></p><p>In the comparative experiments on the self-built mining-induced surface crack image dataset and the VisDrone2019 dataset, we evaluated the performance of several YOLO series models, and their detection results are shown in Figs. 10 and 11.

Specifically, the Precision is 19.8%, 11.2%, and 2.6% higher than Faster-RCNN (0.341), YOLOv5n (0.427), and YOLOv11n (0.513), respectively. The Recall is 3.9% points higher than YOLOv11n (0.369), demonstrating the dual advantage of YOLO-LSN in both accuracy and object detection capability.</p><p>Although YOLO-LSN demonstrates leading performance in both precision and recall, there is still room for further improvement. On one hand, the current precision is 0.539, indicating the presence of some false positives, which could potentially be reduced by incorporating more powerful classification structures and attention mechanisms to suppress background interference. On the other hand, although the recall rate is the highest among compared models, it remains below 0.5, suggesting limitations in detecting small or occluded objects. Enhancing the feature extraction architecture and introducing strategies such as Soft-NMS may improve the detector\u2019s coverage in complex background scenarios.</p><p>In terms of mAP@0.5, YOLO-LSN achieved a score of 0.422, surpassing several models, including YOLOv10n (0.378), YOLOv11n (0.383), and the current mainstream lightweight model YOLOv5n (0.310), demonstrating its excellent detection capability under a single IoU threshold. More importantly, under the more stringent mAP@0.5:0.95 metric, YOLO-LSN reached 0.249, not only outperforming YOLOv11n (0.225) and YOLOv10n (0.222), but also significantly surpassing YOLOv5n (0.179) and PVswin-YOLOv8s (0.204), indicating its outstanding robustness and generalization ability under different IoU conditions.</p><p>YOLO-LSN has a parameter count of only 2.3 M, whereas YOLOv10n and YOLOv11n have 2.71 M and 2.59 M parameters, respectively, and Faster-RCNN has as many as 42.36 M parameters. This significant parameter compression reduces model storage and computational resource consumption while maintaining or even improving performance, making it more advantageous for deployment in edge devices and real-time detection scenarios.</p><p>Compared to the YOLOv8 series (e.g., PVswin-YOLOv8s), YOLO-LSN improved by 7.0% in mAP@0.5 and 4.5% in mAP@0.5:0.95, with fewer parameters (2.3 M vs. 2.71 M). When compared to lightweight models such as YOLOv7-tiny and YOLOv5n, YOLO-LSN outperforms in precision, recall, and mAP, further confirming that the design of YOLO-LSN achieves a good balance between efficiency and accuracy.</p><p>YOLO-LSN outperforms other comparative models on the VisDrone2019 dataset, especially excelling in key metrics such as Precision, Recall, and mean Average Precision (mAP). This result demonstrates that our model not only performs well in small object detection tasks in specific scenarios, such as mining-induced surface crack images, but also achieves significant improvements in small object detection from UAV perspectives. This proves the practical value of the proposed method in UAV aerial image object detection and model lightweighting.</p><p>The results of the ablation experiments in this section demonstrate the following:</p><p>The NWD regression loss effectively improves localization accuracy for small object detection without increasing the number of parameters. The SOFEP module, by incorporating SPD-Conv and CSP-OmniKernel structures, significantly enhances feature representation capabilities, leading to an overall improvement in the mAP metrics. The LDADH detection head reduces parameter count substantially through shared convolution while improving adaptability to multi-scale targets.</p><p>As a result of the synergistic integration of these three components, the proposed model achieves mAP@0.5 and mAP@0.5:0.95 scores of 0.544 and 0.278, respectively, with a 17% reduction in parameter count. These findings validate the effectiveness and practicality of the combined strategy of lightweight design, feature enhancement, and regression optimization for small object detection in complex backgrounds.</p><p>Fig. 11</p><p>Comparison of Detection Results on the VisDrone2019 Dataset by YOLOv8n, YOLOv10n, 612and YOLO-LSN.

Without increasing the parameter count, this module boosted the mAP@0.5:0.95 from 0.265 to 0.27, indicating its optimization effect on bounding box regression for small objects. Meanwhile, the Recall metric increased from 0.424 to 0.428, further validating that this module enables more accurate capture of object locations.</p><p>After the introduction of the SOFEP module, the model\u2019s mAP@0.5 and mAP@0.5:0.95 improved significantly, reaching 0.502 and 0.272, respectively. This result confirms that the SOFEP module, as discussed in Sect. 3.3, effectively enhances feature representation capability and generates discriminative features rich in small-object information. Although the parameter count increased to 3.01 M, it represents a 26.8% reduction compared to directly adding the P2 detection layer (which has 4.11 M parameters).</p><p>When the LDADH module is introduced alone, the model\u2019s precision slightly decreases, but the parameter count is reduced by 26.5% compared to the baseline model. This indicates that the shared convolution module used in LDADH significantly reduces the model\u2019s parameter count. At the same time, mAP@0.5 increases to 0.496, further suggesting that the LDADH module enhances the model\u2019s ability to adapt to cracks of different scales through multi-scale feature fusion and dynamic adjustment.</p><p>When the three modules are combined, mAP@0.5 increases to 0.544 and mAP@0.5:0.95 increases to 0.278, representing improvements of 12% and 4.9%, respectively, compared to the baseline model. The parameter count is reduced by 17%. This result validates the effectiveness of the collaborative work of lightweight design (LDADH), feature enhancement (SOFEP), and metric optimization (NWD), especially for small object detection tasks in complex backgrounds.</p><p>As shown in Fig. 12, the feature extraction maps for small and medium-scale targets are displayed by adding different improvement modules to the YOLOv10n baseline model. We observe that the original YOLOv10n model has weak feature extraction capabilities for small objects, with sparse response areas and some blurred crack features (as shown in the first row of Fig. 12 (a) and (b)). After the NWD module is added alone to the baseline model (as shown in the second row of Fig. 12 (a) and (b)), the response in the target areas is significantly enhanced, particularly in small crack regions, with more highlighted areas, indicating that the module can more accurately capture the small target positions. After introducing the SOFEP module (as shown in the third row of Fig. 12 (a)), the extracted features are clearer and more densely packed compared to the baseline model, indicating that the SPD-Conv module in SOFEP effectively retains fine-grained target features. At the same time, the CSP-OmniKernel module proposed in SOFEP further enhances feature representation ability (as shown in Fig. 12 (b) in the third row). After integrating both the NWD and SOFEP modules (as shown in the fourth row of Fig. 12 (a) and (b)), the response in the target areas is significantly stronger and more densely distributed, with the extracted features becoming more comprehensive. This validates the superiority of the collaborative work between the NWD and SOFEP modules.</p><p>Fig. 12</p><p>Comparison of feature extraction for small and medium-scale targets under different improvement modules.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conclusion</emphasis></p><p>We designed an efficient and lightweight small object detection model based on the improved YOLO architecture, called YOLO-LSN. This model effectively addresses the challenges in detecting small cracks, complex crack shapes, significant scale differences, and the high background interference in UAV aerial mining-induced surface crack image detection. Specifically, we proposed two innovative plug-and-play modules (LDADH and SOFEP). The Lightweight Dynamic Alignment Detection Head (LDADH) module effectively tackles issues related to complex crack shapes and significant scale differences, enhancing the network\u2019s ability in multi-scale feature fusion, feature space alignment, and dynamic adjustment of the receptive field. Ablation experiment results show that when this module is introduced alone, the parameter count decreases by 26.5% compared to the baseline model, meeting the lightweight requirement. The Small Object Feature Enhancement Pyramid (SOFEP) module uses SPD-Conv to extract fine-grained features from the P2 layer and fuses them with P3 layer features, while also integrating the CSP-OmniKernel module, which combines global perception, large kernel convolutions, and local branches. This improves the network\u2019s ability in fine-grained feature capture and feature representation. To address the limitations of IoU (sensitivity to zero overlap, insensitivity to size deviation), we introduced the weighted combination of the NWD regression loss function and the IoU loss function, enabling more accurate capture of small target positions and improving the model\u2019s localization accuracy. We constructed a mining-induced surface crack image dataset, and experimental results show that YOLO-LSN achieves a mAP50 of 0.544 on this dataset, a 12% improvement over the baseline, while reducing the parameter count by 17%, surpassing several mainstream models. Additionally, testing on the VisDrone2019 public dataset shows that the model achieves a mAP50 of 0.422, an 11.6% improvement over the baseline, which fully demonstrates the practical value of the proposed method in UAV aerial object detection and model lightweighting.</p><p>Despite achieving good results on the mining-induced surface crack image dataset, YOLO-LSN still has some limitations: Under extreme lighting conditions (e.g., strong shadows, reflections) or highly cluttered backgrounds (e.g., vegetation coverage), the detection accuracy of small target cracks may decrease, and further optimization of the model\u2019s resistance to interference is needed.Although the model has been made lightweight, when deployed on low-power edge devices (e.g., UAV-mounted terminals), the processing frame rate for high-resolution images may not meet real-time monitoring requirements, necessitating a trade-off between accuracy and speed.</p><p>In the next step, we will explore multi-modal data fusion to enhance robustness in complex environments, while further compressing the model and accelerating inference. Additionally, we plan to construct a larger-scale cross-scenario crack dataset and incorporate self-supervised pre-training to enhance generalization. Based on our in-depth research and experimental validation, future work will continue to deepen the theoretical innovations and practical applications of small target crack detection in UAV aerial imagery, aiming to provide more efficient, accurate, and real-time intelligent detection solutions for fields such as mining safety monitoring and geological disaster early warning.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><p>[1].Gong, X.

Accurate information on sediment yield and soil erosion risk within watersheds is essential for developing effective management strategies. This study aimed to estimate soil loss in the Upper Gilgel Abay catchment using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The observed daily sediment data were utilized for the calibration and validation of the model outputs. Calibration and validation were performed for the periods 2002\u20132015 and 2016\u20132021, respectively. Sensitivity analysis identified the most influential parameters affecting soil loss estimates. </p><p>The model performance was quite satisfactory. The coefficient of determination (R2) was 0.69 for the calibration and 0.67 for the validation of sediment yield. Over the past 18 years, the Gilgel Abay catchment experienced approximately 1.5\u00a0billion tons of soil loss, with spatial analysis revealing soil loss rates of up to 53.88 t/ha/year, particularly in the upper catchment. The maximum and minimum annual sediment yields at the outlet of the catchment were 318, 233 tons, and 61,575 tons per year, respectively. On average 184,695 tons of soil leave the catchment annually. While the model provided an acceptable level of the average basin-wide soil loss, certain areas exhibited severe erosion. These findings underscore the urgent need for targeted soil conservation practices, such as terracing, reforestation, and sustainable land management, to mitigate soil degradation and enhance catchment sustainability.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>According to the Global Soil Partnership hosted by FAO, arable land loses 75 billion tons of soil each year, which is equal to a USD 400 billion loss in the economy1. Approximately 36 billion tons of soil is lost worldwide each year, as per the latest estimates2. The rate of soil erosion in the world is between 12 and 15 t ha-1 y-13. It shows that the removal of the top layer 0.96 to 1.2 mm annually, resulting in losses of between US$64 and US$80 billion4. Soil erosion accelerates the occurrence of land degradation in tropical regions such as the Ethiopian highlands. It has a negative consequence for food security, agricultural productivity and sustainable management of natural resources5,6.</p><p>Ethiopia has extremely high rates of soil erosion, with the highlands losing roughly 3.5 billion tons of soil per year, 1.5 billion of which depart the nation through its rivers. Ethiopia\u2019s environmental issue is grave and ongoing due to soil erosion. Due to Ethiopia\u2019s uneven topography, soil erosion is a major environmental problem that has a substantial effect on agricultural productivity and the long-term viability of those areas7,8. The critical nature of this problem has been revealed by recent investigations. For instance, a synthesis of modeling and plot-level research by Tadesse et al.9 demonstrated that assessments of soil erosion in Ethiopia have attracted a lot of interest in the past 40 years. The study underscored the importance of boosting watershed and plot-level monitoring, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. Furthermore, the lower Baro watershed\u2019s shifting land cover a reduction in wetlands, shrubland, rangeland, and forest land, and an increase in built-up regions, agricultural land, and water bodies have had a substantial impact on hydrological variables10.</p><p>Sedimentation in downstream or sediment deposition in the reservoirs is a serious off-site impact of soil erosion as it shortens the reservoir\u2019s design life and reduces the dams\u2019 sustainability11. Sediments are frequently seen as an unfavorable but unavoidable side effect of water storage. Reservoir sedimentation results in an annual loss of 2% of the intended storage volume12. In addition to affecting the quality of water bodies, the erosion of the catchments\u2019 most fertile soils reduces their capacity to hold water through the sedimentation process13.</p><p>Water-induced soil erosion continues to be the primary driver of land degradation, making it the most significant environmental issue in the world. Additionally, a lack of appropriate erosion prevention measures and an increase in farming activities are major contributors to this issue14,15. To estimate runoff-induced soil erosion, soil erosion models are frequently used worldwide, such as the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and its updated version Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), the European Soil Erosion Model (Euro SEM) the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP)7. The updated version of the Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) has limitations, including the result obtained using this model mainly depending on the input data given by the expert during processing, which could be affected by personal bias and error16. Accelerated erosion via sheet and rill erosion results in a deposition in lake Tana17. Globally, the SWAT model has been effectively used for determining the extent to which Soil and Water Conservation (SWC) methods reduce runoff, reduce soil erosion, and increase groundwater recharge18. The SWAT model effectively simulates hydrological and sediment processes allowing for the identification of erosion hotspots and application of effective conservation measures19. Studies conducted in the Hombole, Weyb and Gidabo, watersheds have validated SWAT\u2019s performance in quantifying soil erosion and sediment yield20,21. In Ethiopia, research combining the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) with geospatial technologies in various watersheds has emphasized the critical role of vegetation covers and proper land-use management in reducing soil erosion22. According to Gebresamuel et al.23, these models have been used in studies carried out in similar watersheds, like the Chamo basin in Southern Ethiopia. Furthermore, a study by Leta et al.24 utilized the SWAT model to estimate sediment yield and soil erosion in the Nashe watershed, Ethiopia. This research identified key areas contributing to sediment and assessed the total amount of soil loss in the watershed. In this case, identifying the priority locations for intervention and assessing the effectiveness of soil conservation measures have been made possible by the application of the SWAT model.</p><p>The upper Gilgel Abay catchment faces a land degradation problem with soil erosion from upstream and subsequent sedimentation in the downstream area. Due to its complicated terrain, the upper Gilgel Abay catchment is particularly vulnerable to soil erosion, which could be exacerbated by several factors such as high rates of wind and water erosion, overgrazing, high rainfall variability, high rainfall intensity, and heavy rainfall25. Even though this issue is critical, prior research has mostly concentrated on general evaluations of soil erosion in the area, paying little thought to the regional variations in erosion risk and sedimentation mechanisms. Prior research has primarily used empirical models to conduct generalized assessments of soil erosion. For instance, Bewket and Teferi26 used remote sensing data to perform a qualitative assessment of land degradation based on changes in land use and land cover, while Gelagay and Minale27 used the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) combined with GIS and satellite imagery to estimate annual soil loss around Koga watershed. Despite their value, these studies frequently lack spatially explicit modeling of the dynamics of sediment yield and routing, particularly at the catchment outlet. As a result, the accurate determination of the risk of soil erosion and the amount of sediment at the outlet is essential for sustainable watershed management. Estimation of soil loss effectively and conveniently, evaluating the risk of soil erosion, and applying conservation measures become an urgent task. This study attempts to fill this gap by using high-resolution remote sensing data and the SWAT model to determine the risk of soil erosion, calculate the amount of sediment deposited at the outlet, and locate the Upper Gilgel Abay catchment\u2019s priority areas for conservation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Materials and methods</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Study area description</emphasis></p><p>The upper Gilgel Abay catchment, which corresponds to the gauged portion of the Gilgel Abay river basin, is one of the major tributaries of Ethiopia\u2019s lake Tana basin. It encompasses a total area of 163,557.31 ha. It is located at 10\u00b0 56\u2032 53\u2033 to 11\u00b0 21\u2032 58\u2033N latitudes and 36\u00b0 49\u2032 29\u2033 to 37\u00b0 23\u2032 34\u2033E longitudes17,28 (Fig. 1).</p><p>The southern and southeastern regions of the catchment consist of highlands with mountain ranges, whereas the northern edge, despite being at a high altitude, is relatively flat compared to the rest of the area29. The elevation varies from 1883 m a.s.l. to 3511 m a.s.l. The mean annual precipitation in the Upper Gilgel Abay catchment is approximately 1400 mm and the mean daily minimum and maximum temperatures range between 15 \u00b0C and 23 \u00b0C on average17,30. Andosols, Luvisols, and Vertisols are the three main soil orders in the catchment31.</p><p>The natural vegetation in the Upper Gilgel Abay catchment is represented by Cordia africana, Juniperus procera, Croton macrostachyus, Rumex nervosus Vahl, Carissa spinarum, Dodonaea angustifolia, Olea europaea, and Rosa abyssinica Lindley32. Cropland dominates the Gilgel Abay catchment, with a few scattered forests and forested peaks. Grassland, marshes, and woodland with regular areas of shrubs and eucalyptus forests are the predominant land cover types, aside from cultivated fields28.</p><p>Fig. 1</p><p>Location map of the study area. The map was produced using ArcGIS (Version 10.8.2, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis10.8.2\">https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis10.8.2</url>).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The SWAT model</emphasis></p><p>SWAT is a hydrological model developed by the USDA to predict how different land management practices will affect agricultural productivity33. The model utilizes spatial data from geospatial technologies, incorporating an integrated physical framework that considers different factors such as climate, topography, soil properties and land use and management practices34. The SWAT model, selected for its flexibility and strong performance in hydrological studies, has been widely utilized to simulate runoff, evaluate the effects of climate and land-use changes, and aid in water resource management across various environmental and agro-climatic settings35. During modeling, the catchment was separated into several sub-catchments to reduce the running time and help get accurate results36. The water balance equation was applied to determine the hydrological process occurring in the catchment Eq. (1)33.1</p><p>Where SW1 is the final water content of the soil (mm), SW0 is the soil initial soil water content on day i (mm), E\u03b1 is the evapotranspiration on a day i (mm), R is the precipitation on day i (mm), Wseeg is the water entering from the soil profile on a day i (mm), Qsurf the surface runoff on day i (mm), and Qgd is the return flow on a day i (mm)37.</p><p>Soil erosion and sediment yield was estimated using a modified version of the universal soil loss equation (MUSLE). Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE) predict sediment yield as a function of runoff factor on a given day38. MUSLE is applied in SWAT by assuming a basic hydrograph shape to estimate daily runoff volume and peak flow rate within each sub-watershed, which is then used to predict changes in runoff erosive energy. SWAT calculates sediment yield as total sediment load and as fractions of sand, silt, and clay for each sub-watershed Eq. (2)39.2</p><p>Where A represents the sediment yield (metric tons), Qsurf the surface runoff (mm per hectare), qpeak the peak rate of runoff (m3/s), Ahru the hydrologic response unit area (hectares), K the soil erodibility factor, C the cover and management factor, P the support practice factor, LS the slope length and steepness factor, and Cfrg the coarse fragment40.</p><p>The SWAT model was selected as an effective model for forecasting soil erosion and sediment yield for the following reasons41. SWAT considers the entire water system of the catchment while RUSLE focuses on estimating soil erosion on individual plots. It considers the spatial variability of the physio-chemical properties of the soil and the land use activities practiced in the area allowing for a comprehensive analysis of water resources and sediment yield. It considers the complexity of the catchment and relies on the detailed knowledge of climate data, soil properties as well as vegetation cover in the catchment. It is computationally efficient, easily accessible and unrestricted42. SWAT is used in a wide range of Ethiopian scenarios (suitable and yielded positive results)33.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SWAT model input data and sources</emphasis></p><p>The catchment boundary and catchment slope were created using SRTM 1 Arc-Second Global DEM (30 m) obtained from the USGS website (Table 1).

The daily climatic data required by SWAT for simulation were obtained from the National Meteorological Institute of Ethiopia. The climatic data were taken from four meteorological stations, including Sekela, Durbet, Gilgel Abay and Adis Alem stations. Each station provided data on precipitation, as well as maximum and minimum temperatures, as shown in Table 2. The record period spans from January 2001 to December 2021, except for the Sekela station, which covers 2001\u20132018, with missing data from 2019 to 2021 filled using CHIRPS. Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) is a high-resolution rainfall dataset developed by the Climate Hazards Group at the University of California, Santa Barbara. It integrates ground-based station data with satellite imagery to generate reliable precipitation estimates. CHIRPS offers quasi-global coverage (50\u00b0S\u201350\u00b0N) from 1981 to the present, with a spatial resolution of 0.05\u00b0 (~ 5 km) and temporal resolutions of daily, pentadal, and monthly. It is particularly useful in regions with limited ground data and is freely available at (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/data/chirps\">https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/data/chirps</url>). According to Bennett43, The CHIRPS dataset, derived from rain gauge measurements and satellite observations, demonstrated the highest performance among the open-access precipitation products reviewed, as evaluated using scatterplots and correlation coefficients. This included comparisons with products such as CFSR and ERA5. CHIRPS was also employed to address missing values in some climatic variables at individual stations. Before integration into the model, the weather data underwent quality control procedures, including the detection of missing or inconsistent values. In cases of data gaps, CHIRPS precipitation data was specifically employed to fill missing records for individual stations, ensuring the continuity and reliability of the weather dataset for the simulation. The final step in handling weather data involved formatting all climate datasets into SWAT-compatible input files (i.e., text files).</p><p>Table 2</p><p>Meteorological stations and the availability of Climatic data.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"10\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col7\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col8\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col9\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col10\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><thead><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" morerows=\"1\">Station name</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\" morerows=\"1\">Long (deg)</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\" morerows=\"1\">Lat (deg)</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\" morerows=\"1\">Year</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col5\" nameend=\"col10\" namest=\"col5\">Data type</entry></row><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col5\">Precipitation</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col6\">Max. temperature</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col7\">Min. temperature</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col8\">Wind speed</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col9\">Solar radiation</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col10\">Relative humidity</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">DURB</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">37.43</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">10.99</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">2001?2021</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col8\"/><entry colname=\"col9\"/><entry colname=\"col10\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">SEKL</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">37.21</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">10.98</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">2001?2018</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col8\"/><entry colname=\"col9\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col10\">?</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">GLGA</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">37.04</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">11.37</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">2001?2021</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col8\"/><entry colname=\"col9\"/><entry colname=\"col10\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">ADAL</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">37.05</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">11.02</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">2001?2021</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col8\"/><entry colname=\"col9\"/><entry colname=\"col10\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Soil data</emphasis></p><p>Soil data including soil physio-chemical properties is also one of the key inputs of the SWAT model.

Six land use classes and a new schema were generated using the extracted imagery under the imagery tab in the ArcGIS Pro training sample manager. Schema and training sample points were saved. After saving the classification schema and training points, the extracted imagery was selected. Under the imagery tab in the classification tools, the \u2018Classify Images\u2019 option was used, and the Maximum Likelihood Classification algorithm was applied to classify the image. The training samples were added, and the classification was performed by specifying the output directory21. After classifying the image small errors in the classification results were edited to individual features or objects by creating a polygon on the classified image and replacing the first land use type with the new land use types using a reclassifier in the classification tool (Fig. 3). After the accurate land use classification, a lookup table was prepared for each land use and land cover type having four-letter codes recommended by SWAT to make the land use name compatible with the model.

The resulting slope raster was subsequently utilized as one of the key input layers for the soil erosion and sediment yield modeling. The slope classes were determined based on commonly accepted terrain classification standards used in land evaluation and watershed management, following Morgan44. The catchment was divided into five slope classes: 0\u20135% (flat), 5\u201315% (smooth to undulating), 15\u201330% (steep/undulating), 30\u201340% (moderately steep), and &gt; 40% (steep slopes).

The daily streamflow data, provided by the Ministry of Water and Energy, Ethiopia, covered the period from 2002 to 2021. In cases where continuous sediment data were unavailable, the sediment rating curve was used to generate time-step data17,21,45,46. The continuous daily time step sediment yield was calculated by using the sediment rating curve equation Eq. 348.3</p><p>where Qs is sediment load (ton/day) and Q is streamflow (m3/s), a and b are empirical constants determined by regression analysis.</p><p>To estimate daily sediment yield from streamflow data, a sediment yield rating curve was constructed using the available sediment concentration records. Due to the discontinuous nature of the sediment data, a discharge-sediment rating curve with an R\u00b2 of 0.90 was developed. A power equation was applied to establish a logarithmic relationship between discharge and sediment yield (Fig. 5). Similar methodologies have been successfully implemented in other Ethiopian watersheds, including the Andasa watershed47 and Ribb Reservoir Eq. (4)48.4</p><p>where Qs is sediment load (ton/day) and Q is streamflow (m3 /s).</p><p>Fig. 5</p><p>Sediment rating curve.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Model setup</emphasis></p><p>SWAT + version 2.1.1 of the QGIS interface, QSWAT + was used to perform the analysis. The first procedure in a simulation of the SWAT model was watershed delineation. Projected SRTM 1 Arc-Second Global DEM data with 30 m resolution was used to delineate the catchment boundary. After generating flow direction and flow accumulation using the anticipated SRTM 1 Arc-Second Global DEM, SWAT automatically defined the streams. It then created the catchment boundary once the outlet and inlet definitions were provided40. The study area was divided into 99 smaller sub-basins, as shown in (Fig. 6). The characteristics of each sub-basin were then determined before proceeding with the Hydrological Response Unit (HRU) analysis. According to the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), an HRU represents a unique combination of soil properties, land use, and slope characteristics that aims to decrease the variability of the landscape. Each sub-basin was separated into HRUs, resulting in a total of 99 HRUs, which means each sub-basin corresponds to one HRU. This ensures that both HRUs and sub-basins share the same boundaries but are characterized by their distinct environmental features, such as land use, soil properties, and slope characteristics. The thresholds of 20% slope, 10% soil, and 20% land use, as recommended by Winchell et al.49, were used to exclude minor land use, soil, and slope types. A total of 99 HRUs were generated. After the generation of HRU the climate data prepared in the SWAT input format for each station were imported into the model.</p><p>The upper Gilgel Abay catchment has been subdivided into 99 HRUs and sub-basins (Table 4). The catchment was divided into six primary land use categories and six key soil types. Agriculture makes up almost 67% of the watershed, while forest and shrubland make up about 21 and 7%, respectively. The primary soil type is Andosols accounting for 65%, followed by Vertisols (18%) and Leptosols (16%). The catchment\u2019s slope is rated as gentle to moderate on 68% of the area, while 31% is classified as steep to extremely steep. Figure 7 clearly shows the general workflow of the study. Sensitivity analysis is an essential method for identifying parameters that have a substantial impact on model outputs50. It offers valuable insights into which parameters most influence the variation in outputs resulting from input variability51. Sensitivity analysis was performed separately for both streamflow and sediment yield to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the model\u2019s performance. Sensitivity analysis was conducted using the SWAT-CUP tool with the Sequential Uncertainty Fitting Algorithm Version 2 (SUFI-2). Following the sensitivity analysis, the model was calibrated and validated using the SWAT-CUP tool with the SUFI-2 algorithm. Calibration was based on daily observed streamflow and sediment data from the Gilgel Abay gauge station for the period 2002\u20132015, while validation was conducted for 2016\u20132021.</p><p>Table 4</p><p>HRUs report for the Gilgel Abay catchment.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"336\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"136\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"64\"/><thead><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">Number of HRUs:Number of sub-basins:Watershed area(ha):</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\">9999163,557.31 ha</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\"/><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"/><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\"/><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\">Area (ha)</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\">Area (%)</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Land use type</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Agriculture</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">109,852.7</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">67.16</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Forest land</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">34,966.9</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">21.38</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Shrubs</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">11,846.4</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">7.24</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Grasses</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">4988.7</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">3.05</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Settlements</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1379.3</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.84</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Water body</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">523.3</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.32</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Soil type</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Andosols</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">106,582.6</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">65.16</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Vertisols</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">29,981.5</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">18.33</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Leptosols</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">26,450.1</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">16.17</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Luvisols</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">519.8</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.317</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Cambisols</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">21.8</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.013</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Slope class (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0?5</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">44,439.6</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">27.2</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">5?15</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">67,212.8</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">41.1</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">15?30</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">32,930.9</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">20.1</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">30?40</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">8804.3</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">5.4</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">&gt; 40</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">10164.8</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">6.2</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Fig. 6</p><p>Sub-catchments.

Sensitivity analysis was conducted using the SWAT-CUP tool, employing the Sequential Uncertainty Fitting Algorithm Version 2 (SUFI-2). In line with Yang et al.57, multiple iterations were performed to ensure the robustness and reliability of the optimized parameter values. As a result, several parameters were identified as sensitive, showing significant influence on the model outputs. Sensitivity analysis was carried out separately for both streamflow and sediment yield, and the most responsive parameters along with their corresponding t-stat and p-values are presented in (Table 6). The t-statistic values are used to assess the sensitivity of the parameters, with larger absolute t-stat values indicating greater sensitivity. This means that parameters with higher absolute t-stat values have a more substantial influence on the model\u2019s output. On the other hand, p-values are used to determine the statistical significance of the sensitivity. A parameter is considered significant if its p-value is close to 0, indicating that the observed effect is unlikely due to random chance and that the parameter significantly affects the model\u2019s behavior58. In the SWAT model calibration process, particularly when using tools like SWAT-CUP, specific qualifiers such as v_, r_, and a_ are used to define how model parameters are adjusted. The prefix v_ indicates that the existing parameter value will be replaced by a new value within a specified range. The r_ qualifier signifies a relative change, meaning the parameter value is adjusted by a specified percentage of its original value. This is useful for scaling parameters proportionally. In contrast, the a_ qualifier denotes an absolute change, where a fixed value is added to or subtracted from the original parameter value.

The estimated mean annual values of soil loss varied between 0.15 tons ha-1 year-1 in the relatively flat northern areas to steep slope portions exceeding 53.88 tons ha-1 year-1. The average yearly loss of soil from the basin is 86,415,499 tons. The generated average annual soil loss is grouped into very severe, severe, moderate, slight and very slight60, 61\u201362 (Fig. 10). The classification shows that 13876.97 ha, which covers 8.48% of the total catchment, was classified under the very severe soil erosion class. Further, a total of 24487.5 ha, which represents 14.97% of the catchment, was classified into the severe level of the soil erosion classification. The moderate level of severity class was assigned to 19.94% of the catchment area. The remaining 42.5% and 14.1% are under the slight and very slight levels of soil erosion, respectively (Table 9). Thus, the results revealed that 38364.47 ha of the catchment are in the very severe and severe erosion classes, covering 23.45% of the total catchment. Such soil loss rates have been recorded in places of somewhat steep terrain as well as in regions where the original forest cover has been converted to agricultural land and degraded bushland. The largest part of the catchment, covering 67.2% of the total area, is agricultural land and the farmers are relying on crops. The sub-watersheds within the study area are labeled numerically on the map to improve clarity. The points displayed in Fig. 10 correspond to the outlets of the river reaches within the catchment. These reaches play a critical role in the routing of water, and sediment33.</p><p>The upper part of the Upper Gilgel Abay catchment is significantly affected by soil erosion, particularly on agricultural land. This is driven by intensive farming practices, deforestation, poor land management, and the conversion of forests into croplands. Additional contributors include over-cultivation, overgrazing, farming on steep slopes, and forest fires caused by human activity. These factors collectively degrade soil fertility, cause reservoir siltation, and reduce agricultural productivity. The area\u2019s rugged and undulating topography further exacerbates erosion, placing much of the catchment under severe to very severe erosion levels. Based on the spatial distribution of erosion severity and the identified driving factors, appropriate soil and water conservation measures should be implemented such as contour farming, agroforestry, and conservation tillage; restoring degraded forest areas through reforestation; restricting agricultural activities on steep slopes; and introducing controlled grazing systems to prevent overgrazing.</p><p>Fenta et al.63. , found that yearly soil loss in Ethiopia\u2019s major river basins was estimated to be 1.9 billion tons/year, and sediment yield was 410 million tons/year. The rate of soil erosion exceeds the acceptance level change with the basin characteristics, causes reservoir siltation, and affects human beings\u2019 lives64,65.</p><p>In contrast to previous reports conducted in Ethiopia, the mean annual soil loss rate estimated at the northwestern highland of Ethiopia by Zeleke66 which is 243 t ha-1 year-1 was much higher than this result; and this result is also smaller than 93 ton ha-1 year-1 found at Chemoga watershed by Bewket and Teferi26, 84 t ha-1 year-1 estimated at northwestern Ethiopia by Selassie and Belay67, and in line with those reported as 47.4 t ha-1 year-1 at Koga watershed by Gelagay and Minale27. In Africa, due to the rivers\u2019 capacity to flow massive volumes of water, soil erosion occurs frequently and to a great extent68. Setegni et al.69. , discovered that in the lake Tana sub-basins, 18.4% of the catchment had sediment outputs greater than 30 tons/ha, considered areas with considerable erosion potential. The land use map of the research area revealed a decline in forest cover, primarily driven by the expansion of agricultural activities. This reduction in forest cover has contributed to increased soil erosion. Soil erosion rate also varies with the vegetation cover found in the area70. The most significant amount of soil loss was generated from agricultural land (9412.32 t/ha) which was followed by grassland (35.55 t/ha). In terms, of soil types, the greatest amount is estimated in the area having Luvisols with a value of (7068.66 t/ha) followed by Leptosols with soil loss of 1512.15 t/ha/yr. The lowest amount of soil loss contribution is obtained from Cambisols (97.11 t/ha/yr) (Table 10).</p><p>Sub-basins are labeled from 1 to 5 on the map. Sub-basins 3 and 4 are the primary contributors to soil erosion in the area, as they contain moderate and severe erosion severity classes. In contrast, Sub-basins 1, 2, and 5 contribute negligibly to the overall soil erosion. Sub-basin 1 is predominantly classified in the very slight erosion category (dark green), resulting in a minimal contribution to soil erosion due to the prevalence of low-severity areas. Similarly, Sub-basin 2 is mainly in the very slight erosion category (dark green), which leads to a minimal impact on soil erosion in the region. Sub-basin 5, like Sub-basin 1, is largely in the very slight erosion category (dark green), contributing very little to the overall soil erosion.</p><p>The spatial variation of soil erosion risk is affected by different variables such as the characteristics of soil, vegetative cover, topography, climate, and human activities. The amount of organic matter present in the soil and the structural arrangement of the soil affects the resistance of the soil to rainfall71. According to recent studies, greater rates of erosion have been caused by overgrazing, deforestation, and inappropriate farming practices72. Higher surface runoff and soil loss are closely associated with an absence of plant cover73. Soil degradation is still mostly caused by inappropriate land management techniques, such as over-tilling, monocropping, and ineffective water management71.</p><p>Fig. 10</p><p>Soil erosion severity map.

The average sediment yield at the main outlet is 184,695 tons. Since some of the eroded sediment particles inside the catchment get stuck and deposited in the upstream reaches, all sediment particles within the catchment are not transported to the outlet.</p><p>This soil loss may cause a serious onsite impact on the catchment and also offsite impacts. The off-site impact of soil erosion is mainly related to sedimentation in the water bodies. Both on- and off-site effects of the eroded soil materials are harmful to both plants and water74. All ecosystem needs water to function properly on qualitative as well as quantitative levels. Ecosystems are severely harmed by both declining water availability and deteriorating water quality75.</p><p>According to Andualem76, about 1,018,000 tons of sediment flow into the lake Tana basin which is estimated by using the recent land use in the tributaries. This value reduces the capacity of the lake and the capacity of the channels, which causes the reduced volume of lakes and rivers.</p><p>Since the upper Gilgel Abay catchment is one of the major tributaries of the lake Tana basin, the higher sediment yield in this catchment results in sedimentation and deterioration of the water quality. The transporting agents don\u2019t contain only soil they may leach nitrogen, phosphorus and other chemicals in fertilizers applied in the agricultural field when soil erosion occurs. This may increase the growth of algae and other species like water hyacinth invasion such as Eichhornia Crassipes (Enbochi) which reduces the concentration of oxygen in the water and aquatic animals will die because of insufficient oxygen and the water body will also dry.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sediment yield trend analysis</emphasis></p><p>Trend analysis was conducted to assess the sediment production over time. The catchment was divided into 99 sub-catchments during the model setup phase (Fig. 6). For the trend analysis, four sub-basins were selected. These sub-basins were chosen based on their representativeness of varying characteristics (e.g., land use, soil types, and topography) and the availability of consistent historical sediment yield data. The selected sub-basins, which are associated with their IDs in Fig. 6, are situated in the northern part of the catchment, as shown on the map. These areas experienced significant land use changes, including agricultural expansion and deforestation, making them suitable for analyzing sediment yield trends. The selection was explicitly based on the availability of historical sediment data at these outlets, which was collected from the gauge station and sediment-related observations documented in previous studies17,77.</p><p>During the summer months, higher sediment yields were observed due to heavy rainfall and increased surface runoff. To provide a clearer understanding of sediment yield distribution and trends, graph and table are included. Figure 11; Table 11 presents the annual sediment yields for the selected sub-basins, along with the trends observed over the years. These additional visual representations serve to enhance the interpretation of the sediment dynamics and provide a more comprehensive view of how sediment yields vary spatially within the study area. The trend of sediment yield over the years shows a general increase, with the maximum yield recorded in 2021 (318,233 tons), followed by 316,869 tons in 2018 (Fig. 11). This trend underscores the influence of land management practices on soil erosion dynamics. The dramatic increase in 2021 can be attributed to multiple factors, including the expansion of agricultural land, deforestation, overgrazing, intense rainfall events, and insufficient soil conservation measures. These variables collectively reduce soil stability and increase erosion rates, as supported by several studies62,63. The increased conversion of forested land to agricultural use, excessive grazing, the presence of heavy rains and inadequate soil conservation measures are some of the causes which contributed to the dramatic increase in sediment yield in 202117. These variables collectively decrease soil stability and accelerate erosion rates61.</p><p>In general, the trend of sediment is increasing from year to year (Table 11), this might be due to the increment in population, deforestation, intensive agriculture, and the variability of climate in the catchment. Without upstream conservation measures, the catchment risks severe nutrient depletion in its topsoil, threatening food security for local farmers. Moreover, sedimentation in the lake Tana basin could lead to significant environmental and economic challenges, necessitating immediate intervention. A limitation of this study is the current quality and quantity of meteorological and hydrological data, which if enhanced, could greatly improve model calibration and validation for more accurate soil erosion and sediment transport assessments.</p><p>Fig. 11</p><p>Sediment yield trend analysis.</p><p>Table 11</p><p>Trend analysis of sediment yield.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"6\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_11\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"104\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"64\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"112\"/><thead><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">Time series</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\">First year</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\">Last year</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\">Test Z</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col5\">Signific.</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col6\">Q (tons)</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sub-basin 1</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2004</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2021</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">2.65</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">**</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">8519.2813</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sub-basin 4</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2004</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2021</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">1.97</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">*</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">2578.506</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sub-basin 6</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2004</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2021</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">2.20</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">*</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">1717.09</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sub-basin 9</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2004</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2021</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">1.59</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\">582.49</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conclusions</emphasis></p><p>This study modeled sediment yield and soil erosion in the Upper Gilgel Abay catchment, Ethiopia, using the SWAT model.

Traditional deployment strategies such as random, grid-based, and deterministic placements often fail to accommodate heterogeneous node capabilities or adapt to dynamic environmental conditions. This study proposes a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based deployment framework tailored for heterogeneous WSNs. The framework incorporates intelligent role assignment, metaheuristic optimization, and adaptive maintenance phases to balance coverage quality, minimize energy consumption, and enhance fault tolerance. A comprehensive simulation-based evaluation involving nine deployment strategies demonstrates that the proposed PSO-based approach achieves superior performance, including an average coverage of 91.4 \u00b1 1.8%, extended operational lifetime exceeding 3,400 rounds, and improved connectivity robustness. The framework also exhibits strong scalability and resilience in the presence of node failures. These findings establish the proposed deployment model as a viable solution for real-world, large-scale, and energy-constrained WSN applications.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have become a cornerstone technology across a wide range of critical modern applications, including environmental monitoring, precision agriculture, industrial automation, structural health monitoring, and military surveillance1,2. These systems consist of numerous spatially distributed sensor nodes that autonomously collaborate to sense, process, and transmit data to a centralized sink or base station. Their ability to function in harsh, inaccessible, or large-scale environments makes them indispensable for real-time, data-driven decision-making.</p><p>The effectiveness and sustainability of WSNs are fundamentally governed by the quality of node deployment. Deployment strategies directly influence key performance parameters such as sensing coverage, communication connectivity, energy consumption, fault tolerance, and ultimately, network lifetime3,4. In scenarios where resources are limited or physical redeployment is unfeasible, achieving an optimal initial deployment becomes even more critical.</p><p>With the increasing complexity and scale of modern WSN applications, there is a growing demand for intelligent and optimized deployment methodologies. Traditional strategies, such as uniform grid layouts or random node placement, often fall short in balancing trade-offs between energy efficiency, sensing fidelity, and network robustness especially in heterogeneous environments with diverse sensor types5.</p><p>To illustrate this relationship, Fig. 1 depicts the wide range of WSN application domains and how each relies on high deployment quality to ensure system performance. Each domain such as agriculture, industry, environmental monitoring, and defense has unique operational requirements that demand specific balances of coverage, energy efficiency, connectivity, and lifetime.</p><p>Fig. 1</p><p>Influence of deployment quality on key WSN application domains.</p><p>Furthermore, the rise of heterogeneous WSNs, where sensor nodes differ in their capabilities, introduces additional design complexity. Static or heuristic-based placement methods are often inadequate for managing such heterogeneous networks6. Consequently, adaptive, performance-aware deployment frameworks are needed frameworks that can intelligently position nodes in a way that accounts for operational constraints, dynamic environments, and application-specific performance goals7.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Challenges of WSN deployment</emphasis></p><p>The deployment of WSNs is inherently complex due to the need to optimize multiple interdependent performance metrics. One of the foremost challenges is coverage, which refers to the ability of the sensor nodes to monitor the entire target area efficiently. Achieving complete coverage with minimal node redundancy is crucial for cost-effectiveness and operational efficiency8. Another critical factor is energy efficiency. As sensor nodes are typically powered by limited battery resources, improper placement can lead to rapid energy depletion in certain areas forming energy holes that reduce the overall lifetime and reliability of the network9.</p><p>Connectivity presents a third major challenge. All nodes must maintain reliable communication paths to transmit sensed data to the sink node. Ensuring robust multi-hop communication without congestion, excessive delay, or data loss becomes increasingly difficult as network size or density increases10. Furthermore, real-world deployment scenarios are often subject to environmental constraints, including terrain irregularities, physical obstructions, and changing weather conditions. These factors can unpredictably impact signal propagation and sensor performance, thereby complicating node placement strategies.</p><p>The relationships among these challenges are not independent; rather, they are deeply interdependent. For example, improving coverage by adding more nodes may increase energy consumption and communication overhead. Similarly, optimizing energy usage might compromise connectivity if nodes are placed too far apart. This interplay is illustrated in Fig. 2, which presents a conceptual view of the interdependencies among coverage, energy efficiency, connectivity, and environmental factors. Understanding and managing these trade-offs is essential for designing effective deployment frameworks.</p><p>Fig. 2</p><p>Interdependencies among key deployment challenges in wireless sensor networks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Problem statement</emphasis></p><p>Despite significant advancements in WSN research, conventional deployment strategies continue to exhibit fundamental limitations in practical, dynamic, and heterogeneous environments. Many existing methods rely on static, deterministic, or randomized placement approaches, which do not account for the evolving conditions of real-world scenarios11. These methods often assume uniform node capabilities and ideal deployment environments assumptions that rarely hold true in complex or large-scale applications.</p><p>As a result, such strategies frequently underperform in terms of key performance metrics, including sensing coverage, network connectivity, and energy efficiency. For example, random deployments may result in coverage gaps or redundant overlaps, while deterministic placements lack the flexibility to adapt to irregular terrains or varying node types12,13. Furthermore, these approaches struggle to maintain performance as the network scales in size or adapts to environmental variations, such as mobility, obstacle interference, or energy depletion.</p><p>The inability to adapt to such conditions leads to premature energy exhaustion, increased latency, and reduced network lifetime, ultimately degrading the quality of service (QoS) provided by the WSN. Given the increasing complexity of applications ranging from smart cities to disaster response systems, there is an urgent need for deployment frameworks that are context-aware, performance-driven, and adaptable to heterogeneous sensor configurations.</p><p>Therefore, the core problem addressed in this study is the lack of scalable, intelligent deployment strategies that can dynamically optimize node placement based on application-specific goals, environmental constraints, and resource limitations. Addressing this gap is critical to enhancing the operational efficiency and sustainability of future WSN deployments.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Objectives</emphasis></p><p>The primary objective of this study is to propose and evaluate efficient deployment frameworks aimed at enhancing the overall performance of WSNs in terms of coverage, connectivity, energy efficiency, and network lifetime. Recognizing the inherent limitations of static and non-adaptive deployment strategies, this research focuses on the development and assessment of deployment models that are not only efficient but also scalable, adaptive, and applicable to heterogeneous sensor configurations.</p><p>Given the dynamic and resource-constrained nature of WSN environments, this study seeks to explore the integration of computational intelligence techniques including heuristic optimization, bio-inspired algorithms (such as genetic algorithms (GA) or particle swarm optimization (PSO)), and artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches to guide sensor node placement toward optimal or near-optimal deployment outcomes. The goal is to balance multiple performance objectives simultaneously while accounting for real-world deployment challenges, including environmental variability and diverse node capabilities.</p><p>By addressing these aims, the study aspires to contribute to the design of robust and intelligent deployment frameworks that can be generalized across a wide range of WSN applications and operational conditions, thereby enhancing the practical applicability and longevity of sensor network deployments.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Contributions</emphasis></p><p>This study contributes to the field of WSNs by addressing critical limitations in existing deployment strategies and proposing enhanced frameworks capable of meeting modern performance demands. The specific contributions of this work are as follows:</p><p>The research provides a comprehensive analysis of the primary obstacles in WSN deployment, including limitations related to sensing coverage, network connectivity, energy efficiency, and adaptability to environmental conditions.</p><p>A critical review of traditional and contemporary deployment methods is conducted, highlighting their respective advantages and shortcomings, particularly in heterogeneous and dynamic environments.</p><p>This study proposes (or adapts, depending on the actual work) novel deployment frameworks that integrate computational techniques such as heuristic optimization or bio-inspired algorithms to enhance node placement outcomes.</p><p>The proposed models aim to optimize multiple performance metrics simultaneously ensuring balanced coverage, connectivity, and energy consumption while maintaining scalability and adaptability.</p><p>A detailed simulation-based evaluation is presented, comparing the proposed framework(s) against benchmark methods across various performance dimensions to demonstrate effectiveness, scalability, and robustness.</p><p>Special attention is given to the applicability of the proposed methods in heterogeneous WSN environments, where nodes possess varying sensing, communication, or power characteristics.</p><p>By consolidating these contributions, this study advances the field toward more intelligent, resilient, and energy-aware WSN deployment strategies suited for modern, large-scale applications.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paper organization</emphasis></p><p>The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 reviews the related literature on WSN deployment strategies, highlighting traditional and modern approaches along with their respective limitations. Section 3 presents the proposed deployment framework, detailing its design principles, computational methods, and adaptability to heterogeneous environments. Section 4 describes the simulation setup and evaluation metrics used to assess performance. Section 5 discusses the experimental results, including comparative analysis with existing techniques. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes the paper by summarizing key findings and outlining potential directions for future research.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related work</emphasis></p><p>The deployment of WSNs has been the focus of extensive research due to its direct impact on network performance, operational cost, and lifespan. Over the years, various deployment strategies have been proposed, broadly categorized into random, grid-based, hierarchical, and optimization-driven approaches.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Overview of deployment strategies</emphasis></p><p>Deployment strategies in WSNs significantly influence the network\u2019s coverage, connectivity, energy efficiency, and lifetime. Various approaches have been proposed, ranging from simple random methods to advanced optimization-based frameworks, each suited to specific environments and application needs.</p><p>Random deployment is widely adopted in scenarios where manual node placement is impractical or hazardous, such as disaster response areas, battlefields, or remote ecological zones. In these cases, sensor nodes are dispersed using aerial drops, robotic systems, or manual throws. While this method offers quick and effortless deployment, it often results in non-uniform node distribution, leading to coverage holes, redundant sensing in some areas, and weak connectivity in others14,15. Additionally, random placement increases the likelihood of localized energy depletion, particularly in critical relay regions, thus shortening network lifetime16.</p><p>Grid-based deployment adopts a more structured layout, placing nodes in predefined patterns such as square, triangular, or hexagonal tessellations. This method facilitates easier coverage estimation and efficient routing due to predictable node locations. Grid-based strategies are especially useful in controlled environments like industrial floors or agricultural fields. However, their rigidity makes them unsuitable for irregular or obstacle-laden terrains, and maintaining redundancy for fault tolerance often requires deploying more nodes than necessary, increasing deployment costs17.</p><p>Hierarchical deployment strategies introduce a layered architecture, often organized using clustering protocols. Pioneering approaches like LEACH (Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy)18 and PEGASIS (Power-Efficient Gathering in Sensor Information Systems)19 segment the network into clusters, each governed by a cluster head responsible for aggregating and forwarding data. This design enhances energy efficiency and scalability, as intra-cluster communication minimizes energy usage. However, challenges such as optimal cluster formation, role rotation, and adaptability to node mobility or failure complicate real-time implementation in dynamic environments.</p><p>To overcome the limitations of deterministic strategies, recent research has turned toward optimization-based deployment. These approaches use metaheuristic algorithms to optimize node placement by considering multiple performance objectives, including coverage maximization, energy minimization, and connectivity assurance. For example, GA apply evolutionary principles to iteratively evolve deployment solutions20, while PSO emulates the social behaviour of swarms to find optimal configurations with reduced convergence time21. Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) mimics ant foraging to develop energy-efficient and fault-tolerant deployment paths22, and Simulated Annealing (SA) explores deployment spaces by probabilistically accepting sub-optimal solutions to avoid local minima23. These methods are well-suited for heterogeneous and large-scale WSNs, offering flexible, adaptive, and high-performance deployment outcomes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Heterogeneous versus homogeneous networks</emphasis></p><p>WSNs can be broadly categorized based on the uniformity of node capabilities into homogeneous and heterogeneous networks.</p><p>In homogeneous WSNs, all sensor nodes possess identical hardware specifications and functionalities24. They share the same sensing ranges, communication radii, computational resources, and power sources. This uniformity simplifies the deployment design and algorithmic modeling, making it easier to analyse and simulate. However, it also limits the system\u2019s adaptability and scalability, especially in dynamic environments or in applications requiring task-specific roles. For example, in a forest fire detection system, homogeneous nodes might all have temperature sensors, but none would be specialized for long-range communication or high-throughput data aggregation.</p><p>On the other hand, heterogeneous WSNs consist of nodes with varying capabilities tailored for different tasks25. These may include:</p><p>Sensor nodes with low power and limited sensing range,</p><p>Relay nodes with higher energy and stronger communication modules to facilitate data forwarding,</p><p>Sink nodes (or base stations) with advanced processing and storage capacity to serve as the central point for data collection and decision-making.</p><p>Heterogeneous deployments better mimic real-world WSN applications and can significantly enhance performance by allocating tasks to nodes best suited for them. However, they also introduce additional design challenges in node placement, load balancing, fault tolerance, and energy-aware routing. Coordinating nodes with different capabilities requires adaptive algorithms that consider each node\u2019s role, energy profile, and spatial positioning26.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Key performance metrics for deployment strategies</emphasis></p><p>To evaluate the effectiveness of deployment strategies in both homogeneous and heterogeneous WSNs, researchers focus on a set of critical performance metrics:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Coverage</emphasis>: Coverage refers to the percentage of the monitored region that is effectively observed by sensor nodes. It is a primary metric for evaluating the spatial quality of deployment. Full or optimal coverage ensures that every point of interest within the target area is within the sensing range of at least one node. Poor coverage can lead to data gaps and undetected events27.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Energy consumption</emphasis>: Since sensor nodes are usually battery-powered and energy replenishment is difficult, minimizing energy consumption is crucial. Deployment strategies must consider node placement that reduces energy-intensive communication (especially long-range transmissions) and supports energy balancing to avoid premature death of critical nodes28.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Connectivity</emphasis>: Connectivity ensures that data collected by any node can be transmitted directly or via multi-hop paths to the sink node. A disconnected network, even if well-covered, is essentially non-functional. Deployment frameworks must preserve network-wide communication paths, even under node failures or environmental interference29.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Latency</emphasis>: Latency refers to the time delay between data sensing and its successful delivery to the sink. In time-sensitive applications like structural health monitoring or battlefield surveillance, low-latency communication is essential. Deployment affects latency by influencing hop count and path redundancy30.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Fault tolerance</emphasis>: WSNs must maintain operational reliability in the face of individual node failures, environmental degradation, or malicious attacks. A robust deployment will include redundant nodes and overlapping sensing areas to ensure service continuity, enabling self-healing capabilities through re-routing and re-clustering mechanisms31.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Recent advancements</emphasis></p><p>Recent developments in AI, Machine Learning (ML), and bio-inspired optimization have significantly advanced deployment strategies for WSNs. Traditional deployment approaches, such as static or probabilistic placement, often lack adaptability to environmental changes or scalability in large networks. In contrast, AI-based methods offer dynamic and context-aware solutions. For example, Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques, including Q-learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN), have been successfully applied to optimize sensor placement and routing paths in real-time by learning from interactions with the environment and adjusting deployment based on feedback signals like coverage and energy efficiency32. Deep Learning (DL) approaches, particularly using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have been used to process spatial data and predict optimal node positions in complex terrains33. In parallel, bio-inspired algorithms such as PSO, ACO, and GA have shown strong capabilities in handling multi-objective optimization problems where trade-offs between coverage, connectivity, and energy must be balanced34. These algorithms are particularly effective in heterogeneous WSNs, where nodes vary in capabilities and roles. PSO, for example, simulates social behaviours to discover efficient placements that maximize sensing area while minimizing energy use35, whereas ACO mimics ant foraging behaviour to build robust communication paths that adapt to network dynamics36. Recent research also explores hybrid models that combine ML and bio-inspired techniques for example, integrating RL with evolutionary algorithms to achieve both adaptiveness and global optimization in large-scale deployments. Emerging trends such as federated learning and edge intelligence further promise decentralized, privacy-preserving deployment frameworks suitable for real-world smart environments37. These advancements collectively mark a shift toward intelligent, flexible, and performance-aware deployment strategies in WSNs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gap analysis</emphasis></p><p>Despite notable progress in WSN deployment research, several critical gaps persist that limit the real-world applicability and scalability of many proposed solutions. A majority of existing deployment strategies are designed under the assumption of static and uniform node placement, which fails to account for mobility support, dynamic network reconfiguration, or environmental variability38. In practical scenarios such as disaster zones or mobile object tracking sensor nodes may need to relocate in response to changing conditions, requiring deployment strategies that can adapt in real time. Furthermore, while heterogeneous WSNs are increasingly common due to their superior performance and flexibility, relatively few studies adequately address the complexities introduced by heterogeneity, such as varying sensing ranges, energy capacities, and communication capabilities. Most current algorithms are optimized for homogeneous environments, limiting their applicability in diverse and dynamic deployments39.</p><p>Another pressing limitation is the computational overhead associated with AI and optimization-based methods. Although techniques like DL and metaheuristic algorithms have demonstrated superior performance in simulations, their feasibility in resource-constrained sensor nodes often with limited processing power and memory is questionable40. Additionally, scalability remains a challenge; many algorithms that perform well in small- to medium-scale networks fail to scale efficiently as the number of nodes or the area of deployment increases41. There\u2019s also a lack of integration between deployment planning and realistic environmental models (e.g., obstacles, terrain irregularities), which can lead to performance degradation when these models are applied in practice.</p><p>Lastly, many studies fall short in providing comprehensive evaluations that consider multiple performance metrics simultaneously, such as coverage, energy consumption, latency, and fault tolerance, particularly under varying environmental and operational conditions. To bridge these gaps, Table 1 present research proposes a scalable and performance-aware deployment framework that incorporates intelligent algorithms, supports heterogeneous node configurations, and is designed with adaptability and practical constraints in mind. This framework aims to balance multiple deployment objectives while ensuring that computational efficiency and scalability are maintained, making it more suitable for real-world applications.</p><p>Table 1</p><p>Comparative summary of WSN deployment Strategies.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"6\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"104\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"104\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><thead><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">Deployment strategy</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\">Structure</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\">Techniques used</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\">Strengths</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col5\">Limitations</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col6\">Key references</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Random</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Unstructured</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Aerial drop, hand-scatters</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Fast, low-cost, applicable in hazardous areas</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">Poor coverage, high redundancy, uneven energy distribution</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">42,43</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Grid-based</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Regular tessellation</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Square, triangular, hexagonal layouts</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Predictable coverage, easy maintenance and routing</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">Inefficient in non-uniform terrains, high deployment cost</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">44,45</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Deterministic</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Manually planned</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Manual placement, CAD-based simulations</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Optimal precision, control over node placement</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">Labor-intensive, infeasible for large-scale or remote deployments</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">46,47</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Hierarchical</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Clustered/Layered</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">LEACH, HEED, PEGASIS, TEEN</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Energy-efficient communication, scalable architecture</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">Cluster head overhead, re-clustering complexity</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">48,49</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Optimization-based</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Adaptive/Metaheuristic</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">GA, PSO, ACO, DE, Firefly, Simulated Annealing</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Multi-objective, balances energy and coverage</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">High computational complexity, parameter sensitivity</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">50,51</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">AI/ML-based</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Intelligent/Adaptive</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Deep Learning, DQN, Reinforcement Learning, Q-Learning</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Environment-aware, real-time adaptation, data-driven decisions</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">Requires training datasets, computational overhead</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">52,53</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Hybrid</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Combined</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">GA + Fuzzy Logic, ACO + RL, PSO + ML</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Trade-off optimization, improved robustness and fault tolerance</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">High implementation complexity, integration challenges</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">54,55</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Mobile node deployment</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Dynamic/Relocatable</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Robot-assisted or autonomous mobile nodes</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Can recover coverage holes, adaptable to topology changes</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">Energy drains from mobility, path optimization overhead</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">56,57</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Drone-assisted deployment</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Aerial/Semi-structured</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">UAVs for node distribution, mobile sinks</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Fast redeployment, useful in post-disaster or inaccessible zones</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">Costly hardware, synchronization and flight control issues</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">58,59</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">System model and assumptions</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Network model</emphasis></p><p>In this study, a heterogeneous WSN is modeled over a two-dimensional bounded area , typically representing an outdoor or irregular terrain. The network is composed of three primary types of nodes: sensor nodes, relay nodes, and a sink or base station (BS)60. Sensor nodes are responsible for detecting environmental parameters and initiating data transmission. Relay nodes are deployed to facilitate multi-hop communication and extend the network\u2019s operational lifetime by relieving communication loads from sensor nodes. The sink node serves as the central data collection point and is assumed to possess unlimited energy and computational resources.</p><p>Let the full set of nodes in the network be denoted as:1</p><p>Where:</p><p>is the set of  sensor nodes,</p><p>is the set of  relay nodes,</p><p>represents the sink node.</p><p>Each node  is defined by its spatial location , a sensing range  (applicable to sensor nodes), and a communication range \u200b, where typically .

The network consists of three main types of nodes: sensor nodes (represented as circles), relay nodes (hexagons), and a central sink or base station (square). Each sensor node is characterized by a sensing radius  and a communication radius , with , indicating that nodes can communicate over longer distances than they can sense. The Fig. 3 also shows circular sensing areas around each sensor node, highlighting both the coverage regions and their potential overlaps. Communication links are depicted as straight lines connecting nodes within communication range, illustrating possible multi-hop transmission paths from sensor nodes to the sink via relay nodes. This arrangement demonstrates how different node types work collaboratively to ensure effective coverage, connectivity, and energy efficiency. Labels within the Fig. 3 identify key parameters such as , , and the roles of each node type. The visual layout provides a clear depiction of the network\u2019s structure, supporting the system model described in this study and emphasizing the importance of strategic node placement in heterogeneous WSN environments.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Assumptions</emphasis></p><p>To simulate a realistic yet computationally tractable deployment scenario for heterogeneous WSNs, the following assumptions are made throughout this study:</p><p>The deployment area is modeled as a two-dimensional rectangular field of dimensions  meters. All nodes are deployed within this bounded region.</p><p>All sensor and relay nodes are static after initial deployment, unless otherwise stated. Advanced scenarios may consider mobile or energy-replenishable relay nodes; however, unless specified, nodes operate on fixed energy budgets.</p><p>Each node is assumed to be location-aware. Localization may be achieved via GPS (Global Positioning System) or a distributed localization algorithm, ensuring each node knows its Cartesian coordinates .</p><p>The sink or base station node is placed either at the geometric center of the field or at one of the corners, depending on the topology evaluated. The position is scenario-specific and will be defined in simulation cases.</p><p>The communication energy model follows the widely adopted first-order radio model proposed by Heinzelman et al. [Heinzelman et al., 2000]. This model accounts for both transmission and reception energy cost and differentiates between short-range free-space propagation and long-range multipath fading environments.</p><p>The energy required to transmit a -bit message over a distance  is defined as in Eq. (5) and the energy required to receive a -bit message is given by Eq. (6). These assumptions form the foundation for evaluating deployment frameworks under different performance metrics, including coverage, energy consumption, and network lifetime.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Performance metrics defined</emphasis></p><p>To quantitatively evaluate the efficiency and robustness of deployment strategies in heterogeneous WSNs, a set of well-established performance metrics is employed. These metrics are critical for assessing trade-offs between coverage, energy usage, and communication reliability, especially in resource-constrained environments.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Coverage ratio (C)</emphasis>: Coverage is a fundamental metric in WSNs, representing the proportion of the target area effectively monitored by sensor nodes61. It is defined as.</p><p>7</p><p>Where:  is the total area within the sensing range of at least one sensor node and  is the overall deployment area.</p><p>A higher coverage ratio implies more comprehensive environmental monitoring and better sensing quality.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Network lifetime</emphasis> (): Network lifetime refers to the duration for which the WSN remains functional before significant performance degradation occurs62. It is often measured using the following criteria.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">FND (First Node Dies)</emphasis>: Time until the first sensor node exhausts its energy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">HND (Half Node Dies)</emphasis>: Time until 50% of nodes are non-functional.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">LND (Last Node Dies)</emphasis>: Time until the entire network becomes inoperative.</p><p>Formally:8</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Energy efficiency</emphasis> (): Energy efficiency captures how effectively the network utilizes energy resources for data transmission and coverage63. It is expressed as:</p><p>9</p><p>\u200bWhere  is the area within the sensing range of at least one sensor node,  is the total energy consumed by all nodes in the network.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Connectivity ratio (CR)</emphasis>: Connectivity ensures that all nodes are able to transmit their data to the sink, either directly or through multi-hop paths64. The connectivity ratio is defined as.</p><p>10</p><p>\u200bWhere  is the number of nodes able to establish a communication path to the sink and is the total number of deployed nodes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Latency (L)</emphasis>: Latency refers to the time delay between sensing an event and receiving the corresponding data at the sink. It is affected by the routing protocol, hop count, and node distribution. Lower latency values are preferable in time-critical applications65.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Scalability (S)</emphasis>: Scalability evaluates the framework\u2019s ability to maintain performance as the number of nodes or the size of the deployment area increases66. This is generally analyzed through simulation by varying the number of nodes and monitoring the stability of metrics such as coverage, lifetime, and connectivity.</p><p>These metrics provide a multi-dimensional view of deployment effectiveness and are used in this study to compare traditional and proposed frameworks under varying network conditions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Proposed deployment framework</emphasis></p><p>To address the limitations of conventional node placement strategies and improve network performance, this work proposes an intelligent deployment framework tailored for heterogeneous WSNs. The framework integrates optimization-based placement with adaptability to environmental and performance constraints.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Framework overview</emphasis></p><p>The proposed framework operates in multiple phases: (1) Initialization, (2) Optimization, (3) Adjustment, and (4) Maintenance. At a high level, the framework accepts input parameters (deployment area, number of nodes, sensing and communication ranges, energy budget) and outputs an optimized spatial configuration of nodes. It incorporates a metaheuristic optimization algorithm to iteratively enhance placement decisions.</p><p>The following input-output relation defines the deployment function:11</p><p>\u200bWhere  is the optimized deployment configuration,  is the set of n nodes,  is the 2D deployment region,  and  are sensing and communication ranges respectively,  is the energy budget vector, and  is the deployment time horizon or simulation duration.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Optimization strategy</emphasis></p><p>To solve the multi-objective deployment problem, this work adopts a PSO algorithm, which balances coverage maximization, connectivity assurance, and energy conservation.</p><p>Let the position of each particle  represent a possible configuration of node placements:12</p><p>Objective Function:13</p><p>Where : coverage ratio given configuration X, : average energy consumption over simulation period, : connectivity ratio under deployment X, : weights assigned to each metric based on application priority.</p><p>The algorithm updates particle positions and velocities using:1415</p><p>Where  is the velocity of particle  at iteration ,  is its position (deployment layout),  and  are personal and global best positions,  and  are acceleration coefficients,  and  are random variables ,  is the inertia weight to balance exploration and exploitation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Deployment phases</emphasis></p><p>The proposed deployment framework is organized into four systematic phases: Initialization, Optimization, Adjustment, and Maintenance. Each phase contributes a critical function in ensuring that the WSN achieves optimal performance in terms of coverage, connectivity, and energy efficiency.</p><p>In the Initialization phase, the sensor and relay nodes are assigned their initial coordinates within the deployment region A. Node roles\u2014either as sensing units or communication relays are determined based on hardware type, energy capacity, and application-specific requirements. This phase also includes the initial estimation of performance metrics such as area coverage and connectivity ratio, which serve as the baseline for subsequent optimization.</p><p>The Optimization phase employs a metaheuristic algorithm typically PSO to improve the spatial distribution of nodes. Each candidate deployment configuration (particle) is evaluated using a multi-objective fitness function , which integrates coverage maximization, connectivity assurance, and energy consumption minimization. Iterative updates to particle positions and velocities guide the swarm toward an optimal configuration. Constraint-handling methods such as bounding coordinates within A are applied to maintain feasible solutions.</p><p>Following optimization, the Adjustment phase fine-tunes the node positions to eliminate redundant coverage overlaps and address coverage holes that may persist. This phase may incorporate local search strategies, such as greedy refinement or simulated annealing, to improve solution quality without incurring the high computational cost of full re-optimization.</p><p>Finally, in the Maintenance phase, the system monitors the network\u2019s operational health in real time. As nodes begin to deplete their energy reserves or fail due to environmental factors, the framework triggers a maintenance routine. This may involve reactivating redundant nodes, repositioning mobile relay units (if available), or initiating a partial redeployment. This proactive strategy extends the functional lifetime of the WSN and ensures service continuity under dynamic field conditions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Complexity analysis</emphasis></p><p>The computational efficiency of the proposed deployment framework is primarily influenced by the characteristics of the optimization algorithm, the number of nodes in the network, and the dimensionality of the deployment space. This section presents a theoretical analysis of both time and space complexity.</p><p>In terms of time complexity, let n denote the number of nodes to be deployed,  the size of the particle swarm, and  the number of generations in the PSO process. The fitness function  evaluates each particle by computing key performance indicators such as coverage, connectivity, and energy consumption. Coverage and connectivity assessments typically involve pairwise distance computations and area-based metrics, resulting in a computational complexity of approximately  for a single particle evaluation. Given that  particles are processed over  generations, the total time complexity of the optimization phase becomes:16</p><p>This reflects the dominant cost associated with evaluating the solution space and guiding the swarm toward convergence. Additional operations such as velocity updates and boundary condition checks are linear in n and are thus negligible in comparison.</p><p>Fig. 4</p><p>Block diagram of the proposed deployment framework.</p><p>For space complexity, the dominant factor is the storage of particle position vectors and their corresponding fitness values. Each particle stores the positions of all nodes in two-dimensional space, requiring  memory per particle, where  for the  and  coordinates. Hence, for  particles, the total space required to store positions is:17</p><p>Additionally, auxiliary memory is required to maintain velocity vectors, personal best positions (pbest), and global best (gbest) values. Fitness scores for each particle also contribute  to the space complexity. These additional components, although relevant, do not asymptotically exceed the primary term and therefore the total space complexity is summarized as:18</p><p>This complexity analysis highlights the scalability of the proposed framework for medium to large-scale WSN deployments. However, for very large-scale scenarios or real-time applications, further optimization or parallel processing strategies may be necessary to maintain computational tractability.</p><p>Figure 4 presents a layered block diagram representing the structure and workflow of the proposed deployment framework for heterogeneous WSNs. The diagram is organized into three main sections: the Input Layer, the Phase Modules, and the Output Layer. The Input Layer includes deployment parameters such as the target region (A), sensing and communication ranges ( and ), and node energy budgets. These inputs feed into the Initialization phase, which randomly places nodes, assigns roles, and estimates initial metrics. The Optimization phase, powered by a PSO engine, iteratively improves the network layout by evaluating fitness functions that account for coverage, connectivity, and energy efficiency. The Adjustment phase fine-tunes node positions to reduce overlaps and fill coverage gaps using local search heuristics. The Maintenance phase actively monitors node energy levels and failures, enabling relay repositioning and runtime adaptation to extend network lifetime. Finally, the Output Layer produces an optimized deployment map detailing node location, assigned roles, energy states, and coverage metrics. Color-coded modules and directional arrows clearly illustrate data flow and phase progression in a visually intuitive format.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Simulation and experimental setup</emphasis></p><p>This section outlines the simulation tools, experimental scenarios, and configuration parameters used to evaluate the proposed deployment framework in heterogeneous WSNs.

The analysis includes performance comparisons across various deployment strategies\u2014Random, Grid-Based, Deterministic, Hierarchical (e.g., LEACH), AI/ML-Based, Hybrid, Mobile Node Deployment, Drone-Assisted Deployment, and the Proposed PSO-Based method. The performance is benchmarked using key metrics such as coverage ratio, network lifetime, residual energy, connectivity, fault tolerance, and computational scalability.</p><p>Table 3 provides a comprehensive comparative summary of all deployment strategies under study. It highlights the quantitative values for each performance metric, including mean \u00b1 standard deviation. As seen in the table, the Proposed PSO-Based Deployment outperforms all others in nearly every category. It achieves the highest average coverage ratio (91.4 \u00b1 1.8%), the longest network lifetime with sustained node activity beyond 3,400 rounds, and the highest residual energy (0.61 \u00b1 0.03 J). It also maintains superior inter-node connectivity (4.2 \u00b1 0.2 average node degree) and demonstrates the best post-failure coverage (68.7 \u00b1 1.9%) following a simulated 20% node failure. Furthermore, it balances computational cost effectively (~ 8 s for 100 nodes), offering an optimal trade-off between performance and runtime overhead. The comprehensive nature of Table 3 reinforces the superiority of the PSO-based framework in optimizing node placement while ensuring energy efficiency, scalability, and robustness in heterogeneous WSN environments. It acts as a summary reference point to validate the findings illustrated in Figs. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, confirming that the proposed strategy consistently delivers optimal or near-optimal results across diverse scenarios.</p><p>Fig. 5</p><p>Comparative analysis of coverage ratios across deployment strategies.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Coverage ratio</emphasis></p><p>Coverage is a fundamental metric reflecting how effectively the WSN monitors its target environment. It is quantified as the percentage of the total deployment area that falls within the sensing range of at least one node. As depicted in Fig. 5, the proposed PSO-based deployment consistently achieves a higher coverage ratio than baseline methods (e.g., random and grid-based layouts), especially under sparse conditions. For example, in a 200 \u00d7 200 m2 field with 100 nodes, the PSO framework achieves an average coverage of 91.4 \u00b1 1.8%, while random and grid-based deployments yield only 76.8 \u00b1 3.1% and 82.5 \u00b1 2.4%, respectively. This improvement stems from the framework\u2019s ability to minimize sensing redundancy and strategically fill coverage gaps.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Energy consumption and network lifetime</emphasis></p><p>Energy consumption is directly correlated with network longevity, particularly in battery-powered WSNs. Figure 6 illustrates residual energy trends over simulation rounds. The PSO-based deployment exhibits a slower rate of energy depletion due to balanced load distribution and reduced communication overhead. Figure 7 further reveals that the proposed method prolongs network operation significantly. With an initial energy budget of 1.5 J per node, the PSO approach sustains more than 50% node activity beyond 3,400 rounds. In contrast, traditional deployments fall below the same threshold after approximately 2,200 rounds. These findings indicate that optimized node positioning contributes to both energy savings and operational resilience.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Connectivity and fault tolerance</emphasis></p><p>Reliable data transmission in WSNs critically depends on maintaining sufficient inter-node connectivity to ensure robust multi-hop communication pathways and uninterrupted data delivery. As demonstrated in Fig. 8, the average node degree used here as a proxy for connectivity quality clearly distinguishes the performance of various deployment strategies. The PSO-optimized deployment consistently achieves the highest connectivity index (4.2 \u00b1 0.2), indicating that sensor nodes are more effectively positioned within communication range () of their neighbours. This intelligent placement minimizes communication bottlenecks and enhances routing flexibility, even under the constraints of heterogeneous node capabilities.</p><p>Furthermore, the proposed framework exhibits strong fault tolerance. Figure 9 shows a post-failure coverage heatmap following a simulated failure of 20% of the nodes. Despite this failure, the PSO-based network maintains a high effective coverage of 68.7 \u00b1 1.9%, significantly outperforming conventional strategies such as random or grid-based deployments, which suffer from sharp performance degradation under similar stress. The combination of high connectivity and strong spatial resilience ensures that the PSO-based deployment remains operationally effective even in adverse conditions, making it especially suitable for mission-critical applications in dynamic or resource-constrained environments.</p><p>Fig. 6</p><p>Residual energy decay over operational rounds.</p><p>Fig. 7</p><p>Node availability over time under different deployments.</p><p>Fig. 8</p><p>Scalability of deployment strategy with increasing node count.</p><p>Fig. 9</p><p>Post-failure coverage distribution in heterogeneous WSN.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Scalability and adaptability</emphasis></p><p>To assess scalability, the framework was tested across varying node densities (50 to 300 nodes) and deployment field sizes (100 \u00d7 100 m2 to 300 \u00d7 300 m2). As shown in Fig. 10, the computational complexity grows linearly with the number of nodes, maintaining practical runtimes (e.g., ~ 8 s for 100 nodes). Additionally, the algorithm adapts well to environmental irregularities, such as terrain obstructions or energy asymmetries among nodes. Dynamic role allocation and relay repositioning enable the network to maintain performance without reinitialization, thereby enhancing long-term adaptability.</p><p>In summary, the proposed PSO-based deployment framework demonstrates clear advantages over traditional, hierarchical, and AI-driven strategies. It achieves superior coverage, extends network lifetime, optimizes energy use, and maintains strong connectivity even under node failure conditions. These characteristics make it particularly suitable for mission-critical WSN applications in challenging environments, such as disaster response, military surveillance, and industrial monitoring. The integration of intelligent optimization with adaptive maintenance mechanisms positions this framework as a robust and scalable solution for modern heterogeneous WSN deployments.</p><p>Fig.

improving the performance and resilience of heterogeneous WSNs. Through extensive simulation and comparative analysis, the proposed method demonstrated significant enhancements across key performance metrics, including coverage ratio, network lifetime, residual energy retention, connectivity index, and fault tolerance. Specifically, the PSO-based deployment achieved an average coverage of 91.4 \u00b1 1.8%, sustained over 50% node activity for more than 3,400 rounds, and maintained a higher average node degree (4.2 \u00b1 0.2) compared to traditional strategies. These improvements are attributed to intelligent node placement within communication ranges and adaptive optimization phases that balance energy consumption and spatial distribution. The study\u2019s main contributions include the development of a scalable, energy-aware deployment framework, a realistic simulation model accommodating heterogeneous node roles, and a thorough complexity-performance evaluation. Looking ahead, future work will focus on real-world validation using physical testbeds and drone-assisted deployments, as well as the integration of advanced AI techniques such as deep RL to enhance adaptability in dynamic environments. Additional emphasis will be placed on security-aware deployment planning and mobility support for dynamic WSN topologies. These directions aim to further elevate the applicability and robustness of the proposed framework for mission-critical, large-scale WSN implementations in domains such as smart infrastructure, environmental monitoring, and industrial automation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><p>[1].Trigka, M.

Let us revisit some of the strategies we used before such as the establishment of checkpoints, placement of trucks, water sourcing, and air assets, including discussion on the possible livelihood projects with the Indigenous Peoples,' he said during the joint conduct of the Provincial Peace and Order Council and Barangay Anti-Drug Abuse Council meeting at the Capitol session hall.</p><p>Police checkpoints and a registry of civilians going to the mountains had been implemented in the towns of Solsona, Nueva Era, and Piddig last summer following a series of forest fire incidents in these areas.</p><p>According to the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP), the primary causes of fires in the province are open flame from rubbish fire, smoking, ignition of materials from embers, open flame in farmlands, electrical ignition caused by a loose connection, open flame from cooking, fireworks, arcing, overheated home appliances, and open flame from kaingin (slash and burn) and kerosene lamps.</p><p>While there have been no reported forest fires in the fourth quarter of this year, the BFP, in coordination with the Ilocos Norte government, has tapped the assistance of the 4th Marine Brigade, the Philippine Army and local disaster risk management and reduction units of the province to sustain their efforts to prevent fire incidents in the province.</p><p>Among the strategies include the regular patrolling of forested areas and the hiring of more forest rangers to minimize hazardous blazes.</p><p>Record shows the wildfires in Ilocos Norte are mostly 'accidental fires' caused by dry weather, discarded lit cigarettes, open fires from campers or hikers, wildlife hunters, and burning of agriculture wastes.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASEANT-ASEANTRIB1712202400010013</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASEANT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DNR-CVM3-RSPS-31RC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434137</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"345\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 ASEAN Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>ASEAN Tribune</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"29734\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"12\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>December 17, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DIYD</classCode><className>ASEAN COUNTRIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp;

Ensure your fire is completely extinguished\u2014drown with water (NOT dirt), stir with your shovel, drown again and feel for any heat using the back of your hand. Continue this process until no heat remains.</p><p>\u2022 Stoves: If using pressurized or bottled liquid fuel stoves, lanterns, or heating devices, use in barren areas with at least 3 feet of clearance from grasses and other debris that may catch fire. Prevent stoves from tipping.</p><p>\u2022 Vehicles: When traveling, ensure your chains are properly connected. The hot underside of the vehicle and dragging chains can start a fire. Stick to driving on designated roads and trails and be careful to not park your car or OHV in tall, dry vegetation, including grass.</p><p>\u2022 Spark Arrestors: Ensure that all internal or external combustion engines have a spark arresting device properly installed, maintained and in effective working order.</p><p>\u2022 Smoking: Extinguish all smoking materials dead out on bare soil. Pack out all cigarette butts and filters.</p><p>\u2022 Fireworks: Fireworks are prohibited on all national forests year-round, leave them and all other pyrotechnic devices at home.</p><p>Similar restrictions are also in effect on neighboring public lands, reported forest officials.</p><p>Because restrictions can vary by jurisdiction, visitors should contact the area they plan to visit for specific fire restrictions and conditions.</p><p>California campfire permits are available online at <url normalizedValue=\"https://readyforwildfire.org\">https://readyforwildfire.org</url>.

This change is especially notable in areas where these events were not common and are now gaining strength, such as in Northern Europe. Norway has suffered unexpected periods of dryness and high temperatures, causing a considerable change in the probability of wildfire occurrence. A clear example of this trend was 2018 when unusual weather conditions caused numerous fires to spread nationwide. This changing trend highlights the need to understand and analyse the current situation to mitigate future impacts and losses. </p><p>This paper examines recent wildfires in Norway by analysing the events that have happened from 2016 to 2023, the period when data is available. While acknowledging that this period may not be extensive enough to predict future patterns, this analysis provides valuable insights into recent trends and occurrences. During this timeframe, Norway experienced an annual average of 1217 wildfires, burning 2019 hectares per year. Wildfires peak in April and May. Southern Norway, particularly the Southeast, experiences more wildfires due to drier conditions and denser populations, while Northern regions have fewer fires. This study also evaluated climatic conditions, highlighting a strong correlation between the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) anomalies and the severe drying conditions in 2018, along with other climatic factors such as land surface temperature, precipitation, and wind. Additionally, the normative and operational situation is detailed to show the framework around these events. It provides reflections and recommendations to avoid future disasters, emphasizing the need for improved fire safety measures and proactive fire management.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>Wildfires are a major threat to forests, communities, and infrastructure worldwide. While they are a natural part of forest ecosystems and play a role in regeneration, their patterns are changing due to shifting climate conditions. The latest reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)1, 2, 3\u20134 show that climate change is driving more extreme weather, with hotter, drier conditions in some regions. This has \u2013 in combination with several other factors (forestry, recreation, etc.) \u2013 led to a rise in wildfires in recent years5,6, and their frequency and intensity are expected to grow in the future7. Wildfires not only cause widespread damage to people, property, and the environment but also release greenhouse gases, contributing to global warming and creating a cycle that increases the risk of even more fires8. This variation in wildfires has led to detrimental effects such as loss of biodiversity, degradation of forest ecosystems, soil erosion, disruption of atmospheric patterns, and exacerbation of global warming through the release of carbon into the atmosphere. Consequently, wildfires have emerged as a pressing environmental and ecological issue9, 10\u201311. Globally, annual carbon emissions from fires are estimated at 3.53 Pg, comprising 25\u201335% of the total net carbon dioxide emissions12,13. In addition to the adverse effects on air quality, water resources, and long-term ecological resilience, wildfires impose significant economic costs, including firefighting expenses, loss of infrastructure, buildings, livestock, wildlife, and productive forests. In extreme cases, they can tragically result in the loss of human lives. In Norway, the 95% rise in forest and grassland fires from 2017 to 2018 led to an additional 1,079.9 million kroner spent on preparedness, averaging 1.06 million kroner per avoidable fire call14. The negative impacts of wildfires extend beyond the immediate danger of flames, as they significantly contribute to air pollution, which can have long-lasting effects on human health, including respiratory issues and cardiovascular diseases15.</p><p>As part of this situation, wildfire occurrences have notably risen in Northern Europe over the past two decades16 with more frequent fires shifting to higher altitudes17, resulting in forest degradation18. It is estimated that up to 90 per cent of wildfires are caused by human activities, while global warming is directly related to their increased abundance and swifter escalation16. Indeed, the unprecedented rise in temperatures and dry conditions makes forests more vulnerable to fires, which are likely to escalate to megafires. Historically, wet, cool summers have been frequent in Northern Europe, with a low number of wildland fires occurring and of low intensity. The fire seasons have been primarily identified during Spring, when the average precipitation is lower, and the vegetation is more prone to ignite, and primarily in seasons following dry winters, which has been identified as one of the factors increasing the risk of wildfires. However, this tendency has not been consistent in the last years when some summer seasons have been remarkably dry and hot19. 2018 was an exceptionally dry and hot year in Northern Europe, conditions closely linked to the impacts of climate change. An example was the summer of 2018, with a total of 2115 wildland fires in Norway, twice as many as in 2016 and 201716.</p><p>The 2018 European drought and heat wave marked a period of exceptionally hot weather that brought about record-breaking temperatures and widespread wildfires across many parts of Europe during the spring and summer of 201820,21. This phenomenon was part of a broader heat wave impacting the Northern hemisphere, partly attributed to a weaker-than-usual jet stream, which allowed hot high-pressure air masses to persist in the same areas. The European Drought Observatory reports that most affected areas experienced drought conditions, particularly in Northern and Central Europe22. The World Meteorological Organization has linked the severe heat waves experienced across the northern hemisphere during the summer of 2018 to climate change in Europe, as well as instances of extreme precipitation. Notably, temperatures in Banak in northern Norway soared to 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F) on 30 July 2018, a remarkably rare occurrence for a region situated north of the Arctic Circle. Additionally, the first half of July witnessed over 40 wildfires. Oslo also saw its hottest summer day in 80 years, reaching a maximum temperature of 34.6 \u00b0C (94.3 \u00b0F). As stated in the IPCC report, very rare extremes and compound events, such as the 2018 concurrent heatwaves across the Northern Hemisphere, are often linked to significant impacts. The changing climate is already altering the likelihood of such extreme events, including decadal droughts and extreme sea levels, and this trend will continue with future warming. Compound events and concurrent extremes are expected to become more frequent with increasing global temperatures, leading to a higher probability of low-likelihood, high-impact outcomes. Higher warming levels will increase the likelihood of events unprecedented in the observational record3.</p><p>In the present context, an unadulterated natural wildfire regime may not be present, emphasizing the imperative of understanding the fire regime for space and time23. Fire regime encompasses various parameters such as fire type, intensity, severity, size, spatial pattern, and seasonality24, 25\u201326. This is influenced by the interplay of biotic and abiotic factors27. The dynamic nature of the fire regime is affected by climatic conditions and human activities28. However, wildfires are complex phenomena that are also influenced by other factors such as preventive measures, economic factors, inheritance laws, or even knowledge of fire management. Temporal and spatial characteristics of fire regimes can be computed from wildfire statistical records29.</p><p>Understanding the impact of wildfires on flora and the environment is needed in the current situation to avoid higher losses when from the events that will take place in the near future. This requires essential information on the spatial and temporal occurrences of fires. However, crucial data such as fire frequency, seasonality, fire regime, hot spots, susceptibility zones, and vegetation affected by wildfires have not been fully determined yet in the case of Norway. To help with this task, the present study aims to document fire patterns in Norway using the wildfire data collected by the Directorate of Civil Protection (DSB) in the database. This database collects the information provided by the fire reports filled by the fire brigades in charge of the management of the incident. These reports contain information such as the burned area, date and time of initiation, and ignition details. Over 8 years (2016\u20132023), a total of around 9900 wildfires were recorded, affecting an area equivalent to 2461 hectares of the total burned area. In Norway, wildfires affect smaller areas in comparison with others. Between 2016 and 2023, approximately 9793 wildfires were recorded, burning a total area of about 16,157 hectares. In Norway, wildfires typically affect smaller areas compared to other regions. However, 2018 was a remarkable exception, with the highest number of fires and the largest burned area during this period, resulting in significant economic losses. A 95% rise in forest and grassland fires from 2017 to 2018 led to an additional expenditure of 1079.9 million kroner on preparedness, averaging 1.06 million kroner per avoidable fire call14. This unprecedented wildfire activity raised critical questions about the underlying factors, particularly the climatic conditions driving such events. It also emphasized the importance of evaluating how policies and regulations evolved or were introduced in response to this extraordinary year.</p><p>It is known that various factors such as climatic conditions, topography, vegetation type, and socioeconomic factors significantly influence fire frequencies and intensities. In this study, we focus on trends in fire occurrence, vulnerable counties, specific periods of high fire activity within a season, and the influence of climatic conditions such as land surface temperature (LST), precipitation, and wind on monthly wildfire variations. Additionally, we analyse the effects of PDSI and LST on wildfires and their connection to large wildfire events in 2018.</p><p>Furthermore, we analyse counties with higher fire frequencies, larger burn areas, and maximum burn area per fire by region. To assess spatial risk factors for each county, data on the number of fires, total burn area, and burn area per fire were combined to create a composite risk index. This index identifies counties at maximum risk when all three factors are considered equally significant. Recognizing these patterns can help improve wildfire management and mitigation efforts.</p><p>Finally, this study examines the current regulations in Norway related to wildfires and the operational implementation of resources for managing these situations. The goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of wildfire management in Norway, concluding with recommendations to enhance awareness and mitigate the future impacts of wildfires, especially in addressing extreme years like 2018.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Data and methods</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target area</emphasis></p><p>Here, we analyse data from wildfires that occurred in Norway from 2016 to 2023 (see Fig. 1). Positioned on the Western side of the Scandinavian Peninsula in Northwestern Europe, Norway lies between 57\u00b0 58\u2032 N and 71\u00b0 11\u2032 N latitude, and 4\u00b0 40\u2032 E and 30\u00b0 58\u2032 E longitude, placing it centrally within the westerlies and both temperate and polar climate zones30. Mainland Norway exhibits a diverse range of physical features, resulting in various climate conditions, encompassing five climate zones according to the K\u00f6ppen classification31. Its proximity to the North Atlantic Current on the western side of the Scandinavian Peninsula moderates the climate to a more temperate level compared to its geographical location. The extensive coastline, numerous fjords, islands, varying altitudes up to 2469 m above sea level, and the transition from maritime to continental climates from West to East contribute to diverse climate patterns on regional and local scales. The Southwestern coastal lowlands of Norway experience relatively temperate climates, while mountainous regions inland often receive substantial precipitation throughout the year, with significant snow accumulation in winter, feeding numerous glaciers. In contrast, the more continental regions of Eastern Norway are notably drier, and the elevated mountain plateaus, particularly in Northern Norway, exhibit subarctic characteristics, including occurrences of permafrost32.Fig. 1</p><p>Maps of Norway representing elevation and population density (top), vegetation (bottom right), and K\u00f6ppen climate types (bottom left).

The country\u2019s vegetation varies along three gradients: from south to north, from lowlands to mountains, and from coastal areas to inland regions, resulting in seven distinct vegetational regions33. On the west coast, characterized by its oceanic climate, heathlands are the dominant vegetation type. Until five decades ago, numerous farmers actively managed these heathlands through cyclical practices, including prescribed fires. However, in the last two decades, nearly all such management activities have ceased, leading to a gradual overgrowth of shrubs and trees across the landscape. This process continues to accelerate today34. These heathlands are the main fire risk on the West coast. Conversely, the inland areas, characterized by higher topography, are home to tall trees of various species, such as Scots pine and Norway spruce, resulting in distinct fire behaviour and fire risk compared to other regions. Furthermore, changes in vegetation over the years have altered fire behaviour from pine-dominated forests, prone to fire, to spruce-dominated forests with reduced fire occurrence1,351.</p><p>Fires occurring North of the Arctic Circle are garnering significant attention and are anticipated to increase in frequency in the years ahead36,37. The lack of precedents for these fires makes it challenging to predict their behaviour accurately. In Norway, climate change is exacerbating conditions conducive to wildfires, leading to heightened risks and increased occurrences of such events. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are creating drier conditions, which, combined with longer periods of warm weather, are contributing to the drying out of vegetation and forest fuels. Expected changes in climate will lead to changes in the vegetation due to ecological survival limitations and adaptation to the new expected conditions. According to K\u00f6ppen-Geiger model Norway will transition to a new paradigm in the coming years and it is expected to have a more fire prone landscape38 as Fig. 2 shows. As a result, the fire season is extending, and wildfires are becoming more frequent and severe. Additionally, reduced snowpack and earlier spring thaws are leaving landscapes more vulnerable to ignition. These changes in climate are altering the fire regime in Norway, increasing the likelihood of large-scale wildfires that pose significant threats to ecosystems, biodiversity, property, and human lives. Furthermore, the impacts of wildfires extend beyond the immediate fire zone, affecting air quality, water resources, and long-term ecological resilience. Addressing the challenges posed by wildfires in the context of climate change requires coordinated efforts in fire management, land-use planning, and climate adaptation strategies to mitigate risks and enhance resilience in Norwegian landscapes.Fig. 2</p><p>Koppen Geiger evolution in vegetation from the actual one (1991\u20132020, left) to the last estimation model (2071\u20132099, right)38.

This Norwegian fire occurrence dataset includes the location and date of wildfires spanning from 2016 to the present. It encompasses all fires documented in grasslands, cultivated areas, forests, and uncultivated lands, independently of their ignition source. In this study, we consider the data collected from 1st January 2016 to 21st December 2023, covering 8 years. The total number of fires considered in this study is 9737.</p><p>The data are sourced from the fire and rescue service reporting system in Norway, known as BRIS (brann- og redningstjenestens rapporteringssystem)40. This dataset includes all fires, not imposing a lower limit on the burned area. However, it is necessary to remark that the data reported in this database, and used in the present study, is not precise regarding the area, being an estimate from the reporting fire officer that determines the size reported. The locations in the dataset represent the GPS locations of the trucks attending the incident. Although these locations may not precisely correspond to the locations where the fire originated, since they correspond to the positions of the first resource to arrive, it is the only reported location that can be associated with these events. The fire reports contain Norwegian fire investigation data compiled since 2016 when DSB initiated the consolidation of data after fires using a uniform nationwide post-fire investigation method. The primary aim of investigating these data reports is to accurately identify the causes, damage, and characteristics of fires and to implement effective fire prevention measures. In terms of this investigation, a fire is defined as a combustion phenomenon that is unintentionally started (by human mishandling, errors, wrong maintenance of electric infrastructures, or naturally mainly by lighting) or caused by arson, requiring the use of fire extinguishing equipment or equally effective means. A single fire is defined as one that has spread from a single point of origin, commencing with fire initiation and continuing until extinguishment. The investigation encompasses all fire phenomena occurring within the territory of Norway. Importantly, the fire reports contain personal and private information. Hence, all fire information presented in this study underwent averaging, summation, and statistical processing. Additionally, any details pertaining to individual cases that were not publicly disclosed were excluded.</p><p>To complement the Norwegian fire occurrence dataset, we incorporated satellite imagery analysis to estimate the burned area for each fire incident. Using the latitude, longitude, and date of the fire from the BRIS dataset, burn area was estimated using Landsat 8 Collection 2 Level-2 Surface Reflectance (SR) imagery accessed via Google Earth Engine (GEE)41. For each fire event, images were selected within a 30-day window before and after the recorded ignition date, and a 1 km buffer was created around each ignition coordinate to account for location uncertainty and capture localized burn impact. This buffer size was chosen to account for spatial uncertainty in ignition location data, which is common in historical fire datasets, and to capture localized burn dynamics, particularly in low-to-moderate severity fire events. Additionally, it ensured spatial consistency in the burned area calculations across all fire records, providing a standardized approach for analysis. Images were cloud- and snow-masked using the QA_PIXEL bitmask (cloud shadow: bit 3, snow: bit 4, cloud: bit 5), as recommended by the USGS. A mosaic of the filtered images was created for both pre-fire and post-fire periods. The Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) was calculated by taking the difference between the Near-Infrared (Band 5) and Shortwave Infrared (Band 7) reflectance values, divided by their sum. The difference between pre- and post-fire NBR (dNBR) was used to assess burn severity and estimate burned area. The burned area was classified into severity levels, and the total area affected, particularly in moderate to low severity classes, was calculated in hectares. This method allowed for a more precise estimation of fire-affected areas, compensating for the inherent inaccuracies of the BRIS-reported burned area data. To ensure the accuracy of our total burned area calculations, we implemented checks and adjustments based on conditions during fire incidents, local fire department data, and filtered out satellite imagery affected by cloudy conditions. To address inaccuracies, we excluded cloudy imagery for better satellite analysis, setting burned areas to zero if reported as less than 20 hectares, and adjusting satellite-derived estimates based on fire department data when discrepancies appeared. This method corrected potential exaggerations caused by cloudy conditions or misinterpretations in satellite imagery. We found that 4,512 fires retained their original recorded areas, while 5,225 fires had updated values. This approach significantly enhanced the dataset\u2019s reliability, crucial for effective fire management and response strategies. The data analysis focused on identifying temporal and spatial characteristics of wildfire occurrences across Norway from 2016 to 2023 and evaluating associated climatic drivers. Four key analytical components were undertaken: (1) analysis of temporal patterns to explore trends and seasonal variation in wildfire activity; (2) assessment of spatial patterns of fire distribution by county; (3) computation of a Composite Wildfire Risk (CWR) to classify counties based on frequency and intensity of fire activity; and (4) evaluation of spatiotemporal relationships with climatic variables. The CWR was derived using a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach that integrated three indicators: number of fires per year (NFPY), average burned area per year (BAPY), and average burned area per fire (BAPF). Each indicator was normalized using min\u2013max scaling, and equal weights (1/3) were assigned to ensure balanced contribution from all factors. The final composite risk score was calculated as the average of the normalized values, and counties were classified into five risk categories using the natural breaks classification method. The classification thresholds used in the analysis are detailed in Table 1.Table 1</p><p>Threshold Values for Risk Classification derived using Natural Breaks Classification Method.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"5\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"144\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"144\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><thead><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">Levels</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\">NFPY (fires/year)</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\">BAPY (hectares/year)</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\">BAPF (hectares/fire)</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col5\">CWR (unitless)</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Very low</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">54</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">55</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">0</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.03</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Low</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">66</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">122</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">1.0</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.21</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Medium</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">92</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">177</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">1.3</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.33</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">High</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">152</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">377</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">2.0</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.60</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Very high</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">331</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">379</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">6.0</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.72</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>The analysis on wildfire initiation risk in Norway uses specific threshold values to categorize counties based on three main criteria: the number of fires per year (NFPY), the average burned area per year (BAPY), and the average burned area per fire (BAPF). These thresholds help in systematically classifying the risk levels of each county, thereby enabling targeted wildfire management and prevention strategies. The analysis began with extracting data on fire occurrences, including the associated counties and dates over the last eight years. This data was then aggregated and grouped by county and year to calculate the average number of fires per year for each county. Using this aggregated data, the counties were classified into different risk levels based on natural breaks classification, ensuring each class contained an equal number of features. Based on the threshold values for the number of fires per year (NFPY), counties are categorized are mentioned in Table 1.</p><p>To merge the three wildfire risk types into a single composite risk classification, a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach with equal weighting for each criterion was employed. The three risk types considered were the number of fires per year (NFPY), average burned area per year (BAPY), and average burned area per fire (BAPF).</p><p>First, the data for each criterion was normalized using the provided threshold values. This ensured that the data from different criteria could be compared on a common scale between 0 and 1. The normalization formula is mentioned in Eq. (1).1</p><p>The composite risk score was calculated for each region by multiplying the normalized value of each criterion by its respective weight (1/3 for each criterion), and summing these weighted values. This composite risk score provided an overall measure of the wildfire risk for each region. The composite risk score is calculated by averaging these normalized values in Eq. (2).2</p><p>Finally, the counties were classified into risk levels based on the composite risk scores. The risk levels were defined using Natural Breaks classification, where the counties were divided into groups based on the distribution of the composite risk scores.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Results</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Temporal patterns and characteristics of fire occurrences between 2016 and 2023</emphasis></p><p>On average, more than 1,233 wildfires occur per year, burning over 2,036 hectares per year. For comparison, there were 3,175 building fires reported in 2019. Individual wildfires in Norway tended to be small, with an average of 1.64 hectares per fire in the 4594 fires where the burned area is reported. 3756 of these fires reported a burned area of less than 1 hectare. The specific statistics and values largely vary depending on the studied year, as discussed in the following sections.</p><p>This section studies the temporal variability of wildfires in Norway by analysing the distribution of events over the years. Both the fire initiation and the fire spread are analysed. Fire initiation focuses on the start of the fire, independently of the cause, which escalates to an uncontrollable scale. It is quantified by the number of fires. Fire spread indicates the extent to which a fire propagates after initiation, and it is measured by the burned area. These parameters largely vary across regions and time, influenced by natural factors such as ignition sources and firefighting efforts.</p><p>Complex trends in wildfire activity from 2016 to 2023 are observed from the collected information, as can be observed in Figs. 3 and 4. Initially, from 2016 to 2018, both the number of wildfires and the total burned area experienced notable changes. Specifically, 2018 stands out due to its exceptionally high number of fires (2,115), indicating an intense period of fire initiation with a total burned area of 4691 hectares, suggesting that 2018 experienced severe wildfire events not only in terms of wildfire count but also in size. In contrast, 2019 saw a significant drop in the number of fires (to 842), yet it recorded a total burned area of 2,743 hectares, showing a higher average burned area per fire than 2018. This indicates that while there were fewer fires, at least some of them were probably more extensive. In 2020, a decrease in both metrics was observed: the number of fires was 995, and the total burned area dramatically decreased to 842 hectares, suggesting effective containment and reduced fire spread. From 2021 onwards, the trends show a gradual increase in the total burned area, with it reaching 2,456 hectares in 2023. During this period, the number of fires remained relatively constant, staying above 800 fires per year. This consistent fire count, coupled with the fluctuating burned areas, underscores the complexity of wildfire dynamics. The year 2020 stands out with both the burned area per fire and the burned area for the largest cases exhibiting a decline, indicating that while fire initiation remained significant, the fire spread was limited.Fig. 3</p><p>Total number of fires in Norway per year from 2016 to 2024 (blue columns) and total burned area per year (red line).</p><p>Fig. 4</p><p>Burned are due to wildfires in Norway in the period 2016\u20132023. Total burned area (blue) per year taking into account all the fires and the biggest 1% of the fires (dotted red). Average burned are per fire (green) per year taking into consideration all occurred fires.</p><p>These observations suggest that the fire initiation process has played a more significant role than the fire spread process in the long-term reduction observed. While the number of fires has remained high, the ability of these fires to spread and cause large-scale damage has varied, highlighting the importance of addressing both fire initiation and spread processes to manage and mitigate wildfire impacts effectively. Alternatively, the extent of burned areas per fire showed notable yearly fluctuations, and the pattern of these changes was similar for both the largest fires and the overall total burned area.</p><p>This means that the way the size of the biggest fires varied each year matched the overall yearly changes in the total area burned. Additionally, Fig. 5 represents the annual average burned area per fire categorized by size percentiles (100%, top 50%, top 30%, and top 10%) from 2016 to 2023, highlighting the disproportionate impact of the largest fires on the total burned area. In Fig. 5, the combined burned area of the top 10, 30, 50, and all largest fires each year is shown. The results demonstrate a clear disparity in the burned area contribution between large and small fires. The top 10% of fires, categorized by size, consistently account for the majority of the burned area each year, with a notable peak in 2018 and 2019, reflecting the occurrence of exceptionally large fire events during these years. In contrast, the average burned area for all fires (100% category) remains relatively low, suggesting that the majority of fires are small and have limited impact. This highlights the disproportionate influence of large fires on overall fire damage and underscores the importance of targeted management strategies aimed at preventing and mitigating large fire events. Consequently, the total burned area each year is mainly influenced by a few very large fires rather than smaller fires. This means that a small number of big fires have a much greater impact on the overall burned area than many smaller fires combined. Thus, understanding the factors influencing large-scale wildfires is crucial when analyzing yearly variations in burned areas. Given that our study period only spans 8 years, from 2016 to 2023, the impact of climate change is difficult to detect. However, the increase in the number of events in 2018 is However, it is important to note that the annual variation in the burned area per fire is influenced by large-scale events, underscoring the importance of understanding natural factors such as extreme dryness and strong winds. These natural factors can play a significant role in determining the severity and extent of wildfires, alongside social changes.Fig. 5</p><p>Annual burned area per fire in the period 2016\u20132023 analysing all the fires (blue), top 50% of the fires (red), top 30% of the fires (green), and top 10% of the fires (orange). To the left, burned are and to right average burned area.</p><p>It has also been observed a shift in Norway\u2019s fire season from the conventional summer months to a more predominant occurrence during spring, particularly from April to July (Fig. 6), which can be attributed to several interconnected factors. As winter transitions to spring, the protective snow and ice cover on the landscape gradually diminish, leaving vegetation exposed. This exposure allows the vegetation to dry out rapidly due to increased sunlight and temperatures characteristic of the spring season. By April, when the protective winter shell has dissipated significantly, the vegetation reaches a critical point of dryness, rendering it highly susceptible to ignition. Additionally, the weather patterns in April often feature lower precipitation, which further exacerbate the dryness of the vegetation and increase the risk of fires igniting and spreading rapidly. This combination of factors creates a perfect storm for wildfires, resulting in a clear maximum in the number of fires and the total area burned during April. The heightened dryness of the vegetation, coupled with conducive weather conditions, culminates in a peak fire occurrence during this month42.Fig. 6</p><p>Total number of fires and area burned per month in the period 2016\u20132023 in Norway. On the top right, ratio of fires depending on the day of the week during the period 2016\u20132023.</p><p>Additionally, seasonal changes are also influenced by anthropogenic conditions, such as an increased number of visitors for recreational purposes. A high number of fires in April and early May starts around fishing or camping sites (fireplaces mishandled) and around areas of great affluence of people (big cities). Figure 6 illustrates another temporal characteristic, depicting the number of fires and the area burned by the day of the week. It is worth noting that fires are more frequent on weekends than weekdays, hinting at a link with recreational pursuits. Notably, Fridays and Saturdays stand out with a surge in fire incidents, suggesting heightened outdoor activities during these periods. Moreover, the number of fires tends to be higher during weekends in March, April, and May. In the seasonal variation observed in Fig. 6, the substantial disparity between the highest and lowest data points ranging from 5 to 10 times indicates a pronounced influence of natural conditions. This suggests that seasonal changes significantly impact the behaviour of fires. Notably, while fire initiation is predominantly influenced by seasonal variations in natural factors, such as temperature and humidity, it\u2019s essential to recognize that both fire initiation and fire spread are subject to seasonal effects. This means that not only does the likelihood of fires starting change with the seasons, but also the extent to which they propagate across landscapes. For instance, during dry and hot seasons, the conditions favour both the ignition and rapid spread of fires, whereas during cooler and wetter periods, fire occurrence and propagation may be limited. Thus, understanding the seasonal dynamics is crucial for assessing fire risk and management strategies.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Spatial patterns of wildfire occurrences</emphasis></p><p>The location of wildfires in the last years also gives an important information regarding the expected future occurrence of events. The analysis of the average number of fires and area burned in the last 8 years is represented in Fig. 7, where the spatial variation of wildfire occurrences by county is shown, being evident that the number of fires tends to be higher in the southern regions, particularly in the southeast. Southeast is comprises of counties such as Innlandet, Viken, Oslo, Vestfold and Adger. In southeast where some counties experienced over 100 wildfires per year. Compared to that, the Southwest\u2014which comprises counties like Rogaland and Vestland\u2014experienced fewer wildfires. As explained before, Southeast is characterized by drier conditions and denser population in counties like Viken and Oslo compared to the northern other regions, characteristics known to contribute to the occurrence of wildfires. Conversely, the northern part of Norway (Nordland, Troms og Finnmark) shows fewer wildfire cases, totalling approximately 450 on average approximately 96 fires per year cases over 8 years. Figure 7 displays the spatial distribution of the burned area, which exhibits a similar distribution except for Vestfold and. Counties such as Rogaland, located in the western coast, recorded the highest values of burned areas. In comparison, and despite the high number of fires in the Viken Vestfold region, the burned area there was relatively smaller than Rogaland.Fig. 7</p><p>Composite wildfire risk map of Norway by county shown in the left part. Right part, from top to bottom, shows the number of fires, the burned area, and the burned area per year in each county during the period 2016\u20132023. The maps were generated using Geopandas (v0.10.2, <url normalizedValue=\"https://geopandas.org/\">https://geopandas.org/</url>), Matplotlib (v3.4.3, <url normalizedValue=\"https://matplotlib.org/\">https://matplotlib.org/</url>), Seaborn (v0.11.2, <url normalizedValue=\"https://seaborn.pydata.org/\">https://seaborn.pydata.org/</url>), and Mapclassify (v2.4.3, <url normalizedValue=\"https://pysal.org/notebooks/explore/mapclassify/intro.html\">https://pysal.org/notebooks/explore/mapclassify/intro.html</url>) in Python.</p><p>Figure 7 also indicates the burned area per fire, which was notably high in Rogaland and Agder. To better highlight spatial variation, the national average rate was determined. It was observed that the number of fires was higher in the Eastern areas, which are the most densely populated regions in Norway and experience dry conditions in winter. In this study, the fire season was defined as the period encompassing consecutive months with a number of wildfires greater than 100. The fire season typically commences around early March in the southern part of Norway and gradually progresses northward over approximately three months, beginning around late May in Finnmark. The shift in the wildfire season is likely influenced by factors such as dryness and vegetation patterns. Moreover, heavy snowfall in the northern part of Norway during winter months may explain the smaller number of wildfires compared to other seasons, as snow-covered surfaces inhibit fire occurrence. Regions in central Norway exhibit unique characteristics, where the wildfire season starts slightly later and lasts longer. This could be attributed to the region\u2019s specific weather patterns and population density. Additionally, since hydrological factors contributing to wildfire occurrence vary across regions, it is challenging to determine the dominant factors for wildfire occurrence. Future research should focus on identifying regional and seasonal drying factors and their spatial characteristics to better understand wildfire occurrences.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Composite wildfire risk (CWR)</emphasis></p><p>The composite wildfire risk (CWR) classification reveals significant disparities among the counties, particularly highlighting those with very high and very low risk levels. Counties such as Rogaland, and Viken have been categorized as \u201cVery High\u201d risk areas. This classification indicates an exceptionally high frequency and intensity of wildfires in these regions, necessitating urgent attention and substantial resource allocation for wildfire prevention and management. (see Fig. 7) The very high composite risk scores for these counties suggest that they consistently experience large numbers of fires, significant burned areas per year, and considerable burned areas per fire, emphasizing the need for proactive and robust wildfire mitigation strategies.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum, More og Romsdal and Nordland are classified as a \u201cVery Low\u201d risk area, with a composite risk score indicating minimal wildfire activity. This low-risk classification implies that these counties experience a significantly lower frequency and intensity of wildfires compared to other regions. As a result, fewer resources may be required for wildfire management in these regions, allowing policymakers to focus efforts on higher-risk areas. The distinct contrast between these counties underscores the importance of tailored wildfire management strategies that account for the specific risk levels of each region. By prioritizing interventions in very high-risk areas and maintaining vigilance in very low-risk areas, stakeholders can effectively mitigate the impact of wildfires across Norway.</p><p>The spatial distribution of wildfire risk across Norway, as revealed by this analysis, provides critical insights for wildfire management strategies. High and very high-risk counties require more focused attention and resources for wildfire prevention and management. Understanding the areas with high average burned areas per fire can help in developing targeted mitigation efforts to reduce the impact of each fire incident. Implementing proactive measures in counties with higher fire risks can help mitigate the impact on communities and ecosystems. In conclusion, the systematic approach utilized in this analysis offers valuable insights into the spatial distribution of fire risk across Norway. By categorizing counties based on different aspects of fire activity, policymakers and stakeholders can prioritize interventions and allocate resources more effectively to reduce the impact of wildfires. This analysis underscores the importance of comprehensive wildfire management and prevention strategies tailored to the specific risks of each region.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Spatial temporal characteristic of wildfire with respect to climatic factors</emphasis></p><p>2Understanding climatic factors is crucial for assessing wildfire risk, particularly in diverse geographical regions like Norway. Wildfires can have significant impacts on ecosystems, biodiversity, and human livelihoods. The occurrence and severity of wildfires are closely linked to climatic conditions, especially temperature, wind speed, and precipitation. Higher temperatures and drier conditions generally increase the likelihood and intensity of wildfires 43, 44,44. The climatic variables used in the correlation analysis, wind speed, precipitation rate, land surface temperature (LST), and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), were obtained from globally recognised remote sensing and reanalysis datasets to ensure accuracy and consistency across Norway43, 44\u201345. Wind speed and precipitation data were sourced from the ERA5 reanalysis dataset provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)43, with 10-m U and V wind components processed into scalar wind speed (m/s), and total precipitation (mm/day), including rainfall and snowfall. Both variables were originally available at an hourly temporal resolution and a spatial resolution of approximately 0.25\u00b0 \u00d7 0.25\u00b0 (31 km), and were aggregated to monthly averages and sums, respectively, for the period 2016 to 2023. Land surface temperature (LST) was derived from MODIS Terra (MOD11C3) and Aqua (MYD11C3) Level-3 products44, offering monthly data at 0.05\u00b0 (5.6 km) resolution. The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), reflecting long-term dryness patterns, was obtained from the TerraClimate dataset developed by the University of Idaho45, with monthly data at 0.0417\u00b0 (4 km) resolution for the same period. All datasets were clipped to the national extent of Norway, and monthly spatial averages were calculated to ensure temporal alignment and consistency across the climatic indicators. This preprocessing ensured that the climatic indicators aligned temporally with monthly fire count records, enabling a consistent basis for the correlation analysis.</p><p>As previous studies14,46,47 pointed out, both the absence of rain and the amount of rainfall are essential in determining fire risk. Higher temperatures and stronger winds typically increase the risk of fires. Interestingly, Grimsrud found that \"average wind speed for the month\" surprisingly decreases fire risk, possibly because larger storm systems with high winds often bring moist air, reducing fire danger. In this study, we investigated the relationship between wildfire activity and three key climatic variables: land surface temperature (LST), precipitation, and wind speed. These were selected based on their relevance in previous literature and availability from remote sensing datasets. We calculated Pearson correlation coefficients between the monthly average values of these climatic variables and the monthly fire counts across Norway for the period 2016\u20132023. This allowed us to quantify the linear relationship between each factor and the number of fires. By using a scatter plot to illustrate the relationship, we derived several insights (See Fig. 8). Our findings show a negative correlation between the number of fires and both wind speed (\u2212 0.31) and precipitation rate (\u2212 0.45). On the other hand, there is a positive correlation (0.45) between the number of fires and average LST. This suggests that higher temperatures increase fire likelihood, whereas higher wind and precipitation reduce it. These results are consistent with previous observations, including Grimsrud\u2019s14 interpretation of wind and moisture dynamics.Fig. 8</p><p>Relation between climatic factors (wind speed, precipitation and Land Surface Temperature) and number of fire in Norway on a monthly basis in the period 2016\u20132023.</p><p>To assess the potential role of longer-term dry conditions, we also examined the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)44. The PDSI is a well-established drought indicator that captures extended dryness patterns. Our comparison between annual PDSI values and fire counts revealed that 2018, a year with extreme drought and unusually high LST, recorded the highest number of wildfires. This reinforces the link between prolonged dry spells and fire outbreaks. This year was also characterized by very high land surface temperatures, as our annual analysis of LST against wildfire count showed a similar pattern as presented in Fig. 9.Fig. 9</p><p>Number of Fires vs Palmer Drought Severity Index and Land Surface Temperature (2016\u20132023).</p><p>It\u2019s important to note that our correlation analysis does not imply causality, but rather highlights statistical relationships. We acknowledge the limitations of using correlation alone and the importance of considering both current and antecedent climatic conditions. While this preliminary analysis is useful for identifying trends, future work will include time-lagged correlation and multivariate regression models to more accurately quantify the influence of pre-conditions on wildfire ignition and spread.</p><p>By leveraging remote sensing data such as land surface temperature , precipitation records, wind datasets, and PDSI imagery in conjunction with wildfire occurrence data, this study provides a foundation for understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of wildfires in Norway. These insights are valuable for developing early warning systems and proactive mitigation strategies.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Current management strategies</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fire regulations</emphasis></p><p>In Norway, there are no specific regulations related to wildfire management, control or protection. In this section, the three regulations that rule fires are described, and the mention on wildfires that they include, if so. These three documents are: the Act on protection against fire, explosion and accidents involving dangerous substances and on the fire service\u2019s rescue tasks (LOV-2003-06-14-20)48; the Regulation on fire prevention (FOR-2015-12-17-1710)49; and the Regulations on the organisation, staffing and equipment of the fire and rescue services and the emergency reporting centres (FOR-2021-09-15-2755)50.</p><p>The purpose of the Act is to protect life, health, the environment and material assets against fire and explosion, against accidents involving dangerous substances and dangerous goods and other acute accidents, as well as unwanted intentional incidents.</p><p>The Act is superior and sets general requirements for the public and municipalities in prevention, and preparedness. It establishes that everyone has to act in a proper manner to prevent fires. If fires occur, it must be immediately reported to the emergency response centre. If possible, the effects of the damage should be limited (ref. \u00a7 5). Additionally, every owner of a building, vehicle, area (forest), must take necessary measures to prevent and limit fires. Additionally, the owner must establish surveillance after a wildfire (ref. \u00a7 6). It also states that the municipality is responsible for establishing a fire service for handling local risks in the municipality, both in terms of preventive and preparedness measures (ref. \u00a7 9). In addition to firefighting, the fire department must conduct informational campaigns for the public, property owners, and others, as well as engage in preventive measures to avoid all kind of fires (ref. \u00a7 11). The municipality has the opportunity to establish extraordinary measures when necessary. For example, during high wildfire danger, a total ban on open fires may be imposed (ref. \u00a7 14). Have any reference to wildfires.</p><p>The Regulation on fire prevention should help reduce the likelihood of fire, and limit the consequences that fire can have on life, health, the environment, and material values. It supplements the requirements set by the Act at a more detailed level. In this regulation, the prohibition to use fires or handle flammable objects in or near forests and other uncultivated land from April 15th to September 15th is established (ref. \u00a7 3). It also defines that the municipality should conduct fire prevention work based on assessed risks (ref. \u00a7 14\u201316).</p><p>The Regulations on the organisation, staffing and equipment of the fire and rescue services and the emergency reporting centres aim to a. set requirements for the municipalities regarding the organisation, staffing and equipment of fire and rescue services and emergency reporting centres, b. sets requirements for the municipalities regarding the competence of personnel in the fire and rescue services and emergency reporting centres must have c. shall contribute to reducing the probability and consequences of fires and other accidents. On this, these regulations establish that the municipality is responsible for establishing a fire service based on a risk analysis, emergency preparedness analysis, and preventive analysis. There are some requirements that must be met, and then the fire service have to be adapted to local risks (ref. \u00a7 6\u20139). It also defines that reinforcement resources have to be established in municipalities/regions where there can be a significant risk for wildfires (ref. \u00a7 16). There are no specific equipment requirements, but three must be equipment to handle incidents they are designed for based on their analysis (ref. \u00a7 19). This regulation is not focused on wildfires, but mentions it in paragraph 16, where it establishes the reserve forces for wildfires and other incidents, saying that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">If the fire and rescue service\u2019s own emergency forces do not have sufficient personnel resources to handle emergency situations that may occur, including in areas where there is a significant risk of wildfire, the fire and rescue service alone or in cooperation with other fire and rescue services must ensure have sufficient reserve forces for wildfires and other incidents. The need for reserve forces must be evident from the preparedness analysis.</emphasis> It also clarifies that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">the reserve force must be trained for the tasks</emphasis>.</p><p>Finally, it is important to notice that fire prevention can also be conducted through maintenance of the landscape, not only fire regulations. Poorly managed landscapes can be highly flammable and the cost of incidents happening has been proven to be much higher than the costs of covering preventive measures. There is no existing previous data to prove this point, but several analysis has shown that increased management of the landscape reduces the risk of fire considerably, mainly in periods when weather conditions increase this risk. In areas where vegetation is highly flammable, such as the heathlands in coastal Norway, a management plan is the most important management measure14, ensuring a reduction in the number of fires and the related costs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operational strategies</emphasis></p><p>The Ministry of Justice and Public Service has the overall responsibility for fire protection in Norway. The Directorate for Civil Protection (DSB), on behalf of the Ministry of Justice and Public Service, is the national fire authority and the overall task is to maintain a complete overview of various risks and vulnerability in general. DSB has a role that means that the directorate has subject, administrative and supervisory responsibilities, but does not have the authority to issue instructions to the municipalities\u2019 fire and rescue services51. Fire services\u2019 responsibilities cover local, regional and national preparedness and emergency planning, fire safety, electrical safety, handling and transport of hazardous substances, as well as product and consumer safety52.</p><p>Fighting the fires is the municipalities\u2019 responsibility through local fire and rescue services. Municipalities are responsible for establishing and operating a fire and rescue service, whose main tasks include conducting fire prevention activities and serving as an intervention force in the event of a fire. The fire and rescue service should also serve as an intervention force in other incidents as determined based on the municipalities\u2019 risk and vulnerability analysis.</p><p>As of February 2024, there were 197 fire and rescue services in Norway, employing approximately 12,000 employees, including 4200 full-tome and 7800 part time staff52. With 357 municipalities in Norway, there are several collaborations between them, resulting in fewer fire departments than municipalities. In order to support smaller municipalities, or any fire station during an event that cannot be controlled exclusively by the nearest fire station, collaboration between fire stations in different municipalities are essential. It is up to each municipality to decide how extensive the collaboration will be. When it is necessary, an emergency alert goes to one of the 12 112-centers in the country.</p><p>There are 609 fire stations distributed in 385,207 square kilometres country52. The placement of fire stations is based on response time requirements to populate areas and/or buildings with specific risks, with response times requirements typically set to 10 to 20 min. From the total number of fire stations in Norway, 68 of them reported to have special competences for wildfires fighting in 2022. Many municipalities have established an extra wildfire reserve. Usually, the fire service is in charge when wildfires occur, but if lives or health are threatened, the police have the role of the overall incident commander, and other commanders integrate into a joint leadership structure. In the wildfire services planning framework, other resources may also be relevant. The forestry industry can contribute to extinguish and during post-extinguishment. Local farmers contribute to the efforts too, as well as volunteers. This working procedure is known as the Telemark model53. Table 2 shows how the emergency preparedness cooperation complements each other with materials and tasks, in connection with wildfire drills and incidents.Table 2</p><p>Telemark model working procedure for collaboration on the fight of wildfires in Norway53.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><thead><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">Civil defence</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\">Fire department</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\">Wildfire troopers</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\">Forest industry</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">4?? hose</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2 \u00bd ?? hose</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1 \u00bd ?? hose</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">2 \u00bd ?? hose</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1 \u00bd ?? hose</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1 ?? hose</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Heavy water supply</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Water supply</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Light water supply</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Large pumps</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Medium pumps</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Light weigh pumps / Self-erecting water tubs</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Forestry machinery, load carriers, forestry packages</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Own crews</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Firefighters</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Own crews</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Employees, machinery</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Water supply, KO operation, transport</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Offensive extinguishment</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Defensive extinguishment</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Transport, logging streets</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Collaboration is essential in handling wildfires, and incidents are coordinated by the fire department\u2019s 110 emergency call centre. There are 12 such centres in Norway, to which all fire services are obligated to be connected52.</p><p>Since 2008, there have been several major events in Norway. On June 9, 2008, a significant wildfire started in Froland municipality in Aust-Agder, where several cabins and 1900 hectares of productive forest were lost. The fire was very resource-intensive, with up to 16 helicopters and between 250 and 300 personnel involved in the firefighting effort. In January 2014, during eleven days two very large wildfires took place simultaneously. In Flatanger (Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag), a grass fire resulted in the loss of 64 buildings, including 23 residential and recreational houses. In Fr\u00e6oya (S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8dndelag), a fire started in heather in an area of 10 square kilometres, resulting in the loss a residential house. Extensive-evacuations were required in both incidents.</p><p>2018 is so far the record year for forest and nature fires. Thorough 2018, more than 2 000 fires in grass and forest were recorded due to an extremely dry summer in southern and eastern Norway. Nearly 1 000 of these fires were wildfires. Much of the emergency response apparatus in the affected areas was mobilized. Calm wind conditions helped prevent the situation from spiralling out of control. All these events have formed the basis for the wildfire regime we have today, including competency requirements, local, national and international cooperation, information campaigns, research and more.</p><p>In a report published by DSB in 201951, they recognised the existing challenges on wildfire fighting as: competence, organisation, responsibility, and authority. In a local level, the list of challenges included personnel resources, competence, material, local management and organisation, communication during extinguishing work, and relationship with other actors. In regional coordination, they focused on coordination of the fire service\u2019s resources, coordination of the emergency services efforts, and managing social consequences. They highlighted the limited number of fire fighters with wildfire expertise. In the years from the publication of this report (the last one available), several efforts have been made to improve the situation.</p><p>One of the main improvements is the availability of helicopters to combat these situations. To this end, DSB started a collaboration with a private helicopter company through which there is at least one available helicopter for wildfire fighting from April 15th to August 15th. One helicopter is always available, and the possibility of having others is open. As an example, in 2018 there were 22 helicopters available at the same time. As a comment, Norway has good access to light helicopters, but since 2018 there has been very limited access to larger helicopters.</p><p>Linked to the use of helicopters, DSB has coordinated a national management support scheme in which Rogaland brann og redning IKS points out fire commanders from several fire and rescue services with expertise on wildfire management. It is a requisite that all the commanders have done bushfire training and exercises and are well equipped to handle the management of bushfire fighting. One leading commander supports the fire chief who is responsible for a wildfire. The responsibility of managing the wildfire will always lie with the fire and rescue service that has the fire in their area of responsibility14,46,47.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Recommendations</emphasis></p><p>As a main recommendation, the different entities involved in wildfire management must understand the inevitable increase in dangerous situations that will come soon. It is important to study the most probable location of these fires, which can be derived from the composite wildfire risk developed in this work. The location, as well as the most probable time (of the year and of the week) when these events will occur, have been described and need to be taken into account for the development of preventive activities to avoid these events from spreading.</p><p>In a more particular focus, the Norwegian Directorate for Civil Protection (DSB)3 made a number of recommendations that can be highlighted as follows:</p><p>Ensure adequate wildfire helicopter readiness with mandatory management support for extinguishing wildfires.</p><p>Consider how to facilitate the establishment of voluntary cooperation agreements between fire and rescue services and forestry contractors in wildfire preparedness.</p><p>Work towards effective wildfire monitoring and examine how the scheme can best be continued.</p><p>Clarify how wildfires and natural events are to be handled in protected areas.</p><p>Facilitate Norway\u2019s active use of new technology and collaborate with other countries on the development of systems that both prevent and manage fires.</p><p>Contribute to the use of new technology that can enhance fire prevention and extinguishing, including through the use of artificial intelligence (AI).</p><p>Additionally, by analysing the data and the current situation in Norway regarding wildfire handling, several points should be addressed to ensure complete and correct treatment of these incidents:</p><p>Implement ways to systematically analyse the territory in every Fire and Rescue Service (F&amp;R) in a homogenized way to be able to compare at a national level.</p><p>Improve and increase the number and quality of data registered in the database (ignition point, local weather data, accurate perimeter, fuel type, etc.)</p><p>Implement a double-check system in the register of data in the database to ensure that correct numbers of burned area are inserted.</p><p>Upgrade and standardize knowledge and training of F&amp;R fire and rescue at all levels (basic firefighters, brigade leaders, incident commander and administrative staff) with the aim of increasing situational awareness, performance and basically safety. There are international standards that could be implemented and followed in Norway.</p><p>Implement levels and categories of the emergency to establish priority rankings and operational phases to reassign resources if needed in a given situation.</p><p>Implement or improve the collaboration between F&amp;R, DSB and Academia from a problem\u2013solution perspective.</p><p>Define the WUI problem in Norway due to the huge vulnerability of its infrastructures and start to investigate and implement planning and prevention measurements to avoid scaling the emergency in a given moment.</p><p>Determine levels of vulnerability of the landscape/ territory and define actions to reduce the potential risk associated to that vulnerability.</p><p>Complex and large events need to be addressed in a knowledge-based manner, both preventively and in preparedness, and a capable organisation is necessary to this end.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conclusions</emphasis></p><p>In conclusion, our composite analysis of wildfire data from 2016 to 2023 reveals critical insights for improving wildfire management and preparedness in Norway. The conditions in 2018, which required extensive emergency response efforts, demonstrate the need to strengthen current strategies. Although calmer wind conditions helped limit further spread, still the event highlights the importance of better planning and prevention measures to address future wildfire risks. Consequently, there have been notable improvements in competence requirements, cooperation frameworks, information campaigns, and research initiatives.</p><p>Our findings highlight that higher temperatures and drier conditions generally increase both the likelihood and intensity of wildfires in Norway. A positive correlation with land surface temperature (r = 0.45), and negative correlations with wind speed (r = \u2212 0.31) and precipitation rate (r = \u2212 0.45), support previous research, such as Grimsrud (2018). The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) further confirms that extended dry periods, like in 2018, are strongly linked to increased fire activity. Although the 2016\u20132023 dataset is relatively limited, the trends indicate a growing need to prepare for longer fire seasons and expanded risk zones under changing climate conditions.</p><p>Spatial analysis identified southern counties such as Rogaland and Viken as \u201cVery High\u201d risk areas, requiring urgent attention and greater resource allocation, while regions like M\u00f8re og Romsdal and Nordland were found to be at \u201cVery Low\u201d risk. Seasonal patterns show wildfire activity peaking in April and May, especially near recreational and urban areas, emphasizing the importance of fire safety measures in these zones. Fires are more frequent on weekends, linked to increased human activity, while larger burned areas on weekdays suggest potential delays in detection or suppression. The earlier fire season onset in southern Norway, compared to the north, reflects climatic differences. Monitoring LST and related indicators can support proactive and region-specific wildfire management strategies.</p><p>In response to the wildfire management challenges identified by the DSB (2019), including issues related to competence, coordination, and resource allocation, several targeted measures have been implemented. These include enhanced helicopter availability during the fire season (April 15\u2013August 15) and the establishment of a national support scheme led by Rogaland brann og redning IKS, deploying experienced fire commanders to assist regional chiefs. To further strengthen preparedness, a shift toward area-specific strategies is essential, particularly for high-risk counties like Rogaland and Viken. Strengthening cooperation between fire services and forestry contractors, maintaining helicopter readiness, and integrating technologies such as AI and satellite monitoring are critical next steps.</p><p>Our findings support DSB\u2019s recommendations, emphasizing systematic territorial analysis, improved data quality, and standardized training for fire and rescue personnel. Moreover, fostering stronger collaboration among fire services, DSB, and academic institutions will help develop more robust wildfire strategies. Addressing Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) risks, enhancing post-fire landscape restoration, and regularly updating wildfire risk maps remain key to building long-term resilience and ensuring effective wildfire preparedness across Norway.</p><p>The regulations and operational forces are not fully prepared for the emerging conditions anticipated with future wildfire scenarios. However, by following several targeted suggestions, the situation can be significantly improved. Implementing proactive measures, informed by past events and comprehensive current data, will enhance Norway\u2019s capability to manage and mitigate wildfire risks. This integrated strategy will not only reduce the adverse impacts of wildfires but foster resilience and adaptability in the face of changing climatic conditions. Even with the inherent uncertainties, the certainty remains that readiness and preventive actions are imperative. These efforts will ensure a safer environment, where preventive measures and protective actions are effectively designed and implemented when necessary, thereby protecting lives, property, and the environment.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>This work was supported by the Norwegian Research Council under the project PREWISS (Prediction of Ignition and Spread of Wildfires in Scandinavia), number 315870.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><p>[1].IPCC.

According to news originating from Nanjing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Forest fires threaten global ecosystems, socio-economic structures, and public safety. Accurately assessing forest fire susceptibility is critical for effective environmental management.\" </p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the Ministry of Education, \"Supervised learning methods dominate this assessment, relying on a substantial dataset of forest fire occurrences for model training. However, obtaining precise forest fire location data remains challenging. To address this issue, semi-supervised learning emerges as a viable solution, leveraging both a limited set of collected samples and unlabeled data containing environmental factors for training. Our study employed the transductive support vector machine (TSVM), a key semi-supervised learning method, to assess forest fire susceptibility in scenarios with limited samples. We conducted a comparative analysis, evaluating its performance against widely used supervised learning methods. The assessment area for forest fire susceptibility lies in Dayu County, Jiangxi Province, China, renowned for its vast forest cover and frequent fire incidents. We analyzed and generated maps depicting forest fire susceptibility, evaluating prediction accuracies for both supervised and semi-supervised learning methods across various small sample scenarios (e.g., 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, and 32 samples). Our findings indicate that TSVM exhibits superior prediction accuracy compared to supervised learning with limited samples, yielding more plausible forest fire susceptibility maps. For instance, at sample sizes of 4, 16, and 28, TSVM achieves prediction accuracies of approximately 0.8037, 0.9257, and 0.9583, respectively. In contrast, random forests, the top performers in supervised learning, demonstrate accuracies of approximately 0.7424, 0.8916, and 0.9431, respectively, for the same small sample sizes. Additionally, we discussed three key aspects: TSVM parameter configuration, the impact of unlabeled sample size, and performance within typical sample sizes.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Our findings support semi-supervised learning as a promising approach compared to supervised learning for forest fire susceptibility assessment and mapping, particularly in scenarios with small sample sizes.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Forest fire susceptibility assessment under small sample scenario: A semi-supervised learning approach using transductive support vector machine.

Why is it important to study the topic?</p><p>My research focuses on fire risk, particularly in Mediterranean forests. Wildfires pose a significant threat to these ecosystems, damaging vegetation and undermining forests' ability to recover. However, fire can also have beneficial effects, such as promoting biodiversity and recycling nutrients in forest ecosystems.</p><p>This dissertation investigates how and why forest fires occur, recur, and transform Mediterranean ecosystems over time, with a specific focus on fire-prone areas in Eastern Spain. By analyzing spatial and temporal patterns of fire activity, vegetation dynamics, and land-use changes, we aim to understand the key drivers behind these changes and their ecological consequences.</p><p>In light of recent extreme fire events, it is clear that preventive and adaptive strategies are urgently needed. In the long term, effective forest planning can help manage these dynamics and reduce fire risks. This thesis addresses these issues, providing insights into their dynamics and the potential strategies to boost forests resilience and adaptation capacity.</p><p>What are the key findings or observations of your doctoral research?</p><p>Our research highlights the complex interactions between human activity, forested landscapes, and other drivers in shaping forest fire risk in Mediterranean areas. Human actions affect the likelihood of fire ignition, and land-use changes can either increase or reduce fuel continuity, thereby influencing how fires spread and impact forests. Climate also plays a key role by making vegetation more flammable under certain conditions. We found distinct factors driving the occurrence of small, medium, and large fires. Small fires are more likely in areas with high human accessibility, while large fires are also influenced by fuel type, especially in younger pine forests with dense shrub layers. This suggests that fire prevention and forest management strategies should be tailored to the scale of fire risk and the specific environmental conditions.</p><p>Additionally, certain forest types are more prone to reburning, and drought events appear to influence the timing of these repeated fires. In the medium term, frequent fires tend to reduce forest structural complexity, often leading to shrub-dominated landscapes. We also observed that tree species composition affects fire impact. While some species combinations show lower tree mortality after fire events, simply mixing species with different fire-related traits does not necessarily reduce damage.</p><p>How can the results of your doctoral research be utilised in practice?</p><p>The methods and insights from this dissertation can support forest managers and policymakers in enhancing forest resilience to wildfires. Our research provides a practical framework for estimating fire risk across Spanish forests and identifying which environmental and human-driven factors most influence fire occurrence and impact. This information can be incorporated into strategic forest planning to design targeted prevention measures and long-term adaptation strategies, ultimately helping to safeguard forests in a changing climate.</p><p>For instance, understanding that small fires are more prevalent in areas with high human accessibility suggests that targeted public awareness campaigns and stricter regulations in these zones could mitigate ignition risks. Conversely, recognizing that large fires are more likely in young pine forests with dense shrub layers indicates a need for proactive fuel management to reduce fuel continuity and flammability.</p><p>Moreover, insights into post-fire vegetation dynamics and the factors contributing to forest reburning can inform restoration efforts. By identifying forest types with higher reburn probabilities and understanding the role of drought events in fire recurrence, land managers can prioritize areas for rehabilitation and implement practices that enhance forest resilience.</p><p>The findings from the species composition analysis provide valuable insights for designing more fire-resilient forest landscapes. One of the key takeaways is that not all mixed-species stands are equally effective in reducing fire damage. While species diversity is often assumed to enhance resilience, our results show that simply combining species with different fire-related traits does not automatically lead to lower fire-induced mortality. In practice, this means forest managers must go beyond promoting diversity for its own sake. Instead, they should strategically select species combinations based on their specific fire survival traits (e.g., resprouting ability, bark thickness, etc.) and the ecological interactions between them.</p><p>Overall, our research supports a shift from reactive fire suppression to proactive fire regime management, emphasizing the importance of integrating ecological knowledge into land-use planning and forest management strategies to mitigate the long-term impacts of wildfires.</p><p>What are the key research methods and materials used in your doctoral research?</p><p>In this research we employed a multidisciplinary approach, combining spatial analysis, statistical modeling, and ecological assessment to investigate fire dynamics in Mediterranean forests. Key data sources included the Spanish National Forest Inventory, digital cartography, fire occurrence records, and environmental variables such as elevation, slope, and aspect. To analyze the size-dependent variables influencing fire occurrence, we utilized weighted generalized linear models, categorizing fires into small (5-50 ha), medium (50-500 ha), and large (500 ha) classes. This approach allowed for the identification of distinct factors associated with each fire size category, providing information into fire risk patterns across different landscapes.</p><p>The research also examined post-fire vegetation dynamics and the likelihood of forest reburning by assessing the temporal and spatial patterns of fire recurrence. This involved analyzing the interplay between vegetation types, fire history, and site conditions to determine factors contributing to repeated fires and changes in forest structure.</p><p>Additionally, the last study investigated the impact of species composition on fire-induced stand damage by comparing mortality rates in monospecific and mixed-species forests. This analysis considered the fire-related traits of various tree species and their combinations, providing insights into how species diversity influences forest vulnerability to wildfires. Collectively, these methods facilitated understanding the complex interactions driving fire regimes in Mediterranean ecosystems, offering practical guidance for developing adaptive forest planning strategies.</p><p>The doctoral dissertation of Marina Peris Llopis, MSc (Agr &amp; For), entitled Fires in Mediterranean forests: patterns of occurrence, transitions and impact will be examined at the Faculty of Science, Forestry and Technology, Joensuu Campus. The opponent will be Professor Cristina Vega, University of Lleida, Spain, and the custos will be Professor Blas Mola, University of Eastern Finland.

They're the same roads used by thousands of families and commercial truckers who cross into Mexico and back each day.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cDiseases know no borders,\" said Ocaranza, El Paso's top public health doctor, \"so as people are mobile, they're going to be coming and receiving medical attention in El Paso but they may be living in Juarez.\u201d It took a couple of months, but El Paso now has the highest measles case count in the state outside of West Texas with 38. Neighboring Ciudad Juarez has 14 cases as of Monday.</p><p>North America's three biggest measles outbreaks continue to balloon, with more than 2,500 known cases; three people have died in the U.S. and one in Mexico. It started in the fall in Ontario, Canada; then took off in late January in Texas and New Mexico; and has rapidly spread in Chihuahua state, which is up to 786 cases since mid-February.</p><p>These outbreaks are in areas with a notable population of certain Mennonite Christian communities who trace their migration over generations from <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-vaccinations-mennonites-4880035d6fd53cc029b531f5adda95ad\">Canada to Mexico to Seminole, Texas</url>. Chihuahua health officials trace their first case to an 8-year-old Mennonite child who visited family in Seminole, got sick and spread the virus at school. And Ontario officials say their outbreak started at a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ottawapublichealth.ca/en/professionals-and-partners/resources/Documents/CMOH-Measles-Memorandum-to-PHU_2025-03-07_Signed.pdf\">large gathering in New Brunswick</url> involving Mennonite communities.</p><p>Mexican and U.S. officials also say the genetic strains of measles spreading in Canada match the other large outbreaks.</p><p>\u201cThis virus was imported, traveling country to country,\u201d said Leticia Ru\u00edz, director of prevention and disease control in Chihuahua.</p><p>North and South American countries have struggled to maintain the 95% measles vaccination rate needed to prevent outbreaks, said Dr. Jarbas Barbosa, director of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.paho.org/en\">Pan American Health Organization</url>. And a recent <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON565\">World Health Organization</url> report said measles activity in the Americas region is up elevenfold from the same time last year and that the risk level is \u201chigh\u201d compared to the rest of the world's \u201cmoderate\u201d level.</p><p>Measles cases have been confirmed in six of the region\u2019s countries \u2014 Argentina, Belize, Brazil, Canada, the United States and Mexico \u2014 and investigating the disease's spread is labor-intensive and pricey. The response to each measles case in the U.S. costs an estimated $30,000 to $50,000, according to Dr. David Sugerman, a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientist.</p><h>Measles at the U.S.-Mexico border</h><p>The cases in Ciudad Juarez have no direct connection to the Mennonite settlement in Chihuahua, said Rogelio Covarrubias, a health official in the border city. The first measles case in El Paso was in a child at Fort Bliss, Ocaranza said.</p><p>More than half of El Paso's cases are in adults, which is unusually high, and three people have been hospitalized. The health department is holding vaccination clinics in malls and parks and says hundreds have gotten a shot. The vaccines are free \u2014 no questions asked, no matter which side of the border you live on.</p><p>Communication about measles between the two health departments is \u201cinformal\u201d but \u201cvery good,\u201d Ocaranza said. Covarrubias said his team was alerted last week to a case of someone who became sick in El Paso and returned home to Juarez.</p><p>\u201cThere is constant concern in Ciudad Juarez \\u2026 because we have travelers that pass through from across the world,\u201d Covarrubias said. \u201cWith a possible case of measles without taking precautions, many, many people could be infected.\u201d</p><h>Measles at the U.S.-Canada border</h><p>Michigan health officials said the outbreak of four cases in Montcalm County are linked to Ontario.</p><p>The state's chief medical executive, Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, expects to see more cases. Michigan has a 95% vaccination rate for measles, mumps and rubella, but it hides weak spots \u2014 counties with 70% vaccination rates and individual schools where just 30% of kids vaccinated.</p><p>\u201cIf we think about measles as a forest fire, we've got these burning embers that are floating in the air right now,\" Bagdasarian said. \"Whether those embers result in another wildfire just depends on where they land.\u201d</p><p>In Canada, six out of 10 provinces have reported measles cases. Alberta has the second-most with 83 as of April 12, <url normalizedValue=\"https://health-infobase.canada.ca/measles-rubella/\">according to government data.</url></p><p>Case counts in Ontario reached 1,020 as of Wednesday, mostly in the southwest part that borders Michigan.

According to news reporting originating from Nanjing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Forest fires not only cause severe damage to ecosystems and biodiversity but also directly threaten the safety of human societies. Given the significant increase in both the frequency and intensity of forest fires worldwide, especially under extreme climate conditions, efficient fire detection and initial attack (IA) are particularly critical.\" </p><p><br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Nanjing Forestry University: \"The initial attack is a key stage in forest fire control, and the time taken for fire detection is a crucial factor influencing the success of the initial attack. In response to the challenges of forest fire prevention and control, this study explores Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) cruising strategies, aiming to develop appropriate approaches based on regional characteristics and provide efficient periodic monitoring solutions for areas with high ecological value and challenging accessibility. By optimizing UAV patrol routes, this research seeks to maximize coverage in areas with lower initial attack success rates and significantly reduce fire detection time, thereby improving detection efficiency. We developed and applied four optimization strategies, random search, high-risk first (HRF), nearest high-risk first (NHRF), and a genetic algorithm-based (GA-based) strategy, to compare different UAV flight routes. To evaluate the deployment effectiveness of the four UAV cruise strategies, we introduced two evaluation metrics: Average Grid Risk (AGR) and Average Distance Risk (ADR). Experimental results showed that the NHRF and GA-based strategies performed better. Specifically, NHRF achieved the highest high-risk coverage, ranging from 51.5% to 71.3%, significantly outperforming the random search strategy (4-7%) and the HRF strategy (23.1-37.5%).\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The GA-based algorithm achieved the highest grid coverage, ranging from 30% to 59.8%, far surpassing the random search strategy (4-6.6%) and the HRF strategy (10.2-19.1%). Additionally, the NHRF and GA-based strategies delivered the best AGR and ADR performance, respectively. The application of these innovative strategies and evaluation metrics enhances forest fire prevention through periodic monitoring and supports more efficient firefighting efforts.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: UAV Cruise Strategies Based on Initial Attack.

According to news originating from Paterna, Spain, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"The objective of this article is to create soil burn severity maps to serve as field support for erosion tasks after forest fire occurrence in Spain (2017-2022).\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Epyris Interreg Sudoe. <br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from University of Valencia: \"The Analytical Spectral Device (ASD) FieldSpec and the CIMEL CE-312 radiometers (optical and thermal, respectively) were used as input data to establish relationships between soil burn severity and reflectance or emissivity, respectively. Spectral indices related to popular forest fire studies and soil assessment were calculated by Sentinel-2 convolved reflectance. All the spectral indices that achieve the separability index algorithm (SI) were validated using specificity, sensitivity, accuracy (ACC), balanced accuracy (BACC), F1-score (F1), and Cohen's kappa index (k), with 503 field plots. The results displayed the highest overall accuracy results using the Iron Oxide ratio (IOR) index: ACC = 0.71, BACC = 0.76, F1 = 0.63 and k = 0.50, respectively. In addition, IOR was the only spectral index with an acceptable k value (k = 0.50).\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"It is demonstrated that, together with NIR and SWIR spectral bands, the use of blue spectral band reduces atmospheric interferences and improves the accuracy of soil burn severity mapping. The maps obtained in this study could be highly valuable to forest agents for soil erosion restoration tasks.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Soil Burn Severity Assessment Using Sentinel-2 and Radiometric Measurements.

According to news reporting from Pune, India, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"In the present research, the open-source WRF-SFIRE model has been used to carry out surface forest fire spread forecasting in the North Sikkim region of the IndianHimalayas. Global forecast system (GFS)-based hourly forecasted weather model data obtained through the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) at 0.25 degree resolution were used to provide the initial conditions for running WRF-SFIRE.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include R&amp;D of It Group, Itea Division, Ministry of Electronics And Information Technology, Govt. of India-vide. <br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC): \"A landuse-landcover map at 1:10,000 scale was used to define fuel parameters for different vegetation types. The fuel parameters, i.e., fuel depth and fuel load, were collected from 23 sample plots (0.1 ha each) laid down in the study area. Samples of different categories of forest fuels were measured for their wet and dry weights to obtain the fuel load. The vegetation specific surface area-to-volume ratio was referenced from the literature. The atmospheric data were downscaled using nested domains in the WRF model to capture fire-atmosphere interactions at a finer resolution (40 m). VIIRS satellite sensor-based fire alert (375 m spatial resolution) was used as ignition initiation point for the fire spread forecasting, whereas the forecasted hourly weather data (time synchronized with the fire alert) were used for dynamic forest-fire spread forecasting. The forecasted burnt area (1.72 km<sup>2</sup>) was validated against the satellite-based burnt area (1.07 km<sup>2</sup>) obtained through Sentinel 2 satellite data.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The shapes of the original and forecasted burnt areas matched well. Based on the various simulation studies conducted, an operational fire spread forecasting system, i.e., Sikkim Wildfire Forecasting and Monitoring System (SWFMS), has been developed to facilitate firefighting agencies to issue early warnings and carry out strategic firefighting.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Operational Forest-Fire Spread Forecasting Using the WRF-SFIRE Model.

Current methods often suffer from limitations in scalability, privacy, and real-time data integration, particularly in large-scale disaster scenarios. This study introduces the mTCN-FChain framework, a novel solution that combines Massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC) and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) with federated learning and blockchain technology. The objective is to develop a scalable, secure, and efficient system for real-time disaster prediction using IoT data streams. Lightweight edge-based TCNs enable localized anomaly detection, while federated learning ensures privacy-preserving collaborative model training across edge devices. Blockchain integration secures model updates and provides traceability. Using datasets for earthquakes, floods, and tsunamis, the framework was implemented in Python and validated using metrics such as MAE, MSE, and RMSE. The results show significant performance improvements over existing methods, with higher accuracy, reduced latency, and robust scalability in disaster prediction tasks. Tools like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Hyperledger Fabric were employed for implementation. The study concludes that mTCN-FChain offers a transformative approach to disaster resilience, though future work will focus on optimizing blockchain integration and expanding real-world applicability to enhance its robustness and adaptability.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>Natural disasters, especially tsunamis, floods, and earthquakes, are perhaps the most disastrous phenomena that impact human populations, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Preparedness and prompt intervention are paramount importance in reducing damage and loss of human life. Conventional disaster prediction systems, mostly based on history and fixed sensor networks1,2. The problem occurs in the disasters themselves, mainly because of variability and dynamic involvement in their causing factors. Therefore, a diverse array of interactions such as rain conditions, seismic oscillations, ocean behavior, commences. Also, the scale of the data is considerably huge to successfully predict disasters-especially considering deployment of more environmental sensors worldwide lately. The potential for using real-time data from these sensors, in combination with the most advanced machine learning techniques, increases with the development of technology3,4. Data processing and analysis in real time, with a guarantee of privacy and security, are therefore of utmost importance. This makes integrating technologies such as IoT, AI, and decentralized learning frameworks promising avenues for revolutionizing disaster prediction systems and response strategies.</p><p>The existing disaster forecasting models have also evolved from statistical techniques to complex machine learning methods and deep learning. Classical approaches to regression models or time-series models are limited and cannot capture dynamic, non-linear data associated with disasters. There are more machine learning algorithms related to ANNs, SVMs, and RFs applied lately for the disaster prediction5, 6\u20137. While these methods are promising, they often present problems like overfitting, scalability, and dependency on large, centralized datasets. Deep learning techniques, CNNs, and RNNs have been used to solve many of the above issues with a better accuracy and robustness for the task. However, these models still present problems with regards to data privacy issues, high computationally demanding steps and demands for large datasets8, 9\u201310. Furthermore, centralized models often require significant data transmission, which can be slow and inefficient, especially in areas with limited connectivity. Federated learning has been suggested as a way to overcome the problem of data privacy, but existing models are still not robust enough to deal with multi-modal time-series data from various disaster types simultaneously.</p><p>To overcome the limitations of existing techniques, the innovative framework proposed in this study is mTCN-FChain which integrates mMTC with TCNs in a federated learning setting. This is capable of handling large scale, multi-modal time-series data from the tsunami, flood, and earthquake datasets in real-time. By taking advantage of the edge devices to process data locally, the model reduces the number of data transmission, thereby achieving efficient bandwidth use and preserving the data privacy. Light TCNs deployed at the nodes of the network enable real-time anomaly detection and disaster prediction without relying on a centralized server. Federated learning allows training the local models at the site by sharing only model updates and ensures data privacy while enhancing the model\u2019s predictability. Furthermore, the use of blockchain technology will ensure that the updates of models are secure, traceable, and accountable to prevent tampering and verify the authenticity of the shared information. The decentralized approach not only improves the efficiency of the system but also promotes the robustness and adaptability of disaster prediction models for timely response to a disaster and continuous learning from local predictions. The model proposed overcomes the challenges of above-mentioned approaches by innovating a scalable, secure, and efficient solution toward disaster prediction using cutting-edge technology to provide prompt and accurate disaster predictions in high-risk areas.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Research motivation</emphasis></p><p>Natural disasters, including earthquakes, floods, and tsunamis, result in devastating damage to human lives, infrastructure, and ecosystems. The existing prediction systems cannot handle the dynamic, nonlinear data from real-time, large-scale sources efficiently. Motivated by the need to enhance disaster preparedness and reduce damage, this study is aimed at developing a scalable and secure disaster prediction framework using leading-edge technologies to ensure accurate predictions and proactive interventions in high-risk areas.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Significance of study</emphasis></p><p>The proposed mTCN-FChain framework integrates some of the state-of-the-art technologies, namely mMTC, TCNs, federated learning, and blockchain, to alleviate critical challenges involved in disaster prediction. This study is significant since it can handle real-time time-series data from the IoT sensors to predict disasters accurately and efficiently. Combining scalable machine learning methods with decentralized and privacy-preserving techniques, the framework provides a reliable prediction system for disasters, such as tsunamis, floods, and earthquakes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Problem statement</emphasis></p><p>Most disaster prediction studies remain limited by issues of computational efficiency, scalability, and real-time data integration. A study11 mentioned that their model for disaster prediction is not very efficient at the large scale; it is needed to improve its computational efficiency. Another study12 point out that the limitations of flood management models in regions with unreliable data could be mitigated by introducing real-time, data-driven systems. Similarly13 discuss the challenges involved in the fusion of real-time data for disaster prediction, which needs to be done in a much better way for the integration of multiple data sources. The proposed method overcomes the limitation by incorporating Massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC) along with TCN, federated learning, and blockchain-based mechanisms that lead to scalable, efficient, and real-time disaster prediction while allowing the model\u2019s applicability to large-scale disaster scenarios in real life.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Recent inventions and challenges</emphasis></p><p>Recent developments in the form of AI-driven disaster resilience models, federated learning for privacy-preserving disaster prediction, and blockchain-based secure data aggregation have revolutionized disaster management systems. Yet these approaches also raise challenges in computational inefficiency, the necessity for robust multi-modal data integration, and the ability to scale well in different types of disasters.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Key contributions of the study</emphasis></p><p>Innovative framework Design: mTCN-FChain framework that combines federated learning and blockchain with TCNs and mMTC to achieve secure, scalable, and real-time-based disaster prediction.</p><p>Privacy-preserving collaborative learning: Propose federated learning for decentralized model training, thereby keeping privacy and data on sensitive raw material while enabling edge devices to collaboratively enhance disaster prediction models without sharing their sensitive raw data.</p><p>The study utilized blockchain technology to improve the security and traceability of model updates while proving the authenticity of updates in a federated learning environment.</p><p>The study exhibited better accuracy, reduced latency, and scalability than other methods and was validated using multi-modal datasets, including earthquakes, floods, and tsunamis, with metrics such as MAE, MSE, and RMSE, demonstrating strong real-time disaster prediction capabilities.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rest of section of the study</emphasis></p><p>Section 2: Review of existing models in disaster prediction, federated learning, blockchain, and IoT systems.</p><p>Section 3: Explanation of the mTCN-FChain framework using TCNs, federated learning, and blockchain.</p><p>Section 4: Performance evaluation of the framework with a discussion on strengths and challenges.</p><p>Section 5: Summary of contributions, challenges, and future research directions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related works</emphasis></p><p>A recent study11 proposed a disaster prediction knowledge graph utilizing remote sensing data, geographic information, and knowledge from specialist experts for disaster research. The method constructs a semantic ontology of disasters and operates in a single unambiguous space-time. Applying the proposed model for disaster prediction, studies on forest fires and geological landslides establish the efficiency of the proposed model in acquiring multi-source spatio-temporal information from experiments and case studies. However, the study does not consider the computational efficiency or scalability of the paradigm when extended to larger scale disaster situations. Another approach12 presented a target-specific real-time Decision Support System (DSS) for flood disaster management for Iran that considers its various climates. This paper applied the principal component analysis via KMeans Clustering, Nearest Neighbours Classification, Gaussian process Classifier and Neural Network and proved a positive correlation (mean <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">r</emphasis> = 0.7) between rainfall and flood disasters. Thirdly, the TOPSIS method also classified flood prevention strategies according to social, environmental and economic criterion. The model used confirmed precipitation data and estimates; however, it is only feasible where credible data is available, particularly in the third world. Additionally, a study14 developed an artificial neural network to predict of landslide risk for open-pit mine dumps. The study used geo studio software (GeoStudio 2012 8.15.6.13446, <url normalizedValue=\"https://geostudio-2012.software.informer.com/8.0/)15\">https://geostudio-2012.software.informer.com/8.0/)15</url> to evaluate the slope factors of safety under different rainfall intensity levels where the accuracy gains by GBRT was established to be at its highest (for instance FOS = 1.283 under q = 87 mm/day). Consequently, the results reveal that the proposed model is appropriate for early landslide risk warning. However, the research mainly bases its analysis on rainfall only and does not take into account other geographical or human structures.</p><p>Communications are critical in disaster-stricken areas where conventional modes of communication may not be functional, and for this reason, a user-centric communication model have been developed in this study16. The approach forms ad hoc cluster to connect end-users to the core network, for and aims to maximize through put in accordance with convex optimization. An example of a disaster-sensitive scheme that uses social media data to categorize regions such flooded areas is a machine learning scheme. As the results showed that, clustering and classification could effectively help restore the connection; however, the extensiveness of the model, when applied in large-scale real-world disasters, and real-time data was not tested. The multi-sensor information fusion algorithm for natural disaster protection was presented in this study13 the system improves the accuracy of distinct predictions and the level of tolerance to faults made during the process by combining Kalman joint filters, DS evidence theory, BP neural networks, as well as support vector machines. The application of the developed comprehensive diagnosis model pointed out the increased prediction accuracy of the working results, the integration of the results of several models, and a real-time decision and management approach. The results obtained from the simulation included better classification accuracy of disasters. But the authors did not look super closely at realistic issues surrounding the fusion of real-time data, which could be a problem for the real application in different types of disasters. Based on hydraulic theory and the machine learning method, the classification-based real-time flood prediction model was presented in this study17 utilizes flood database from EPA-SWMM and a two-dimensional inundation model; data categorization is done using the Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) method, coupled with a Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) classifier for felicitous flood range analysis. The model gives real time flood mapping through converting predicted cumulative volumes into grid areas with a fitting of 85% goodness-of-fit and with a runtime of 1 min 12 s. It also improves the efficiency of flood prediction on a hybrid conceptual platform that can be applied in assessing loss mitigation and operational disaster risk management. However, additional data exploring model scalability for various flood cases and types might improve the model\u2019s applicability in practice.</p><p>A study18 focus on the application of the machine learning approach for improving the flood forecasting system. This study emphasizes the use of AI and machine learning to forecast floods especially for nonlinear problems and to ease the computational effort of diffident hydrologic and hydraulic models. The work considers the applicability of machine learning techniques including Support Vector Machines SVM and fine tree classifiers for flood identification while developing a machine learning model for SIFT extracting. But this increases accuracy and at the same time reduces computation costs The use of real time data input could additionally enhance predictive abilities for disaster response. Another study19 explored the mapping of the drought forecast in the Free State Province of South Africa to analyze and forecast the dried-up patterns in arid zones by prompting machine-learning. The study shows that AI and ML are valuable tools for mapping the dry areas; nevertheless, more detailed studies on climatic and anthropogenic characteristics of sub-Saharan Africa may extend the reliability of the drought models. The ML-based model for farmland waterlogging prediction was recently proposed, which includes weather data forecasts and main predictors like rainfall and node water levels.</p><p>A study20 integrates several categories of machine learning models such as Random Forest and Multilayer Perceptron in order to forecast the occurrence of the result of disasters and economic losses from waterlogging. The outcome demonstrated that the established model was useful in predicting disaster losses and important deviations in yields were noticed to occur in different rainfall situations. But it could be more effective if geographic and temporal data were more specific in order to make locality estimates. Another study21 explored the role of AI in enhancing disaster resilience, particularly in response to emergencies, crises, acute diseases and disasters (ECDs) including the COVID-19, natural calamities and cyber threats.

This methodology models sequential data from diverse sources, including earthquake, tsunami, and flood datasets, with TCN. Federated learning allows decentralized training across edge devices while preserving data privacy and enabling collaborative learning. The process is made secure through model updates encryption and authenticity verification by digital signatures along with an immutable ledger for traceability and accountability purposes. The proposed framework also embeds WNLs for data transmission and processing. The aggregate global model that validated on the level of blockchain would be deployed onto edge devices then conduct real-time disaster prediction based on greater precision. This encompassing methodology supports secure, scaled, and privacies-preserving disaster monitoring with prediction for hazardous regions.</p><p>Fig. 1</p><p>Workflow of proposed method mTCN-FChain.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Data collection</emphasis></p><p>This study uses real-time data from the IoT sensors; three datasets were used to make predictions. Earthquake Dataset spans from 2001 to 2023 which provides a magnitude and location for forecasting purposes. Flood Dataset comprises 50,000 records with details of the parameters from the hydrological and meteorological sensors. These parameters will be analyzed in predicting flood risk. The Tsunami Events Dataset, which contains more than 2000 records, collects wave height and source event data from oceanographic sensors and together supports accurate and real-time disaster prediction models.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Earthquake dataset</emphasis></p><p>The earthquake dataset22 comprises 782 cases and seismic events from January 1, 2001, to January 1, 2023; earthquakes\u2019 attributes include the magnitude, date, time, latitude, longitude, depth, and CDI, MMI, and SIG indicators. Event risk categorization is done based on its alert levels (\u201cgreen,\u201d \u201cyellow,\u201d \u201corange,\u201d \u201cred\u201d) while a tsunami flag indicates ocean events. Other parameters like NST, GAP, MAGTYPE also help in making a result more reliable and geographical information gives more background information. Due to its highly featured and real-time nature, this dataset is used in the study for pattern recognition and earthquake prediction using TCNs and for localized training in federated learning.

These pre-processing steps help to check the quality and completeness of the data fed into the system. They are specifically required when training the TCNs. The workflow of data pre-processing in shown in Fig. 2.</p><p>Fig. 2</p><p>Workflow of data pre-processing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Normalization</emphasis></p><p>Normalization (or standardization) is a technique applied to scale numerical data into a constant range, hence making it easier for machine learning models to learn and perform well. Normalization usually scales the data to a [0, 1] range, while standardization transforms the data so that it has mean 0 and a standard deviation of 125. When features such as magnitude due to an earthquake, flood probability, and tsunami impact have varying numerical ranges, the appropriate application of this technique is important in TCNs. For instance, the magnitude of an earthquake can be between 1 and 9, while the probability of a flood is between 0 and 100. This would make the model place greater emphasis on the probability of a flood since it is the larger scale. Standardization is done using the following Eq. (1).1 where  is the original value,  is the mean of the feature, and  is the standard deviation of the feature. This process makes it possible for all features to get into a similar scale which makes the model more efficient and not to be biased toward large-value features.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Missing value imputation by mean imputation</emphasis></p><p>Missing values in a dataset may result in incorrect predictions or incomplete models. Mean imputation is one of the most common techniques for dealing with missing data, where missing values are replaced by the mean of the observed values in the feature26. This is quite valuable in the case of numerical features such as the probability of a flood or the magnitude of a tsunami, where the data may be missing due to reporting errors or other reasons. Mean imputation is simple and helps retain the overall distribution of the data. The formula for mean imputation is given in Eq. (2).2 where,  is the value used to replace the missing data,  is the sum of all the data points that are not missing; n is the number of data points that are not missing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wireless-aware neural layer (WNLs)</emphasis></p><p>WNLs are layers that improve wireless data transmission by using neural network models to dynamically adapt to network conditions such as signal strength, bandwidth, and congestion. In this work, WNLs are applied after data collection, optimizing the transmission process before the data reaches edge nodes. WNLs reduce packet loss through error-correcting codes and adaptive retransmission mechanisms, ensuring data integrity even in noisy environments. They minimize latency through dynamic transmission rates and critical data prioritization in order to prevent network congestion. Intelligent routing is implemented so that WNLs predict optimal paths and make selections based on real-time network metrics for robust data delivery. Once data reaches the edge nodes, it is subjected to lightweight preprocessing and initial analysis using the Lightweight TCN. The working of WNLs is given in Fig. 3.</p><p>Fig. 3</p><p>Workflow of WNLs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Temporal convolutional networks (TCNs)</emphasis></p><p>Lightweight TCNs mechanism is intended to efficiently process time-series data, especially in resource-constrained environments like those with limited computational resources and network bandwidth27. Lightweight TCNs have several layers with unique contributions toward the overall functionality of the model. This section expands on the role of each layer, with special emphasis on how they work together to process time-series data for real-time disaster prediction. The architecture of TCN is shown in Fig. 4. The Input Layer is the first contact point with the model. The time-series data is received and usually pre-processed by WNLs. It plays a critical role in this step as they optimize the data transmission from the IoT devices to the edge nodes by reducing noise and only transmitting relevant information. This pre-processing step improves the quality of the input data, which is very important for proper predictions. The convolutional layers are the core component of TCNs, and they are designed to extract features from the input time-series data.</p><p>First layer: This layer uses causal convolutions, with specified kernel size. The causal convolutions do ensure that the predictions produced for time  depend only on inputs up to previous time steps while keeping their temporal order necessary for predictions. Mathematically this can be expressed as Eq. (3).</p><p>3 where  is the output at time ,  are the weights of the convolution kernel, and  represents the input sequence.</p><p>Fig. 4</p><p>Architecture of TCN.</p><p>Dilated convolutional layers: Following layers apply dilated convolutions with increasing dilation rates. Dilation allows the network to expand its receptive field without significantly increasing the number of parameters. For example, setting dilation rates  each layer processes inputs with different receptive fields given in Eq. (4).</p><p>4</p><p>This way, it can understand dependencies across longer time spans effectively without losing computational efficiency. After feature extraction, TCN computes an anomaly score to determine whether the current observation significantly deviates from the expected behavior. The TCN utilizes a 96-hour receptive field, which is intended to capture long temporal dependencies typical of disaster events such as slow pressure declines ahead of a flood or seismic precursors in earthquakes, which improve early prediction capabilities and false alarm rates.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Localized anomaly detection</emphasis></p><p>Edge-based TCNs can perform local anomaly detection, where it able to identify any irregular behavior or pattern within time-series data coming from a sensor or other IoT device. It processes the incoming streams of data and looks for patterns that may hint at a possible disaster, it can be a temperature rise, uncharacteristic seismic activity, or unusual levels of rainfall. This model uses causal convolutions in order to have predictions based on past data therefore, maintains the necessary temporal integrity required to be correct for any kind of prediction. Mathematical representation of an anomaly score can be computed as Eq. (5).5</p><p>Here, \u200b is the predicted value from the TCN model, and is the actual observed value. If this score exceeds a predefined threshold , an alert can be triggered for further investigation. For every convolutional layer, the non-linear activation functions such as ReLU are applied. Such functions allow a model to introduce non-linearity and therefore capture complex patterns from the data. The definition of the ReLU function can be given by Eq. (6).6</p><p>This non-linearity is crucial for enabling TCNs to model intricate relationships within time-series data. Residual Blocks are introduced after some of the convolutional layers to further improve learning within deeper networks. The residual block of TCN is shown in Fig. 5.</p><p>Fig. 5</p><p>Residual block of TCN.</p><p>A residual block adds outputs of convolutional layers with their corresponding inputs which is given in Eq. (7).7 where,  is the output of a set of convolution operations applied to the input . This design helps reduce problems of vanishing gradients, hence training better and deeper networks without performance degradation. The Output Layer generates predictions given the features which have been passed through previous layers. For a disaster prediction problem, this output is the probabilities of certain events (such as floods or earthquakes) happening in a given timeframe. The output can be written as Eq. (8).8 where  are the weights learned during training,  represents the output from the last hidden layer, and  denotes a bias term.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Federated learning workflow for disaster prediction</emphasis></p><p>In this study, Federated Learning (FL) is applied to develop a disaster prediction model using multiple edge devices with different disaster datasets, for instance, handling tsunami, flood, and earthquake disasters. This will ensure the development of a robust global model, capable of making predictions of all types of disaster, and thus ensuring scalability, preservation of privacy, and adaptability in different disaster scenarios.</p><p>Local mTCN models: Each edge node trains a lightweight TCN, mTCN is trained on its assigned disaster dataset. This localized scheme allows each of the models to specialize in disaster type, meaning it can then better predict under certain conditions in an earthquake event, flood or tsunami. Due to the naturally non-IID nature of data associated with disasters between nodes (i.e., coastal nodes handling tsunami data versus inland nodes handling flood data), the challenges related to model convergence can be addressed through normalization of data sets, as well as balancing the weights that are aggregated during model fusion. This type of heterogeneity is part of the real-life deployment, as well as a key aspect when creating a robust and generalized global model. Local models perform short-term trend analysis to detect immediate disaster signals like seismic or flood indicators, enabling timely alerts. They also capture long-term patterns such as seasonal or oceanographic trends to improve disaster forecasting and preparedness.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Federated learning workflow</emphasis></p><p>Federated learning is used to enable the models on edge devices to collaboratively train a global model in a distributed manner without transferring sensitive local data. The core components of the federated learning are as follows. Each edge node trains its local mTCN model using solely the data stored locally28. The training is done by focusing on disaster-specific features, which enables the model to learn from the local data without being required to access other nodes\u2019 data. Unlike simple raw data communication, the devices communicate model updates such as weights or gradients back to the central server. Such an approach assures privacy since any sensitive information from the edge does not leave; instead, model parameters are the only information transmitted and shared in a collaborative framework among devices for collaboration. Thereby, throughout the federated learning process, privacy of disaster data is maintained. Only model updates would be communicated as not to mention the exact details of the whereabouts of disasters, or socio-economic factors. Partial participation is allowed each communication round to realistically simulate the real-world deployment conditions. To simulate devices that fail, lose connectivity for a period of time, or just are unavailable temporarily, an average of 60\u201380% of the nodes are expected to provide updates each round. This helps improve the resiliency and scalability of the system in a dynamic or unpredictable environment. The framework of federated learning is shown in Fig. 6.</p><p>Fig. 6</p><p>Workflow of federated learning.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Global model aggregation</emphasis></p><p>Finally, after training the local models, the edge models need to aggregate those models towards forming a single global model, which is typically performed by the central server. The workflow of model aggregation is shown in Fig. 7.</p><p>Federated aggregation: The global server aggregates the model updates that come from each edge node by using a process called Federated Averaging, or FedAvg. It combines the model parameters (weights or gradients) coming from each of the edge nodes into a single unified model. This process can be represented mathematically as Eq. (9).</p><p>9 where,  denotes the aggregated global weight,  represents the weight from the  local model,  indicate the number of edge nodes. Because of non-synchronous device performance, straggler nodes - nodes that do not respond within a 30-s window, will not be included in the current round to prevent bottlenecks during training. Additionally, in order to reduce communication and synchronization overhead due to frequent updates being transmitted, model updates have been quantized, and devices are allowed to communicate every 5 local epoch instead of after each epoch. This reduces the bandwidth usage and increases the usable resource lifetime of edge devices, which is crucial in disaster-prone scenarios when deployed to the real world.</p><p>Fig. 7</p><p>Model aggregation.</p><p>The aggregated model incorporates the knowledge learned from each disaster-specific dataset, making it robust across multiple disaster types. This enables the model now to predict broader sets of information, thus upgrading its ability toward predicting different forms of disasters and catastrophes, such as earthquakes, floods, and tsunamis.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Blockchain integration in federated learning for disaster prediction: working mechanism</emphasis></p><p>The blockchain component of the mTCN-FChain framework is fundamental to securing federated learning operations by providing encrypted update transmission, tamper-proof validations, traceability, and resilient fault tolerance. For securing model updates sent from edge nodes, symmetric encryption using the AES-256 algorithm is utilized. Each model update is encrypted individually, instead of encrypting all updates in a single batch, before being sent to the blockchain so that confidentiality can be ensured for any gradient or weight vector shared from the local mTCN models.</p><p>Let  be the model update vector of an edge node, with nnn being the number of learnable parameters. The encrypted version  is represented as Eq. (10).10 where  is the AES encryption function with a 256-bit key . The size of each update vector prior to encryption is between 320 KB and 512 KB based on the depth of the local mTCN model, whereas the encrypted output has an almost negligible overhead (~ 3\u20135%) attributed to AES block padding. The updates are pushed to the blockchain ledger every 5 local epochs, which coincides with the federated communication round interval to limit bandwidth consumption and power expenditure on resource-constrained edge devices.</p><p>Digital signatures are created with the ECDSA algorithm (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) using 256-bit keys. Let  be the digital signature of an update  created with the private key \u200b, given in Eq. (11).11 where  represents the SHA-256 hash of the model update. After getting to the central aggregator, the signature  is verified with the sender public key  to verify the source and integrity of the update. If the verification does not pass, the update is rejected and set to audit status. All verified updates are tracked on a permissioned blockchain based on Hyperledger Fabric. The ledger has nearly 1000 TPS of transaction throughput and utilizes a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus with a ten second block time and one-megabyte block size limit. Each update stored includes a timestamp, node ID, update type (flood, earthquake, and tsunami) and cryptographic metadata. This immutable log provides complete traceability of contributions and allows for forensic analysis in real-time.</p><p>The framework is resistant to various types of attacks, e.g. tampering, model poisoning and spoofing. Hashed updates are automatically rejected at verification stage through hash mismatch. Attackers found to frequently fail in validating their gradients across rounds are blacklisted such that each malicious node trying to inject adversarial gradients is temporarily blocked from participating in the aggregation. In case of node compromise, the system can simply reinitialize the local model with the most recent global model and re-verify through a quorum of trusted validators before being allowed back into the network. This design guarantees the data Privacy, provenance and system robustness with reduced communication overhead. Security and integrity of disaster prediction as maintained within the federated environment are jointly secured by encryptions, digital signatures, as well as integrity backed by ledgers, coupled with traceability. The technical design of the system has been abided by most recent developments of safe federated learning29, making it accurate in case of high-risk real-time conditions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Deployment and feedback</emphasis></p><p>An updated model of global mTCN is deployed along with a feedback mechanism to effectively deploy real-time predictions of a disaster. The workflow of deployment and feedback is shown in Fig. 8.</p><p>Fig. 8</p><p>Flowchart of deployment and feedback.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Model deployment</emphasis></p><p>Once the global mTCN model is updated through aggregation of the local model parameters, it gets deployed on all participating edge nodes. This enables every node to receive the most recent and updated version of the model for a real-time accurate prediction in a disaster situation. Disasters such as floods or earthquakes can be evaluated according to the latest known information. This allows the system to adapt to changing conditions and growing data sources.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Feedback loop</emphasis></p><p>The feedback loop is critical for the continuous improvement and adaptability of the disaster prediction system. It has two main components:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Continuous learning</emphasis></p><p>Once the global model has been deployed, each edge node generates predictions from real-time data. These predictions are fed back into the system for analysis. Feedback from local predictions allows for an iterative refinement of the global model. Mathematically, this may be represented as following Eq. (12).12 where,  represents the change in model weights,  is the learning rate,  denotes the actual observed outcome, is the predicted outcome,  represents input features.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Adaptability</emphasis></p><p>The feedback loop thus ensures that the mTCN model evolves with time as the pattern of disasters change. For example, in the case of an emerging type of flood event or an increase in seismic activity within a region once stable, the model can evolve from new data input. More information from the constant monitoring and predicting processes will be used for further training, which can constantly adapt to newly emerging trends and anomalies. Overall, the dynamic framework should enhance disaster preparedness and response capabilities well. This dynamic framework enhances better outcomes under emergency situations.</p><p>Algorithm of mTCN-FChain for disaster prediction</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_5\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Input: Multi-modal disaster datasets (earthquake, flood, tsunami).</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Output: Global disaster prediction model with real-time deployment.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">1. datasets ? collect_datasets([?earthquake?, ?flood?, ?tsunami?])</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">2. preprocessed_data ? preprocess(datasets).</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">3. edge_nodes ? initialize_edge_nodes().</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">4. for each node in edge_nodes:</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">5. local_data ? get_data(node).</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">6. local_model[node] ? train_TCN(local_data).</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">7. for each node in local_model:</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">8. updates ? get_model_updates(local_model[node])</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">9. encrypted_update[node] ? encrypt(updates).</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">10. blockchain ? initialize_blockchain().</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">11. for each node in encrypted_update:</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">12. if verify_signature(encrypted_update[node], node.key)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">13. store_on_blockchain(encrypted_update[node], node.signature)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">14. validated_updates ? blockchain.get_validated_updates()</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">15. global_model ? aggregate_updates(validated_updates)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">16. for each node in edge_nodes</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">17. distribute_model(global_model, node)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">18. for each node in edge_nodes</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">19. predictions[node] ? predict(global_model, node.test_data)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">20. repeat process with new data for continual learning</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Fig. 9</p><p>Flowchart of proposed method mTCN-FChain.</p><p>The mTCN-FChain framework is a novel framework that brings together Temporal Convolutional Networks, Federated Learning, and blockchain technology to enable disaster prediction in a secure, decentralized, and privacy-preserving manner.

The x-axis represents magnitude values, and the y-axis represents occurrence counts. It can be inferred that the most frequent value in the dataset is about a magnitude of 7 because of the peak around this point. The smooth density curve, which closely follows the histogram, reveals a roughly normal distribution with a slight right skew. It depicts the frequency and distribution of magnitudes of tsunami. The findings thus indicate a common range for the magnitudes of tsunamis, with implications on enhancing the predictability of the tsunami models.</p><p>Fig. 11</p><p>Tsunami distribution.</p><p>Figure 11 compares the frequency of two categories: 0 (no tsunami) and 1 (tsunami present). The larger bar for category 0, which just clears 450, demonstrates that events with no tsunami are more frequent. The smaller bar for category 1, which tops out at around 300, demonstrates tsunami events are much less common. It also shows that compared to its opposite, the tsunamis are less frequent events. The results emphasize the need to target rare events such as tsunamis with more effort in disaster forecasting models.</p><p>Fig. 12</p><p>Frequency distribution of earthquake magnitudes.</p><p>Figure 12 is the bar chart shows the count of events with various magnitudes ranging from 6.5 to 9.1. The maximum count is seen at a magnitude of 6.5, with an approximate count of 120, and it decreases with an increase in the magnitude. The color gradient from pink to purple indicates that there is a transition from smaller to larger magnitudes. This shows that lower magnitudes occur more frequently than higher magnitudes. The results highlight the significance of knowing magnitude distributions in better earthquake prediction and risk management in disaster scenarios.</p><p>Fig. 13</p><p>Flood probability distribution.</p><p>The histogram of flood probabilities shows the frequency distribution in Fig. 13. The x-axis is shown here as probabilities from 0.30 to 0.70, and the y-axis is frequency. The bell-shaped curve indicates a peak probability of about 0.50, which represents the most frequent event. This would mean that the flood events are most likely to occur at a probability near 0.50. The flood distribution provides important information related to risk assessment through identification of areas at susceptibility to floods and aiding flood prediction planning. It concludes that understanding probability distributions helps in enhancing disaster preparedness and mitigation.</p><p>Fig. 14</p><p>Impact of key factors on flood probability.</p><p>Figure 14 visualizes the influence of several numerical features on flood probability using a number of scatter plots.

The x-axis in each plot represents the feature value and the y-axis represents corresponding flood probability. The scatter patterns may indicate possible correlations or trends: for example, higher values of some features, such as \u201cUrbanization\u201d or \u201cDeforestation,\u201d might be related to increased flood probability. The plots together suggest a complex interplay of environmental, infrastructural, and socio-political factors in determining flood risks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Federated learning performance</emphasis></p><p>Fig. 15</p><p>MAE loss graph of federated learning.</p><p>Figure 15 compares the four models: Model 1, Model 2, Model 3, and the Federated Model in terms of the MAE across training epochs.

Generally, the lowest MAE is consistently recorded with the Federated Model, and other models are at the low end. This suggests that this framework at the developed mTCN-FChain, implemented with federated learning, will give better results. The results show the decrease in error rates with federated learning that increases the model\u2019s performance at the time of training.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Blockchain security metrics</emphasis></p><p>Table 9</p><p>Contributions from edge nodes.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_10\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"104\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"136\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"200\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"168\"/><thead><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">Edge node ID</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\">Dataset used</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\">Model contribution (%)</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\">Timestamp</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Node 1</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Tsunami data</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">30%</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">November 11, 2024</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Node 2</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Flood data</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">25%</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">November 11, 2024</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Node 3</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Earthquake data</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">45%</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">November 11, 2024</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Table 9 illustrates the contribution of edge nodes in the mTCN-FChain framework, which includes the dataset used and the percentage of model contribution from each node.

Thus, this scenario depicts the federated learning architecture, where the model is formed using many edge nodes without sharing any private data among nodes.

On the other hand, \u201cUnverified Updates\u201d are at a security level of around 10%. This clearly explains why encryption and verification are very important for model updates. Results indicated that the usage of unverified updates raises security risk, hence validating the use of secure update mechanisms in the disaster prediction model.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Disaster prediction results</emphasis></p><p>Fig. 18</p><p>Tsunami prediction model performance: observed vs. predicted wave height.</p><p>Figure 18 gives a comparison between the observed and predicted wave heights for the tsunami with the x-axis as the number of simulations runs and the y-axis as wave height.

Such factors generally increase together, whereas negative relationships, such as between \u201cTopographyDrainage\u201d and \u201cFloodProbability\u201d (\u2212 0.25), imply that an improved drainage will decrease the possibility of floods. The heatmap allows for the better understanding of complex environmental factors, and key interactions emerge. It shows the strongly related variables that can be found to make informed decisions on policy and planning. The study emphasizes deforestation, urbanization, and drainage system as targets in mitigating flood risks.</p><p>Fig. 23</p><p>Correlation heatmap of earthquake.</p><p>The \u201cCorrelation Heatmap\u201d in Fig. 23 has been depicted for the interrelations between variables concerning earthquakes, namely magnitude, depth, cdi, mmi, and sig.

Its capability to process multi-modal time-series data efficiently obtained from IoT sensors leads to precise and low-latency predictions even in resource-restricted environments. Edge-based TCNs, in combination with WNLs, ensures high predictive accuracy while minimizing the computational load on IoT devices. This makes the system suitable for deployment in remote or disaster-prone areas. Federated learning ensures data privacy by enabling decentralized training, and blockchain guarantees data security and traceability, which is critical in emergency situations. However, challenges are there to the framework. The computational overhead of federated learning and blockchain integration may also slow down the training and updating times, hindering real-time performance in some disaster scenarios. Real-world deployment may be affected by inconsistent sensor data, device failures, and environmental issues that may negatively impact data collection or prediction accuracy. These limitations underscore the need to optimize within system architecture and the mechanisms of handling data. Future work in this regard has to reduce the latency, compute efficiency of the framework, and make the framework robust for its large-scale deployments, which are likely to find different real-world conditions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conclusion and future work</emphasis></p><p>This framework, mTCN-FChain, is represents a significant advancement for the real-time disaster prediction field that leverages the collective power of IoT, AI, and blockchain technologies. The system utilizes TCNs together with federated learning and blockchain to provide the best prediction accuracy with scalability and robust data privacy and security. The proposed model results in better existing approaches in disaster prediction in terms of fewer error rates and faster updates, which makes it suitable for any practical application in disaster resilience. The framework is promising, although computational complexity and resource constraints make it unfeasible at the moment to achieve its functionality on a larger scale.</p><p>Future research will focus on optimizing key components of the system, particularly the blockchain architecture, to reduce latency and enhance computational efficiency. Including more types of disasters and real-time data sources can expand the framework, making it more usable in a variety of regions and scenarios. Real-world deployment will help determine its robustness to various regions and scenarios and also give insight into operational challenges and environmental factors. Instead, by integrating such sophisticated techniques as transfer learning and federated learning into the model, one can improve on its performance and scalability. These future improvements would open up paths for more effective, scalable, and reliable systems of disaster prediction that could lead to supporting a global level of disaster resilience.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><p>[1].Akhyar, A.

In these areas structures are threatened by both approaching flames and lofted embers which spread fire into and within communities. While independent factors influencing structure fire protection are well known, their combined effects remain largely unquantified, limiting the accuracy of risk assessments and mitigation strategies. Here, we examine five major historical WUI fires\u20142017 Tubbs, 2017 Thomas, 2018 Camp, 2019 Kincade, and 2020 Glass Fires\u2014utilizing machine learning (ML) analysis of on-the-ground post-fire data collection, remotely sensed data, and fire reconstruction modeling to assess patterns of structure loss and mitigation effectiveness. We show that the spacing between structures is a critical factor influencing fire risk, highlighting the importance of structure arrangement, while fire exposure, the ignition resistance (hardening) of structures, and clearing around structures (defensible space) work in combination to mediate fire risk. Utilizing an XGBoost classifier, structure survivability can be predicted to 82% accuracy. Results highlight the effectiveness of hardening and defensible space, with a hypothetical 52% reduction in losses. Our findings emphasize the need for community-level mitigation to reduce structure loss in future WUI fires.</p><p>Wildfire risk in California\u2019s WUI is rising. Analysis of past events shows home hardening and defensible space can reduce structure loss by up to 52%, but coordinated, community-scale action is essential to maximize impact.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>Globally, the frequency, severity, and size of wildland fires has been increasing, resulting in extreme events that have led to dramatic losses in terms of people, property and the environment1,2. A majority of these impacts on people occur where houses and other urban development intermingle with undeveloped wildland vegetation, an area termed the WUI. This area has grown dramatically in recent years3,4 with one-third of all new homes in the US built in the WUI5. The western United States has witnessed a 246% increase in structures lost to wildfires from 2010\u20132020 compared to the previous decade6. California, despite its long fire history, has experienced recent increases in the number of very large fires (over 100,000 ha) resulting in massive losses of lives and property7. Between 2013 and 2018, approximately 47,000 structures have been damaged or destroyed and 189 fatalities have been attributed to wildfires in California8. This increasing risk has consequences that jeopardize the economic stability, well-being of local residents, and the environment in affected communities9.</p><p>Central to preventing future destruction has been the development of mitigation measures aimed at reducing the likelihood of ignition and spread in the WUI10, 11, 12, 13\u201314. Improvements in building features and materials (hardening) and clearing surrounding vegetation and other flammable materials (defensible space) play important roles mitigating fire spread into the WUI15, 16, 17\u201318 but differ in their characteristics because structures and vegetation have different heat release rates, durations of burning, and responses to external exposure including direct flame contact, radiation, and firebrands19. For instance, Ondei et al.20 synthesize a zonation strategy for defensible space, focusing on removing dead vegetation within 1.5 meters of a house and managing fuel connectivity up to 30 meters. Similarly, studies like Carton et al.21 stress the importance of fire-resistant construction, vegetation management, and the need for specific wildfire codes, particularly addressing the unique needs of Indigenous communities and heritage properties in Canada. While effective mitigation strategies have been developed based on past testing and investigations22, their combined effectiveness under different exposure conditions is not yet known5.</p><p>Previous geospatial studies have demonstrated the critical influence of spatial arrangement and biophysical factors23, 24\u201325, with defensible space around structures playing a substantial, albeit secondary, role26,27. The role of building materials has also been examined, revealing mixed findings27, 28\u201329. For instance, Syphard and Keeley28 found structural features like enclosed eaves and vent screens were crucial, while others (Price et al., Metz et al., Knapp et al.)30, 31\u201332 identified factors such as spacing and arrangement as more important, suggesting determinants of loss are often beyond homeowners\u2019 control. A later study of the Woolsey Fire suggests that proximity to destroyed structures and building materials, such as multi-pane windows and enclosed eaves, are key factors in determining survival.27 Large structure loss datasets, such as those from the Camp fire, show that homes built before 1997 had markedly lower survival rates compared to those built after, underscoring the importance of construction standards32. The 2021 Marshall Fire also highlights the significance of neighborhood and parcel characteristics in housing survival, revealing the impact of jurisdictional differences in building codes and planning31. Collectively, these studies underscore that while defensible space is important, building features and surrounding vegetation, as well as proactive mitigation strategies, are critical to improving wildfire resilience.</p><p>Despite these advances, the majority of studies focus on single events, and lack a comprehensive quantitative analysis of how mitigation measures, such as home hardening and defensible space, interact and influence fire risk. In order to safeguard communities and stem the current trend of destruction, we must quantitatively understand how features influence fire risk to structures, particularly in relation to fire exposure, surrounding vegetation, the proximity of neighboring structures, and properties of the structures themselves. We hypothesize that the combined effects of structure hardening, defensible space, and structural separation can substantially reduce the risk of structure loss, with the most substantial benefits occurring when changes are made to both the structure itself and the surrounding vegetation. Furthermore, changes to individual structures may not be sufficient to reduce risk when structures are arranged at high density, requiring community-wide mitigation.</p><p>Here, we combine the largest existing structure loss database from California with simulated fire and ember exposure conditions to structures across multiple large-loss events, providing a methodology to quantify and compare the combined influence of exposure and mitigations such as defensible space and home hardening on fire risk. Unlike past studies, fire reconstruction modeling that includes urban fire spread is used to quantitatively estimate the effect of flame and ember exposure on structures. Geospatial assessments of vegetation surrounding structures are added using both LiDAR and visual imagery to assess the level of defensible space (vegetation) surrounding structures. The database is then fit using a multivariate analysis similar to refs. 27,31 that distinguishes between the interrelated effects of exposure, structure hardening, and defensible space. A parameter importance analysis reveals the strong role both structure separation and exposure play, distinguishing wildfire from other natural hazards that are not affected by neighboring conditions, highlighting the importance of a community approach to mitigation. The model developed is strongly predictive when incorporating all the above features and is also used to assess the impact of recommended mitigation measures on homes. It is found that it is most impactful to make changes both to the structure itself and surrounding fuels, especially vegetation and other flammable materials within 1.5 m (5 ft) of the structure (zone 0) to achieve the maximum benefit.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Results</emphasis></p><p>In this study we took advantage of the Damage INSpection (DINS) Dataset collected by on-the-ground CAL FIRE crews from structures damaged, destroyed, or affected by wildfires in California during post-fire investigations between 2013\u20132022 (California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE))33. Figure 1 shows all fires in the DINS dataset between 2017\u20132022 as well as five of the largest loss fires in this dataset (2017 Tubbs and Thomas, 2018 Camp, 2019 Kincade, and 2020 Glass fires) selected for further analysis based on data availability and the number of structures exposed and destroyed. We combined records of damage state and building features from this dataset with remotely-sensed assessment of surrounding vegetation (akin to defensible space) and structure footprints (to assess building separation) of undamaged, damaged, and destroyed structures within the final fire perimeter (CAL FIRE Historic Fire Perimeters), including a 91 m (300 ft) buffer around any burned areas34. Post-fire reconstruction modeling was then used to add local fire exposure by both flames (flame length) and embers (ember load) to the dataset resulting in a more complete picture of fire exposure and effects.Fig. 1</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Spatial distribution of damage to structures in California.</emphasis></p><p>CAL FIRE Damage Inspection (DINS) data (2017\u20132022; <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 87,156) overlaid on fire perimeter polygons (semi-transparent rose shading) for five of the most destructive WUI fires before the 2024\u20132025 Los Angeles area fires.

Map created using the Free and Open Source QGIS.</p><p>Data from 5 selected fires were extracted from the overall DINS dataset (~90,000 structures) by combining/stacking the five fire datasets after preprocessing. Additional structures that were unburned but exposed to fire were added to the dataset (Tubbs ~14,000, Thomas ~ 6000, Camp ~24,000, Kincade ~2000, and Glass ~5000 structures). We employed a resampling process to balance the samples, resulting in a total of approximately 47,000 structures and 45,947 unique data points. We simplified the damaged, non-damaged, and destroyed classifications in the original DINS to a binary classification of Survived and Damaged categories because &gt;90% of damaged structures are destroyed.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Post-fire reconstruction</emphasis></p><p>Five fires were reconstructed using a level-set model (ELMFIRE) that included both wildland35,36 and urban fire spread37 to re-create fire spread conditions and estimate critical missing exposure data (flame length and ember deposition) from these events. While reconstruction can never perfectly mirror on-the-ground conditions, these results provide reasonable estimates taking into account spatiotemporal variability in fuels, topography and weather. Figure 2 shows the modeled fires and resulting flame length (in meters) and ember load (in terms of number of embers deposited per meters squared). These are extracted adjacent to each of 47,000 structures in our dataset and distributions are shown in terms of flame and ember exposure as probability density functions (PDF) in Fig. 3. These distributions reveal a 27% and 39% overall decrease in exposure to flames and embers, respectively for structures that survived vs. those that were damaged. The decrease in exposure, however, is small in comparison to the difference in total number of structures destroyed and suggests that other features may play a role in determining which are more or less likely to survive.Fig. 2</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Simulation of fire spread and ember deposition for the 5 fires, overlaid with fire perimeters.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> Fire spread (shaded based on time of arrival) illustrates fire progression in each event, while <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis> ember deposition illustrates the large reach and stochastic nature of generated firebrands.

These distributions highlight the pronounced effect of simulated ember and flame exposures on the destruction of structures in large WUI fires.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Feature contribution to structure loss</emphasis></p><p>We applied an XGBoost38 Classifier to our dataset and then utilized a SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) model to explore the importance of various features on structure destruction. By looking at the stacked results from all 5 fires (Fig. 4), we found that structure density, which is determined by the distance between structures (SSD), is one of the most important features in structure destruction. The second most important contributor to the classification results from the XGBoost estimator was exterior siding, representative of the materials used in construction, followed by Year Built. Note, in the DINS database year built indicates the year that the primary structure in the parcel was constructed. Year built has therefore been identified as a confounding variable ultimately combining the effects from different parameters such as hardening (e.g., materials used for roof construction, eaves, vent screen, window pane, exterior siding), vegetation, and surrounding features (e.g., defensible space/vegetation separation distance and nearby structures/structure separation distance). Hence, considering Year Built as a single factor for determining vulnerability is inaccurate, and our results recommend adopting a holistic approach in such determinations. Results underscore the importance of hardening structures, structure density, and building arrangements in WUI areas to mitigate fire risk and potential destruction. These results are consistent with already-established engineering knowledge22,32,39. Furthermore, these insights are based on the available data rather than being drawn from direct experiments or detailed numerical simulations at the flame scale.Fig. 4</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHAP aggregation results characterizing the contribution of features for the entire (stacked) WUI data from five fires.</emphasis></p><p>Mean absolute SHAP values from an XGBoost classifier (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 47,742 structures) trained on merged WUI data from five fires. Bars show the average |SHAP| for each predictor, ranked by contributions: structure separation distance (SSD), exterior siding, year built, flame length, ember deposition, roof construction, vent screen, vegetation separation distance (VSD), window pane and eaves. Higher |SHAP| indicates greater contribution to the model\u2019s prediction of structure destruction. The vertical dotted line marks the clustering cutoff (0.5) used to identify redundant features. SSD is the single strongest driver of predicted loss, followed by exterior siding and year built.</p><p>Exposure was still important in predicting damage from past WUI fires, specifically considering flame length and ember load derived from fire spread simulations. Flame length, which indicates the height and intensity of flames, can directly influence the severity of damage to structures and vegetation in its path. Ember load, representing the number and size of burning embers carried by the wind, also substantially contributes to the spread of the fire and subsequent structure loss, as these embers can ignite spot fires far beyond the main fire front. The intensity and reach of flames, as well as the quantity of embers, played pivotal roles in the extent of damage and structure loss observed in these fires.</p><p>SHAP values provide a unified measure of feature importance in a predictive model. Based on the evaluation metrics, the XGBoost model emerged as the most effective estimator, demonstrating superior skill in predicting losses. This finding is supported by its higher average SHAP values for key features compared to other models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest. The average SHAP values for the XGBoost estimator revealed that certain features notably impacted the model\u2019s predictions. For instance, Structure Separation Distance (SSD) and flame length had positive average SHAP values of 0.090 and 0.051, respectively, underscoring the importance of building arrangements and fire behavior in risk assessment. Year Built showed an average SHAP value of \u22120.058, suggesting that newer structures might be associated with lower predicted losses, possibly due to improved building codes and materials.</p><p>We also broke down the feature importance results for each of the 5 individual fires assessed (Fig. 5), and found common features of importance: SSD, flame length, and year built, but distinct differences were also revealed between individual fires. Structure separation distance (SSD) was the most important predictive feature in the 2017 Thomas, 2018 Camp, 2019 Kincade and 2020 Glass fires while flame length was the most predictive feature for the 2017 Tubbs fire. In fires that burn through densely populated areas, wildfires can transition into urban conflagrations that become dominated by structure-to-structure spread, which is most strongly influenced by SSD. The high density of structures in the Thomas and Camp fires in the cities of Paradise and Ventura (Butte and Ventura counties) therefore emphasize this mode of spread. In the Kincade and Glass fires, the clustering of structures in Geyserville (Sonoma County) and Deer Park (Napa County) contributed to the rapid urban spread of the fire. Flame Length substantially contributes to structure destruction in the Tubbs fire and is the second most important factor for the Thomas, Camp, and Kincade fires. In the Glass fire, it ranks third in importance, emphasizing the role of nearby buildings and surrounding fuels in spreading flames to structures. Year built, in conjunction with building characteristics (eaves, roof, vent, siding, window), underscores the significance of home hardening in dense WUI areas, limiting fire spread and protecting structures from losses.Fig. 5</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHAP aggregation results for characterizing the contribution of features for five individual fires.</emphasis></p><p>Mean absolute SHAP values (mean |SHAP|) for the top ten predictors in each fire-specific XGBoost model.

Each panel represents one feature, displaying both the distribution of values through a violin plot (in light gray) and the mean values (in blue). The violin plots highlight the density of feature values, with wider sections indicating regions where values are more concentrated, allowing for a comprehensive comparison of how each feature behaves across different fires. For instance, the SSD and YEAR BUILT features show relatively wider distributions in the Glass fire, suggesting a broader range of structure separation distances and building years compared to other fires. Overlaid bar plots show the mean feature values for each fire, providing insight into the central tendencies. For example, the SSD and YEAR BUILT features have relatively higher means in the Camp and Glass fires, indicating greater separation distances and older structures on average in these regions. In contrast, the Kincade and Tubbs fires exhibit lower mean SSD values, suggesting tighter structure spacing. The combination of these two plots makes it possible to assess not only the average feature importance (through the bar plots) but also the variation within each fire (through the violin plots).Fig. 6</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The standardized distribution (gray) and mean values (blue) of important features across five fires.</emphasis></p><p>Gray violin plots show the standardized distributions of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> structure separation distance (SSD), <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis> flame length, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis> year built and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis> ember deposition for each fire.

This is particularly important because structure density cannot be modified for existing structures (which make up more than 98% of the current housing stock22,41. We applied this to the 5-fire database we created. In the first scenario, which involved home hardening, we adjusted all hardening values in our dataset to fire-safe ones (e.g. non-flammable siding, fine mesh over vents, double paned windows, non-flammable roof, etc.) and applied the XGB model. This resulted in a 25% survival rate with 75% structure loss due to WUI fires (Supplementary Materials Fig. 6). Next, we combined home hardening with clearing defensible space in Zone 0 (0\u20135 feet; 0\u20131.5 meters), which effectively doubled the survival rate to 40% and reduced the loss rate to 60% (Supplementary Materials Fig. 7). Finally, we implemented an extreme mitigation scenario that included both home hardening and the clearing of defensible space in Zone 0 (0\u20135 feet; 0\u20131.5 meters) and Zone 1 (5\u201330 feet; 1.5\u20139 meters). This further increased the survival rate to 48% and reduced the structure loss to 52% (Supplementary Materials Fig. 8). Figure 7 shows the structure loss and survivability across various mitigation scenarios. It is crucial to acknowledge that these hypothetical scenarios did not incorporate the impact of suppression efforts or firefighting strategies, which could substantially influence the outcomes in real-world situations. Therefore, the results from this analysis should be considered as theoretical estimates, and the actual outcomes may differ considerably when these real-world mitigation strategies are applied.Fig. 7</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Probabilities of predicted structure destruction under various mitigation scenarios.</emphasis></p><p>Horizontal stacked bars show percentage of structures Destroyed (navy) versus Survived (pale blue) under various predicted mitigation scenarios: No Mitigation (baseline), Scenario 1 (home hardening only), Scenario 2 (home hardening and clearing Zone 0), and Scenario 3 (home hardening and clearing Zones 0 and 1).

The ranked importance and interplay between these mitigation measures has now been presented in this study, utilizing simulations to extract exposure conditions during different fires. The application of XGBoost and SHAP methods has illuminated the critical features contributing to structure destruction. Following investigations of the Camp fire by Maranghides et al. and Knapp et al.22,32 Structure Separation Distance (SSD) arose as a key metric in characterizing the likelihood of loss for any particular structure during these large WUI fires. While smaller fires may occur through sparse housing arrangements, the majority of structure losses in California have occurred in large-loss fires in moderately dense (suburban) communities28,32. In these fires, the structures themselves become fuel and contribute to spread. These existing structures pose a unique challenge in hazard management\u2014they are immobile. While these structures can be hardened, they cannot be readily removed or displaced like many other WUI fuels.</p><p>The analysis revealed the role of interactions among competing factors (like SSD, flame length, ember load, year built, and exterior siding) in influencing fire dynamics, showcasing that multiple features contribute simultaneously to fire risk to structures. Our results show that the most important factor that cannot be changed is the distance between structures, as conflagrations tend to consume a majority of houses in major fires. Nevertheless, there is still a substantial opportunity to enhance safety through effective mitigation measures such as hardening structures and establishing a defensible space. Mitigation measures on the structure (hardening) combined with removal of surrounding fuels in the area immediately adjacent to the structure (zone 0) has the potential to dramatically reduce losses in future fires. While applying these measures to any particular structure within a dense urban area makes little difference on the survivability of a single home, substantial reductions in losses are achievable when community-wide actions can be applied. This has been proposed in many studies and is a major tenant of community risk-reduction programs, however, it has not been shown to be effective before because previous studies focus more on individual structures. The effect of community risk reduction may have other benefits as well, with amplified effectiveness to responding fire crews28. When fewer homes ignite from embers or direct flame contact, less structure-to-structure spread results, and the fire service is freed up to focus on those structures that are most threatened. If arriving early in fire progression, it is possible that embers can be extinguished and the \u201cdisaster sequence\u201d posited by Calkin et al.10 can be disrupted and a smaller number of homes may be lost.</p><p>While hardening and defensible space actions may not alter the fundamental risks posed by structure proximity, they can still dramatically improve the survivability of buildings during wildfires. By examining individual fire cases, we can further tailor mitigation approaches to address specific vulnerabilities and enhance resilience against future wildfires. This is apparent when we see that the factors most correlated with structure destruction change for some fires, such as the Tubbs fire where flame length played a greater role than structure spacing overall. During this fire, sparser structures could potentially have benefited from additional fuel management to reduce fire exposure, although some areas, such as the Coffey Park community were dense and still dominated by structure separation. While siding materials were not critical to predict outcomes in any one fire, as an overall predictor they were very important, which speaks to the fact that clustered structures on each fire often had similar construction materials, year built, etc. so that those factors do not appear as important.</p><p>Overall, we have shown the potential to combine extensive on-the-ground post-fire data collection, analysis of remotely sensed data, and fire reconstruction modeling to better understand the complicated interactions between different features and structure survivability during wildfires. Despite the improvement of these data and modeling tools, we still have a dramatic lack of information before and during fires that is desperately in need of improvement. Pre-fire inspections are limited and were not available at scale to aid this study, therefore much of the data was collected after the fire and is not at the fine scale to distinguish all potential factors that play a role in destruction. For instance, year built is an inter-related term that also corresponds to materials used, construction type, building codes, etc. It is still useful because it is one of the most easily obtained factors for future analysis, but it makes it harder to distinguish between other factors. During the fires it would also have been useful to observe failure modes more directly, e.g. observation of what part of the exterior ignites by embers, structure-to-structure spread, etc. Still, this study provides a broader understanding useful to the field now and a framework for future data to be applied.</p><p>This analysis supports the effectiveness of home hardening and defensible space in reducing structure losses in the WUI, underscoring a need for more application in high-risk areas. Integrating fire risk assessments into land-use planning, including zoning regulations that incorporate risk maps to guide development away from high-exposure areas or require stricter building codes requiring defensible space and home hardening in communities that can be exposed to wildfires may help reduce losses. Similarly, policies that provide financial incentives, subsidies, or insurance benefits for retrofitting homes can also contribute to enhancing community resilience. These results can also be used to inform community outreach and education. Fire risk communication grounded in localized data can empower residents to take action and participate in preparedness efforts.</p><p>It is important to highlight potential limitations of the input data and methods used in this study. While reliance on post-fire damage inspection (DINS) assessments provides clear distinctions on the damage state of structures, there is inherent uncertainty on collected features that are difficult to determine in a post-damage state. Additionally, the DINS data may not capture the full range of potential factors that contribute to fire damage, such as local preparedness, fire suppression efforts, construction practices, etc., which could affect the generalizability of the findings to other regions or future fires. Remotely-sensed data, particularly for vegetation separation distance (VSD) is also subject to potential errors as small fuels that can contribute to local fire spread may not be visible at the resolution captured. The moisture content, species, and arrangement of vegetation and other flammable materials may also influence the effectiveness of defensible space but can\u2019t be captured through remote sensing modalities. Estimates of fire and ember exposure from fire reconstruction modeling are also subject to potential errors from deviations in fuel or weather input data and the empirical nature of the model itself. Machine Learning models are also limited in their reliance only on provided data. Efforts have been taken to minimize these potential sources of error, including conducting a comprehensive sensitivity analysis with perturbations, an assessment of the trained ML model to systematically assess how variations in key parameters influence our predictions, and use of a validation dataset to assess the performance of the model.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methods</emphasis></p><p>We primarily relied on a modified database from five selected fires that includes more than 47,000 structures with two broad damage states: \u201cSurvived\u201d and \u201cDestroyed\u201d, and five detailed damage states: \u201cDestroyed (&gt;50%)\u201d, Damaged (\u201cMajor (26\u201350%)\u201d, \u201cMinor (10\u201325%)\u201d, \u201cAffected (1\u20139%)\u201d), \u201cNo Damage\u201d. The CAL FIRE Damage INSpection Program (DINS) was founded with the goal to collect data on damaged, destroyed, and unburned structures during and immediately after fire events to assist in the recovery process, and to provide local governments and scientists information for analyzing why some structures burned and why some survived43. Through a public records request, we acquired DINS data for more than 90,000 structures that survived, were damaged, or were destroyed across all California wildfires from 2013\u20132022, making this potentially the largest combined dataset of its sort. We then incorporated risk factors associated with structure destruction by wildfires to the DINS data to gain a deeper understanding of WUI destruction. These factors include structure density, building materials, year built, defensible space, and exposures to structures (fire intensity and ember). We employed several Machine Learning (ML) techniques to identify and highlight the important features in our WUI data. These techniques included feature selection, feature engineering, and model interpretation methods to ensure we could pinpoint the most influential variables influencing our results. To enhance the performance of the ML model in this study, we implemented a range of data preprocessing techniques such as data cleaning, normalization, and encoding. These preprocessing steps were crucial for improving model accuracy, reducing noise, and ensuring the robustness of our findings. By meticulously preparing the data, we ensured that the ML model could effectively learn and make accurate predictions from our complex WUI dataset. We opted for the XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) algorithm for our ML model due to its superior performance over other methods on our dataset. We also leveraged the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) model, which provides a nuanced understanding of each column\u2019s contribution to the overall predictive outcome. This technique allowed for a comprehensive assessment of the importance of variables within the dataset, enhancing the robustness and reliability of our analysis. The results of Confusion Matrices and Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) Curves, in addition to an advanced computational framework, allowed us to delve into the intricacies of the dataset, capturing complex relationships and patterns that might not be discernible through conventional methods. Our evaluation extended beyond a generalized assessment, as we calculated the accuracy and sensitivity metrics for each individual fire and aggregated the results to encompass all structures within the damage dataset. This meticulous analysis not only provided insights into the predictive performance of our model on a per-fire basis but also yielded a comprehensive understanding of its effectiveness across the entire spectrum of structures in the damage data.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Risk factors to structures from wildfires in the WUI</emphasis></p><p>The methodology for integrating risk factors related to structure destruction builds upon the combination of on-the-ground data with fire modeling reconstructions by Hakes and Theodori et al.34 for community-level risk assessment for the Tubbs fire, which includes:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Structure spacing</emphasis> which represents \u201cStructure Separation Distance (SSD)\u201d. We employed the Microsoft Maps dataset (available at <url normalizedValue=\"https://github.com/microsoft/USBuildingFootprints\">https://github.com/microsoft/USBuildingFootprints</url>), which encompasses open building footprints datasets for entire counties in the United States. This dataset comprises 129,591,852 computer-generated building footprints. Additionally, we utilized QGIS software to access geospatial data concerning urban infrastructure, building locations, and their spatial interconnections.</p><p>The <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">year built</emphasis> refers to the year in which the primary structure on a parcel of land was constructed. In the context of analyzing the impact of WUI fires, the Year Built variable is important because the age of a structure can influence its susceptibility to fire damage. Furthermore, it acts as a confounding variable that can affect both the building features and the extent of damage.</p><p>Concerning fire safety in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">building construction materials</emphasis>, numerous in-depth studies have been carried out through meticulously planned laboratory tests18,44. Despite the solid laboratory evidence, few empirical studies have documented building characteristics associated with structure loss in real wildfire situations28. In this study building characteristics include eaves, vent screens, exterior siding, roof construction, and window panes.</p><p>In terms of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">defensible space</emphasis>, which is representing in this study as \u201cVegetation Separation Distance (VSD)\u201d, the state of California requires fire-exposed homeowners to create a minimum of 30 m (100 ft) of defensible space around structures, and some localities are beginning to require at least 60 m (200 ft) in certain circumstances26. We established three categories for the Vegetation Separation Distance (VSD): Zone0, which comprises the initial five feet from the building or \u201c0\u20135\u201d; Zone1, encompassing the area within 30 feet of the building or \u201c5\u201330\u201d; and Zone2, extending to within 100 feet of the building or \u201c30\u2013100\u201d (CAL FIRE DSpace: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/dspace\">https://www.fire.ca.gov/dspace</url>). Remote sensing techniques were utilized to analyze the density and distribution of vegetation in the WUI regions and urban settings, extracting valuable insights from the aerial and satellite imagery and LiDAR data. The publicly available datasets (including countywide LiDAR data and a fine scale vegetation and habitat map) which were produced by the Sonoma County Agricultural Preservation and Open Space District and the Sonoma County Water Agency, provide an accurate, up-to-date inventory of the county\u2019s landscape features, ecological communities and habitats (Sonoma County Vegetation Map: <url normalizedValue=\"https://sonomavegmap.org/\">https://sonomavegmap.org/</url>).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Exposures</emphasis> including fire intensity (flame length) and firebrand (ember load). Houses are destroyed during wildfires when exposed to flames in adjacent fuel, radiant heat from nearby fuel (\u226440 m)16, or airborne embers and firebrands originating in nearby and distant fuel (typically &lt; 10 km)45,46. In this study, we used the Eulerian Level set Model of FIRE spread, ELMFIRE, an operational fire behavior and spread simulation tool35 for its additional capability in simulating ember deposition of multiple embers and its implementation of Monte Carlo analysis36 to capture the stochasticity and uncertainty inherent in wildland fire modeling. We used and modified the semi-physical model of\u200636,47 to include urban fire spread by using the empirical approach of HAMADA37.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Data preprocessing</emphasis></p><p>To predict the damage for any of the fire datasets, the dataset was divided into the target variable or y, and all the other features as inputs or X. A stratified split was executed based on \u201cy\u201d values, allocating 80% of the data for training purposes and reserving the remaining 20% for the testing set. This stratified approach ensured that the class proportions in the target variable were similar in both subsets, minimizing the risk of bias due to imbalanced classes. By preserving the target class distribution, this partitioning strategy not only improved the model\u2019s ability to generalize but also provided a more accurate and reliable performance evaluation when tested on unseen data. Additionally, the use of a fixed random_state ensured that the split was reproducible, allowing for consistent model training and evaluation across different iterations. As part of the model training process, we utilized GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning across several models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. During the grid search, k-fold cross-validation (with cv_k_folds set to 10) was employed to evaluate the models, ensuring robust validation and mitigating overfitting. In the cross-validation process, the data was split into k-folds, where each fold served as the validation set once, while the remaining k-1 folds were used for training. This allowed the grid search to identify the optimal set of hyperparameters based on performance metrics, such as accuracy and F-beta scores. After selecting the best hyperparameters, the model was refitted on the entire training set, ensuring that the final model was well-tuned for testing.</p><p>To address the noteworthy variations in the scales of the model inputs, a vital preprocessing step was implemented prior to model training. Using the scikit-learn package48, we first designed imputation strategies through IterativeImputer to handle missing values. These strategies were trained on the training set and then applied to both the training and test sets. The imputation strategy was tailored for each feature in stacked WUI data and for each wildfire case. For example, Roof Construction (19,318 non-null), Eaves (19,318 non-null), Vent Screen (19,318 non-null), Exterior Siding (19,318 non-null), Window Pane (19,318 non-null), VSD (3504 non-null), and Year Built (22,501 non-null) were imputed using a nearest neighbor approach. For Year Built in individual fire cases, either nearest neighbor imputation or a median-based strategy was adopted, whereas numerical features like Embers (11,549 non-null), and Flame length (14,578 non-null) were aggregated (e.g., using the mean or median, potentially augmented by k-nearest neighbors) to fill in missing values. In our approach, we incorporated a spatial clustering technique that utilizes proximity-based methods for data imputation. Specifically, we leveraged Haversine Distance and Pairwise Distance metrics in UTM coordinates to cluster data points based on their geographic proximity. This spatial clustering approach ensures that similar locations, defined by latitude and longitude, are treated consistently when imputing missing values. By considering spatial proximity, we make the assumption that nearby data points are likely to share similar attributes, enhancing the robustness of the imputation process. Next, we normalized the numerical variables using StandardScaler, ensuring that they were on a similar scale, which helps in the convergence and performance of various models. Additionally, we conducted OneHotEncoding and Label Encoding on categorical variables using OneHotEncoder and LabelEncoder from scikit-learn to convert them into a numerical format that can be understood by the models. Class balance is achieved through the binarization of different labels/classes with damaged and not damaged/survived. This approach is essential, particularly in scenarios where certain damage classes may be underrepresented. This preprocessing pipeline allowed us to use a variety of models on the dataset, ensuring compatibility and enhancing the overall performance of the models.</p><p>In essence, this procedure, encompassing data categorization, stratified splitting, imputation, standard scaling, OneHotEncoding/Label Encoding, and resampling, laid the foundation for a robust and unbiased evaluation of the model\u2019s predictive capabilities regarding fire damage across diverse datasets.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Machine learning techniques</emphasis></p><p>Machine learning (ML) methods have recently been applied to wildland fire49 and present an ideal platform for WUI fires as interactions between competing factors can be fit and modeled. In this work, we employed both regression and classification ML techniques to our combined dataset resulting in a predictive model for structure destruction based on home hardening (roof, siding, vents, eaves, window, year built), vegetation separation (defensible space and surrounding), exposure metrics (flames and embers), and structure spacing. The XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) machine learning algorithm was chosen as it outperformed other methods on our dataset. The model hyper parameters were tuned using RandomizedSearchCV, which was employed to perform a randomized search over a predefined parameter grid. This approach was used because of the large number of parameters in the XGBoost model. Hyper parameter selection is performed using the best result in terms of the following classification metrics: F-beta50, F1-Score50, accuracy51, balanced accuracy52 and precision-recall scores53. The F-beta score is used to balance precision and recall, with the beta parameter allowing for tuning the model\u2019s sensitivity to false positives and false negatives. Finally, feature importance with SHAP aggregation analysis was utilized to quantify the contribution of each feature to the target variable. A higher feature importance score indicates that the feature has a greater influence on the model\u2019s prediction54. The SHAP model connects optimal credit allocation with local explanations using the classic Shapley values from game theory and their related extensions55. This was then applied to a unified framework for interpreting predictions to explain the output of any machine learning model.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Classifiers</emphasis></p><p>We employed several classification models, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest48, and Gradient Boosting based XGBoost56 since there is another method called Gradient Boosting Machine other than Extreme Gradient Boosting Machines (XGBoost). Each of these models offers distinct advantages and methodologies for analyzing feature importance.</p><p>Logistic Regression is a generalized linear model used for classification problems57 and we use it as a base model to compare with more complex models. The second model used in this work is the Random Forest. Random Forests are a technique in ensemble learning utilized for tasks such as classification and regression. During the training, several decision trees are built. In classification, the random forest outputs the class chosen by the majority of trees58. CatBoost employs an ordered boosting technique to minimize target leakage from categorical features, often leading to robust performance even with limited parameter tuning56. While CatBoost can seamlessly integrate categorical data with minimal preprocessing and achieve competitive performance on binary classification tasks, logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost typically require more elaborate feature engineering and preprocessing, which in turn can influence both model performance and the interpretability of sensitivity analyses such as those based on SHAP values. Finally, Gradient Boosting (GB) is a method in machine learning that employs boosting within a functional framework. The XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is a GB implementation that has been used as it outperformed other methods on our dataset. XGBoost is often preferable for developing predictive models for large datasets due to its accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability38. Furthermore, XGBoost is a robust algorithm for both classification and regression problems. Due to its strengths in model prediction, XGBoost can be utilized for damage assessment to create predictive models for structure destruction. The SHAP analysis results for all four models are provided in the Supplementary Materials (Supplementary Figs. 1\u20133). These figures offer a detailed breakdown of how each feature contributes to the predictions across models, enhancing the interpretability of our findings and complementing the results discussed in the main text.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Feature contribution through SHAP analysis</emphasis></p><p>While machine learning (ML) models are increasingly used due to their high predictive power, their use in understanding the data-generating process (DGP) is limited. Understanding the DGP requires insights into feature-target associations, which many ML models cannot directly provide, due to their lack of understanding causal effects. Feature importance (FI) methods provide useful insights into the DGP under certain conditions59. Furthermore, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a unified framework for interpreting machine learning models based on cooperative game theory55. It assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction by computing the contribution of each feature to the prediction, averaging over all possible combinations of features. This approach ensures consistency and local accuracy, providing insights into how different features influence model predictions. SHAP values can explain individual predictions and provide a global understanding of the model\u2019s behavior, making it a valuable tool for model interpretability in research54. SHAP can be considered a form of in-sample sensitivity analysis because it assesses how changing a feature or a subset of features affects the model\u2019s output. It evaluates the impact of including or excluding a feature and identifies which features contribute most to the predictions60. We utilized SHAP interpretation analysis of feature importance to identify and understand the key factors driving structure destruction in WUI fires. In this study, we opted for SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) as a model-agnostic tool because its values not only quantify the magnitude and direction of each feature\u2019s contribution, but also capture complex non-linear interactions between variables55. This provides both local and global insights that are critical for understanding the multifaceted nature of fire damage. For example, SHAP allowed us to reveal how features such as SSD, ember exposure, and flame length interact in non-linear ways that traditional importance measures might overlook. Ultimately, the detailed and context-specific information provided by SHAP helped us interpret the predictive factors driving structural vulnerability, reinforcing the robustness of our findings.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sensitivity analysis for the machine learning model</emphasis></p><p>We developed a comprehensive sensitivity analysis framework to assess how variability in key input features from the exposure model (ember load and flame length) affects our model predictions. For each of the five fires, ensemble outputs from the WUI fire spread model were used to perturb the \u201cember load\u201d and \u201cflame length\u201d variables while keeping other inputs fixed. By aggregating the model outputs from these multiple ensemble runs, we computed the mean predictions and corresponding uncertainties for each test sample. This approach allowed us to quantify the impact of non-linear interactions and input variability on the final predictions, offering both local and global insights into model performance.</p><p>Visualizations, such as kernel density estimation (KDE) plots, clearly illustrate the distribution and variability of the predictions across the test samples (Fig. 8). The shaded regions represent the uncertainty around the mean predictions for both ember and flame perturbations, with the respective overall mean, standard deviation, and relative uncertainty values indicated within the plots. These distributions provide a clear view of the uncertainty and variability in the model\u2019s response to perturbations in ember load and flame length. Additionally, SHAP analysis was employed to further interpret the contributions of each feature, enhancing our understanding of the model\u2019s behavior under different exposure conditions. This sensitivity analysis not only characterizes the associated uncertainties related to flame and ember in the model but also suggests that the machine learning estimator, XGBoost, has learned an underlying understanding of the problem implying intermediary outcomes other than damaged and survived are possible in the dataset; see the emerged middle class distributions in Fig. 8. Additionally, it helped us gain insights into the physical factors influencing damage, as it highlights the non-binary classifications for the damage classes, offering a more nuanced understanding of the damage severity.Fig. 8</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sensitivity analysis with respect to ember and flame exposure with perturbations.</emphasis></p><p>A sensitivity analysis is shown, performed by perturbing two key exposure inputs\u2014ember deposition and flame length\u2014using 100 ensemble outputs from the ELMFIRE spread model (HAMADA extension) for each fire, while holding all other predictors constant. For each test sample (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 47,742), the model\u2019s predicted survival probability was computed across ensembles to yield a mean prediction (solid fill) and its uncertainty (shaded region = \u00b1 1 standard deviation). <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> Ember perturbation: blue fill shows the kernel density of mean predictions under varied ember load; dashed blue lines mark mean \u00b1 std. Inset reports overall mean, standard deviation and relative uncertainty (%). <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis> Flame perturbation: green fill shows the kernel density of predictions under varied flame length; dashed green lines mark mean \u00b1 std. Inset reports overall mean, standard deviation and relative uncertainty (%). This framework quantifies the influence of non-linear interactions and input variability on the binary damage classification (0 = not damaged, 1 = damaged), reveals emergent intermediate prediction modes, and offers both local and global insights into model behavior under uncertainty.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Confusion matrix and ROC curve for predictions</emphasis></p><p>A confusion matrix summarizes the classification performance of a classifier with respect to some test data. It is a two-dimensional matrix, indexed in one dimension by the true class of an object and in the other by the class that the classifier assigns61. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) graphs are useful for organizing classifiers and visualizing their performance. A receiver operating characteristics (ROC) graph is a technique for visualizing, organizing and selecting classifiers based on their performance62. We investigated the five large WUI fires in our dataset to predict structure survival during each fire by understanding the model\u2019s accuracy, and other key performance metrics. By analyzing the confusion matrices and ROC curves for each fire event, we were able to identify patterns and discrepancies in model performance, leading to a better understanding of the factors influencing structure survival in large WUI fires.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reporting summary</emphasis></p><p>Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>We would like to express our deepest gratitude to Matt Lee, Dave Shew, Dave Sapsis, Steve Hawks, and William Brewer from CAL FIRE for their invaluable contributions, guidance, and expertise throughout this study.

The wildfire was described as starting with \u201can improperly extinguished bonfire.\u201d</p><p>Judge James Gluck told Kling during a brief court appearance Thursday the state sought to have him detained pending trial and he wouldn't be released. Kling spoke briefly, only to clarify that his next court appearance was set for Tuesday. \u201cThank you. Have a good day,\u201d he said when the judge dismissed him.</p><p>A public defender representing Kling during the hearing told the judge she had \u201cnothing further\u201d when he asked.</p><p>Emails from the public defender's office said Thursday it could not comment on a pending case so early in the process. A voice message was left at a possible phone number for Kling.</p><p>Authorities first spotted the blaze Tuesday morning from a fire tower when a smoke column appeared amid the pines. Law enforcement said they used a GPS to plot the origin of the fire and determined the cause was a bonfire that hadn't been put out.</p><p>Speaking Thursday afternoon at a news conference, Ocean County Prosecutor Bradley D. Billhimer said \u201cwe can confidently say that we think the fire was set intentionally.\u201d He declined further comment on why authorities believe Kling was responsible and other matters related to the investigation since it remains ongoing.</p><p>It's peak forest fire season in the vast pine wilderness that covers more than 1 million acres (405,000 hectares) \u2014 an area roughly as large as the Grand Canyon \u2014 and firefighters are contending with low humidity and the aftermath of a <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/drought-new-york-water-conservation-new-jersey-121d29c25df168fa5b9d3d74add27d7c\">monthslong drought</url> in the region.</p><p>Though large tracts of the Pine Barrens are uninhabited, New Jersey is the nation's most densely populated state and officials have warned the fire could threaten developments nearby. The fire had grown to more than 23.8 square miles (61.6 square kilometers) on Thursday, approaching what officials believe to have been the largest wildfire in the state in the last two decades.</p><p>Authorities had said there were no injuries or deaths in the fire, but a commercial building and some vehicles were destroyed. About 5,000 people had been evacuated but were permitted to return home on Wednesday, officials said.</p><p>\u201cThis is still a very active fire,\u201d LaTourette said Wednesday. \u201cAs we continue to get this under full control the expectation is that the number of acres will grow and will grow in a place that is unpopulated.\u201d</p><p>Jim and Lenore Thoms, who own a business in an industrial park near the blaze, called the fire \u201ca very scary experience\u201d and praised the efforts of firefighters.</p><p>\u201cThe firefighters were phenomenal, they saved this whole park.\u201d Jim Thoms said. \u201cIf they weren\u2019t around, the way things were going on, you might not have seen any buildings at all.\u201d</p><p>The effects of the fire are beginning to be seen beyond the state.</p><p>Higher-than-normal pollution levels were forecast Thursday in New York City, Rockland and Westchester counties, and in Long Island\u2019s Nassau and Suffolk counties, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation said. The fire is roughly 54 miles (87 kilometers) south of New York City.</p><p>It said \u201cgoing indoors may reduce exposure\u201d to problems such as eye, nose and throat irritation, coughing, sneezing and shortness of breath.</p><p>In New York, dry conditions across the state are resulting in a high fire danger rating in several regions including New York City, Long Island, the Hudson Valley, Capital Region, and portions of the North Country, according to the advisory. The rest of the state is at a moderate or low level of fire danger.</p><p>Officials said the fire is believed to be the second-worst in recent years, smaller only than a 2007 blaze that burned 26 square miles (67 square kilometers).</p><p>Acting New Jersey Gov. Tahesha Way declared a state of emergency Wednesday, and officials said Thursday that they\u2019ve contained about 50% of the wildfire. Gov. Phil Murphy is on an official visit in Poland for a Holocaust memorial. He's due to fly back home Friday.</p><p>Video released by the state agency overseeing the fire service showed billowing white and black clouds of smoke, intense flames engulfing pines and firefighters dousing a charred structure.</p><p>The Pine Barrens sit between Philadelphia to the west and the Atlantic coast to the east. In the region with quick-draining sandy soil and trees with still-developing leaves, humidity remains low and winds can kick up, drying out the forest floor.</p><p>___</p><p>Bruce Shipkowski in Chatsworth, New Jersey;

The wildfire was described as starting with \u201can improperly extinguished bonfire.\u201d</p><p>Judge James Gluck told Kling during a brief court appearance Thursday the state sought to have him detained pending trial and he wouldn't be released. Kling spoke briefly, only to clarify that his next court appearance was set for Tuesday. \u201cThank you. Have a good day,\u201d he said when the judge dismissed him.</p><p>A public defender representing Kling during the hearing told the judge she had \u201cnothing further\u201d when he asked.</p><p>Emails from the public defender's office said Thursday it could not comment on a pending case so early in the process. A voice message was left at a possible phone number for Kling.</p><p>Authorities first spotted the blaze Tuesday morning from a fire tower when a smoke column appeared amid the pines. Law enforcement said they used a GPS to plot the origin of the fire and determined the cause was a bonfire that hadn't been put out.</p><p>Speaking Thursday afternoon at a news conference, Ocean County Prosecutor Bradley D. Billhimer said \u201cwe can confidently say that we think the fire was set intentionally.\u201d He declined further comment on why authorities believe Kling was responsible and other matters related to the investigation since it remains ongoing.</p><p>It's peak forest fire season in the vast pine wilderness that covers more than 1 million acres (405,000 hectares) \u2014 an area roughly as large as the Grand Canyon \u2014 and firefighters are contending with low humidity and the aftermath of a <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/drought-new-york-water-conservation-new-jersey-121d29c25df168fa5b9d3d74add27d7c\">monthslong drought</url> in the region.</p><p>Though large tracts of the Pine Barrens are uninhabited, New Jersey is the nation's most densely populated state and officials have warned the fire could threaten developments nearby. The fire had grown to more than 23.8 square miles (61.6 square kilometers) on Thursday, approaching what officials believe to have been the largest wildfire in the state in the last two decades.</p><p>Authorities had said there were no injuries or deaths in the fire, but a commercial building and some vehicles were destroyed. About 5,000 people had been evacuated but were permitted to return home on Wednesday, officials said.</p><p>\u201cThis is still a very active fire,\u201d LaTourette said Wednesday. \u201cAs we continue to get this under full control the expectation is that the number of acres will grow and will grow in a place that is unpopulated.\u201d</p><p>Jim and Lenore Thoms, who own a business in an industrial park near the blaze, called the fire \u201ca very scary experience\u201d and praised the efforts of firefighters.</p><p>\u201cThe firefighters were phenomenal, they saved this whole park.\u201d Jim Thoms said. \u201cIf they weren\u2019t around, the way things were going on, you might not have seen any buildings at all.\u201d</p><p>The effects of the fire are beginning to be seen beyond the state.</p><p>Higher-than-normal pollution levels were forecast Thursday in New York City, Rockland and Westchester counties, and in Long Island\u2019s Nassau and Suffolk counties, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation said. The fire is roughly 54 miles (87 kilometers) south of New York City.</p><p>It said \u201cgoing indoors may reduce exposure\u201d to problems such as eye, nose and throat irritation, coughing, sneezing and shortness of breath.</p><p>In New York, dry conditions across the state are resulting in a high fire danger rating in several regions including New York City, Long Island, the Hudson Valley, Capital Region, and portions of the North Country, according to the advisory. The rest of the state is at a moderate or low level of fire danger.</p><p>Officials said the fire is believed to be the second-worst in recent years, smaller only than a 2007 blaze that burned 26 square miles (67 square kilometers).</p><p>Acting New Jersey Gov. Tahesha Way declared a state of emergency Wednesday, and officials said Thursday that they\u2019ve contained about 50% of the wildfire. Gov. Phil Murphy is on an official visit in Poland for a Holocaust memorial. He's due to fly back home Friday.</p><p>Video released by the state agency overseeing the fire service showed billowing white and black clouds of smoke, intense flames engulfing pines and firefighters dousing a charred structure.</p><p>The Pine Barrens sit between Philadelphia to the west and the Atlantic coast to the east. In the region with quick-draining sandy soil and trees with still-developing leaves, humidity remains low and winds can kick up, drying out the forest floor.</p><p>___</p><p>Bruce Shipkowski in Chatsworth, New Jersey;

Tibetan sources told Radio Free Asia that Chinese authorities have restricted local residents from sharing details about the disasters on social media.</p><p>The largest fire, which broke out Jan. 23, was burning in a heavily forested area of Kyirong county in Shigatse prefecture of the Tibet Autonomous Region, or TAR, according to the sources, satellite images and a map from the NASA FIRMS, or Fire Information for Resource Management System.</p><p>The region supports a diverse range of wildlife, including long-tailed gray leaf monkeys, leopards, musk deer, elk, peacock pheasants, snow chickens and herds of wild donkeys.</p><p>It is also home to over 100 tree species, including rare varieties such as Tibetan longleaf pine, longleaf spruce and Himalayan yew.</p><p>The region also contains over 200 types of herbal medicines, such as cordyceps, Panax notoginseng and gastrodia elata, many of which are considered nationally valuable.</p><p>Another fire was raging in Gangri township of Bachen, or Bagen in Chinese, in the TAR.</p><p>Two other wildfires have been reported in Sichuan province, to the east one near Ringpo village in Nyagchuka (Yajiang) county that started on Feb. 2 and another near Gamda village in Zamthang (Rangtang) county in Aba Prefecture on Feb. 5.</p><p>Local Chinese officials said the cause of the fires was unknown and under investigation.</p><p>Few firefighters dispatched</p><p>The fires have continued to spread after two weeks because Chinese authorities dispatched only a few firefighters, according to the source outside Tibet but in contact with residents on the ground.</p><p>\"Chinese authorities have dispatched only a few firefighters so that the fire was not contained, even over 10 days after it first broke out,\" the person said.</p><p>Known for its rich vegetation and biodiversity, Kyirong county comprises over 143,000 hectares (353,400 acres), including 128,000 hectares (317,000 acres) of forest land that fall under the Qomolangma National Natural Preserve, according to the Jilong County Forestry and Grassland Bureau.

Who's going to save us?\"</p><p>Past wildfires</p><p>Wildfires have erupted in Sichuan's Nyagchu county before.</p><p>In December 2024, a blaze broke out on the mountains near Chuka town that took a week to put out. Another fire in March of that year resulted in significant property damage.</p><p>Located in the hilly plateau area of northwest Sichuan, Nyagchuka county boasts a diverse and rich biodiversity due to its varied topography and climate. It is home to 196 species of large fungi, including 126 edible varieties, as well as an abundance of medicinal plants such as cordyceps, astragalus and fritillaria.</p><p>The forest fire in Zamthang county, which occurred around 4 p.m. local time on Thursday, reportedly threatened several surrounding villages as it spread.</p><p>The Sichuan Provincial Forest Fire Brigade dispatched 495 people and 93 vehicles to the fire scene, official state media said.</p><p>Additional reporting by Dolma Lhamo, Tsering Namgyal, Tenzin Norzom and Tashi Wangchuk.

Though recent rains have helped, Ocean County remains abnormally dry during what is now peak wildfire season in New Jersey.</p><p>LaTourette said he was \"hopeful\" that the fire would remain away from people, \"but I'm not going to tell you there's no chance because wildfires are risky.\"</p><p>The fire was 50% contained as of Wednesday evening.</p><p>Conditions will remain favorable for fires to spread over the next few days, officials said, as humidity remains low, temperatures are up, and breezes are steady.</p><p>No injuries have been reported, but about 5,000 people in Lacey and Ocean Townships had to be evacuated. They have since been allowed to return home.</p><p>At least one commercial building has been destroyed, as well as some vehicles.</p><p>\"This is the worst fire in the history of our township,\" Lacey Township Mayor Peter Curatolo said.</p><p>Curatolo described the sky Tuesday night over his township - filled with smoke and the glow of approaching flames - as apocalyptic.</p><p>\"I know our residents were terrified,\" Curatolo said in a phone interview.</p><p>The township opened a shelter at the Charles A. Smith Community Center for residents of the Pheasant Run senior community, but the center had sustained a power outage and only had bottled water for the approximately 35 evacuees, Curatolo said.</p><p>Thankfully, he said, Ocean County helped transfer the residents to a better-equipped shelter, and Curatolo and other officials assisted the evacuees onto school buses for their trip to Manchester Township High School.</p><p>The only major damage that occurred in Lacey was to a warehouse owned by a family business that burned down, he said.</p><p>Curatolo added that he was grateful for the assistance provided by the mayors of other communities in Ocean County.</p><p>Although the fire danger was waning, he said, he was still concerned about the air quality and was eagerly anticipating the rain that was forecast for this weekend.</p><p>\"I was never so hopeful for a rain event in my life,\" he said.</p><p>The fire began over 10 to 20 acres in Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area before spreading rapidly.</p><p>As of Wednesday, the blazes had drifted away from homes and toward the wilderness of the Pinelands, partly as a result of winds and the backburning firefighters used to control and direct the fire.</p><p>The heavily used Garden State Parkway and Route 9 have reopened after being closed Tuesday because of what has been dubbed the Jones Road Fire.</p><p>About 1,320 buildings had been threatened by the blaze, but that number dropped to 20 by Wednesday.</p><p>Although 25,000 customers of Jersey Central Power &amp; Light lost electricity, a company spokesperson said power was being restored starting Wednesday.</p><p>Acting Gov. Tahesha Way declared a state of emergency in response to the fire. The declaration authorizes officials to implement emergency plans, coordinate recovery efforts, reroute traffic, and muster resources. Way is New Jersey's lieutenant governor and serves as acting governor when Gov. Phil Murphy is unavailable.</p><p>The Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area, managed by the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife, spans a heavily wooded 32,253 acres in the Pinelands and is bordered by housing developments.</p><p>The fire broke out near Jones Road, about six miles west of Forked River on the New Jersey coast.</p><p>The wildlife management area is the largest tract of land preserved by the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife. Most of it is dominated by pine and oak trees on higher ground, and pines and Atlantic white cedar bogs in the lowlands.</p><p>Because of the dry conditions, it has been a busy season for wildfires.</p><p>Bill Donnelly, chief of the New Jersey Forest Fire Service, said there have been 662 wildfires that have burned 16,572 acres so far this year. That compares with 310 wildfires and 315 acres burned during the same time last year.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:fkummer@inquirer.com\">fkummer@inquirer.com</email> and <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:bmoran@inquirer.com\">bmoran@inquirer.com</email></p><p>RobertMoran215</p><p>(215) 854-5983</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHIINQ-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHIINQ2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FN0-9C33-RS5V-R4PN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"754\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Philadelphia Inquirer</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 24, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

The wildfire was described as starting with \u201can improperly extinguished bonfire.\u201d</p><p>Judge James Gluck told Kling during a brief court appearance Thursday the state sought to have him detained pending trial and he wouldn't be released. Kling spoke briefly, only to clarify that his next court appearance was set for Tuesday. \u201cThank you. Have a good day,\u201d he said when the judge dismissed him.</p><p>A public defender representing Kling during the hearing told the judge she had \u201cnothing further\u201d when he asked.</p><p>Emails from the public defender's office said Thursday it could not comment on a pending case so early in the process. A voice message was left at a possible phone number for Kling.</p><p>Authorities first spotted the blaze Tuesday morning from a fire tower when a smoke column appeared amid the pines. Law enforcement said they used a GPS to plot the origin of the fire and determined the cause was a bonfire that hadn't been put out.</p><p>Speaking Thursday afternoon at a news conference, Ocean County Prosecutor Bradley D. Billhimer said \u201cwe can confidently say that we think the fire was set intentionally.\u201d He declined further comment on why authorities believe Kling was responsible and other matters related to the investigation since it remains ongoing.</p><p>It's peak forest fire season in the vast pine wilderness that covers more than 1 million acres (405,000 hectares) \u2014 an area roughly as large as the Grand Canyon \u2014 and firefighters are contending with low humidity and the aftermath of a <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/drought-new-york-water-conservation-new-jersey-121d29c25df168fa5b9d3d74add27d7c\">monthslong drought</url> in the region.</p><p>Though large tracts of the Pine Barrens are uninhabited, New Jersey is the nation's most densely populated state and officials have warned the fire could threaten developments nearby. The fire had grown to more than 23.8 square miles (61.6 square kilometers) on Thursday, approaching what officials believe to have been the largest wildfire in the state in the last two decades.</p><p>Authorities had said there were no injuries or deaths in the fire, but a commercial building and some vehicles were destroyed. About 5,000 people had been evacuated but were permitted to return home on Wednesday, officials said.</p><p>\u201cThis is still a very active fire,\u201d LaTourette said Wednesday. \u201cAs we continue to get this under full control the expectation is that the number of acres will grow and will grow in a place that is unpopulated.\u201d</p><p>Jim and Lenore Thoms, who own a business in an industrial park near the blaze, called the fire \u201ca very scary experience\u201d and praised the efforts of firefighters.</p><p>\u201cThe firefighters were phenomenal, they saved this whole park.\u201d Jim Thoms said. \u201cIf they weren\u2019t around, the way things were going on, you might not have seen any buildings at all.\u201d</p><p>The effects of the fire are beginning to be seen beyond the state.</p><p>Higher-than-normal pollution levels were forecast Thursday in New York City, Rockland and Westchester counties, and in Long Island\u2019s Nassau and Suffolk counties, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation said. The fire is roughly 54 miles (87 kilometers) south of New York City.</p><p>It said \u201cgoing indoors may reduce exposure\u201d to problems such as eye, nose and throat irritation, coughing, sneezing and shortness of breath.</p><p>In New York, dry conditions across the state are resulting in a high fire danger rating in several regions including New York City, Long Island, the Hudson Valley, Capital Region, and portions of the North Country, according to the advisory. The rest of the state is at a moderate or low level of fire danger.</p><p>Officials said the fire is believed to be the second-worst in recent years, smaller only than a 2007 blaze that burned 26 square miles (67 square kilometers).</p><p>Acting New Jersey Gov. Tahesha Way declared a state of emergency Wednesday, and officials said Thursday that they\u2019ve contained about 50% of the wildfire. Gov. Phil Murphy is on an official visit in Poland for a Holocaust memorial. He's due to fly back home Friday.</p><p>Video released by the state agency overseeing the fire service showed billowing white and black clouds of smoke, intense flames engulfing pines and firefighters dousing a charred structure.</p><p>The Pine Barrens sit between Philadelphia to the west and the Atlantic coast to the east. In the region with quick-draining sandy soil and trees with still-developing leaves, humidity remains low and winds can kick up, drying out the forest floor.</p><p>___</p><p>Bruce Shipkowski in Chatsworth, New Jersey;

Two other fires were active in nearby Burke and Madison counties, with a third wildfire burning in Stokes County on the northern border with Virginia.</p><p>In South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster declared a state of emergency Saturday as part of an effort to stop a blaze in Pickens County called the Table Rock Fire that started the previous day in an area within the Blue Ridge Mountains.</p><p>\"As this wildfire continues to spread, the State of Emergency allows us to mobilize resources quickly and ensure our firefighters have the support they need to protect lives and property,\" McMaster said in a statement that reinforced a statewide outdoor burning ban issued Friday by the South Carolina Forestry Commission.</p><p>Local fire officials called for voluntary evacuations Saturday of some residents near Table Rock Mountain, the forestry commission said in a social media post.</p><p>The Pickens County Sheriff's Office posted an update late Saturday saying crews had ceased operations and would resume Sunday morning with ground personnel and machinery and assistance from helicopters and air tankers. The fire was about 110 acres and the public was asked to avoid state Highway 11.</p><p>North Carolina's western region already had been hit hard by Hurricane Helene in September. Among the extensive damage, flooding washed away more than a mile of eastbound lanes on Interstate 40 leading to eastern Tennessee and remained partially closed to traffic until March.</p><p>The hurricane damaged or impacted 5,000 miles of state-maintained roads and damaged 7,000 private roads, bridges and culverts in North Carolina.</p><p>The New Jersey Forest Fire Service, meanwhile, has been battling a wildfire that broke out in the Wharton State Forest on Saturday. The fire had consumed about 2.7 square miles as of early Sunday morning. Firefighters had contained about half of the blaze according to an 8a.m. update on the service's Facebook page.</p><p>Emergency officials said they have evacuated two campgrounds in the park. Eighteen buildings were near the fire but the flames were moving away from them and no structures had been evacuated.</p><p>The cause of the fire is under investigation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELHLD-7916820</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELHLD2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FDY-STR3-RSKJ-H1M0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">156396</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"513\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Woodward Communications, Inc.

Though recent rains have helped, Ocean County remains abnormally dry during what is now peak wildfire season in New Jersey.</p><p>LaTourette said he's \"hopeful\" that the fire can remain away from people, \"but I'm not going to tell you there's no chance because wildfires are risky.\"</p><p>The fire was 40% contained as of Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>Conditions will remain favorable for fires to spread over the next few days, officials said, as humidity remains low, temperatures are up, and breezes are steady.</p><p>No injuries have been reported. But about 5,000 people in Lacey and Ocean Townships had to be evacuated. They have since been allowed to return home.</p><p>At least one commercial building had been destroyed, as well as some vehicles.</p><p>\"This is the worst fire in the history of our township,\" Lacey Township Mayor Peter Curatolo said.</p><p>Curatolo described the sky Tuesday night over his township - filled with smoke and the glow of approaching flames - as apocalyptic.</p><p>\"I know our residents were terrified,\" Curatolo said in a phone interview.</p><p>The township opened a shelter at the Charles A. Smith Community Center for residents of the Pheasant Run senior community, but the center was suffering from a power outage and only had bottled water for the approximately 35 evacuees, Curatolo said.</p><p>Thankfully, he said, Ocean County helped to transfer the residents to a better-equipped shelter, and Curatolo and other officials assisted the evacuees onto school buses for their trip to Manchester Township High School.</p><p>The only major damage that occurred in Lacey was a warehouse owned by a family business that burned down, he said.</p><p>Curatolo added that he was grateful for the assistance provided by the mayors of other communities in Ocean County.</p><p>Although the fire danger was waning, he said he was still concerned about the air quality, and was eagerly anticipating the rain that was forecast for this weekend.</p><p>\"I was never so hopeful for a rain event in my life,\" he said.</p><p>The fire began over 10 to 20 acres in Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area before spreading rapidly.</p><p>As of Wednesday, the blazes had drifted away from homes and toward the wilderness of the Pinelands, partly as a result of winds and the backburning firefighters used to control and direct fire.</p><p>The heavily used Garden State Parkway and Route 9 have reopened after having been closed Tuesday because of what's been dubbed the Jones Road Fire.</p><p>About 1,320 buildings had been threatened by the blaze, but that dropped to 20 by Wednesday.</p><p>Although 25,000 customers of Jersey Central Power &amp; Light lost power, a company spokesperson said power would begin to be restored Wednesday.</p><p>Acting Gov. Tahesha Way declared a state of emergency in response to the fire. The declaration authorizes officials to implement emergency plans, coordinate recovery efforts, reroute traffic, and muster resources. Way is New Jersey's lieutenant governor and serves as acting governor when Gov. Phil Murphy is unavailable.</p><p>The Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area, managed by the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife, spans a heavily wooded 32,253 acres in the Pinelands and is bordered by housing developments.</p><p>The fire broke out near Jones Road, about six miles west of Forked River on the New Jersey coast.</p><p>The wildlife management area is the largest tract of land preserved by the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife. Most of it is dominated by pine and oak trees on higher ground, and pines and Atlantic white cedar bogs in the lowlands.</p><p>It contains the headwaters of Cedar Creek as well as numerous wildlife, such as the barred owl, a threatened species.</p><p>Because of the dry conditions, it's been a busy season for wildfires.</p><p>Bill Donnelly, chief of the New Jersey Forest Fire Service, said that there have been 662 wildfires that have burned 16,572 acres so far this year. That compares to 310 wildfires and 315 acres burned during the same time last year.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:fkummer@inquirer.com\">fkummer@inquirer.com</email> and <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:bmoran@inquirer.com\">bmoran@inquirer.com</email></p><p>RobertMoran215</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHIDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHIDLY2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FN0-9C33-RS5V-R4NT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247246</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"765\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Philadelphia Daily News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 24, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

According to news reporting from Uttarakhand, India, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"We indexed 8,970 scientific publications on forest fires in order to bridge the gap between research and policy discussions on forest fires. Journal articles and conference papers dominated the literature, with an emphasis on environmental science, agricultural and biological sciences, earth and planetary sciences, engineering, and computer science.\" </p><p><br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from G.B. Pant National Institute of Himalayan Environment: \"Research in the field of fire has historically focused on terms such as ''Forest Fire', 'Wildfire'', and 'Deforestation'', but recent trends have highlighted terms such as ''MODIS,'' ''Artificial Intelligence,'' ''Algorithm,'' ''Satellite Data,'' and ''Prediction''. The number of publications has steadily risen, particularly after year 2000, with funding predominantly from the National Science Foundation, National Natural Science Foundation, U.S. Forest Service, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Notable scientific contributions observed from the United States, China, Canada, Spain, Australia, and India. The International Journal of Wildland Fire had the maximum share in published articles among scientific journals, followed by Forest Ecology and Management, Forests, Science of The Total Environment, and Remote Sensing. A variety of aspects of forest fire research have been covered, such as data-driven studies, new discoveries, methodological advances, theoretical applications, and policy implications.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"In spite of our long interrelation with fires, we are lacking a comprehensive mechanism to combat them effectively. A multidisciplinary approach to the collection and analysis of forest fire information could provide an insightful tool for evidence-based policies and practices aimed to address emerging environmental challenges due to forest fire at global scale.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Forest fire management, funding dynamics, and research in the burning frontier: A comprehensive review.

According to news originating from Ankara, Turkey, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Fire detection and extinguishing systems are critical for safeguarding lives and minimizing property damage.\" </p><p><br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Atilim University: \"These systems are especially vital in combating forest fires. In recent years, several forest fires have set records for their size, duration, and level of destruction. Traditional fire detection methods, such as smoke and heat sensors, have limitations, prompting the development of innovative approaches using advanced technologies. Utilizing image processing, computer vision, and deep learning algorithms, we can now detect fires with exceptional accuracy and respond promptly to mitigate their impact. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive review of articles from 2013 to 2023, exploring how these technologies are applied in fire detection and extinguishing. We delve into modern techniques enabling real-time analysis of the visual data captured by cameras or satellites, facilitating the detection of smoke, flames, and other fire-related cues.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Furthermore, we explore the utilization of deep learning and machine learning in training intelligent algorithms to recognize fire patterns and features. Through a comprehensive examination of current research and development, this review aims to provide insights into the potential and future directions of fire detection and extinguishing using image processing, computer vision, and deep learning.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Review of Modern Forest Fire Detection Techniques: Innovations in Image Processing and Deep Learning.
