Natalia and Wyatt, two teens from Portland, Oregon, venture on a short hike which goes awry when a fire breaks out, blocking the trail. Wyatt's wilderness experience and Natalia's aspirations to become a doctor prove to be boons for the people they encounter and join forces with as they are trying to escape. These include a family-Ryan, Lisa, and their toddler, Trask; a man called Darryl and his grandson, Zion; Beatriz and Marco, a young couple; an older woman named Susan; and two men, AJ and Jason. In an escalating accumulation of bad luck that strains credulity, the group members in turn experience extraordinary injuries, health problems, and psychological challenges during the ill-fated journey. Natalia struggles with tragic events from her past that are explained in several interspersed flashbacks. The fast-paced action described through Natalia's anxious but practical third-person voice will initially hook readers, and for those able to suspend their disbelief, it may carry them through the novel. However, the shallow presentation, particularly of the secondary characters, may lessen the title's appeal. Natalia and Wyatt seem to be White by default; there is ethnic diversity in the supporting cast. A frantic and harrowing but predictable tale of group dynamics and survival. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">(Thriller. 12-18)</emphasis></p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Publication Date: </emphasis>2021-01-19</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Publisher: </emphasis>Christy Ottaviano/Henry Holt</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stage: </emphasis>Teen</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ISBN: </emphasis>978-1-250-23406-3</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Price: </emphasis>$17.99</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Author: </emphasis>Henry, April</h></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KIRKUS-2000208391</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KIRKUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:615N-XMH1-DYRM-F18K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"261\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Kirkus Media LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Kirkus Reviews (Print)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30101\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"11\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>November 1, 2020, Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp; Journals</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000022</classCode><className>ADOLESCENTS &amp; TEENS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CET8</classCode><className>GRANDCHILDREN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009EVK</classCode><className>MEDICINE &amp; HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000C47H</classCode><className>WOUNDS &amp; INJURIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX001444</classCode><className>RACE &amp; ETHNICITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp; EVENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GX506</classCode><className>PORTLAND, OR, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS153</classCode><className>OREGON, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The sight of the gleaming silver bird flying overhead and the thought of what it must have been like when hundreds of the twin-engine mainstays of World War II flew across the English Channel on their way to the beaches above Normandy had to be beyond a simple word.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The fact the beloved plane keeps flying and is in good health is also beyond impressive.</p><p>But the single most \"impressive\" thing about the Miss Montana is the lasting memories it has come to symbolize to a continually awestruck group of fans and aviation enthusiasts.</p><p>So as the big bird circled overhead, releasing a small group of parachutists in two momentous passes above Thompson Falls this past Saturday morning, it's easy to see why so many people were shading their eyes and pointing their cameras skyward with each fly by.</p><p>And as the plane, originally a C-47 but later updated to a DC-3, rolled to a stop in front of the group of fans at the T-Falls Airport, an impressive outburst of applause, admiration, nostalgia and love engulfed the tiny airfield and the group of several hundred people who came to see her.</p><p>Saturday's event was organized by local resident Ruth Cheney, a retired Army Colonel who came up with the idea as a way to honor fellow Thompson Falls resident Norm Allen, who flew in C-47s during the D-Day invasion of Europe, and later as a smoke jumper helping battle forest fires throughout the region.</p><p>Colonel Cheney was on hand to honor Allen, a longtime friend, and keep his storied legacy alive. Allen died in 2013.</p><p>\"Norm did it all,\" Cheney said of the highly decorated member of the 17th Airbone Division that was part of the first wave of Allied soldiers to see action in the opening hours of the D-Day assault. \"Everyone who knew him loved him\".</p><p>Cheney and others said Saturday's event was originally planned for three years ago, but the Miss Montana was called to duty at that time to help deliver supplies to disaster victims in Haiti.</p><p>The visit had been scheduled the past two years, but the Co-vid epidemic canceled those plans.</p><p>For aviation fans, the landing was a chance to remember the plane and the many battles it has survived. That included Jonathon Fuetes of Missoula, a current smoke jumper and veteran of several flights in the Miss Montana.</p><p>\"I was fortunate enough to be on the plane a few years ago when we flew in a re-enactment of the Normandy invasion\", Fuentes said following his jump into the blue skies above Thompson Falls. \"I love jumping out of this plane and I was extremely honored to be part of the flyover and jump in Normandy a few years ago\".</p><p>The plane has been used primarily for flying smoke jumpers into otherwise inaccessible forest fire areas, and was the plane that dropped jumpers in the infamous Mann Gulch fire of 1949 that claimed the lives of 13 smoke jumpers.</p><p>In recent years, the plane has served in a promotional and ceremonial roll for an increasing number of events such as the T Falls landing.</p><p>One of those who continues to be impressed with the Miss Montana and its abilities is Al Charters, jump master for a Missoula based smoke jumper group.</p><p>\"That is just a good plane to fly in,\" he said as he emerged from the cabin. \"Very smooth workhorse of a plane\".</p><p>Those comments were echoed by pilot Art Dykstra, who has been at the controls of the Miss Montana for three years.</p><p>\"They built this plane to be tough,\" Dykstra said. \"It is heavy control wise, kind of like a farm truck with no power steering. But it is a joy and honor to fly a plane like this\".</p><p>Like Fuentes, Dykstra said the highlight of being at the controls of the legendary aircraft was flying over the Normandy coast during the re-enactment.</p><p>\"It is already a privilege to fly this plane,\" he said. \"It is also a huge honor. During the re-enactment of the D-Day event, we were one of only 10 planes to drop paratroopers. Imagine what it must have been like to have the skies filled with these other other planes on the morning of the invasion.\"</p><p>Air Force veteran/retiree Charley Owen was on hand Saturday to see the plane up close and personal after having flown in it just once.</p><p>\"I was part of a softball team participating in a tournament at Fairchild Air Force Base (outside of Spokane) and when we won that tournament, we were told we needed to be in Alabama in a couple days if we wanted to compete in the Air Force tournament finals. \"The only plane available at that time was a DC-3 and we found that laying on the floor of the cabin was a better ride than the jump seats,\" he laughed. \"You could get 16 fully armed paratroopers in there so we were able to get the whole team loaded and made the tournament in time\".</p><p>\"Flying in the C-47 was a hell of a ride.\"</p><p>The Miss Montana is currently based at the Missoula Airport where mechanics take pride in keeping her flying.</p><p>Recent Headlines</p><p>___ (c)2022 the Clark Fork Valley Press and Mineral Independent (Plains, Mont.)

Sign up to get our reporting sent straight to your inbox every weekday morning. <br/><br/>For more than 70 years, Smokey the Bear has had the same message for us: Only you can prevent forest fires. <br/>The U.S. Forest Service's Cooperative Forest Fire Prevention Program,[1] also known as the Smokey Bear Program, was created to prevent human-caused wildfires. In Montana, the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation reports 75% of wildfires as human-caused. Montana Free Press talked with experts about the most common things humans do that start wildfires and what people can do to uphold Smokey's message. <br/>Julia Berkey, DNRC's wildfire prevention program manager, said the most common version of human-caused wildfires differs based on where you are in the state. <br/>West of the Continental Divide, campfires are generally the biggest cause for concern and the second most common wildfire ignition source across the state. <br/>Berkey said fire restrictions go into place as the fire season progresses, which put limits on cigarette smoking and the type of campfires people can build on Forest Service land. When stage 1 fire restrictions are established, the first level of restrictions, followed by stages 2 and 3 as needed, campfires are limited to the metal rings found in Forest Service campgrounds. Berkey said those campfire rings are safer than open campfires, and the presence of camp hosts at Forest Service campsites provides extra hands on deck if a fire gets out of hand. <br/> What else you need to know: <br/> 08.15.202208.16.2022  <br/> 08.12.202208.12.2022  <br/> 08.12.202208.12.2022  <br/><br/><br/>Regardless of whether fire restrictions are in place[2], Berkey said a fire should never be left unattended and should be put out before abandoning it. DNRC promotes a 'drown, stir, drown, feel' test, that involves pouring water on the fire, mixing up the embers, watering it again, and doing so until the fire is cold to the touch. <br/>Berkey said in some cases people just pour a bucket on the fire and think it's good to go. The fire might die overnight, Berkey said, but as the next day warms and maybe a breeze picks up, the embers could reignite. <br/>'Be careful and use common sense. If there are restrictions in place, respect those fire restrictions to make sure you can give the firefighters a break.' Patrick Gilchrist, warning coordination meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Glasgow <br/>Burning leaves, tree branches, grass and debris leftover from farming, ranching or gardening is the most common way humans start wildfires across Montana.  <br/>A big reason people choose to burn debris accumulated on their property is part of a fire mitigation strategy that DNRC promotes. Thinning trees and pruning shrubs around homes can decrease the chances of a fire burning to the tops of the trees, where once reached it becomes harder to put out, Berkey said. Prescribed burns on Forest Service land are one way of achieving this goal, but on smaller residential properties, thinning vegetation and burning it in piles is more appropriate. It's not a bad way to reduce risk, Berkey said, but, if done incorrectly, it could increase risk. <br/>Burning piles of debris requires a burn permit during wildfire season,[3] and as fire season intensifies, counties often place bans on getting such a permit. If you do get a permit, Berkey recommends burning earlier in the day, when it's cool and wet, and checking the forecast for any wind that may cause the fire to escape the burn pile. Berkey also recommends burning smaller piles to mitigate any potential bigger fires, and to always have water and a shovel nearby while constantly monitoring the burn pile. As with campfires, Berkey said the fire is only considered out if the debris is cold to the touch. <br/>The most common source of human-started fires east of the Continental Divide, and third most common across the state, is lawn and farm equipment.[4] This can include things like hay equipment hanging loose, striking a rock and producing sparks, or a lawn mower hitting a rock and producing sparks. Dragging trailer chains can strike the road, producing sparks and igniting dry grass on the side of a road. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://montanafreepress.org/mt-fire-report-2022\">https://montanafreepress.org/mt-fire-report-2022</url>/ <br/>Patrick Gilchrist, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Glasgow, said harvesting crops in the early morning or later in the evening can help reduce equipment-caused fires. He also said carrying water or a fire extinguisher can be useful if a small fire does start. <br/>With agriculture the predominant industry in NWS Glasgow's vicinity, which includes northeastern Montana, Gilchrist said these equipment-started fires are common every year. <br/>'Small things, preventative things, can go a long way toward alleviating work of the fire departments,' Gilchrist said. <br/>Fire plays a natural role in the ecosystem, Berkey said, so a fire started by a lightning strike can have some benefits. She added, however, that 'Fire ignited by debris burning with a whole bunch of houses around, it's a lot harder to see the benefits that we get from something like that.' <br/>'Be careful and use common sense,' Gilchrist said. 'If there are restrictions in place, respect those fire restrictions to make sure you can give the firefighters a break.' <br/> Thank you for supporting Montana Free Press.  <br/>We rely on your donations to remain free and independent.

However, certain marketing agencies have helped these mortgage brokers and realtors stay in business through foolproof marketing skills and strategies to expand reach. In Canada, Mortgage On Fire has occupied the top spot in the list of fast-growing agencies in the region.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Mortgage On Fire, run by a team of experts and led primarily by Samad A. Agaria and Asad R. Sagarwala, is a digital marketing agency that helps real estate professionals and mortgage brokers generate more leads on a monthly basis and convert them into clients. So far, the duo has helped many companies and personal brands from all over Canada. Companies like Ontario Lending Solutions and Premier GTA Mortgages are testifying and advocating for the marketing agency, promoting it on social media, and helping it gain fast popularity in many areas of Ontario, especially in Toronto. \u00a0</p><p>The most interesting part of this fast-growing agency is what sets it apart from other real estate and mortgage marketing agencies. According to testimonials and client reviews, Mortgage On Fire is rapidly growing because it underpromises and over-delivers, a concept that is typically found in reverse in most agencies and is a major point of concern for clients. Intelligently, the company has targeted a significant problem for brokers and realtors, solved it, and used it to expand rather quickly. \u00a0</p><p>If their business strategy, as well as marketing solutions, commit to the current growth rate, it won\u2019t be long before Mortgage On Fire becomes the top marketing agency in all of Canada. With word of mouth spreading faster than a forest fire, the agency will have no problems becoming the best in town. More information about the business and its lead generation program are available on its official website and social media handles (LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram).</p><p>For the original news story, please visit\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://prdistribution.com/news/mortgage-on-fire-becomes-one-of-the-fastest-growing-real-estate-mortgage-marketing-agency-in-canada.html\">https://prdistribution.com/news/mortgage-on-fire-becomes-one-of-the-fastest-growing-real-estate-mortgage-marketing-agency-in-canada.html</url></p><p>     Attachment </p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>         Mortgage on Fire Becomes One of The Fastest Growing Real Estate &amp; Mortgage Marketing Agency in Canada       </p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\">Media Company: Mortgage on Fire,  Media Name: Abdul Samad Akhter Agaria,  Media Phone: (416) 901-7594,  Media Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:sam_mortgageonfire@customers.prdistribution.org\">sam_mortgageonfire@customers.prdistribution.org</email>,  Media URL: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mortgageonfire.com\">www.mortgageonfire.com</url></pre></p><p>Mortgage on Fire Becomes One of The Fastest Growing Real Estate &amp; Mortgage Marketing Agency in Canada</p><p/><p>Mortgage on Fire Becomes One of The Fastest Growing Real Estate &amp; Mortgage Marketing Agency in Canada</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRIZNE-8286707</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRIZNE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6379-1691-JDPV-B53F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">222091</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-01-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"466\"/><timeReceived>8:45 AM PT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 GlobeNewswire, Inc.

Our five base camps were spread across the deserts of New Mexico, Utah and Montana, allowing our crews to explore 100 million years of geologic time for dinosaurs and other ancient animals.</p><p>Weather-wise, this was a summer of extremes. We kicked off the season in New Mexico, where we were pummeled by nightly sandstorms amplified by the record drought -- tents were shredded, meals uncooked and patience worn thin. At the famous Crystal Geyser Quarry in central Utah, the mercury spiked to 120 , and we laughingly recorded 100-degree temperatures at midnight, whilst desperately trying to get some shut-eye and stay hydrated. (Our 15-person team went through 40 gallons of drinking water each day!)</p><p>In late July, we moved to the San Rafael Swell in Utah, where severe flash flooding wreaked havoc on the landscape, miring our vehicles, muddying our quarries and producing Mount Olympus-style lightning storms. That same lightning ignited a forest fire by our camp, forcing us to consider the prospect of a hasty middle-of-the-night evacuation. Soon after, a blanket of smoke arrived from the massive fires in California and Oregon, blotting out the sun and enveloping us in a surreal haze.</p><p>The best part of all this extreme weather? Incredible double rainbows abounded, and we watched with awe as they slowly arced over the landscape!</p><p>Fossil-wise, the trip was an enormous success with its own extremes. The team collected 5-foot long sauropod (long-neck) dinosaur ribs lying next to penny-sized bones of feathered dinosaur hatchlings. We discovered the skeletons of duckbill and horned dinosaurs, and their tyrannical predators. We found new species and collected many new bones from old friends.</p><p>Our most unusual find was a dinosaur buried within a volcanic ash layer. The cutest discovery? The remains of a baby Triceratops, unearthed, as usual, as we were packing up to head home. We also collected more than 100 specimens for radiometric dating, chemostratigraphy and paleoclimate reconstructions, adding key data on the Cretaceous Thermal Maximum, one of the hottest intervals in Earth's history. We wrapped up the season with more than 800 specimens in tow and having trained a multitude of graduate and undergraduate students from universities around the United States.</p><p>During our expedition, we invited the public to follow our discoveries through four livestreamed events from the field. We also chronicled our adventures in real time on Twitter and Instagram.</p><p>Now it's time for you, our guests, to be part of the discovery! Visit the Museum to watch the preparation and study of this summer's haul within the glass-walled Paleontology Research Lab on the third floor of the Nature Research Center.</p><p>[Category: Arts/Cultural]</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7619779 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7619779</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63RK-2H41-JC11-1090-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"511\"/><timeReceived>11:17 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>October 1, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Due to COVID-19 restrictions on campus, it was closed temporarily and the artists' talk postponed until Feb. 9 at 1 p.m. Admission is free and open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. except for the holidays.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Clackamas Print had the opportunity to visit the exhibit. Mel Ulven is the mastermind behind the work displayed on the walls of the Alexander Gallery. Ranging from collages to napkin drawings and journal entries, the exhibit tells a story about the past, present and future.</p><p>Ulven was born in Minnesota where he lived with his very large family that consisted of 10 kids until he was 5. He spent the remainder of his childhood in the Willamette Valley. Mel attended art school in Portland and was introduced to black and white art and photography and was drawn into it.\u00a0</p><p>Ulven spent 45 years as a graphic designer, which he described as a precise type of job. Ulven referred to himself as a \"naturally sloppy guy\" and said it was freeing to make colleges in his free time.\u00a0</p><p>\"You can modify and change and go back and peel back and all of that and,\" Ulven said. \"I like the idea of cutting and tearing\".</p><p>\"About Time'' runs through Feb. 25. Photo credit: Jakob Kaiser</p><p>One of the displays that stuck out was the piece titled \"Napkin Drawings.\" This was done around 1998 with pen and ink on airplane napkins done on a long flight back home from Japan. Ulven said they were done in about an hour.\u00a0</p><p>\"I was kind of reacting to what was around me and what was on the TV screen,\" he said. He joked about his flight attendant bringing him more and more napkins as the creativity flowed.</p><p>Another piece in the exhibit called \"Pigs Race for Oreos\" was done for his family. It all started when his wife read an article in the 1990s about how the state fair was feeding Oreos to the pigs as a prize.\u00a0</p><p>Ulven said in his home he keeps a jar of Oreos. \"We always had a jar of Oreos around,\" said Ulven. \"And no one was supposed to take that last Oreo that was always mine until it was filled up again.\"\u00a0</p><p>He said that he had never seen the image of the pigs at the fair so he created it and that's how the collage came about.</p><p>One of the last pieces I got to talk to Ulven about the piece titled \"1-A Day\" created\u00a0 from 2018 to 2020.</p><p>\u00a0\"I love maps,\" he said. \"And I love Google Maps. So I like going to Google and visiting places. You know, you could go to Ukraine and you could zero down and go down the street. It's so cool.\"\u00a0</p><p>He said he likes that they are freeze-framed so you can see all the details.</p><p>Ulven said that sometimes it was kind of interesting to him that he would draw what the Google maps showed then but as time goes on that part of the world looks different.</p><p>\u00a0\"Two guys are walking down the sidewalk. And Google captured them. I think that two years ago, this summer, the town of Paradise burned up in a forest fire in Northern California. So this photo was taken before the fire, and I'm doing the artwork after the fire. So there's a story to be told in there. I don't know that story.\" Ulven shared how interesting it was to him that the picture he drew would be so different if he saw what the town of Paradise looks like now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5212102</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64RN-WP41-DY7P-T493-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"560\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Clackamas Print: Clackamas Community College</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"02\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>February 8, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Oregon City</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>OR</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Flight Attendants</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Nzc5ODQxRDgxOENCNEExNDk4OUVBNTM5NzRCMDA4OEE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDc0QkUxRjIwOENFNDFFM0IyRjk2QzZCRjNCMjkwODU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N611310SS</classCode><className>COLLEGES &amp;

Still, according to local media, China Eastern Airlines has greyed out its logo on its Weibo account and changed its website to black and white as a mark of respect. <br/>According to China's Civil Aviation Administration, officials have dispatched investigators and emergency teams to the scene. <br/>Reports said the incident created a forest fire, which responders have extinguished. <br/>Flight MU5735 was due to depart Kunming at 13:11 local time (05:11 GMT) and arrive in Guangzhou at 15:05. <br/>According to FlightRadar24, the six-year-old airplane traveled at 29,100 feet at 0620 GMT. Data revealed it had dropped to 9,075 feet in just over two minutes and 15 seconds. <br/>Its last tracked altitude was 3,225 feet after another 20 seconds, indicating a vertical plunge of 31,000 feet per minute, FlightRadar24 added. <br/>At the time of the crash, online weather data in Wuzhou showed partly cloudy skies with good visibility. <br/>The last big jet disaster in China occurred in August 2010, when a flight from Harbin crashed in Yichun, killing 42 passengers. <br/>According to state media CCTV (viaLive Mint[4]), Chinese President Xi Jinping was \"shocked\" to learn of the incident. <br/>He ordered China Eastern to coordinate search and rescue efforts and begin an investigation into the cause of the disaster. <br/>The airline declared that it would send staff to the crash scene and that a hotline for family members had been established. <br/>China Eastern Airlines aircrafts sit on the tarmac of the International Airport in Beijing, 09 November 2007. Singapore Airlines and the city-state's Temasek Holdings have signed a final agreement to buy a combined 24 percent stake in China Eastern Airlines, Temasek said 09 November.

Another described the Nairobi round as \"a step\" and voiced hope for further informal meetings before December. <br/>\"We need to continue with the dialogue with the intention to simplify and reduce the brackets (on the disputed issues) and alternatives,\" said Vinod Mathur, head of India's National Biodiversity Authority. <br/>For that to happen, warned Francis Ogwal of Uganda, one of the two co-chairs of the Kenya negotiations, \"there has to be a very big shift of mind in the way we are negotiating\". <br/>Proposals include a global commitment to set aside at least 30 percent of both land and oceans as protected zones by the end of the decade, as well as efforts to cut plastic and agricultural pollution. <br/>But time is running out, with one million species threatened with extinction and tropical forests disappearing, while intensive agriculture is depleting the soil and pollution is affecting even the most remote areas of the planet. <br/> Smokes rise from a forest fire -set and controlled by locals for farming purposes- in the Tambopata region, southern Peruvian jungle on September 01, 2019. Photo: AFP / Ernesto BENAVIDES  <br/>\"It's not any longer an ecological issue only... It is increasingly an issue that affects our economy, our society, our health, our wellbeing,\" Marco Lambertini, director general of WWF International, told a press conference. <br/>\"It is a security issue for humanity.\" <br/>Lambertini accused some countries of using a \"delaying tactic\", pointing the finger at Brazil in particular. Behind the scenes, Argentina and South Africa were also getting the blame. <br/>One of the main stumbling blocks concerns agriculture, particularly targets for a reduction in pesticides and fertilisers. <br/>The European Union wants to see the pesticide issue specifically mentioned in the text, but \"there is little support\" for that position, according to one delegate. <br/>Delegates from the Global South have highlighted the need to produce more, with much of the planet undergoing a major food security crisis, and reject any reference to agroecology, the use of ecological principles in farming. <br/>\"Agriculture is currently responsible for 70 percent of biodiversity loss,\" said Guido Broekhoven of WWF International, adding that it was \"absolutely crucial\" to fix a system where 30 percent of food goes to waste. <br/>Countries are also divided on the issue of the funding needed to implement the biodiversity goals. <br/>Brazil, backed by 22 countries including Argentina, South Africa, Cameroon, Egypt and Indonesia, renewed calls for rich countries to provide at least $100 billion a year until 2030 to help developing countries preserve their rich biodiversity. <br/>The African bloc is also asking for a fund dedicated to biodiversity, according to one country delegate. <br/>Although leaders of 93 countries committed in September 2020 to ending the biodiversity crisis, the issue is struggling to gain as much traction on the international political agenda as climate change. <br/>\"There is also a need to see where our political leaders want us to be,\" said Canada's Basile van Havre, co-chair of the Kenyan talks. <br/>\"We're looking to see who's going to step up to pick up that ball.\" <br/></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

For most privately held businesses, that cycle is tied to the life of the owner. At some point for one reason or another, every business owner must face the fact that their business, as they know it, will cease to exist.      In parts <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wealthmanagement.com/high-net-worth/advising-clients-exit-planning-part-1\">one</url>   and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wealthmanagement.com/high-net-worth/advising-clients-exit-planning-part-2\">two</url>   of this four-part series I laid out the challenges facing business-builder clients that advisors who   take   the initiative to   add value to a client\u2019s company can help them increase profits, lifestyle   and their level of happiness almost immediately, and offered some tips on how to get the exit planning ball rolling. </p><p>  In this installment, we'll   discuss dealing with one of the most common impediments to a successful transition: your client.Advisors have reported that when they begin their planning process it\u2019s common for even the most seemingly economically successful client\u2019s current plan to fall short of their anticipated GPS coordinates.      One prevailing view is that the reason current planning doesn\u2019t match with reality is that many business owners want to transition to the next generation\u2014especially if they themselves are a second or third-generation owner. In this light, business continuity is akin to adding railroad cars to a train. The challenge is that to maintain the railroad, the train must be kept in good operating condition, the tracks cleared   and certain critical events must happen, at times sequentially and with precision. Otherwise, the train can go off the track.      One advisor we interviewed spoke of a client with a $200 million business that was seeking to transition to the next generation. Years earlier, when the first intergenerational transition took place, the company was only worth $18 million. Currently, the family members who lead the company are fixated on repeating their parents\u2019 steps for inter-generational transfer. Before they began exit planning, they hadn\u2019t realized that the transition between their father\u2019s generation and themselves was no longer replicable.      All too often, an exit planner needs to find effective ways to help clients understand that the dynamics at play today are fundamentally different than those of the past. To that end, another advisor recounted a recent meeting with the elderly founder of a business who viewed things very differently than the younger generation.   Often, the lifestyles of the owners are dependent on the continuation of a high level of cash flow. Business builders acknowledge that they often need to increase capital reserves, but if the second-generation transfers ownership to their children, there often isn\u2019t enough cash flow to pay everybody an amount that they are accustomed to receiving. Equally challenging is that when profits are heavily allocated to the generation that is transferring their interests, the business is restricted in its ability to diversify and grow. All of which limits the business value and can significantly reduce the ultimate sales value for a subsequent generation.   Even after 35 years of advising clients, arriving at a point where a $60 million business can\u2019t transition to the next generation without severely impeding its value can be a painful conversation for an advisor to have with a client. But in my experience, it may be the most important conversation to have.   Family Matters   Many years ago, I had a breakthrough. I discovered that it is often necessary to help high-net-worth families understand that what they have built is more than just a business; that they have created a certain lifestyle for themselves that encompasses shared wealth and a shared vision. Understanding that it\u2019s a client\u2019s family that remains at the fulcrum of activity is essential to a shared belief system that what you have created is more than an individual business. In a real sense, a multi-generational business becomes a self-sustaining enterprise.      One way for you to empower a client\u2019s family is to help them develop the vision and mission that want to accomplish. It should be motivating for each subsequent generation to understand that even if the founder of the business has long since passed, they remain part of an enterprising family. That they have capabilities, such seeding capital to form new businesses or to buy other businesses. In speaking with dozens of exit planners, my experience is that most successful family businesses have never even had that conversation.   As one would envision, the sale of a business will often trigger a cascade of emotions for family members. Expert advisors recognize that there are a variety of conversations that need to take place with their clients. There\u2019s a cadence that occurs in undergoing such conversations.      The knowledge which is developed during the exit planning process is not static\u2014it will evolve. It is not mathematically formulaic, such as a set of dominoes whose pattern of events depends materially, functionally and logically on the past.      Leading advisors uniformly suggest that best practices incorporate a routinized, systematic process to identify a litany of key areas to be explored and understood. You as a business owner should recognize that each component of the process is uniquely important.      Seeking Truth   Sean Hutchinson is a partner at RFN Global with a CEPA and CMAA background. He posits that what is most essential for business builders who are looking to transition is \u201cclarity.\"   He   believes that many successful business owners are overwhelmed by a wide spectrum of data. To mitigate the overload, Sean suggests that business owners narrow their transition focus to the things that matter the most to them.      Clients may contemplate business sales for years, with   nary a thought about what matters most to successfully achieve their goals. A powerful role for a client\u2019s exit planning advisor is to help them see through the noise to gain clarity on the strategic business assets they have and, on those that are missing, including resources, information, and conversations that need to be had.   As Sean and his teammates work with a multi-generational family business, they often discover that what gets in the way of clarity is a series of what he calls \u201cmissing conversations.\"   These conversations can be uncomfortable to hold. It\u2019s not uncommon for business owners to do what many of us do during our own lives\u2014they push the difficult conversation off, and in doing so, the problem gets worse   and the issue remains dormant until it later erupts, causing potentially irrevocable damage.   A thoughtful advisor needs to develop finely-honed skills that enable them to identify those missing conversations and then help the owner, their families and their management teams have those conversations. As he states, \u201cit\u2019s only through those conversations that legitimate, durable clarity emerges for the owner and the other stakeholders in their business and personal lives.\"   In retrospect, it\u2019s not uncommon for business owners and management teams to talk about what exit planners call \u201cthe easy stuff.\" These are discussions that center on revenue and earnings, or getting the books in order, instead of discussing big strategy questions like how a cohesive leadership team shows up in the business. Sean says \u201cleaders \u2018bring the weather\u2019 and increases in enterprise value are directly linked to the strength of the executive management team.\"      It\u2019s also possible that as a client\u2019s business grows, it outgrows its current leadership team\u2014which may include the client! Without change, enterprise value can decrease\u2014it is a crucial issue to address, and clients should work with an experienced exit planner/value growth advisor who is skilled enough to encourage thoughtful and incremental change that ultimately benefits them. To get to the next level client may need to replace themselves with a more experienced CEO or COO.   As their trusted advisor need be able to address this road block with your client if it arises. The intersection of these challenging issues and a willingness to put ego aside and seek truth in a way that empowers your client can be one of the most challenging\u2014yet defining moments in their life as a business builder.      As we\u2019ve seen, exit planning may be better described as \u201ctransition planning,\" not simply because of what happens after the sale, but in part because the planning per se demands that your client and their leadership team transition from a    pre-sale mindset to new ways of thinking, and often includes undertaking new activities.      According to Melisa Silverman, it is the serious groundwork that creates the path for enhancement and initiatives that lead to new actions and improvements. \u201cSo that\u2019s where we begin breaking components into ninety-day segments, we actually called them sprints to evoke momentum.\" It\u2019s during these sprints that Melisa helps her clients identify and choose what\u2019s most important and to create a hierarchy of their initiatives.      \u201cClients learn to select the three to five most important initiatives every ninety days. These could be in areas that are crucial to finding the right buyer at the best price, de-risking the company, and so forth. We are trying to make improvements that are going to hit their bottom line to increase the value of their business. That leads to the next ninety-day engagement, and that next engagement can go on for ninety days, or for years. Transitioning can happen as fast or as slow as clients want, but they happen in increments that are designed to add value all along the way.\"   Will They Miss You When You\u2019re Gone?   How many business owners do you know who are comfortable taking a month-long vacation without checking into the office? That would be a rare thing, indeed. The inevitable friction is that many business owners thrive on control, yet also typically seek buyers who at some point will fully transition them out of power.   Entrepreneurs need to dedicate significant time and effort and develop a routinized process that enables their executive team to maximize value at the time of sale. Sometimes this means\u2014and I offer this respectfully\u2014helping a business owner to learn how to get out of his or her own way. It\u2019s important to understand that the characteristics that enable a control-oriented CEO to successfully grow a company may be very different from what\u2019s needed to build an independent, self-reliant leadership team that can run the company.      Such can be the case with companies where the founder creates a \u201clifestyle business.\" I\u2019ve seen many instances where a mid-seven-figure K1 income translates into a business that only sells for a multiple of 1x or 2x because the so-called leadership team neither leads nor functions as a team.   It\u2019s that leadership, according to Joe Seetoo, Senior Vice President at Morton Wealth, that\u2019s needed to carry these businesses through tough times. \u201cLeadership is where the action is right now, you can imagine with inflation, with supply chain, with labor shortages, with all the things that happen every day for owners right now that create a whole bunch of noise for them. The character and quality of the team are going to either get in the way of their success or carry them across the finish line. An owner can\u2019t shoulder this by themselves. If they try, they\u2019re likely to fail. So, we want to give them clarity around the issues that matter the most, depending on where they are and where they want to go.\"   Conversely, it\u2019s the lack of leadership that\u2019s also driving fundamentals in the marketplace. To offset this, a skilled exit planner shapes a narrative for his or her clients where the transition becomes a surmountable challenge. This may include monthly \u201caccountability meetings\" with the CEO, internal executives such as the CFO and COO, and other leaders and external partners such as the CPA where they openly work on developing a leadership team that survives the founder, which is something they may have never done, and where instead they typically meet to put out the forest fire du jour.

In addition, such a plan would aim to improve conditions in long-term care facilities to reduce the number of people sent to the ER or admitted to hospital.</p><p>\"Ultimately, what we're trying to create are more resilient communities,\" Dodd says. \"We can't prevent events from occurring, but when they do occur, we can help our patients and our communities and our colleagues and our system bounce back. And not just bounce back to where it was, but bounce back better.\"</p><p>To fulfill that goal, the study group hopes to host a post-pandemic symposium for emergency response providers across BC and western Canada to review the lessons they learned this time that they may not have absorbed after the dust had settled on the H1N1 virus in 2009.</p><p>\"We need to take the opportunity to look at this because the tendency and the temptation will be, as soon as the pandemic is over, we'll just forget about it -- time to move on to something else,\" he says.</p><p>\"Every crisis is an opportunity... We have opportunities to build networks better. To connect professions -- connect the emergency management profession to the health care profession to the medical profession, specifically.\"</p><p>It was his time with his MADEM cohort that opened his eyes to the possibilities and prompted him to ask the question \"How do physicians get involved in emergency planning?\"</p><p>As for his involvement in the pandemic, when asked how many vaccinations he's administered; he recently checked and, as of the middle of January, the total was almost 6,000.</p><p>Graham Dodd has enough letters after his name to play a game of Wordle. In addition to his MD and MADEM credentials, he also has a special certification in emergency medicine and holds Bachelor and Master of Science degrees in zoology.</p><p>* * *</p><p>JOURNAL link: BC Medical Journal - <url normalizedValue=\"https://bcmj.org/shared-care-covid-19/emergency-preparedness-project-rises-challenge-pandemic-response\">https://bcmj.org/shared-care-covid-19/emergency-preparedness-project-rises-challenge-pandemic-response</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7738142 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7738142</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64RG-RTJ1-JC11-14SK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"703\"/><timeReceived>7:10 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"02\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>February 8, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Click here to view this embed.</p><p>The crew also demonstrated a remotely operated spray system mounted on the building that, in this case, offered two levels of reach and power, controlled by a phone.</p><p>Observers included representatives from Cal Fire, including the deputy director of technology, a wildfire mitigation specialist, several contractors, including one who already has been installing Mighty Fire Breaker's \"Locked-and-Loaded\" spray defense on remodels in the Sierra foothills and elsewhere, and a variety of Rohnert Park firefighters, on-hand in case of a problem.</p><p>Fire Marshal Jim Thompson was among those who allowed that he was \"fairly impressed\" with what he had seen of the technology.</p><p>Two other bystanders, retirees and friends, decided to come \"to see things burn\" after seeing a notice about the event.</p><p>\"It seems to work,\" Cotati resident Greg Wetterman said. \"But I don't know how it would work in a raging forest fire.\"</p><p>Conboy say he's inspired to help save life and property, but also to allow property owners to maintain insurance at a time many companies are pulling coverage in high risk areas.</p><p>But he's also trying to do it in a safe manner.</p><p>\"We do not need another cancer-causing product,\" he said.</p><p>His interest in fire prevention stems from his work in engineered wood products, which he said \"were failing in fires and killing firefighters.\"</p><p>So he started investigating potential new treatments for wood construction that would resist burning and diminish the smoke that is such a killer in catastrophic fires.</p><p>It took him to Malaysia, Germany, Switzerland to consult scientists there, as well as experimentation with environmentally safe chemistry. The result was a biodegradable formulation based on food grade, raw materials derived primarily from corn, as well as things like potassium citrate and xanthan gum, for thickening.</p><p>It's mixed with water, as a delivery system, and manufactured in Ohio (where there's plenty of water) and can be sprayed through a variety of systems targeting different scales of application.</p><p>It does not contain ammonium, phosphates or other chemicals common to fire retardants, and has been undergoing accreditation through the Environmental Protection Agency and other organizations so it can bear labels attesting to its safety, Conboy said.</p><p>\"The reason our chemistry works different than foams and gels is foams and gels dry out and make a mess, and they're good for about three hours,\" he said. \"Ours will defend a month later, bone dry, and doesn't make a mess.\"</p><p>Conboy said the material can actually be sprayed once a season (if it doesn't rain) and still will inhibit fire. Any longer would require polymer ingredients that would harm plant and animal life.</p><p>Conboy said he's inspired to preserve both life and property, but also to work with the insurance industry to find a way for folks to reduce their risk by using his technology so they can remain insured.</p><p>\"What we want is to defend houses so the insurance companies can insure people,\" he said.</p><p>Conboy said he's been training contractors to install the spray systems after doing about 50 himself and is just starting to advertise the technology.</p><p>He said the owner of a 2,500-square-foot home can probably count on spending about $10,000 to have the sprinkler system installed, as well as all the other home hardening that usually goes with it, such as fireproofing vents and decking. If that level of home hardening already is achieved, the Locked-and-Loaded system is likely closer to $5,000 to $7,500.</p><p>You can reach Staff Writer Mary Callahan at 707-521-5249 or <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:mary.callahan@pressdemocrat.com\">mary.callahan@pressdemocrat.com</email> On Twitter @MaryCallahanB.</p><p>___ (c)2022 The Press Democrat (Santa Rosa, Calif.)

Click here to view this embed.</p><p>The crew also demonstrated a remotely operated spray system mounted on the building that, in this case, offered two levels of reach and power, controlled by a phone.</p><p>Observers included representatives from Cal Fire, including the deputy director of technology, a wildfire mitigation specialist, several contractors, including one who already has been installing Mighty Fire Breaker's \"Locked-and-Loaded\" spray defense on remodels in the Sierra foothills and elsewhere, and a variety of Rohnert Park firefighters, on-hand in case of a problem.</p><p>Fire Marshal Jim Thompson was among those who allowed that he was \"fairly impressed\" with what he had seen of the technology.</p><p>Two other bystanders, retirees and friends, decided to come \"to see things burn\" after seeing a notice about the event.</p><p>\"It seems to work,\" Cotati resident Greg Wetterman said. \"But I don't know how it would work in a raging forest fire.\"</p><p>Conboy say he's inspired to help save life and property, but also to allow property owners to maintain insurance at a time many companies are pulling coverage in high risk areas.</p><p>But he's also trying to do it in a safe manner.</p><p>\"We do not need another cancer-causing product,\" he said.</p><p>His interest in fire prevention stems from his work in engineered wood products, which he said \"were failing in fires and killing firefighters.\"</p><p>So he started investigating potential new treatments for wood construction that would resist burning and diminish the smoke that is such a killer in catastrophic fires.</p><p>It took him to Malaysia, Germany, Switzerland to consult scientists there, as well as experimentation with environmentally safe chemistry. The result was a biodegradable formulation based on food grade, raw materials derived primarily from corn, as well as things like potassium citrate and xanthan gum, for thickening.</p><p>It's mixed with water, as a delivery system, and manufactured in Ohio (where there's plenty of water) and can be sprayed through a variety of systems targeting different scales of application.</p><p>It does not contain ammonium, phosphates or other chemicals common to fire retardants, and has been undergoing accreditation through the Environmental Protection Agency and other organizations so it can bear labels attesting to its safety, Conboy said.</p><p>\"The reason our chemistry works different than foams and gels is foams and gels dry out and make a mess, and they're good for about three hours,\" he said. \"Ours will defend a month later, bone dry, and doesn't make a mess.\"</p><p>Conboy said the material can actually be sprayed once a season (if it doesn't rain) and still will inhibit fire. Any longer would require polymer ingredients that would harm plant and animal life.</p><p>Conboy said he's inspired to preserve both life and property, but also to work with the insurance industry to find a way for folks to reduce their risk by using his technology so they can remain insured.</p><p>\"What we want is to defend houses so the insurance companies can insure people,\" he said.</p><p>Conboy said he's been training contractors to install the spray systems after doing about 50 himself and is just starting to advertise the technology.</p><p>He said the owner of a 2,500-square-foot home can probably count on spending about $10,000 to have the sprinkler system installed, as well as all the other home hardening that usually goes with it, such as fireproofing vents and decking. If that level of home hardening already is achieved, the Locked-and-Loaded system is likely closer to $5,000 to $7,500.</p><p>You can reach Staff Writer Mary Callahan at 707-521-5249 or <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:mary.callahan@pressdemocrat.com\">mary.callahan@pressdemocrat.com</email> On Twitter @MaryCallahanB.</p><p>___ (c)2022 The Press Democrat (Santa Rosa, Calif.)

Fire officials said crews will begin taking advantage of the calmer weather to conduct back burns near the lake to expand the control lines, the Record Searchlight reported.</p><p>\"We're going to hold it. It's going to be done this week,\" Bret Gouvea, chief of CalFire's Shasta-Trinity unit, said at a community meeting Saturday night.</p><p>Initial assessments found that 131 homes and other buildings had burned, CalFire said. That number was likely to change as teams go street by street surveying the destruction.</p><p>Authorities have arrested a 30-year-old woman on suspicion of starting the blaze that erupted Wednesday and grew explosively in hot and gusty weather in the region about 200 miles northeast of San Francisco.</p><p>Alexandra Souverneva, of Palo Alto, was charged Friday with felony arson to wildland with an enhancement because of a declared state of emergency in California, Shasta County District Attorney Stephanie Bridgett said.</p><p>Souverneva pleaded not guilty. She is also suspected of starting other fires in Shasta County and throughout the state, Bridgett said. It wasn't immediately known if she has an attorney who could speak on her behalf.</p><p>The Fawn Fire has charred more than 13 square miles of heavy timber.</p><p>It's the latest destructive blaze to send Californians fleeing this year. Fires have burned more than 3,750 square miles so far in 2021, destroying more than 3,200 homes, commercial properties and other structures.</p><p>Those fires include a pair of big forest blazes burning for more than two weeks in the heart of giant sequoia country on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada. More than 1,700 firefighters battled the KNP Complex Fires, which covered 70 square miles by Sunday.</p><p>Nearby, the Windy Fire grew significantly Saturday as it made uphill runs and winds blew embers that ignited spot fires. The blaze ignited by lightning on Sept. 9 has scorched 122 square miles of trees and brush on the Tule River Indian Reservation and in Sequoia National Forest. Containment shrunk from 5% to 2% Sunday.</p><p>A historic drought in the American West tied to climate change is making wildfires harder to fight. It has killed millions of trees in California alone. Scientists say climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELHLD-4749504</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELHLD2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63PW-0911-DYWP-807K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">156396</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"500\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Woodward Communications, Inc.

Had we stayed another 30 seconds it would have burned us,' a Pallini resident who lost his car and shed to the flames told ERT television. <br/>'The civil protection authority was late in alerting us,' he said. <br/>France scrambled water-bombing planes and hundreds more firefighters to combat wildfires that were being fed by hot swirling winds [Bob Edme/AP Photo] <br/>In France, firefighters brought twin blazes[2] near the southwestern city of Bordeaux under control. <br/>Temperatures of more than 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) over previous days have spelled misery for millions and shattered heat records. <br/>Cooler air swept in Wednesday, bringing relief to people from Portugal to Britain, but thousands of firefighters continued to tackle blazes that have broken out in multiple countries after months of drought-like conditions. <br/>'Our assessment is generally positive. The situation improved overnight,' French fire service spokesman Arnaud Mendousse told AFP from the southwestern Gironde region where two huge blazes have engulfed 20,600 hectares (50,900 acres) of tinder-dry forest since last week. <br/>Record heat <br/>The heatwave saw a new all-time record for Britain where the national weather service clocked 40.3C (105F) in eastern England, surpassing the previous high set in 2019. <br/>Grassland fires erupted on Tuesday on the edge of London, with one forcing the evacuation of 14 people as farm buildings, houses and garages were consumed by the flames. <br/>Sixteen firefighters were injured around the capital with two taken to hospital, the London Fire Brigade said. <br/>'Yesterday was the busiest day for the fire service in London since the second world war,' the city's Mayor Sadiq Khan told Sky News on Wednesday, urging the public to remain vigilant despite temperatures now falling. <br/>Khan also accused the Conservative leadership candidates vying to succeed Prime Minister Boris Johnson of ignoring the 'elephant in the room' that is climate change. <br/>Hundreds of firefighters were also deployed in western Slovenia Wednesday to battle a blaze that forced the evacuation of several villages, emergency services said. <br/>The blaze broke out Tuesday in the spectacular wooded Karst region, where vegetation was dried up by the strong heat, and intensified Wednesday afternoon because of the wind. <br/>Residents were forced to flee their homes in several areas and emergency sirens were sounded. <br/>Climate demonstrators triggered a lengthy tailback on Britain's busiest motorway encircling London on Wednesday as they sought to highlight the need for greater action to reduce greenhouse gases responsible for global heating. <br/>Members of the group Just Stop Oil climbed gantries over the M25 motorway, causing police to intervene. <br/>'This is the moment when climate inaction is truly revealed in all its murderous glory for everyone to see: as an elite-driven death project that will extinguish all life if we let it,' the activist group said in a statement. <br/>A fire burns during a heatwave, in Rainham, east London, UK [Tony O'Brien/Reuters] <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/18/record-heatwave-europe-uk-france-spain-wildfires\">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/18/record-heatwave-europe-uk-france-spain-wildfires</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/18/forest-fire-forces-thousands-more-people-out-of-homes-in-france\">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/18/forest-fire-forces-thousands-more-people-out-of-homes-in-france</url></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

It will be conducted between 1000 and 1630 today and will be no more than one acre in size. They will be utilizing a small portion of Starr Unit 22 on the NW corner of Bear Valley for this exercise.</p><p>* Emigrant Creek Ranger District - No burning over the upcoming weekend. The district will assess an additional 200 acres in Silvies 7 to burn next week, once the temperature and relative humidity come into prescription.</p><p>* Prairie City Ranger District -The district will consider burning 1-3 acres in Merit 8 for Prairie City's guard school/rookie training just west of Logan Valley the week of June 14.</p><p>For the safety of firefighters and the public, roads and areas of prescribed fire activity will be signed. Please avoid these areas so as not to interfere with ongoing operations. For safety, roads, trails and areas may need to close temporarily as firefighter operations are taking place. Smoky conditions may also reduce visibility to a level that would require additional temporary closures. During prescribed fire operations, there is potential for impacts to camping and hunting. Hunters are advised to plan ahead, for their safety they should not camp in or near an area of prescribed fire activity.</p><p>Spring operations reduce surface fuels, increase height of some canopy, reduce small tree densities, and help promote fire resilient trees, thereby improving our ability to protect communities from wildfire. Additionally, these prescribed fires improve wildlife habitat, promote long-term ecosystem integrity and sustainability by reducing the risk of high-severity wildland fire.</p><p>All prescribed burn activity is weather and condition dependent.</p><p>With the potential for smoke to settle in certain areas during active operations, the public can monitor the smoke and air quality in our area and across the state by visiting, <url normalizedValue=\"http://oregonsmoke.blogspot.com/\">http://oregonsmoke.blogspot.com/</url>.</p><p>Additional information regarding prescribed burning on the Malheur National Forest is available on InciWeb at <url normalizedValue=\"https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7426/\">https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7426/</url> or by viewing the Prescribed Fire Activity interactive map at USFS R6 Tri-Forest Prescribed Fire Map.

Images of flames racing toward a French beach and Britons sweltering - even at the seaside - have driven home concerns about climate change.</p><p>The U.K. Met Office weather agency registered a provisional reading of 104.5 degrees Fahrenheit at Coningsby in eastern England - breaking the record set just hours earlier. Before Tuesday, the highest temperature recorded in Britain was 101.7 F, set in 2019. By later afternoon, 29 places in the UK had broken the record.</p><p>As the nation watched with a combination of horror and fascination, Met Office chief scientist Stephen Belcher said such temperatures in Britain were \"virtually impossible\" without human-driven climate change.</p><p>He warned that \"we could see temperatures like this every three years\" without serious action on carbon emissions.</p><p>The sweltering weather has disrupted travel, health care and schools. Many homes, small businesses and even public buildings, including hospitals, in Britain don't have air conditioning, a reflection of how unusual such heat is in the country better known for rain and mild temperatures.</p><p>The intense heat since Monday has damaged the runway at London's Luton airport, forcing it to shut for several hours, and warped a main road in eastern England, leaving it looking like a \"skatepark,\" police said. Major train stations were shut or near-empty Tuesday, as trains were canceled or ran at low speeds out of concern rails could buckle.</p><p>London faced what Mayor Sadiq Khan called a \"huge surge\" in fires because of the heat. The London Fire Brigade listed 10 major blazes it was fighting across the city Tuesday, half of them grass fires. Images showed several houses engulfed in flames as smoke billowed from burning fields in Wennington, a village on the eastern outskirts of London.</p><p>Sales of fans at one retailer, Asda, increased by 1,300%. Electric fans cooled the traditional mounted troops of the Household Cavalry as they stood guard in central London in heavy ceremonial uniforms. The length of the changing of the guard ceremony at Buckingham Palace was shortened. The capital's Hyde Park, normally busy with walkers, was eerily quiet - except for the long lines to take a dip in the Serpentine lake.</p><p>\"I'm going to my office because it is nice and cool,'' said geologist Tom Elliott, 31, after taking a swim. \"I'm cycling around instead of taking the Tube.''</p><p>Ever the stalwart, Queen Elizabeth II carried on working. The 96-year-old monarch held a virtual audience with new U.S. ambassador Jane Hartley from the safety of Windsor Castle.</p><p>A huge chunk of England, from London in the south to Manchester and Leeds in the north, remained under the country's first \"red\" warning for extreme heat Tuesday, meaning there is danger of death even for healthy people.</p><p>Such dangers could be seen in Britain and across Europe. At least six people were reported to have drowned while trying to cool off in rivers, lakes and reservoirs across the U.K. In Spain and neighboring Portugal, hundreds of heat-related deaths have been reported in the heat wave.</p><p>Climate experts warn that global warming has increased the frequency of extreme weather events, with studies showing that the likelihood of temperatures in the U.K. reaching 40 C (104 F) is now 10 times higher than in the pre-industrial era.</p><p>The head of the U.N. weather agency expressed hope that the heat gripping Europe would serve as a \"wake-up call\" for governments to do more on climate change. Other scientists used the milestone moment to underscore that it was time to act.</p><p>\"While still rare, 40C is now a reality of British summers,\" said Friederike Otto, Senior Lecturer in Climate Science at Imperial College London's Grantham Institute for Climate Change. \"Whether it will become a very common occurrence or remains relatively infrequent is in our hands and is determined by when and at what global mean temperature we reach net zero.\"</p><p>Extreme heat broiled other parts of Europe, too. In Paris, the thermometer in the French capital's oldest weather station \u00e2 \" opened in 1873 \u00e2 \" topped 40 C (104 F) for just the third time. The 40.5 C (104.9 F) measured there by weather service Meteo-France on Tuesday was the station's second-highest reading ever, topped only by a blistering 42.6 C (108.7 F) in July 2019.</p><p>Drought and heat waves tied to climate change have also made wildfires more common and harder to fight.</p><p>In the Gironde region of southwestern France, ferocious wildfires continued to spread through tinder-dry pines forests, frustrating firefighting efforts by more than 2,000 firefighters and water-bombing planes.</p><p>Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated from homes and summer vacation spots since the fires broke out July 12, Gironde authorities said.</p><p>A smaller third fire broke out late Monday in the Medoc wine region north of Bordeaux, further taxing resources. Five camping sites went up in flames in the Atlantic coast beach zone where blazes raged around the Arcachon maritime basin famous for its oysters and resorts.</p><p>In Greece, a large forest fire broke out northeast of Athens, fanned by high winds. Fire Service officials said nine firefighting aircraft and four helicopters were deployed to try to stop the flames from reaching inhabited areas on the slopes of Mount Penteli, some 25 kilometers (16 miles) northeast of the capital. Smoke from the fire blanketed part of the city's skyline.</p><p>But weather forecasts offered some consolation, with temperatures expected to ease along the Atlantic seaboard Tuesday and the possibility of rains rolling in late in the day.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELHLD-4944035</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELHLD2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6606-B2B1-DYWP-82R4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">156396</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1006\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Woodward Communications, Inc.

Today, we know that among all human organs, it is most like a heart that beats and circulates humidity, through its many rivers and its rain. Along with the Cerrado\u2014the Brazilian savanna\u2014it guarantees climate stability for the South American continent. It is also a key element of global carbon accounting. According to the Greenhouse Gas Emission and Removal Estimating System (<url normalizedValue=\"https://plataforma.seeg.eco.br/total_emission\">Seeg</url>) initiative, deforestation and land use changes were responsible for 43 percent of Brazilian emissions in 2020. Forest restoration of degraded areas represents one of the best possible solutions to combat climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today the situation of most of the Amazon rainforest, including the BrazilianAmazon, is tragic. Deforestation runs rampant, reaching more than <url normalizedValue=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2022/05/amazon-deforestation-surges-in-april/\">13,000 square kilometers</url> in 2021, driven by predatory agricultural practices, organized crime and illegal mining. After years of a pandemic, as well as economic and political crises, Amazonians live in a situation of vulnerability and insecurity.</p><p>In this very difficult context, the world needs to look at the Amazon forest. Both because of the social and environmental war there, but also because it is the place where such great climate solutions can be built. In a world that is currently consuming its last years of relative climate stability, it is urgent to bet massively on these solutions.</p><p>When looking at the Amazon from above, green patches of protected territories appear. Anyone who thinks that the forests have remained there because the lands are said to be \"protected\" or because government agencies have specific responsibilities there would be wrong. These territories are only preserved today because Indigenous populations live there, being the main actors in this protection.</p><p>The state of Mato Grosso, in the south of the Amazon, is an important laboratory that demonstrates the strength and potential of Indigenous populations as a solution to climate change. In it live 43 Indigenous groups, occupying 116 territories and more than 200,000 square kilometers of forests. Forty-three ethnic groups, 43 languages, 43 ways to think about the word and 43 cosmologies.</p><p>But despite that and despite having several symbols of indigenism in its territory, such as the Kayapo leadership itself\u2014the great Chief Raoni\u2014Mato Grosso is not known worldwide for its Indigenous cultural diversity. It is known much more for its agriculture. After all, in 2020, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.imea.com.br/imea-site/dashboards?c=4&amp;d=1136863500319006720\">it produced more than 36 million</url> tons of soy, had more than <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.imea.com.br/imea-site/dashboards?c=2&amp;d=1136865063632576512\">30 million heads of cattle</url> and according to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.escolhas.org/wp-content/uploads/Gold-under-the-microscope-more-than-200-tons-of-brazilian-gold-are-potentially-illegal.pdf\">Instituto Escolhas</url>, had a quarter of the gold extracted illegally in the BrazilianAmazon from 2015 to 2020.</p><p>It is in this territory where challenges presented by competing land use models are apparent\u2014that the role of Indigenous populations has emerged strongly. With the support of several partners from civil society, from governments and from the international community, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/fepoimt_oficial/\">State Federation of Indigenous People and Organizations (FEPOIMT)</url> has supported Indigenous peoples with <url normalizedValue=\"https://remmt.com.br/index.php/pt/subprogeamas-2/item/54-territorios-indigenas\">fund raising</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8qLUT_dQbs\">emergency actions during the pandemic</url>, has defended their rights <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.olhardireto.com.br/noticias/exibir.asp?id=470208&amp;noticia=entidades-afirmam-que-pl-do-governo-ameaca-27-areas-indigenas-em-mato-grosso&amp;edicao=1\">in the State Assembly</url> and in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.leiagora.com.br/noticia/61944/indigenas-de-mato-grosso-participam-do-acampamento-terra-livre-em-brasilia\">the federal Congress</url>, as well as invested in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2022/06/09/une-mediation-judiciaire-proposee-a-casino-accuse-de-contribuer-a-la-deforestation-en-amazonie_6129595_3244.html\">litigation outside Brazil</url>.</p><p>The example of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/fepoimt_oficial/\">FEPOIMT</url>is far from unique, as there are several other state federations such as<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/fepipa_oficial/\">FEPIPA</url> (Federation of Indigenous Peoples of the State of Par\u00e1),<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/apoianp/\">APOIANP</url> (Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Amap\u00e1 and Northern Par\u00e1), or regional federations such as<url normalizedValue=\"https://coiab.org.br/\">COIAB</url> (Coordination of Indigenous Organizations in the BrazilianAmazon) and national as the<url normalizedValue=\"https://apiboficial.org/\">APIB</url>(Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil).</p><p>Compared to traditional Indigenous organizations, FEPOIMT is quite new. It was founded in 2017 based on a clear vision from Mato Grosso's Indigenous people: that even if a federation model was very different from traditional Indigenous governance, they needed an institution that could act at the state level to defend their interests. When the Mato Grosso government began to negotiate international support for REDD+\u2014the U.N. acronym for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation\u2014based on the reduction of deforestation in the state between 2004 and 2014, FEPOIMT was able to clearly state the rights of Indigenous people to obtain part of these resources.</p><p>To guarantee this right, a<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.icv.org.br/projeto_especial/rem-mt-subprograma-territorios-indigenas/\">12-month process of consultation</url>was organized by FEPOIMT to define collectively with 42 of the 43 Indigenous groups how to share the benefits of REDD+ through the <url normalizedValue=\"https://remmt.com.br/index.php/pt/\">Early Movers Program</url> established with the support of Germany and the U.K. Today this program is present in almost all the Indigenous territories of Mato Grosso with projects supporting local food production and economical activities, planting and protecting forests, as well as strengthening governance among the different groups.</p><p>The threats against forests and against the people that defend them are still there. Other solutions are needed to ensure that the state of law prevails. But who better than empowered Indigenous people to monitor and support the state for the law enforcement that needs to happen?</p><p>In a world that is increasingly anxious about climate change\u2014increasingly questioning the effectiveness of solutions\u2014it is necessary to repeat and reaffirm this principle: Powerful solutions already exist and these solutions are not receiving the necessary level of support. We urgently need to have more Indigenous voices at the negotiating table, more resource flowing to strengthen these Indigenous voices, and greater support on the ground to guarantee their well-being.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Crisanto Rudz\u00f6 Tseremey'w\u00e1 is president of FEPOIMT, the Mato Grosso Federation of Indigenous people and Indigenous organizations and is also the traditional chief of the Xavante community Tres Maria.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Alice Thuault is executive director of Instituto Centro de Vida (ICV) and has been working for more than 15 years in the Brazilian Amazon.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The views expressed in this article are the writers' own.</emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2081011/fire-brazil.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Fire in Brazil</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>CARL DE SOUZA/AFP via Getty Images</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>A firefighter works to put out a large forest fire in Porto Jofre, Pantanal, Mato Grosso state, Brazil, on Sept. 5, 2021.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWKCOM-1726109</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWKCOM2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6601-XCK1-JBR6-92K1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472435</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1001\"/><timeReceived>8:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright \u00a9 2022 Newsweek Inc.

Fire officials said crews will begin taking advantage of the calmer weather to conduct back burns near the lake to expand the control lines, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.redding.com/story/news/2021/09/26/fawn-fire-grows-less-than-100-acres-overnight/5874722001/\">the Record Searchlight reported.</url></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to hold it. It\u2019s going to be done this week,\u201d Bret Gouvea, chief of CalFire's Shasta-Trinity unit, said at a community meeting Saturday night.</p><p>Initial assessments found that 131 homes and other buildings had burned, CalFire said. That number was likely to change as teams go street by street surveying the destruction.</p><p>Authorities have arrested a 30-year-old woman on suspicion of starting the blaze that erupted Wednesday and grew explosively in hot and gusty weather in the region about 200 miles (322 kilometers) northeast of San Francisco.</p><p>Alexandra Souverneva, of Palo Alto, was charged Friday with felony arson to wildland with an enhancement because of a declared state of emergency in California, Shasta County District Attorney Stephanie Bridgett said.</p><p>Souverneva pleaded not guilty. She is also suspected of starting other fires in Shasta County and throughout the state, Bridgett said. It wasn\u2019t immediately known if she has an attorney who could speak on her behalf.</p><p>The Fawn Fire has charred more than 13 square miles (34 square kilometers) of heavy timber.</p><p>It\u2019s the latest destructive blaze to send Californians fleeing this year. Fires have burned more than 3,750 square miles (9,712 square kilometers) so far in 2021, destroying more than 3,200 homes, commercial properties and other structures.</p><p>Those fires include a pair of big forest blazes burning for more than two weeks in the heart of giant sequoia country on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada. More than 1,700 firefighters battled the KNP Complex Fires, which covered 70 square miles (181 square kilometers) by Sunday.</p><p>Nearby, the Windy Fire grew significantly Saturday as it made uphill runs and winds blew embers that ignited spot fires. The blaze ignited by lightning on Sept. 9 has scorched 122 square miles (317 square kilometers) of trees and brush on the Tule River Indian Reservation and in Sequoia National Forest. Containment shrunk from 5% to 2% Sunday.</p><p>A historic drought in the American West tied to climate change is making wildfires harder to fight. It has killed millions of trees in California alone. Scientists say climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-68fb036974f4c0bf6203d752978ee89720210926</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63PH-GYF1-JC5B-G48R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"516\"/><timeReceived>5:36 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 26, 2021 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

How limited? The \"test to treat\" program might as well have been called the \"Minute Clinic program\" because it appears to target CVS Minute Clinics. There are more than 1,100 CVS Minute Clinics in 33 states, fewer than 100 Walgreens' VillageMD programs and a handful of other pharmacy sites (including a few independents) where a prescriber is on-site. Altogether, it's likely that less than 3 percent of pharmacies could do \"test to treat\" as described by the White House. Not exactly a convenient way for consumers to access a COVID-19 treatmentespecially one where timely treatment is of the essence.</p><p>The solution to this would have been for the FDA to include pharmacists as prescribers when they granted emergency use authorization for the current two antivirals, molnupiravir and Paxlovid, to treat COVID-19. FDA has told us about concerns they have with pharmacists having access to lab values such as renal function that are important considerations when prescribing these drugs. It's true that pharmacists don't always have ready access to the patient's latest lab values, but neither do some urgent care clinics or convenient care clinics. There are ways to identify patients who may have compromised renal function and protocols that could be put in place for pharmacists to refer patients if they have concerns. FDA could still do a course correction but, at least for now, the public health good they could have done in this area has been unrealized.</p><p>Speaking of missing an opportunity, NCPA has been critical in the press and with CMS of health plans paying insultingly meager dispensing fees for oral antiviralsciting Prime Therapeutics, the PBM for many BlueCross/Blue Shield plans, as one of the worst offenders for initially paying pharmacies only a dollar for the pharmacist to perform drug and disease interaction checks and to work with the physician on the proper prescribing.</p><p>(Let me break in here for an important announcement. We all know how ridiculous these reimbursements are, and we have to let legislators, the public, and the media know too. NCPA has launched an advocacy and public awareness effort by creating a website that will post your story. This strategy localizes the narrative to specific legislative districts and the public can relate to a story that's in their own back yard. Lots of pins on a map are a great way to get a legislator's attention. Please take a few minutes to tell your story multiple times with multiple cases if you like. Remember: this kind of effort only works if hundreds of you participate. Tell your story here.)</p><p>This week, Express Scripts finally decided to boost their anemic dispensing fee to $12 - two months after the omicron surge peaked in the U.S. Likewise, Prime Therapeutics now offers $8. That's like showing up to put out a forest fire with a garden hose. Too little, too late.</p><p>The Biden administration needs to do better in this area. Make sure that patients have convenient access to COVID-19 treatments to help keep them alive and out of the hospital. Open up \"test to treat\" to all pharmacies and add oral antivirals to the list of COVID-19 treatment options that pharmacists have the authority to prescribe. During his speech, the president said the government has ordered more than a million \"pills\" from Pfizer (Paxlovid). That's wonderful. But if those \"pills\" can't get to the patients in a timely manner to all parts of the country, they can't work their magic. Mr. President, don't limit \"test to treat.\" Expand it to include pharmacists so they can work theirs.</p><p>Best,</p><p>B.

(AP) \u2014 Firefighters were gaining the upper hand Sunday on a forest fire that displaced thousands of people and destroyed more than 100 buildings near Shasta Lake in Northern California.</p><p>Lighter winds and cooler temperatures slowed the Fawn Fire as it moves toward the shores of California's largest man-made lake and away from populated areas north of the city of Redding, allowing crews to increase containment to 35%, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said in a statement.</p><p>The fire at one point threatened 9,000 buildings, but the number dropped to 2,340 on Sunday.</p><p>Light rain was in the forecast for Monday. Fire officials said crews will begin taking advantage of the calmer weather to conduct back burns near the lake to expand the control lines, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.redding.com/story/news/2021/09/26/fawn-fire-grows-less-than-100-acres-overnight/5874722001/\">the Record Searchlight reported.</url></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to hold it. It\u2019s going to be done this week,\u201d Bret Gouvea, chief of CalFire's Shasta-Trinity unit, said at a community meeting Saturday night.</p><p>Initial assessments found that 131 homes and other buildings had burned, CalFire said. That number was likely to change as teams go street by street surveying the destruction.</p><p>Authorities have arrested a 30-year-old woman on suspicion of starting the blaze that erupted Wednesday and grew explosively in hot and gusty weather in the region about 200 miles (322 kilometers) northeast of San Francisco.</p><p>Alexandra Souverneva, of Palo Alto, was charged Friday with felony arson to wildland with an enhancement because of a declared state of emergency in California, Shasta County District Attorney Stephanie Bridgett said.</p><p>Souverneva pleaded not guilty. She is also suspected of starting other fires in Shasta County and throughout the state, Bridgett said. It wasn\u2019t immediately known if she has an attorney who could speak on her behalf.</p><p>The Fawn Fire has charred more than 13 square miles (34 square kilometers) of heavy timber.</p><p>It\u2019s the latest destructive blaze to send Californians fleeing this year. Fires have burned more than 3,750 square miles (9,712 square kilometers) so far in 2021, destroying more than 3,200 homes, commercial properties and other structures.</p><p>Those fires include a pair of big forest blazes burning for more than two weeks in the heart of giant sequoia country on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada. More than 1,700 firefighters battled the KNP Complex Fires, which covered 70 square miles (181 square kilometers) by Sunday.</p><p>Nearby, the Windy Fire grew significantly Saturday as it made uphill runs and winds blew embers that ignited spot fires. The blaze ignited by lightning on Sept. 9 has scorched 122 square miles (317 square kilometers) of trees and brush on the Tule River Indian Reservation and in Sequoia National Forest. Containment shrunk from 5% to 2% Sunday.</p><p>A historic drought in the American West tied to climate change is making wildfires harder to fight. It has killed millions of trees in California alone. Scientists say climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-68fb036974f4c0bf6203d752978ee89720210926</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63PH-H001-JC5B-G48Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"517\"/><timeReceived>5:36 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 26, 2021 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Her daughters left school to save money, but still the family fell behind in their household expenses. All Baby could afford was one dialysis treatment each week. Eventually, even that became too costly. She stopped going for treatment, and died shortly after.</p><p>Vivek Jha, a nephrologist and executive director of the George Institute for Global Health, India, in New Delhi, contrasts Baby\u2019s story with that of another of his patients: a 25-year-old roadside vendor with end-stage kidney disease. Jha told the man that his best bet for survival was a kidney transplant, but the father of two young children couldn\u2019t afford it. \u201cWe thought he\u2019d be another one of those who\u2019d go home and die,\u201d says Jha. Instead, some of the vendor\u2019s colleagues asked Jha what they could do to help. The money they raised, combined with financing from local philanthropists and a kidney donated by the man\u2019s mother, allowed him to get the surgery he needed.</p><p>Part of Nature Outlook: Chronic kidney disease</p><p>The average life expectancy of someone with end-stage kidney disease \u2014 also known as kidney failure \u2014 is around 15 years with a kidney transplant (it can be longer or shorter, depending on whether the kidney is from a living donor or not). Life expectancy for a person receiving dialysis is 5\u201310 years on average. Those who receive neither will die in less than a month. Transplantation, dialysis or death are the only options for people with kidney failure. Which of the three someone experiences is, by and large, determined by where they live, their socio-economic status, their education and their race. For end-stage kidney disease, the stakes are high and the equity gap is deep.</p><p>In most countries, organs from both living and deceased donors are in short supply. Dialysis, therefore, is the most common option for someone with kidney failure, and it\u2019s far from ideal. Peritoneal dialysis uses a catheter in the abdomen to passively infuse solution over the course of at least eight hours. It\u2019s usually done at home overnight, and requires storage space for the dozens of boxes of solution needed for a month of treatment, as well as a consistent power supply, a sanitary area for treatment and access to running water.</p><p>The alternative approach, haemodialysis, uses a machine to remove blood, filter it and then reinfuse the clean blood. The process requires the recipient to have surgery to create vascular access. Although this active process can be done faster and less often than peritoneal dialysis \u2014 three times a week for about four hours at a time \u2014 it is usually done at a dialysis centre and can leave people feeling exhausted for hours afterwards. In countries such as the United States that have few social safety nets, those hours also result in time away from work and lost wages, often requiring people to make difficult choices between their physical and financial security.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The rich get healthier</emphasis></p><p>Varying wealth and health-care systems mean that countries tend to funnel people with kidney failure down different paths. In lower-income countries, that path is often conservative management: few or no dialysis centres and exorbitant treatment expenses mean that end-stage kidney disease is usually an imminent death sentence. Research has shown that only 1 in 100 people in sub-Saharan Africa who start dialysis will still be receiving treatment a year later1. Often they don\u2019t realize that they\u2019re signing up for a long-term commitment, Jha says. In some places, the time and cost of travelling to a free clinic can be too much for people to maintain. Many people travel great distances, thinking they\u2019re headed towards a one-time, curative procedure. \u201cWhen they get there, they realize that there is no cure,\u201d Jha adds. \u201cThey will start dialysis, but very soon they realize that it\u2019s not sustainable and they will drop off and die.\u201d</p><p>In low- and lower-middle-income countries, kidney disease is the leading cause of \u2018catastrophic health expenditure\u2019 \u2014 when the medical spending of a household exceeds a certain threshold of capacity to pay. Almost everyone with kidney disease who receives accessible and sustainable treatment lives in high- or upper-middle-income countries2. Only around 7% of those who have access to dialysis and receive regular treatments are in low- or lower-middle-income countries, even though some of these countries are more populous than higher-income countries and have similar or higher rates of kidney disease compared with the rest of the world.</p><p>Even within upper-middle- and high-income countries, equity gaps persist. People with similar disease receive different treatments, and have different fates. This can depend not only on the country\u2019s health-care system \u2014 private insurance compared with universal health care, or a focus on transplantation rather than dialysis \u2014 but also on the person\u2019s location, their support network, their socioeconomic status, their race and their ethnicity.</p><p>\u201cIn any country, even if things are free, you have to depend on peoples\u2019 health literacy and the safety they feel in accessing the health care system,\u201d says Adeera Levin, executive director of BC Renal in Vancouver, Canada, an organization that oversees the care and allocation of kidney services in British Columbia. \u201cAnd in any illness, the more resources you have as an individual \u2014 be they financial, intellectual or support services \u2014 then the more likely you are to do well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn British Columbia, for instance, health care is free but we have a diverse geography,\u201d says Levin, who is also a nephrologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. \u201cIf you have to travel 100 miles to see a specialist, you\u2019re not going to get the same care as if you have to travel three blocks.\u201d</p><p>The United States has a different set of equity issues, mainly because its system of private health insurance means that those without coverage slip through the cracks. There is no universal coverage for preventing or delaying progression; only once someone has been diagnosed with kidney failure does the government step in, with Medicare \u2014 a federal programme for those over 65 or with certain disabilities \u2014 covering the cost of dialysis 90 days after starting treatment.</p><p>Many think, however, that this approach, is like trying to use a garden hose to put out a forest fire \u2014 it\u2019s too little, too late. Interventions that can slow the progression of kidney disease, such as regular exercise, kidney-friendly diets, specific medications, and controlling blood glucose and blood pressure, are most effective when started earlier in the course of the disease. \u201cAll of the important stuff happens before you get on dialysis,\u201d Levin says. In countries such as Canada that have universal health care, the system is set up to provide care every step of the way. \u201cIf you have kidney disease and you\u2019re progressing, you get care,\u201d Levin says, although she notes that there are geographical and socio-cultural limitations. The US approach of waiting until the end stages of disease to guarantee care \u201cabsolutely scuppers people from getting any prevention\u201d, she says.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Silent killer</emphasis></p><p>Even in countries that aim to detect kidney disease early, many people don\u2019t receive treatment until their disease has progressed. \u201cKidney disease doesn\u2019t give any specific symptoms until it\u2019s too late in the game,\u201d says Tushar Vachharajani, an interventional nephrologist at Wayne State University School of Medicine in Detroit, Michigan. It is, he says, \u201ca silent killer\u201d.</p><p>End-stage renal disease is typically defined as kidney function of less than 15% of typical levels. But people often don\u2019t show symptoms until their kidney function has declined to below 20%. Such late symptom onset means that people without health insurance or regular care are less likely to be diagnosed and treated in time to prevent progression.</p><p>In the United States, those with the worst care are consistently people of colour. Research has shown that US dialysis facilities in communities where most residents are Black or Hispanic have poorer outcomes than would otherwise be expected3, regardless of the individual\u2019s race and ethnicity, says nephrologist Deidra Crews, deputy director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Equity in Baltimore, Maryland. Crews thinks that factors at the community level probably have an important role \u2014 these could be limited access to other health care, healthy foods, services that support stable housing, or something else.</p><p>More from Nature Outlooks</p><p>When it comes to preventing the progression of kidney disease, Crews says, it\u2019s clear that consistent health care makes a difference. An unintentional experiment for this exists in data from Medicaid \u2014 a public health-insurance programme for low-income individuals in the United States, and one that varies between states. A few years ago, with federal government funding, some states chose to expand their Medicaid coverage under legislation known as the Affordable Care Act. Crews points out that people who began their dialysis regime while living in states with this expanded Medicaid coverage had better survival than did those in states that did not expand4. Although the underlying reasons aren\u2019t fully understood, the fact that these people have access to care before starting dialysis means that they are better positioned to maintain treatment. \u201cWe know that having coverage prior to dialysis initiation makes a difference,\u201d Crews says.</p><p>Accessing dialysis can also be difficult for certain populations because it depends on factors that physicians often neglect to ask about, Crews says. Many people do not have a regular place to sleep, for example, or have little family or community support, or consistent access to food, let alone healthy options. \u201cWe make all sorts of recommendations for diet to people with end-stage kidney disease, but it\u2019s almost impossible to follow that diet when you have a low income and you aren\u2019t even sure when you\u2019ll get a meal,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a vicious cycle, because then people get labelled as non-compliant for the kidney-failure diet and are not considered eligible for things like transplantation.\u201d</p><p>In an ideal world, one with universal access to preventive care, physicians could catch kidney disease early and slow its progress. Until then, dialysis remains a stop-gap solution \u2014 prolonging survival until donor organs become available. Dialysis is expensive, costing countries a disproportionate amount of their health-care budgets relative to the small number of people who need it. It\u2019s also available only to those with the resources to access it and maintain that access, multiple times each week.</p><p>Until there are better medical options, Crews says, it\u2019s essential to improve people\u2019s access to care before the onset of kidney failure. Researchers are also looking to improve affordable access to dialysis for low-income individuals and countries. Back at the George Institute for Global Health, India, Jha and his colleagues are testing a portable, low-cost dialysis machine that they are aiming to get into clinics as soon as possible. They hope that by telling Baby\u2019s story they can raise both awareness and funding, and that she and countless others will not have died in vain.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related Content</emphasis></p><p>Researchers tackle chronic kidney disease</p><p>SGLT2 inhibitors breathe life into kidney-disease care</p><p>Stop denying kidney transplants to non-citizens</p><p>Confronting racial and ethnic disparities in diabetic kidney disease</p><p>How organoids are advancing the understanding of chronic kidney disease</p><p>Could implantable artificial kidneys end the need for dialysis?</p><p>The genetic revolution transforming kidney disease</p><p>Chronic kidney disease: highlights from research</p><p>Sponsor feature: CKD is a hidden threat, but the treatment landscape is evolving</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><p>[1].Ashuntantang, G.. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Lancet Glob.

Here's how climate change drives these events. </p><p><br/>HOTTER, MORE FREQUENT HEATWAVES <br/>Climate change makes heatwaves hotter and more frequent. This is the case for most land regions, and has been confirmed by the U.N.'s global panel of climate scientists (IPCC). <br/>Greenhouse gas emissions from human activities have heated the planet by about 1.2 Celsius since pre-industrial times. That warmer baseline means higher temperatures can be reached during extreme heat events. <br/>\"Every heatwave that what we are experiencing today has been made hotter and more frequent because of climate change,\" said Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London who also co-leads the World Weather Attribution research collaboration. <br/>But other conditions affect heatwaves too. In Europe, atmospheric circulation is an important factor. <br/>A study in the journal Nature this month found that heatwaves in Europe have increased three-to-four times faster than in other northern mid-latitudes such as the United States. The authors linked this to changes in the jet stream - a fast west-to-east air current in the northern hemisphere. <br/>FINGERPRINTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE <br/>To find out exactly how much climate change affected a specific heatwave, scientists conduct \"attribution studies\". Since 2004, more than 400 such studies have been done for extreme weather events, including heat, floods and drought - calculating how much of a role climate change played in each. <br/>This involves simulating the modern climate hundreds of times and comparing it to simulations of a climate without human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. <br/>For example, scientists with World Weather Attribution determined that a record-breaking heatwave in western Europe in June 2019 was 100 times more likely to occur now in France and the Netherlands than if humans had not changed the climate. <br/>HEATWAVES WILL STILL GET WORSE <br/>The global average temperature is around 1.2C warmer than in pre-industrial times. That is already driving extreme heat events. <br/>\"On average on land, heat extremes that would have happened once every 10 years without human influence on the climate are now three times more frequent,\" said ETH Zurich climate scientist Sonia Seneviratne. <br/>Temperatures will only cease rising if humans stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Until then, heatwaves are set to worsen. A failure to tackle climate change would see heat extremes escalate even more dangerously. <br/>Countries agreed under the global 2015 Paris Agreement to cut emissions fast enough to limit global warming to 2?C and aim for 1.5?C, to avoid its most dangerous impacts. Current policies would not cut emissions fast enough to meet either goal. <br/>A heatwave that occurred once per decade in the pre-industrial era would happen 4.1 times a decade at 1.5?C of warming, and 5.6 times at 2?C, the IPCC says. <br/>Letting warming pass 1.5?C means that most years \"will be affected by hot extremes in the future,\" Seneviratne said. <br/>CLIMATE CHANGE DRIVES WILDFIRES <br/>Climate change increases hot and dry conditions that help fires spread faster, burn longer and rage more intensely. <br/>In the Mediterranean, that has contributed to the fire season starting earlier and burning more land. Last year more than half a million hectares burned in the European Union, making it the bloc's second-worst forest fire season on record after 2017. <br/>Hotter weather also saps moisture from vegetation, turning it into dry fuel that helps fires to spread. <br/>\"The hotter, drier conditions right now, it just makes [fires] far more dangerous,\" Copernicus senior scientist Mark Parrington said. <br/>Countries such as Portugal and Greece experience fires most summers, and have infrastructure to try to manage them - though both have received emergency EU help this summer. But hotter temperatures are also pushing wildfires into regions not used to them, and thus less prepared to cope. <br/>CLIMATE CHANGE ISN'T THE ONLY FACTOR IN FIRES <br/>Forest management and ignition sources are also important factors. In Europe, more than nine out of 10 fires are ignited by human activities, like arson, disposable barbeques, electricity lines, or littered glass, according to EU data. <br/>Countries, including Spain, face the challenge of shrinking populations in rural areas, as people move to cities, leaving smaller workforces to clear vegetation and avoid \"fuel\" for forest fires building up. <br/>Some actions can help to limit severe blazes, such as setting controlled fires that mimic the low-intensity fires in natural ecosystem cycles, or introducing gaps within forests to stop blazes rapidly spreading over large areas. <br/>But scientists concur that without steep cuts to the greenhouse gases causing climate change, heatwaves, wildfires, flooding and drought will significantly worsen. <br/>\"When we look back on the current fire season in one or two decades' time, it will probably seem mild by comparison,\" said Victor Resco de Dios, professor of forest engineering at Spain's Lleida University. <br/></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

The fire extinguisher can work, but it is not designed to put out a forest fire-sized pandemic.</p><p>See this realistic evaluation of the problems that will be facing us as we move to provide vaccinations to Americans: \"I Was a Military COVID Planner. The Vaccine Rollout Is Going to Be a Nightmare.\"</p><p>Resources are constrained, even in the military. When you talk about priority inoculations for medical personnel and first responders, in the military it also means the entire fighting force needs to be protected in order to be able to project our military power (hopefully not in Iran) wherever it is needed. Remember the aircraft carrier coronavirus cases from earlier in the year?</p><p>As Kris Alexander rightly points out, it is the medical system here in the states that is woefully unprepared to care for sick people in normal circumstances and now [my thinking] is being totally overwhelmed with the current surge. Today, Wednesday, we just passed 250,000 deaths from COVID-19. Yet some people think that COVID-19 is still a hoax, even when they are on their deathbed.</p><p>For more on military support to civil authorities, see this TV interview I did a number of years ago.

Those fires tend to be on a smaller scale, burning about an acre each, and Mr. Taylor noted those wildfires result from the burning of forests' understory, which are the small shrubs and trees between the forest canopy and floor.</p><p>The largest fire in recent memory was the 16-mile fire near Cresco, Monroe County, in 2016 that burned through more than 8,000 acres of forest and cost emergency services $2 million to extinguish.</p><p>Mr. Taylor said the size of the wildfires in Pennsylvania wouldn't match the ferocity and danger of the millions of acres burning in the western U.S. because Pennsylvania's wet climate prevents massive flame spread. But, he added that due to warming temperatures and human influence, the state could experience big fires in the future.</p><p>Climate extremes, which scientists say have become less predictable, could prompt the drought and extreme heat that dries up the state's dense undergrowth and could serve as the fuel and kindling to a wildfire in the region.</p><p>\"We are seeing and expecting more drying, drought and heat waves through our summers, and there's a logical link between drought, drying, heat, flammability and therefore fire that can occur,\" said Meg Krawchuk, a fire ecologist and an associate professor at Oregon State University.</p><p>\"There's a number of ways that, within [Pennsylvania's] geography, there is a reason for concern of how fire could change with climate change,\" she added. Wildfires soaring</p><p>According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the frequency and severity of wildfires have soared since the mid-1980s.</p><p>Those forest fires are not limited to the United States. In London, some thought England was fire resistant due to its high precipitation and climate. Still, multiple wildfires broke out across the city last month amid a record-breaking heat wave that was only worsened by climate change.</p><p>Lee Hendricks, a hydrologist at the National Weather Service, said Pittsburgh experienced two of its rainiest seasons during the past five years in 2018 and 2019 when there were 57.83 and 52.46 inches of precipitation, respectively. He explained those totals are well above the area's average of 39.61 inches of precipitation.</p><p>Scientists say those highs are due to climate change, which is increasing the amount of rainfall across the Northeast. However, Mike Kern, the state's chief forest fire warden, said that precipitation growth is \"deceptive\" because the amount of rain happens at a larger scale with longer, hotter dry spells between rainy periods.</p><p>\"Climate is going to push toward the extremes here. So what happens when the pendulum swings the other way, and we get an extreme drought because our vegetation has not adapted to deal with that kind of weather? It's adapted to deal with regular precipitation,\" Mr. Kern said.</p><p>In Pennsylvania, forest fires are most likely to occur during the driest season in the late spring and early autumn months, Mr. Kern said.</p><p>The National Park Service reported that about 85% of wildfires are started by humans, with the other fires starting through lightning or overheating. But in Pennsylvania, 99% of wildfires are caused by people, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.</p><p>Mr. Kern warned that \"there's more population mixed in the wild areas. So even a small fire here can impact somebody's house ... or property or lives because there's more population and spread that spread throughout the area.\"</p><p>He added that the population living in the woods and the number of fire departments sprinkled throughout the state means fires that flare up can be quickly identified and extinguished.</p><p>The Pennsylvania DCNR recommends prescribed fires, or controlled burns, that can mitigate the scale of wildfires by removing old undergrowth and growing young trees.</p><p>However, some critics have concerns. With rising dry spells and increasing temperatures, they say those prescribed fires could become out-of-control blazes.</p><p>In New Mexico, a prescribed fire by federal officials turned into the largest wildfire in the state's history, scorching more than 500 square miles and hundreds of homes. But their prescribed burn failed to account for climate change-related variables that worsened the out-of-control burn through, according to a Washington Post report.</p><p>Forestry and fire experts said those large-scale Western fires are not realistic in Pennsylvania. Still, while the foliage in the state is accustomed to wetter seasons, with hotter weather and more extended dry periods, those plants are more susceptible to burns in the dry spring and autumn seasons.</p><p>Ryan Reed, a natural resource program specialist in the Bureau of Forestry at the DCNR, said state officials are taking added measures to protect the forests from climate change.</p><p>Disrupting invasive species, protecting native species and preserving the forests' biodiversity through assisted migration - where scientists introduce foliage more apt to deal with climate change - can help build resilient forests, Mr. Reed said.</p><p>He emphasized that reducing humans' environmental impact is the best way to prevent nature's erosion.</p><p>Mr. Reed encouraged individuals to be sure to completely extinguish their fires and call the appropriate fire and forest authorities to report any forest fires they see.</p><p>As climate change continues to put the state's forests at risk, Mr. Reed said mitigation measures must be a collaborative effort between residents and officials to protect the forests.</p><p>\"[Climate] changes just aren't occurring in a predictable way, so the idea is to expect the unexpected,\" Mr. Reed said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Mattie Neretin/Post-Gazette: The fire barometer sign indicates low danger Friday in McCandless.

I'm begging you; please stop.</p><p>I have work early tomorrow morning, and I need to sleep, but all I can do is lie here in despair as I bake in these temperatures and curse the wakeful sunlight. Surely I'm not alone in my suffering. The lower mainland is a densely populated area, and all of us are recommended seven or more hours of sleep per night - which is very hard to do when you keep cranking up the heat like that. You've perfected your smolder, and it's melting us and our thermometers alike.</p><p>I agree, your style is fantastic. Those bold choices of cut and colour, the way you've decided to wear your hair, and those new pieces of jewelry- stunning! All of them! You're glowing bright enough to put the sun to shame, and it's a gigantic problem. Just yesterday I saw a sunflower blooming in June! This is not supposed to happen for another month. You're throwing the ecosystem way off. Think of the impact this will have on nature. It'll be chaos. There'll be an excess of flowers, the bugs won't know what to do, and the bees will probably make too much honey.</p><p>These temperatures are way too hot, and we are simply not prepared to deal with it. It'll be like the forest fire season of a few years ago, but with smoky eyeliner instead of actual smoke clogging the air. Just a disaster, overall. Next thing you know, you'll be drawing in hunky firefighters from all over the province, all very concerned about forest safety. And what a conundrum that will cause! The shortage of available firefighters will throw the calendar industry into complete disarray, and they may even need to resort to publishing lewd photos from the firefighters' neglected counterparts; paramedics. Sexy paramedic calendars. Charming, I'm sure, but it doesn't quite hit the same.</p><p>I understand how difficult lockdown has been, and how excited we may all be to really own our place in the world, but please- think of the consequences. We've already lost the frosted tips to this heat, and I fear for what's next.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5038202</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6362-9YF1-JBSN-30PX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"386\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Peak: Simon Fraser</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 16, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Van Couver</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>Canada</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>N621399OG</classCode><className>PARAMEDICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D5IA</classCode><className>INSECTS &amp; ARACHNIDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001785</classCode><className>VACCINES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0008X9G</classCode><className>POPULATION DENSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>N621399OG</classCode><className>PARAMEDICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001785</classCode><className>VACCINES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000CA0Z</classCode><className>THERMAL SENSORS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

URP's work has never been more necessary than during the rising tide of overdose deaths taking place during the current coronavirus-induced crisis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In mid-November, the New York Timesreportedthat more than 100,000 Americans died during the period of April 2020 to April 2021. The tragic factor is that these fatalities were not due to coronavirus-related symptoms but drug overdoses.</p><p>While overdose deaths have been an existing crisis for years now, the new report reflected a staggering 30% year-over-year increase. That equates to 22,000 more deaths than the 78,000 reported between the Aprils of 2019 and 2020.</p><p>New York Times reporter Roni Caryn Rabin explained that the new statistic came from \"federal researchers\" who also pinned the dramatic increase on three factors, in particular. Rabin defined these as \"lost access to treatment, rising mental health problems and wider availability of dangerously potent street drugs.\"</p><p>This trio of causes has not been lost on the staff at United Recovery Project. URP is a luxury addiction treatment program that was co-founded by Bryan Alzate, the current CEO who has over 13 years in recovery himself.</p><p>Alzate and his team have watched the events unfold with alarm. They're well aware of the rising mental health crisis. Alzate has also gone on record \u2014 via press releases as well as his podcast,Hell Has an Exit\u2014 regarding how much increasing regulation hasimpacted the opioid crisis.</p><p>Regarding the availability of dangerously potent street drugs, the owner, along with many others, identifies the extremely dangerous synthetic Fentanyl as the primary culprit, detailing that \"the days of doing opiates for 20 years are over. There aren't any more old heroin addicts like there were in the 70s. People are trying opiates and now they are dead within three years unless they get clean. Fentanyl has shortened the life expectancy of an entire generation\"</p><p>While many are quick to point out the dangers of the ongoing overdose crisis, Alzate's operation is one of the few bright spots that is actuallydoing something to address the issue.</p><p>\"My job is to spark the flame in the addict who doesn't think he can,\" encourages the URP CEO, adding, \"That's what I focus on. Little Sparks all over the world. Not trying to put out a forest fire. I'm focused on starting my own fire.\"</p><p>As we head into another holiday season marked by dampened expectations, economic struggles, and ongoing pandemic woes, URP remains a bright spot in a landscape shrouded in darkness. However, it remains in the hands of addicts and their loved ones to take that first step toward recovery before time runs out.</p><p>About United Recovery Project: URP was founded in 2016 in Hollywood, Florida. The addiction treatment program prides itself on offering an all-inclusive selection of programs that can be tailored to each client's needs. URP is in the process of expanding to other states as well, where it hopes to offer ongoing substance abuse help to those who need it as well as their loved ones.

Greg Abbott tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday, according to his office, who said the Republican is in good health and experiencing no symptoms.</p><p> Abbott, who was vaccinated in December and has refused calls to reinstate mask mandates as the highly contagious delta variant surges in Texas, was isolating in the governor's mansion in Austin and receiving monoclonal antibody treatment, spokesman Mark Miner said in a statement. He is at least the 11th governor to test positive for the virus since the pandemic began, according to a tally by The Associated Press.</p><p> The positive test comes a day after Abbott, who has seldom been seen wearing a mask in public recently, did not wear one while speaking indoors near Dallas to a crowded room of GOP supporters, most of whom were older and unmasked. Video posted by his campaign shows the governor mingling with attendees as they gathered around him taking pictures.</p><p> &lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;House Democrats planning to hold budget vote next week&lt;/span&gt;</p><p> WASHINGTON - Top Democrats plan House votes next week on a budget resolution that could clear a path for future passage of a $3.5 trillion, 10-year social and environment package, suggesting a showdown ahead with rebellious party moderates.</p><p> Nine centrists have threatened to vote against their own party's budget blueprint, enough to defeat it in the closely divided House. They want the chamber to first approve a separate $1 trillion bill financing highway, water supply and other infrastructure projects, their top priority.</p><p> If all Republicans oppose the budget as expected, Democrats could lose no more than three of their own votes and prevail. The budget's congressional approval would prevent Republicans from killing the subsequent $3.5 trillion bill, probably this fall, from bill-killing Senate filibusters.</p><p> &lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;Forest fire forces thousands to flee in French Riviera&lt;/span&gt;</p><p> LA GARDE-FREINET, France - French President Emmanuel Macron said firefighters have been able to \"stabilize\" the blaze that raced Tuesday through forests near the French Riviera, forcing thousands of people to flee homes, campgrounds and hotels in a picturesque area beloved by residents and tourists alike.</p><p> The wildfire started Monday evening about 24 miles inland from the coastal resort of Saint-Tropez. Fueled by powerful seasonal winds coming off the Mediterranean, the fire had spread across 12,000 acres of forest by Tuesday morning, according to regional administration.</p><p> Some 6,000 people were evacuated from homes and a dozen campgrounds while others were locked down in a holiday center for Air France employees. At least 22 people suffered from smoke inhalation or minor fire-related injuries and two firefighters were among the injured, officials said.</p><p> Wildfires have swept across the Mediterranean this summer, leaving areas in Greece, Turkey, Italy, Algeria and Spain in smoldering ruins.</p><p> -&lt;!--p:tag--&gt; From wire reports&lt;!--p:tag--&gt;</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RCHTMD-RIC00370838840C9C35A4588C470020210818</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0EABABE4B16DC41B RCHTMD2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63D5-V4W1-JBCN-43K0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">152567</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"520\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Richmond Newspapers, Inc.

The sky in Athens was once again covered in smoke. <br/>\"The fire front is large and the winds in the area are very strong,\" Thanasis Avgerinos, the deputy governor of East Attica region told AFP. <br/>\"This is a very flammable pine-covered area.\" <br/> Firefighters are battling to keep the flames away from a national park in the Sounion area, as it will then be extremely difficult to control the blaze. <br/>Meanwhile, another forest fire broke out in Vilia, Attica, about 60 kilometres (40 miles) northwest of Athens, prompting the mobilisation of air and ground forces. <br/>Authorities have called for the evacuation of at least four nearby villages, while another 40 firefighters were battling the blazes, according to a firefighting official. <br/> Scores of firefighters battled fresh blazes in Greece Monday, including near the village of Markati, near Athens Photo: AFP / Angelos Tzortzinis  <br/>The fires come on the heels of blazes in recent weeks that have destroyed homes, property, pine forests, wildlife and livestock across more than 1,000 square kilometres (386 square miles) of land. <br/>The island of Evia, 200 kilometres northeast of Athens, has paid the heaviest price with more than half of the land burned. <br/>The Peloponnese peninsula, 200 kilometres west of Athens, as well as the northern suburbs of the capital, were also heavily affected by about 600 fires. <br/>Those blazes were finally brought under control on Friday. <br/>Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the fires offered a dire warning. <br/>\"The climate crisis tells us everything must change,\" he said last week. <br/>As global temperatures rise, heatwaves are predicted to become more frequent and intense, and their impacts more widespread, scientists say. <br/>Meanwhile, Deputy Civil Protection Minister Nikos Hardalias, who has been coordinating the fire-fighting efforts, suffered an \"ischaemic episode\" and underwent a successful heart operation, the hospital treating him said in a statement on Monday afternoon. <br/>The minister, 52, will remain at the cardiological clinic for monitoring, it said. <br/>Secretary General for Civil Protection, Vassilios Papageorgiou, will step in until Hardalias recuperates, according to a statement by the Greek Civil Protection department. <br/></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Several other villages and a nearby nursing home received evacuation orders.</p><p>On Wednesday, a shift in the winds drove the flames towards Vilia, 60 kilometers (37 miles) from Athens. Greek media said several outlying buildings were damaged, but no injuries were reported and no evacuation order was issued for the village.</p><p>Clouds of smoke obscured the sun, which cast an otherworldly, orange light over the capital.</p><p>Local mayor Christos Stathis told Open TV that the fire was within a few dozen yards from Vilia, and appealed for firefighting aircraft to be deployed to the spot.</p><p>Hundreds of wildfires have burned across Greece this month, fueled by parched forests and shrubland from the country\u2019s most severe heat wave in decades.</p><p>The blazes have stretched the country\u2019s firefighting capabilities to the limit, leading the government to appeal for international help, including through a European Union emergency response system. About two dozen European and Middle Eastern countries responded, sending planes, helicopters, vehicles and hundreds of firefighters.</p><p>The causes of the fires have not been officially established, although more than a dozen people have been arrested on suspicion of arson.</p><p>State ERT TV reported that a 14-year-old boy was arrested Wednesday in central Greece on suspicion of setting at least 13 fires in recent days \u2014 including one that raged out of control destroying homes and forest land. Quoting local officials, ERT said the suspect was caught on CCTV cycling away from spots where fires had started. The boy's parents were arrested for neglect, ERT said.</p><p>Intense heat and wildfires have also struck other Mediterranean countries. Firefighters in France worked to contain a forest fire along <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/europe-business-fires-forests-5f16e1fe10d9b8c14dd16a83a39da30c\">the French Riviera</url> on Tuesday, and recent wildfires have killed at least 75 people in Algeria and 16 in Turkey. Worsening drought and heat have also fueled wildfires in the western United States and in Russia\u2019s northern Siberia region.</p><p>Greece\u2019s fire department said 430 firefighters, including 143 from Poland, were deployed at the Vilia fire on Wednesday, along with 130 vehicles, 19 helicopters and 10 planes. The army, volunteer firefighters and local authorities also provided assistance.</p><p>By midday Wednesday, an estimated 7,500 hectares (18.500 acres) of forest had been destroyed in the area.</p><p>Satellite imagery from Tuesday showed a giant plume of smoke from the Vilia fire extending south for hundreds of kilometers along the entire length of the Peloponnese.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow AP's coverage of climate issues at <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/climate-change\">https://apnews.com/hub/climate-change</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-d2bcbeee296a6bac90c06ea25b92fbc520210818</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63D5-C8R1-JC5B-G12J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"489\"/><timeReceived>7:06 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 18, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Several other villages and a nearby nursing home received evacuation orders.</p><p>On Wednesday, a shift in the winds drove the flames towards Vilia, 60 kilometers (37 miles) from Athens. Greek media said several outlying buildings were damaged, but no injuries were reported and no evacuation order was issued for the village.</p><p>Clouds of smoke obscured the sun, which cast an otherworldly, orange light over the capital.</p><p>Local mayor Christos Stathis told Open TV that the fire was within a few dozen yards from Vilia, and appealed for firefighting aircraft to be deployed to the spot.</p><p>Hundreds of wildfires have burned across Greece this month, fueled by parched forests and shrubland from the country\u2019s most severe heat wave in decades.</p><p>The blazes have stretched the country\u2019s firefighting capabilities to the limit, leading the government to appeal for international help, including through a European Union emergency response system. About two dozen European and Middle Eastern countries responded, sending planes, helicopters, vehicles and hundreds of firefighters.</p><p>The causes of the fires have not been officially established, although more than a dozen people have been arrested on suspicion of arson.</p><p>State ERT TV reported that a 14-year-old boy was arrested Wednesday in central Greece on suspicion of setting at least 13 fires in recent days \u2014 including one that raged out of control destroying homes and forest land. Quoting local officials, ERT said the suspect was caught on CCTV cycling away from spots where fires had started. The boy's parents were arrested for neglect, ERT said.</p><p>Intense heat and wildfires have also struck other Mediterranean countries. Firefighters in France worked to contain a forest fire along <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/europe-business-fires-forests-5f16e1fe10d9b8c14dd16a83a39da30c\">the French Riviera</url> on Tuesday, and recent wildfires have killed at least 75 people in Algeria and 16 in Turkey. Worsening drought and heat have also fueled wildfires in the western United States and in Russia\u2019s northern Siberia region.</p><p>Greece\u2019s fire department said 430 firefighters, including 143 from Poland, were deployed at the Vilia fire on Wednesday, along with 130 vehicles, 19 helicopters and 10 planes. The army, volunteer firefighters and local authorities also provided assistance.</p><p>By midday Wednesday, an estimated 7,500 hectares (18.500 acres) of forest had been destroyed in the area.</p><p>Satellite imagery from Tuesday showed a giant plume of smoke from the Vilia fire extending south for hundreds of kilometers along the entire length of the Peloponnese.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow AP's coverage of climate issues at <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/climate-change\">https://apnews.com/hub/climate-change</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-d2bcbeee296a6bac90c06ea25b92fbc520210818</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63D5-C6Y1-DYMD-60VC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"488\"/><timeReceived>7:06 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 18, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

We encourage other forestry businesses to join us in the rebuilding of these resource-dependent communities.\u201d</p><p>The company is reaching out to the Nlaka'pamux Nation Tribal Council/Lytton First Nation, the municipal government and regional district, and province to coordinate the donation with those authorities, ensuring the donation goes where it\u2019s most needed and arrives at the right time. Teal Jones is also planning to contact community organizations about supporting their rebuilding in the communities.</p><p>The donated lumber will come from BC\u2019s working forests, and be sawn in Teal Jones\u2019 local mills.</p><p>Teal Jones has experienced fires at mills and woodlands in the past \u2013 perhaps the most significant about 20 years ago when campers violating a campfire ban near Boston Bar caused a significant forest fire that destroyed a large timber supply area. The company was able to recover with support from suppliers and employees.</p><p>About Teal Jones:</p><p>Teal Jones is BC\u2019s largest privately-owned coastal forestry company. A family-owned value-added manufacturer, the company employs more than 1,000 people directly in woods and sawmill operations across B.C., plus numerous contractors and service providers \u2013 many in remote communities where few other employment options exist. The company\u2019s Surrey mill site and headquarters supports more than 500 jobs across eight specialized milling operations, giving the company the flexibility to ensure every log arriving at the site is directed to its highest-value potential. Teal Jones has invested and committed to investing $60-million in its primary Surrey site since 2019 to strengthen its value-added manufacturing in British Columbia. The company ensures 100 per cent of every log it mills is used, with sawdust and chips directed to partners in pulp, paper, and biofuel production.</p><p>For more information visit tealjones.com</p><p>Media contact:Shawn <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Hallshawn@apogeepr.ca604-619-7913\">Hallshawn@apogeepr.ca604-619-7913</email></p><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRIZNE-8278943</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRIZNE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6349-NJB1-F15X-21JT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">222091</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-01-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"430\"/><timeReceived>10:27 AM PT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 GlobeNewswire, Inc.

Through innovative investment solutions, including patient and flexible financing, the Zero Gap Fund is helping its diverse and growing portfolio overcome traditional market barriers while delivering impact. The new report highlights the impact of the Fund's eight investments, including two new additions in 2021 that are showing strong momentum in closing the racial wealth gap in the United States.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Launched in partnership with the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and its flagship Catalytic Capital Consortium (C3), ZGF's mandate is focused on financial innovation - namely, showing how new investment solutions can overcome traditional market barriers to channel critical financing to impact-driven investments at scale and unlock nascent market opportunities long ignored by private investors.</p><p>The past year has been a period of unprecedented challenge and dislocation around the globe, yet also a time of resilience and determination. Our collective response to the Covid-19 pandemic and its many ongoing shocks called for fortitude and creativity in the face of unexpected change. We saw that spirit across our partners in the Zero Gap Fund (ZGF or the Fund). By design, the Fund channels private investment toward solutions addressing the world's most pressing challenges: climate change, inequalities of opportunity, access to critical healthcare, among others.</p><p>Through the targeted deployment of patient, risk-tolerant, flexible capital, ZGF focuses on supporting new investment products and mechanisms marrying deep impact with the potential for replication and growth. ZGF portfolio companies were able to deliver on their impact mandates in 2020, despite the many adversities. The impact achieved in 2020 was a welcome reprieve for communities navigating the ongoing pandemic and shows promise for the future sustainability and scaling of ZGF portfolio companies.</p><p>Realized impact included:</p><p>* LeapFrog expanded its reach to emerging consumers by nearly 23% with investments in companies offering essential services like healthcare and insurance to 221 million people.</p><p>* The Forest Resilience Bond (FRB) completed 50% of its total restoration work despite Covid-19 restrictions and the largest forest fire season on record in the United States.</p><p>* Sixup emphasized resilience and proactively enrolled its student borrowers into a Covid deferment program.</p><p>* The CRAFT fund made its first investment into a solar hydro-panel company and as of December 2020, 5,552 panels were producing at least 1,222,675 liters of water across 48 different countries.</p><p>* The Women's Livelihood Bond 2 directly impacted over 31,000 women, exceeding its target by over 20% and supported their borrowers to successfully navigate Covid-19 challenges.</p><p>The ZGF team looks to build off the resourcefulness and resilience of 2020 to identify and support new ways to improve the lives of vulnerable communities and ecosystems around the world.

Nationally, human-caused wildfires make up 87% of all wildfires each year. Almost all those fires could have been prevented.</p><p>So, the public, when out in the forests camping, does hold a great deal of responsibility regarding fire prevention.</p><p>No one wants to end a camping trip with a raging forest fire in the background, so it is important to remember the tips to keep safe. For one, make sure your vehicle or trailer is in good mechanical working condition. Sparks from a chain as it hits the pavement could cause a spark that shoots into a region of dry grass. Mufflers also should be in good working order.</p><p>Equipment is one leading cause of fires. Another is just plain carelessness. Common sense is crucial while out enjoying our state's vast public lands. While fire restrictions are already in place throughout the region, it is important the public understand that operating a generator next to a dry patch of grass probably is not a good idea.</p><p>Area fire managers are worried, and they should be. That is because the climate is going to get hotter across our state before it begins to cool off. Many forest areas are already far too dry and are, essentially, tinderboxes.</p><p>It is easy to shrug off the danger. To adopt a sort of \"it's hot every year\" philosophy would be an error. Our public lands are some of the greatest in the nation. They provide ample recreation opportunities for the residents of Eastern Oregon, and they deserve to be protected. That means all of us need to remember to use common sense and caution when we are out in the woods over the next few weeks.</p><p>___ (c)2021 The Observer (La Grande, Ore.)

Apache Sitgreaves National Forests - issued the following press release:</p><p>The Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests (ASNFs) coordinated with federal, state, and local partners and terminated the Stage 1 Fire Restrictions effectively Nov. 10, 2020, at 8 AM.</p><p>The forest had originally implemented restrictions on Oct. 9, 2020, to reduce the risk of human-caused wildfire during extreme drought conditions, historically low fuel moisture, high fire danger, and limited availability of firefighting resources. The current forest fuels have received moisture from two recent storms, which have helped reduce the wildfire threat.</p><p>\"The onset of late fall/early winter has brought moisture, lower temperatures, and higher relative humidity. The fire indices have dropped below the thresholds that warrant fire restrictions,\" said Gary Strickland, Forest Fire Management Officer.</p><p>Although conditions continue to improve and the number of visitors has decreased, the forest expects to see a steady amount of hunters, campers, and first-time visitors as active hunts, fuelwood, and Christmas tree cutting activities are taking place (tree permits can be found here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.recreation.gov/tree-permits\">https://www.recreation.gov/tree-permits</url>).</p><p>As restrictions on campfires and smoking are lifted, forest managers urge visitors to continue to use caution around campfires and other potential ignition sources by following campfire safety procedures. Never leave your campsite until the fire is completely extinguished and cold to the touch. Violators of regulations that prohibit abandoning a campfire are subject to a fine and/or imprisonment. If an abandoned campfire causes a wildfire, violators can also be held responsible for fire suppression costs.

However, it seems our concern for them is as fleeting as our liking for the newest hit song. It tops the charts, we listen to it on repeat for a few weeks, then it fades into the depths of our playlist as we latch onto the succeeding song. Climate change is no different.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Our concern for the forest fires in Australia or California is often less than or equal to the time it appears in the news cycle. Further, are the slew of Instagram story reposts out of genuine concern or merely an attempt to appear cultured and aware? These problems are troubling to scientists and economists alike, making possible solutions the subject of intense debate. I will argue that individuals will continue to neglect the issue until it directly interferes with their own well-being. My argument will be based on the science of human behavior through evolution and will conclude with a critique of currently posed solutions.</p><p>In \"The Theory of Moral Sentiments,\" Adam Smith, speaking on man's reaction to all of China being swallowed by an earthquake, says, \"If he was to lose his little finger to-morrow, he would not sleep to-night; but, provided he never saw them, he will snore with the most profound security over the ruin of a hundred millions of his brethren, and the destruction of that immense multitude seems plainly an object less interesting to him, than this paltry misfortune of his own.\"\u00a0</p><p>In other words, we care more about an injury to our finger than for the death of a hundred million people we've never met or seen. Let's trace this line of logic to what I am loosely calling the \"encroaching dilemma.\" Imagine a prominent issue such as a forest fire spreading. You are first notified that a neighboring country is being plagued by such fires. Next, you hear that a state within your country is feeling the effects of the fires. Then, it comes to your attention that a neighboring city has been nearly destroyed as a result. And so the dilemma is born. At exactly which point do individuals sense enough danger to begin taking preventative actions? I am not sure a perfect answer exists, but my intuition is that the answer lies uncomfortably closer to Smith's than the wishful thinking popularized by the media.\u00a0</p><p>How could humans be so selfish as to only concern themselves with climate change when it begins to directly interfere with their own lives? I believe evolution has something to contribute here. At no point in history has our species preoccupied itself with issues outside of our immediate environment. We are, in no way, encoded to care about, \"that over there\" when there exists a myriad of problems \"right here.\" It is not until the \"there\" becomes the \"here\" that the organism begins to adapt its behavior.\u00a0</p><p>It is unpleasant to accept the reality that humans, generally, are selfish animals in pursuit of resources and reproduction. Further, it is discouraging to think that this pursuit persists even when faced with a threat to the future of humanity. With time, I am hopeful that our evolutionary nearsightedness can morph into the type of forward-thinking required for progress.\u00a0</p><p>However, individuals are going to have to experience some disruption to catalyze change. This disruption will assuredly not come in the form of a celebrity or predictive documentary. I am optimistic that improvements can be made through production of recyclable products and safer emissions. In the case of industry, government regulations may be the only antidote to corporate greed.\u00a0</p><p>Widespread progress will not occur until humanity develops a sense of immediacy around the threat of climate change. It remains up for question whether this sense can be artificially induced by means of activism or media.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5201396</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64N9-JWF1-DY7P-T3FG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-01-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"640\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Villanovan: Villanova University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"01\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>January 29, 2022 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Villanova</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>PA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001965</classCode><className>SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp; LIFESTYLE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRN1</classCode><className>NEGATIVE SOCIETAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001588</classCode><className>SOCIAL JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001982</classCode><className>WEAPONS &amp; ARMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001964</classCode><className>SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000820</classCode><className>GUN CONTROL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0009FXT</classCode><className>BEHAVIOR &amp; COGNITION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DLA3</classCode><className>ECONOMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp; OPINIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

After seeing his warnings about the severity of Covid-19 ignored in early 2020, Ferguson revived his interest in the role of disasters in world history. The result is this assertive, intensely researched, sometimes unconvincing, but always entertaining account. </p><p>\"Historians tend to gravitate toward the study of...extreme disasters, with a preference for the man-made varieties,\" writes the author. \"Yet they seldom reflect very deeply on their common properties.\" With all disasters, the social context is crucial: A hurricane or earthquake is of no consequence unless there are people around. Perhaps most important of all, Ferguson emphasizes, these phenomena tend to follow \"power laws\" rather than the familiar normal distribution such as human heights. There is no average forest fire, stock market drop, or measles outbreak. Major catastrophes occur so rarely that few of us take the risk personally and continue to invest in risky stocks, settle in flood plains, and thrill at the beginning of the latest war. Historians follow every disaster with an explanation. Thus, they explain that the shocking 1914 outbreak of World War I was caused by decades of competition between Europe's great powers. Ferguson disagrees, preferring Tolstoy's view that human calamities are natural phenomena comparable to a hurricane. \"Most disasters occur when a complex system goes critical,\" writes the author, \"usually as a result of some small perturbation.\" After a handful of familiar examples (the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Titanic</emphasis>, Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, etc.), Ferguson returns to Covid, an ongoing preoccupation that he describes in superb detail. Unquestionably an economic disaster, in terms of lives lost, the author labels it a \"medium-size disaster\"-comparable to the 1957-1958 influenza pandemic rather than the epic 1918-1919 Spanish flu. Ferguson ends in September 2020, before the pandemic's massive upswing, so future editions will require an addendum. Captivating, opinionated history from a knowledgeable source.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Publication Date: </emphasis>2021-05-04</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Publisher: </emphasis>Penguin Press</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stage: </emphasis>NonFiction</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ISBN: </emphasis>978-0-593-29737-7</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Price: </emphasis>$30.00</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Author: </emphasis>Ferguson, Niall</h></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KIRKUS-2000212299</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KIRKUS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6238-DMD1-DYRM-F3G3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"381\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Kirkus Media LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Kirkus Reviews (Print)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30101\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"03\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>March 1, 2021, Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has said the Western military alliance is ready to defend itself against any threat posed by the move of Russia's Wagner mercenary force to Belarus amid fears the relocation of the private army could create instability for NATO's Eastern European members. Protests erupt near Paris after the fatal shooting of a 17-year-old boy in the Parisian suburb of Nanterre. French authorities have detained one police officer on suspicion of ''culpable homicide.'' Kevin Spacey arrived at a London court Wednesday for the beginning of a four-week trial over sexual assault allegations. The 63-year-old has denied the 12 charges against him, including indecent and sexual assault, as well as the more serious offense of causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent, which alone carries a possible maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The Oscar-winning actor has denied the allegations that the prosecution claims were committed against four men between 2001 and 2013. Jury selection is scheduled to take place Wednesday, though the prosecution's case may not formally begin until next week. The San Bernardino County coroner identified remains found on a California hiking trail as those of British actor Julian Sands, who was missing since January after hiking in southern California's San Gabriel Mountains, according to the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department. Over 80 million people from the Midwest to the East Coast are under air quality alerts as smoke from Canadian wildfires sweeps across parts of the U.S., prompting beach closures, warnings of reduced visibility and calls for people to stay indoors. Canada is seeing its worst fire season on record with hundreds of wildfires raging across the country -- more than 250 of them burning \"out of control,\" according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. The wildfires have led to the highest annual emissions on record for the country. Former President Donald Trump insists that he did \"nothing wrong\" as he reacted to a leaked recording of him apparently discussing what he described as \"highly confidential\" documents in his possession post-presidency. People in South Korea woke up on Wednesday to find that they were a year younger than they had been on Tuesday, and in some cases, up to two years younger. This mass de-aging was down to a new law coming into effect, which scrapped a traditional age counting system, leaving South Koreans using the international method. A 28-year-old chimpanzee, who was caged her entire life, saw the open sky for the first time in her life in a heartwarming video captured at her new home in Florida. Vanilla, the rescued chimp, spent years at a New York biomedical research laboratory where chimps were often housed in small cages, which were \"suspended from the ground like bird cages,\" according to Save the Chimps, a chimpanzee sanctuary.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[08:01:02]</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR: Hello, and welcome to CNN Newsroom. I'm Max Foster in London.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just ahead, a deadly Russian missile strike hits a crowded restaurant in Ukraine's East. Children amongst the dead. More from the ground in just a moment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">French President Macron calls the fatal shooting of a teenager during a police traffic stop unjustified as the boy's death prompts unrest near Paris. We're live on this developing story.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And Kevin Spacey appears in a London court as his trial on sexual offense charges gets underway.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy calls the strike on an eastern city, quote, \"a manifestation of terror\". At least 10 people were killed when two Russian missiles slammed into Kramatorsk on Tuesday. One hitting a busy city center, the other a village nearby. Dozens of people are injured. A popular restaurant was hit. Among the victims, a baby and these teenage twin sisters who had just graduated from 8th grade.</p><p>CNN's Ben Wedeman joins us live from Eastern Ukraine with the very latest developments. And that is the restaurant, I believe, Ben?</p><p>BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's correct. That's the restaurant, the Ria behind me. They continue to search for perhaps survivors, more likely the dead. Now, in fact, our producer Costa did speak to some of the rescue workers. They said at this point their expectation is that there is nobody alive under the rubble. They're still trying to dig out.</p><p>Now, the latest numbers, according to the local authorities, are 10 dead. As you mentioned, those twin 14-year-old sisters, a 17-year-old girl, 61 wounded, among them an eight-month-old baby. Now, this is a -- was a very popular restaurant with soldiers, with civilians. In fact, we ate there day before yesterday, but this operation is continuing.</p><p>Now, according to President Zelenskyy, in his nightly address last night, he had said that it was hit by an S-300 surface to air missile. Now, the Ukrainians are saying it was an Iskander missile, which is a hypersonic ballistic missile, very difficult to detect by air defenses, even harder to bring down, and it's a much more precise weapon than the S-300.</p><p>And given the level of damage here, which is extensive, it's not just the restaurant itself, but the buildings around it and on the other side of the buildings on the main street as well. So it looks like, in fact, it was an Iskander missile which is capable of causing this level of destruction, death and damage. Max?</p><p>FOSTER: Ben outside that restaurant, thank you.</p><p>NATO sending a clear message to Russia and Belarus. It is ready to defend every member and every inch of its territory. That's the word from Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at a meeting in The Hague. He adds, NATO is fortifying its eastern front after Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin and perhaps some of his troops were said to be in Belarus following this weekend's failed insurrection.</p><p>Stoltenberg says the cause of the internal strike in Russia is obvious.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO SECRETARY GENERAL: These are internal Russian matters. But what is clear is that President Putin's illegal war against Ukraine has deepened divisions and created new tensions in Russia.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FOSTER: Let's get some perspective on the situation. Nic Robertson is here, our International Diplomatic Editor. The language he's using is quite worrying to people in Europe because he's talking about fortifying that sort of border towards Belarus.</p><p>[08:05:00]</p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: He is. It was very interesting. And he just held a press conference with the Estonian Prime Minister, Kaja Kallas, who was saying that Ukraine must be allowed to join NATO. We must make a path forward for that. And that was one of the things Stoltenberg was saying, we will be at this coming NATO leader summit in two weeks in Vilnius, Lithuania.</p><p>We will be upgrading, he said, Ukraine's political ties to NATO, with a view on the path, obviously, to fully inclusive membership. This is what he's saying. But when he was talking about the threat from Russia and NATO being ready for it, you know, there's a bolstering of the forces along the border, along the eastern flank of NATO, a greater air readiness, a readiness to switch from air policing to air defense.</p><p>Not just planes, fighter jets patrol in that area, but air defense systems put in place along there. NATO is definitely on a footing that Stoltenberg says it will be ready for any threat from Russia. But here was the kicker today that I found interesting. We're so used to Stoltenberg talking about being ready for any threat from Moscow.</p><p>Today, he said Moscow and Minsk, the capital of Belarus. The message is very clear. There's an assessment that Belarus is a much more of a wild card player in this and perhaps potentially a greater threat to NATO at the moment than previously perceived.</p><p>FOSTER: OK, Nic, thank you.</p><p>Protesters clashed with riot police in the Parisian suburb of Nanterre after a 17-year-old boy was shot by police during a traffic stop early on Tuesday. An officer has been detained on suspicion of culpable homicide. A video of the incident has emerged showing two police officers beside the car before the driver pulls away. And a warning, some of the footage here you may find disturbing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(GUNSHOTS)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FOSTER: Well protests continued until the early hours of Wednesday, around 2,000 police officers have been mobilized in anticipation of further unrest. The shooting caused widespread outrage in France. French football star Kylian Mbappe tweeted heartbreak emojis and wrote, quote, \"I'm aching for my France. An unacceptable situation\".</p><p>Let's bring in CNN's Melissa Bell in Paris. A huge challenge for the authorities to manage this.</p><p>MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Max. And they appear to be taking this very seriously. It was 350 policemen that were mobilized yesterday in that Nanterre part of Paris, just on the outskirts of the city, to the northwest of the French capital, to try and put down that anger that erupted really very suddenly.</p><p>The police stop that you just saw on that video and the shooting that followed within a few seconds of it happened yesterday morning, just after 08:00 a.m. Paris time. The young man was pronounced dead an hour later. It was as that video emerged that the anger really began to spread. By the evening, of course, people down the street calling for justice.</p><p>Now, it isn't the first time that here in France, French police have faced these sorts of allegations before. It's happened very often when it comes to either traffic stops or identity checks and often in some of the less well-off neighborhoods of Paris. It's something that we've been looking at for years here in the French capital and in other French cities as well.</p><p>And I think that has contributed further, as has the existence of this video, which appears to contradict what the police initially said about the incident in their defense. All of those factors have really helped whip up the anger and the controversy around this particular incident of yesterday morning.</p><p>Here's what the French president had to say just a short while ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT (through translator): I would like to express the emotion of the entire nation at the death of young Nael and give his family our solidarity and the affection of the nation. We need calm for justice to carry out its work and we need calm everywhere because the situation, we can't allow the situation to worsen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BELL: And yet calm is absolutely not what they're expecting tonight. Not just in Nanterre, the part of the outskirts of Paris I mentioned a moment ago where the incident took place, but in other neighborhoods around the French capital and in its suburbs. That deployment of some 2,000 policemen gives you an idea of the kind of trouble that they're expecting.</p><p>And there is, of course, the emotion from the family that's now been expressed. The mother of young Nael. Bear in mind, Max, that he was just 17 years old who's called for a march in the name of his -- her son and the justice he hopes he's going to get. That's to be held tomorrow. Max?</p><p>FOSTER: OK, Melissa in Paris, thank you.</p><p>Two time Oscar winner Kevin Spacey walked into a London courthouse earlier today to stand trial for sexual assault. The disgraced actor has pleaded not guilty to a dozen charges connected to alleged encounters he had with four men from 2001 to 2013 when he lived in the U.K.</p><p>[08:10:06]</p><p>If convicted of all the charges, he could face a maximum penalty of life in prison. Our Salma Abdelaziz tracking the case here. Looks very confident, though, didn't he, going into court?</p><p>SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Very confident, smiling, arriving nearly two hours early, Max. Kevin Spacey and his lawyers see this as their opportunity to vindicate him. He has long denied the charges against him, insisted that they are false, and insisted that he wants his day in court to prove his innocence. And that began today.</p><p>Important to note here that this is a four-week trial. The court has already adjourned for the day. It was only in session for about two hours. Only procedural things took place today. The jurors were sworn in, a dozen jurors and then the charges were read out.</p><p>But you have to remember, Max, these are very serious charges. Despite the very relaxed Kevin Spacey that you're seeing there, he has 12 charges of sexual assault filed against him, including indecent assault and causing a person -- a person rather, to engage in sexual activity without consent.</p><p>The incidences taking place allegedly between 2001 to 2013. The charges brought forward by four separate individuals, four men, all of them, most of them take place during the period in time when Kevin Spacey called London home, when he was the artistic director of the Old Vic Theater.</p><p>Again, this is going to take several weeks, this trial, but today, or beginning today, really, this process starts. The Crown prosecution, of course, over the coming weeks, will present its reasoning for bringing these charges forward and Kevin Spacey's lawyers will have their work cut out for them defending him.</p><p>FOSTER: Salma, thank you.</p><p>The body of acclaimed British actor Julian Sands has been found in the California Mountains. Sands went missing in January whilst on a hike near Mount Baldy. Poor weather conditions hampered search efforts at that time and authorities only recently began looking for him again.</p><p>The actor's family says he was an avid hiker. He is survived by a wife and three children, as well as legions of fans from his more than 30- year career.</p><p>A start warning about safety of British classrooms. A school collapse that cause -- causes death or injury is very likely. That's according to a troubling new report by the National Audit Office, which is a public spending watchdog.</p><p>It finds about 700,000 children in England are attending schools that need major repairs and more than a third of school buildings across the country are beyond their estimated design lifespan. And the report also speculate says that specialists are carrying out urgent structural checks on about 600 schools identified as possibly at risk.</p><p>Still to come, aging backwards in South Korea, at least on paper, there's no magic cream or diet. It's all thanks to the government.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[08:15:05]</p><p>FOSTER: Now more than 80 million people from the U.S. Midwest to the east coast are under air quality alerts as smoke from Canadian wildfires sweeps across the border. Chicago and Detroit had the worst air quality in the world throughout the day on Tuesday, according to IQAir. Officials in the U.S. are warning of reduced visibility and closing some public spaces.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Wow, this is pretty insane, guys. This is not fog. This is smoke.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FOSTER: Canadian authorities say more than 200 wildfires are burning out of control right now. This was the view from farms in Wisconsin on Tuesday. The smoke is expected to linger for the next few days. It's Canada's worst ever fire season and has led to the country's highest emissions on record.</p><p>Jennifer Gray joins me from the CNN Weather Center. And I know that some of the smoke has even reached Europe. This is a huge issue.</p><p>JENNIFER GRAY, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yes, Max, it's actually remarkable how far reaching the smoke is. It's definitely into the Midwest and portions of the Northeast. This is a live look at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and you can see just very, very thick smoke.</p><p>You remember very recently we had all the smoke in the Northeast. It even caused some airports to delay flights and cancel flights. And so it is a serious issue. You can see the smoke just settling in across the Midwest. As you mentioned, Chicago had some of the worst air quality in the world and still does. It still makes it on that list.</p><p>It still has very unhealthy air quality alerts out there for portions of Chicago, St. Louis, Detroit, all across the Midwest, even into the Ohio Valley and portions of interior sections of the Northeast, all dealing with poor air quality. We have these air quality alerts and stretching as far South as North Carolina.</p><p>So the smoke is getting farther south than the Midwest in the Ohio Valley and so it is going to continue on that track down to the south at these northerly winds that are just pushing it down. However, today should be the last really bad day across the Midwest and then we're supposed to see improvement, especially by tomorrow.</p><p>You can see these shades of blue returning that indicates that the air quality will improve. But it is interesting, as you mentioned, some of these darker colors on the satellite imagery showing that smoke actually reaching Europe. And so it's going very far all across the Atlantic and even making it to the Europe coast and even interior sections of Europe.</p><p>So Max, it is interesting. It's something we're going to be dealing with throughout the summer, most likely because the Canadian fire season is still early on. It's only June. It should last several more months. And so far, we've already burned more land than ever before for any fire season on record. And it's just getting started, which is wild to think.</p><p>FOSTER: Unbelievable. Jennifer Gray, thank you so much for bringing us that insight on a global, truly global story. We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) FOSTER: After CNN attained an audio recording of Donald Trump discussing confidential documents, the former U.S. president insists he's done nothing wrong. That recording is a key piece of evidence in the U.S. Justice Department's case against Trump in the classified documents case.</p><p>Here's what he told Fox News Digital on Tuesday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: I had a whole desk full of lots of papers and mostly newspaper articles, copies of magazines, copies of different plans, copies of stories, having to do with many, many subjects. And what was said was absolutely fine and very perfectly. We did nothing wrong.</p><p>[08:20:15]</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're not concerned then with your own voice on those recordings?</p><p>TRUMP: My voice was fine. What did I say wrong on those recordings? I didn't even see the recording. All I know is I did nothing wrong. We had a lot of papers, a lot of papers stacked up. In fact, you could hear the rustle of the paper.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FOSTER: When asked if there are any other recordings of him out there, he said he didn't know if of any that -- he should be concerned with, at least, and he blamed what he calls fake news. Trump has pleaded not guilty to the 37 criminal counts, including conspiracy to hide classified documents from the U.S. government.</p><p>This is far from the first time that we've heard Donald Trump saying things that have landed him in hot water. Randi Kaye now takes a look back at some of the lowest moments caught on tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TRUMP: You know, I'm automatically attracted to beautiful -- I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet.</p><p>RANDI KAYE, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Donald Trump caught on tape saying crude things about women in 2005 during an interview with Access Hollywood, broadcast just weeks before Election Day in 2016.</p><p>TRUMP: Grab them by the (INAUDIBLE). You can do anything.</p><p>KAYE (voice-over): Days after the recording surfaced, Trump, then the Republican presidential nominee, apologized. Though the New York Times later reported Trump told a Republican senator that he wanted to investigate the recording because, quote, \"We don't think that was my voice\". Also, before the 2016 election, Trump was recorded in his office by his then lawyer, Michael Cohen. The two were discussing how they would buy the rights to former Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal's story. She claims she and Trump had an affair which ended in 2007. Trump has denied the affair, but listened to him on tape.</p><p>MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER TRUMP ATTORNEY: I need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend, David. I've spoken to Allen Weisselberg about how to set the whole thing up with --</p><p>TRUMP: So, what do we got to pay for this? 150?</p><p>COHEN: -- funding. Yes.</p><p>KAYE (voice-over): Before Election Day, Trump's friend David Pecker, whose company published the National Enquirer, paid McDougal $150,000 for the rights to her story. Then buried it in what's known as a catch and kill scheme. Months before the 2020 election, President Trump was recorded on a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p><p>According to a White House transcript, Trump pressured Zelenskyy by asking him to investigate trump's 2020 opponent, Joe Biden, as well as Biden's son, Hunter, who once had business in Ukraine. Later, Trump repeatedly referred to the call like this.</p><p>TRUMP: We had a perfect phone call with the President of Ukraine.</p><p>KAYE (voice-over): A whistleblower inside the White House shared details of the call with members of the intelligence community. Congress investigated. In the end, that recording led to Trump's first impeachment. Trump denied any wrongdoing.</p><p>In 2020, journalist Bob Woodward recorded interviews with Trump for his book. Those interviews, later made public, revealed that Trump knew for months how dangerous the coronavirus was and how it spread, but intentionally concealed that from the public.</p><p>TRUMP: I wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down.</p><p>BOB WOODWARD, JOURNALIST: Yes, sir.</p><p>TRUMP: Because I don't want to create a panic. It goes through air, Bob. That's always tougher than the touch.</p><p>KAYE (voice-over): After the 2020 election, Trump was recorded yet again.</p><p>TRUMP: It's just not possible to have lost Georgia. It's not possible. When I heard it was close, I said, there's no way.</p><p>KAYE (voice-over): That's Trump on the phone with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Trump called him following his loss in the 2020 election.</p><p>TRUMP: It's pretty clear that we won, we won very substantially Georgia.</p><p>KAYE (voice-over): That wasn't true. Trump lost Georgia by 11,779 votes. On the recording, he's heard, asking Raffensperger to find enough votes to give Trump a win.</p><p>TRUMP: I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. Because we won the state.</p><p>KAYE (voice-over): Raffensperger didn't play ball. Trump is now under investigation by Georgia's Fulton County district attorney for his actions on the phone call in question.</p><p>Randi Kaye, CNN.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FOSTER: Muslims all over the world are celebrating the start of Eid al-Adha today. Pilgrims at the Hajj in Saudi Arabia are braving the intense heat to perform the symbolic stoning of the devil ritual today. The annual pilgrimage, one of five Pillars of Islam, started in Mecca on Monday. Nearly 2 million worshippers expected to attend this year's pilgrimage, the first one without pandemic restrictions.</p><p>No, they're not stuck in a dream. More than 51 million South Koreans woke up a year or two younger on Wednesday, at least according to the law. The country scrapped its traditional Korean age, which considers babies a year old on the day that they're born, with a year added every January 1.</p><p>[08:25:07]</p><p>Instead, under new legislation, Seoul will adopt the international age system that starts at zero and is used by most of the world. President Yoon Suk Yeol made a campaign pledge last year to scrap the old age counting method which he said is not only confusing, but a drain on the economy.</p><p>And finally, a chimpanzee named Vanilla had quite the reaction when she saw blue skies for the very first time in her life.</p><p>That was her looking at the sky in amazement. The other chimps of this Florida chimpanzee sanctuary seemed to want to share her joy as well.

The luxury rehabilitation option has built a reputation on hope \u2014 a perfect antidote for a world steeped in pessimism and despondency.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On December 30, NPRreportedthat a sobering new line has been crossed in the ongoing opioid epidemic. As of the end of 2021, the number of Americans who have died from overdoses has crossed the one million mark. The news outlet came to this conclusion through the combination of two statistics.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">First, the National Center for Health Statistics division of the CDC reported that there were officially 932,364 overdose fatalities between 1999 and 2020 \u2014 the years that the data has been tracked so far. In addition, NPR added that preliminary data from the CDC points to another 100,000 drug-related deaths being added to the leger for 2021. This dramatic addition would easily push the total beyond one million deaths.</p><p>While the horrifying number is a wake-up call for many, the staff at United Recovery Project has been on the alert for years now. The group has created its luxury addiction recovery program directly in response to the hundreds of thousands of individuals who are desperately seeking a realistic way to escape their addictions.</p><p>The team at URP is aware of the fact that the ongoing crisis comes from a variety of factors. For instance,multiple settlementshave recently been made involving pharmaceutical companies like McKinsey &amp; Co., Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Purdue Pharma. These entities must pay states billions of dollars to help manage the damage caused by the companies' irresponsible promotion of addictive medications.</p><p>In addition, the rise in the number of drugs laced with lethal quantities of the illicit synthetic fentanyl has become a major issue. Add in depression and isolation caused by the pandemic, and it creates a perfect storm of addictive danger.</p><p>While URP is aware of the sad circumstances, though, the team knows the response cannot be to give up without a fight. The program is dedicated to creating a light in the midst of a sea of darkness. URP cofounder Bryan Alzate explains this hope-filled objective, \"My job is to spark the flame in the addict who doesn't think he can. That's what I focus on. Little Sparks all over the world. Not trying to put out a forest fire. I'm focused on starting my own fire.\"</p><p>In pursuit of this end, Alzate and his co-founders have created United Recovery Project. The luxury drug and alcohol rehabilitation center focuses on providing high-quality service through things like customized and comprehensive care and a low client-to-staff ratio.</p><p>In addition, Alzate hostsHell Has an Exit, a URP podcast that focuses on the resiliency of the human spirit. The combination of the podcast and the URP facility has allowed Alzate and his team to create more than a spark. The URP message is a raging bonfire in a desolate landscape, a beacon of hope in a desperate world. With fatalities rising and no end to the opioid epidemic in sight, it is organizations like URP that must continue to fight the good fight to keep that spark of hope alive in the hearts of millions of suffering Americans across the nation.</p><p>About United Recovery Project: URP was founded in 2016 in Hollywood, Florida. The addiction treatment program prides itself on offering an all-inclusive selection of programs that can be tailored to each client's needs. URP is in the process of expanding to other states as well, where it hopes to offer ongoing substance abuse help to those who need it as well as their loved ones.
