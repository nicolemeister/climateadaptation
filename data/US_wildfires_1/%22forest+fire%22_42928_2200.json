According to news reporting out of Changsha, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"In real forest fire scenarios, there are a large number of convex and concave terrains at the junction of flat land and slopes. In this paper, a typical charring material, kraft paper, is selected as the experimental sample, and the variation law of key characteristic parameters of flame spread over convex solid surface are investigated.\" </p><p><br/> Financial support for this research came from National Science Foundation of Hunan Province. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the School of Civil Engineering, \"The experimental results show that all the flame spread processes have obvious deceleration behaviors, and the influence mechanism of flame tangent angle on the flame spread deceleration of convex surfaces is revealed. The characteristic length of the pyrolysis zone shows a tendency of increasing and then decreasing with time. The variation curves of radiant heat flux present two peaks. Combining with the characteristic length, the reason for the occurrence of two peaks is explained. The exponential relationship between the instantaneous mass loss rate and the characteristic length of the pyrolysis zone is obtained. Based on the range of power exponents, the heat transfer controlling mechanism in the pyrolysis zone is classified into three categories for all the working conditions. Moreover, a piecewise power-law relationship between the dimensionless maximum flame height and the dimensionless heat release rate is established.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The results of this study will fill the research gap of flame spread of solid materials with curved surfaces, and will be of great academic value for the improvement and development of theories on building and forest fire safety.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Characteristics of Concurrent Flame Spread Over Convex Charring Materials.

Nancy Cordes will join us with the latest.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A New Jersey teenager is arrested for setting the state`s largest wildfire in nearly 20 years. The smoke now impacting air quality in New York City. CBS` Ray Strickland reports for us tonight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And in-depth tonight, imagine being homeless and saddled with a mortgage. CBS` Dave Malkoff looks into how this is possible. Those stories and more right after our news headlines.</p><p>A federal judge in Maryland has ordered the return of yet another man deported to that prison in El Salvador. The district judge who was appointed by President Trump says the administration violated an agreement to protect the Venezuelan migrant from deportation, while his case for asylum is being heard.</p><p>Long simmering tensions between nuclear armed India and Pakistan are escalating, following a deadly attack on civilians in Kashmir, which India controls, but both countries claim as theirs. India blamed Pakistan for the assault, which killed 26 mostly Indian tourists in the region. A previously unknown group calling itself Kashmir Resistance is claiming responsibility.</p><p>And a key measure of the country`s economic health, sales of existing homes took a drubbing. They tumbled by nearly 6% in March. It`s the biggest single month drop in three years, but the average rate on a 30-year mortgage eased slightly this week to 6.81%. That`s below the more than 7% rate this time a year ago.</p><p>We begin tonight with the hurdles to get to a possible peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. President Trump issued a rare public rebuke of President Putin following a deadly strike on Kiev. The attack Thursday morning killed at least 12 and injured 90 others, the deadliest assault on Ukraine`s capital since July.</p><p>Chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes joins me now. And Nancy, what we`re hearing from the president on a possible peace deal here and his recent airstrikes. After all, the president was talking about ending this war on day one.</p><p>NANCY CORDES: Right. Well, that deadline has come and gone, Maurice, but the president does still believe that he can broker some kind of deal between Russia and Ukraine as long as it happens fairly quickly. He did express frustration with the Russians again publicly today, saying that he felt that it was not helpful for Vladimir Putin to target civilian locations in Kyiv, leading to the deaths of Ukrainians even as these talks continue.</p><p>But he also lashed out at the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, arguing that what Zelenskyy wants, particularly when it comes to the Crimean Peninsula, is unrealistic. And interestingly, when he was asked, Maurice, what he thinks Russia is prepared to give up in this negotiation, he basically made it sound like he doesn`t expect Russia to give up much at all. Take a listen to that exchange from the Oval Office.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>REPORTER: What concessions has Russia offered up thus far to get to the point where you`re closer to peace?</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R) (U.S. President): Stopping the war, stopping taking the whole country, pretty big concession.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>NANCY CORDES: So if that`s what`s on the table, is Russia basically agreeing not to continue this war, but taking all of the territory that it has so far, that`s something that is unlikely to be palatable, Maurice, to the Ukrainians.</p><p>MAURICE DUBOIS: Nancy, as you update us on where negotiations stand, I heard the President saying in the Oval today, we are putting a lot of pressure on Russia. You have no idea. What exactly does that mean? Where do things stand? Anybody have any idea?</p><p>NANCY CORDES: Well, we do know that the President is sending his Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, to meet with Vladimir Putin in Russia on Friday, at least that`s the plan right now. The Russian Foreign Minister confirmed that to our Margaret Brennan in an interview today. But there was supposed to be another high-level meeting involving the Ukrainians in London. That was canceled at the last minute.</p><p>The Secretary of State decided not to go, and the assumption is that they didn`t like what Ukraine`s leader was saying about the fact that he didn`t think that he should have to give up territory.</p><p>MAURICE DUBOIS: Okay. Nancy Cordes at the White House. Thank you. As we turn now to the massive wildfire in New Jersey, traced back to a bonfire left burning by a 19-year-old who police say then fled the scene. The fire still rages, and it`s causing air quality concerns. CBS` Ray Strickland reports tonight from near the fire zone.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>RAY STRICKLAND (voiceover): Firefighters are racing to put out a wildfire burning near Shore towns in Ocean County, New Jersey, that`s already destroyed more than 15,000 acres. It`s the Garden State`s largest fire in nearly two decades. Officials say it`s been difficult to keep this fire under control.</p><p>BILL DONNELLY (New Jersey Forest Fire Service Chief): We just could not get far enough ahead of this fire, based on its behavior, that we were able to actually keep it in check.</p><p>RAY STRICKLAND (voiceover): Nineteen-year-old Joseph Kling is accused of starting the fire on Tuesday. Authorities say Kling lit wooden pallets for a bonfire and left the area. Investigators used advanced equipment to track him down.</p><p>MAN: There was some technology that was involved, the GPS coordinates, we were able to establish, and that really led us to Joseph Kling and some of the witnesses that we were able to find.</p><p>RAY STRICKLAND (voiceover): This home and several buildings were damaged as the fire spread rapidly due to high winds, dry brush, and low humidity. Evacuations have now been lifted after some 5,000 people were forced to flee.</p><p>WOMAN: Didn`t sleep all night, and then we got the notice that we could go back, but it`s still very unsettling because look at it.</p><p>RAY STRICKLAND (voiceover): Firefighters are making progress. The blaze is now about 50% contained, but winds are blowing the smoky air towards New York and Long Island, creating health concerns for millions of people. Officials in New York have issued an air quality alert.</p><p>MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D-NY): New Yorkers may see smoke and smell smoke over the city. We`re monitoring the situation closely and coordinating with New Jersey and New York State.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>RAY STRICKLAND: And Kling now faces multiple counts of arson. He has not entered a plea. As large as this fire is, only one business and a few structures were destroyed.</p><p>Maurice?</p><p>MAURICE DUBOIS: Okay, Ray Strickland in South Jersey on the fire lines. Thank you.</p><p>Those civil rights groups are condemning President Trump for signing a series of executive orders this week that they say would weaken anti- discrimination laws.</p><p>Janai Nelson joins me now. She`s the President of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Janai, good to see you.</p><p>So one of the executive orders goes after what is known as disparate impact liability. Take us through what that is and an example, if you can, of how that`s helped people in the past.</p><p>JANAI NELSON (President, NAACP Legal Defense Fund): Yeah, so it`s so important that we don`t get tripped up on these words disparate impact liability. What this is really about is the ability to interrogate inequality. When we see inequality and we see different groups experiencing a law or a policy in different ways, we as a society that believes in fairness, that believes in justice, we have an obligation to interrogate that.</p><p>To make sure that the results that we`re seeing are not based on discrimination, are not based on, you know, someone`s identity, and that they are fair policies. That`s what disparate impact means. It`s the ability to interrogate inequality.</p><p>We see this in so many spheres of society. So for example, if people are trying to access affordable housing and there`s a rule or a law, like a credit report threshold that somehow is making it difficult for people to find access to housing, to get shelter, then we should ask, is that really a useful tool to ensure who gets access to housing or not? If it is, then that`s fine.</p><p>If it`s not, and it`s hurting particular populations more than others, then we should be interrogating it. We should be making sure that we are not forcing inequality on people simply because of their identity based on policies that don`t serve us.</p><p>MAURICE DUBOIS: Whether it`s intentional or not is a key here too. What`s your biggest concern?</p><p>JANAI NELSON: That`s right.</p><p>MAURICE DUBOIS: Right? What`s your biggest concern with this executive order?</p><p>JANAI NELSON: My biggest concern is that this is an attempt to dismantle our entire civil rights infrastructure. Gone are the days where someone`s going to say out loud, I want to discriminate against you because you are, you know, black or a woman or a person who`s a member of the LGBTQ plus community. We don`t see smoking guns like that anymore. That doesn`t mean though that discrimination is gone. It still exists. When we see imbalances, when we see inequality, we have a duty to interrogate it.</p><p>So I`m worried that if this executive order is able to be enforced, which it absolutely shouldn`t, it is thoroughly unlawful, but if for some reason it does get enforced, it is going to undermine the entire civil rights infrastructure that this country has relied on to diversify the ranks of leadership with more women, with more people of color, with people with disabilities, with people from all different backgrounds, we will be an entirely different America, which is really what this Trump administration is after.</p><p>MAURICE DUBOIS: One final thought here. The executive orders framed disparate impact as being divisive and endangering equal opportunity more broadly. You hear the president talk about DEI in this way as well. What do you make of all that?</p><p>JANAI NELSON: Listen, this is just more of the lies and falsehoods that President Trump loves trafficking in. He uses words like equal opportunity, which come out of the civil rights movement, to weaponize those words against the very people they were intended to benefit, which is frankly all Americans. All Americans benefit from all of us having equal opportunity to achieve and to access opportunity, which makes this country better.</p><p>It`s the reason that we can even talk about America`s greatness. It`s because of civil rights laws and protections that remove the barriers that sideline so many for generations.</p><p>MAURICE DUBOIS: Okay. Janai Nelson, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, thanks so much for the insight tonight.</p><p>JANAI NELSON: Thank you, Maurice.</p><p>MAURICE DUBOIS: Now, here are three things to note tonight. The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to allow it to immediately enforce its policy against transgender individuals in the military, even while lower courts hear challenges from LGBTQ groups who say the policy violates the Constitution`s Equal Protection Clause. A baffling discovery three miles deep in the Pacific.</p><p>Researchers using remote cameras to explore the rusting hulk of the World War II aircraft carrier, U.S. Yorktown, found a Ford automobile parked in the ship`s hangar. No one can yet explain what the vehicle was doing on a ship that was on its way to the historic Battle of the Midway.</p><p>And your dog may be your best friend, but how does Fido stack up against everybody else in your life? Well, a new study of 700 dog owners published in the journal Scientific Reports finds that dogs score higher on the companionship scale than our closest relatives, our best friends, and even our romantic partners. No comment.</p><p>Coming up on CBS EVENING NEWS PLUS here tonight, we go in-depth on what happens when Mother Nature wipes out your home, but you still have to pay the mortgage.</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>MAURICE DUBOIS: When a natural disaster strikes, it can create a financial storm for homeowners who`ve lost it all. In tonight`s In Depth, CBS` Dave Malkoff reports many are often left temporarily homeless and still obligated to pay their mortgage.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>BETH BRIGHTMAN (Home Damaged By Hurricane Helene): Double pane glass doors still have water in them from the storm.</p><p>DAVE MALKOFF (voiceover): You can still see the flood damage six months after Hurricane Helene hit Beth and Alex Brightman`s home in Hudson on Florida`s west coast.</p><p>BETH BRIGHTMAN: Oh my God, this stuff that was in my china cabinet!</p><p>DAVE MALKOFF (voiceover): Since then, they`ve changed the message at their door.</p><p>BETH BRIGHTMAN: Let`s not stay home. It originally said let`s stay home because that`s all we wanted to do was stay here in our retirement home.</p><p>DAVE MALKOFF (voiceover): Flood insurance only covered damage to the structure and homeowner`s insurance doesn`t cover contents lost from flooding.</p><p>BETH BRIGHTMAN: If we had a hole in the roof and rain came in, then our belongings would have been covered through the homeowners.</p><p>DAVE MALKOFF (voiceover): So they`re using savings for repairs while living in a rental still with a $2,500 monthly mortgage.</p><p>BETH BRIGHTMAN: We still kind of live paycheck to paycheck.</p><p>DAVE MALKOFF (voiceover): About a month after Hurricanes Helene and Milton hit the southeast, nearly 60,000 homeowners fell behind on their mortgages. And there`s been a similar trend after the L.A. wildfires. Right now, 4,100 homeowners there are delinquent on their mortgage payments.</p><p>PAUL WILLEN (Economist): They understand that you have short-term cash flow issues.</p><p>DAVE MALKOFF (voiceover): Economist Paul Willen says historically, lenders have worked out arrangements with disaster victims.</p><p>PAUL WILLEN: The last thing they want is for a borrower to end up defaulting on a mortgage.</p><p>DAVE MALKOFF (voiceover): One option with your bank is forbearance, which gives you temporary pause on your mortgage payments.</p><p>PAUL WILLEN: It would basically give you a way of paying for stuff up front and freeing up cash flow.</p><p>DAVE MALKOFF (voiceover): It`s given the Breitmans relief from their house payments for six months.</p><p>BETH BRIGHTMAN: It`s been helpful, but then now it`s going to turn around and be a big bite.</p><p>DAVE MALKOFF (voiceover): That bite will be about $15,000, the total amount deferred, now coming due. And forbearance can also have long-term consequences for homeowners, affecting credit, ability to refinance, and home equity.</p><p>BETH BRIGHTMAN: This is the year to rebuild, recover, and then --</p><p>ALEX BRIGHTMAN (Home Damaged By Hurricane Helene): Go from there.</p><p>DAVE MALKOFF: Just get back to the day before the storm. That`s all you want.</p><p>BETH BRIGHTMAN: If they could go to September 25, 2024, that`d be nice.</p><p>DAVE MALKOFF (voiceover): If they could go back, they would have prepared differently, adding insurance and protecting their belongings before --</p><p>BETH BRIGHTMAN: Oh, my God.</p><p>DAVE MALKOFF: -- Helene arrived on their doorstep.</p><p>Dave Malkoff, CBS News, Hudson, Florida.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>MAURICE DUBOIS: When we return, John Dickerson from Rome with tonight`s interview.</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>MAURICE DUBOIS: Thousands continue to pay tribute to Pope Francis as he lies in state in St. Peter`s Basilica. John Dickerson is in Rome to cover Saturday`s funeral, and for tonight`s interview, he spoke with Father Matthew Berrios, who leads St. Patrick`s Catholic American Parish, and asked him about the legacy Francis leaves behind.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>JOHN DICKERSON: Let`s talk about the moment you heard that Pope Francis had passed. Where were you and how did that news -- how did you receive that news?</p><p>FR. MATTHEW BERRIOS (St. Patrick`s Catholic American Parish In Rome): It must have been somewhere around 9 o`clock in the morning. I was having coffee in the living room, finished with morning prayer, and the Vice Rector, Fr. Fr. Greg Apparcel, sent me a text just very simply saying, the Holy Father died.</p><p>It was a little surreal, I suppose, and so I had to check the \"New York Times\" and a couple of other outlets just to see if that was in fact true, because living here, you hear all sorts of things. As a priest friend of mine said, Roman gossip is the best gossip. Sometimes it`s even true, so you have to double-check your sources.</p><p>But no, it was very shocking. We had expected it for a while. We didn`t expect that it would happen so suddenly.</p><p>JOHN DICKERSON: He was the pope for most of the time that you were -- I mean, for the time that you`ve been a priest, he`s mostly been your pope, yeah?</p><p>FR. MATTHEW BERRIOS: He has been pope for the majority of my time as a religious. I think I was only in seminary for maybe two or three years when he was elected, and so for most of my life as a Paulist, I`ve only known Francis.</p><p>JOHN DICKERSON: Do you see any evidence that Pope Francis brought people either back into the Catholic Church who had lapsed or people who were not religious but came through his more public persona?</p><p>FR. MATTHEW BERRIOS: I think, yes, absolutely. People were able to come back to the Church if they had felt alienated, precisely because he was willing to have the tough conversations with peoples and person groups that maybe many people in the Church had ignored or outright disparaged. There was nothing to be afraid of in engaging and welcoming and trying to have a certain accoglienza towards the rest of the world. Even those who aren`t religious felt a certain warmth and friendliness and fondness towards him.</p><p>JOHN DICKERSON: As I think about people joining the Church, what was -- what was your -- why did you join the priesthood?</p><p>FR. MATTHEW BERRIOS: Well, the simple answer is because I was called, but what the call feels like is a little nebulous. In some ways, it`s like an attraction. It`s like gravity. It`s almost like falling in love with the call of a certain style of life and a certain way of prayer and a certain way of being.</p><p>JOHN DICKERSON: What does the Catholic Church need to do to recruit more priests?</p><p>FR. MATTHEW BERRIOS: Well, what makes priesthood attractive to young people, I think, is those who are currently priests living their priesthood joyfully because that`s a beautiful and attractive thing when you find someone who`s so fallen in love with the life that they`ve been called to that it flowers and becomes a place of grace and inspiration for others around them.</p><p>JOHN DICKERSON: We live in a time where a lot of people in different countries all over the world believe in a different thing. Latest and loudest, largest, biggest, how does that create an appetite for the case for humility that you just made or does it make it more difficult to preach humility in a world where if it`s not flashy and gold-plated, it doesn`t count?</p><p>FR. MATTHEW BERRIOS: The faith becomes a sign of contradiction in that way, and it`s not necessarily something bad because the Church at one level will always be countercultural. No matter what the current trends of culture might be, the Church will always have something to proclaim, and if we live it authentically, it`ll be something attractive. It`ll be something beautiful because it`s living. It comes from our groundedness in God, to his life, and love itself.</p><p>JOHN DICKERSON: Living it authentically sounds like your description of Pope Francis.</p><p>FR. MATTHEW BERRIOS: Absolutely.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>MAURICE DUBOIS: Finally tonight, something most of us don`t see every day, a real live bison jam. On a recent trip to Yellowstone National Park, tourist Cindy Shaffer captured this unique moment. A herd of these majestic beasts stopping traffic for nearly 20 minutes as they slowly cross the road.</p><p>The park service says there are some 5,400 bison roaming Yellowstone. The fact that we`re lucky enough to steal even a glance of the bison in the wild today is a miracle in itself. In the 1800s, it`s estimated as many as 60 million of them populated the plains and west.</p><p>But as the American frontier expanded, the bison population declined due to hunting and disease. Only a few hundred remained before the turn of the century. Ambitious conservation efforts, though, have allowed the bison to make a comeback. Today, the Interior Department supports herds of some 11,000 bison across 12 states. Restoring a piece of American history for future generations.</p><p>And that is tonight`s CBS EVENING NEWS PLUS.

According to news reporting from Calgary, Canada, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Forest fires cause extensive damage to ecosystems, biodiversity, and human property, posing significant challenges for emergency response and resource management.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Nserc Discovery Grant; Alberta Innovates \u2018nserc Alliance-alberta Innovates Advance Program' Grant. <br/> The news editors obtained a quote from the research from University of Calgary: \"The accurate and timely delineation of forest fire perimeters is crucial for mitigating these impacts. In this study, methods for delineating forest fire perimeters using near-real-time (NRT) remote sensing data are evaluated. Specifically, the performance of various algorithms-buffer, concave, convex, and combination methods-using VIIRS and MODIS datasets is assessed. It was found that increasing concave a values improves the matching percentage with reference areas but also increases the commission error (CE), indicating overestimation. The results demonstrate that combination methods generally achieve higher matching percentages, but also higher CEs. These findings highlight the trade-off between improved perimeter accuracy and the risk of overestimation.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The insights gained are significant for optimizing sensor data alignment techniques, thereby enhancing rapid response, resource allocation, and evacuation planning in fire management. This research is the first to employ multiple algorithms in both individual and synergistic approaches with NRT or ultra-real-time (URT) active fire data, providing a critical foundation for future studies aimed at improving the accuracy and timeliness of forest fire perimeter assessments. Such advancements are essential for effective disaster management and mitigation strategies.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Comparison of Perimeter Delineation Methods for Remote Sensing Fire Spot Data in Near/Ultra-Real-Time Applications.

According to news originating from D. Serikbayev East Kazakhstan Technical University by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"In 2023 there was a severe forest fire on the territory of the Semipalatinsk Forest. More than 60 thousand ha were burned.\" </p><p><br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from D. Serikbayev East Kazakhstan Technical University: \"This resulted in high environmental costs, destroying trees, real estate, recreational and even human lives. One of the most pressing issues was the determination of the origin and spread of forest fires. In such cases, remote sensing data is a spatial and temporal measure to obtain fast and accurate data to prevent the further spread of the fire and to neutralize this natural disaster. Using such geospatial information, it is possible to prioritize preventive measures to reduce the risk of forest fires and identify mitigating factors to increase the likelihood of immediate fire suppression in threatened areas. This work proposes to assess the fire potential and to determine the hazard potential. This is done by analyzing and mapping the area of the fire that has occurred. The mapping of the fire potential was approached from a remote sensing point of view by estimating and mapping the total vegetation cover using Landsat-8-9 OLI/TIRS DATA and the geographic information systems QGIS, SAGAGIS. A morphometric, spatial analysis of conditions was also conducted, taking into account many factors affecting fire potential-land exposure, aspect, wind direction, fire statistics, population density, climatic characteristics, etc. As a result, an attempt was made to create indices RBR, RdNBR, dNDVI, dGNDI, GEMI and BAI, which could be the basis for the determination of fire potential. These indices are based on the type of tree, the vegetation and the topographic features.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"These characteristics make it possible, after the classification of the Landsat images, to evaluate the reliability of the information obtained by determining the area of the fire through the Object Based Image Analysis segmentation method and by assessing the accuracy of the detected data. The index values identified were consistent with reliable information for identifying fire locations and monitoring estimated fire risk. They could be used to map fire potential from regional to local scales.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Spatial analysis and mapping of potential wildfires from Landsat satellite data.

(Nasdaq: RKLB) has achieved a significant milestone, completing its 56th Electron mission and deploying five satellites for French Internet-of-Things (IoT) constellation operator Kineis.</p><p>The mission, titled \"Ice AIS Baby,\" launched from Rocket Lab's Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand, at 4:55 pm on November 25 NZDT (03:55 UTC). The satellites were deployed into a 643 km low Earth orbit, marking Rocket Lab's 14th mission of 2024 and 56th mission overall.</p><p>This operation pushed the company's total deployed satellites to 203, affirming Electron's status as a leader among small launch vehicles. Notably, this launch occurred just 21 hours and 55 minutes after a successful mission from Launch Complex 2 in Virginia, setting a new company record for the shortest turnaround between launches.</p><p>Rocket Lab founder and CEO Sir Peter Beck highlighted the achievement: \"Two successful launches less than 24 hours apart from pads in different hemispheres. That's unprecedented capability in the small launch market and one we're immensely proud to deliver at Rocket Lab. Customers like Kineis are unlocking the potential of space and we're excited to give them the keys to do so with frequent, dedicated, and reliable small launch opportunities.\"</p><p>Kineis CEO Alexandre Tisserant praised the mission's precision: \"The Kineis teams have once again demonstrated their technical capabilities as satellite operators by taking control of these five new satellites at a sustained launch rate. This achievement would not have been possible without Rocket Lab's Electron precision in placing our satellites in their planned positions.</p><p>\"With 15 Kineis satellites now in orbit, we're one step closer to the full deployment of our dedicated IoT constellation for transmitting data in near-real time, anywhere on the globe. Congratulations to all our teams, who are doing an incredible job - and, let's not forget, a European first! We're equally enthusiastic about our second mission, AIS. In a rapidly consolidating market, Kineis is establishing itself as a sovereign European player, combining technological expertise and strategic independence. With our new AIS offering, we provide maritime players with enhanced visibility over their fleets, while ensuring higher data reliability.\"</p><p>This was the third of five dedicated Electron launches for Kineis, supported by private and public investments, including backing from the French government's space agency CNES and CLS (Collecte Localisation Satellites). The Kineis constellation aims to enable global IoT connectivity by offering near-real-time data transmission with low energy consumption. Applications of the constellation include monitoring water resources, forest fire detection, tracking transport and logistics, and managing infrastructure and energy networks in remote locations.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPCDLY-202411252135043657</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPCDLY2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DH5-8S91-JC3D-Y2NR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">288597</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"473\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Space Daily, Distributed by United Press International</copyright><publicationName>Space Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 25, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC000DS24</classCode><className>ROCKET LAB USA INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS336414 GUIDED MISSILE &amp;

(SEAN MCKEAG / STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER)</p><p>Expand</p><p>Julian Maza, a service forester, Bureau of Forestry for the Pinchot Forest District, said that overall a downward trend in the populations of spongy moths across Pennsylvania is being observed.</p><p>\u201cDCNR will spray 75,000 acres statewide this year, and then last year we sprayed 227,000 acres,\u201d Maza explained, adding the variation in spongy moth populations is typical over years. \u201cThey kind of come in fluctuations, and then they just hit a population collapse.\u201d</p><p>In other words, after a while, they make like a tree and leave.</p><p>A variety of trees are vulnerable to damage, said Tim Latz, assistant district forester in the Bureau of Forestry for the Pinchot State Forest.</p><p>\u201cYou have several species of trees that are highly attractive to spongy moths, so all oak species, most maple, red maple, sugar maple, and almost every species of deciduous trees,\u201d said Latz. \u201cThey don\u2019t like pine that much, so if your forest is mostly pine, you should be OK.\u201d</p><p>Other trees that spongy moths infest include apple, alder, aspen, basswood, birch, hemlock, spruce, tamarack (larch), willows and witch hazel, per DCNR\u2019s press release. Pine is included on the list.</p><p>Latz said prior year infestations can be an indicator of what\u2019s to come for the next year. He said heavy infestation, year over year, is what can lead to tree death.</p><p>\u201cTypically, you need a heavy infestation for two years to really start to see mortality,\u201d Latz explained. \u201cSo, for Lackawanna, Susquehanna, Wayne, Luzerne, Wyoming, which is to the northeast of where the Pinchot is, for those counties, right now, we\u2019re checking for egg masses.\u201d</p><p>Latz said the moths are currently overwintering in an egg stage, and as of now, foresters are \u201cnot really finding high populations of egg masses in those counties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, we expect, at worst, probably moderate, and so I would say it\u2019s going to be more or less nuisance levels in those moderate areas,\u201d he said. Areas that are low or moderate the previous year are probably going to be moderate or high the following year, he added.</p><p>The sprays used to combat spongy moths, per the press release, include Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki (Btk) and Tebufenozide (Mimic), which they describe as \u201csafe and effective products\u201d to suppress infestations. The release also shared information for property owners to find resources to protect their trees, including a list of aerial applicators and expert foresters in each county.</p><p>Maza explained that foresters are available to answer questions about the moths and other questions involving their tree population, and can consult on how and if landowners should treat their property for spongy moths and other afflictions. In Lackawanna County, Maza recommended landowners call the Bureau of Forestry for the Pinchot State Forest\u2019s office in South Abington Twp. at 570-945-7133 for help. He also pointed property owners to the spongy moth page on the DCNR\u2019s website, where he said maps of activity and other resources can be found.</p><p>Jeff King, founder and president of the Pest Rangers, headquartered in Hanover Twp., said he has been called to spray for spongy moths at the request of homeowners who didn\u2019t fall into Pennsylvania\u2019s designated spray areas, leaving them to fend for themselves in terms of cost.</p><p>\u201cPeople have large oak trees that want to save their trees,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll do a number on old oaks.\u201d</p><p>The service isn\u2019t cheap.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen them go from the low end of $695 up to $2,200, and it\u2019s really because we\u2019re doing it from the ground,\u201d he said, explaining that treatment delivered by helicopter covers terrain more efficiently and uses less material.</p><p>He explained that in years past, some homes opted to skip treatment, which didn\u2019t fare well for them.</p><p>\u201cIt looked like a forest fire went through,\u201d he said.</p><p>He advised neighborhoods \u2014 for example, homeowner associations \u2014 to consider pitching in a small amount per house, explaining that homeowners who do it that way can ultimately save money.</p><p>\u201cPeople won\u2019t pay for the treatment, and then they\u2019ll end up paying $1,200 to get the tree taken down,\u201d King said.</p><p>Those who are not willing or able to invest in the spray have other options, such as \u201cmechanical removal\u201d of eggs, which is best for yards with a sparse tree population. Egg masses may be hiding in piles of old wood, building materials and dead branches. They can be scraped into a container, sealed and then disposed of. Wrapping burlap around the trunks of trees and then disposing of the larvae by scraping them into soapy water will kill them, per the DNCR\u2019s spongy moth page.</p><p>\u00a9 2025 The Times-Tribune (Scranton, Pa.).

Students are concerned that there will no longer be a more nutritious food option, but are swayed by chai caramel lattes with extra cream.</p><p>Forever 21 leases Stimson, following the recent closure of their Towson store. Faculty voice their confusion.</p><p>Welsh Hall has been leased to a nursing home, Eagle Ridge At Grand Valley. Eagle Ridge will give more opportunities for overworking as student nurses in the newly created nursing program. Our reporter Xam Ykztinvar found this assisted senior living program on the Nursing Homes To Avoid list of AssistedSeniorliving.net and was happy to hear Goucher is partnering with the worst of the worst.</p><p>The Athenaeum has been sold to Nazi group Hawk White, as they wish to burn more books. All pornographic material will be burned, even as Steve Grate, President of Hawk White, was found yesterday sleeping with two underaged boys. This is a big win for the portion of the student body who wishes there to be less complicated lies thrown in their faces by professors. They will now be told the truth about how many genders there are.</p><p>Generik Shell Inc. has purchased Julia Rogers. No one knows exactly who is behind this company.</p><p>Sheppard Pratt takes over Goucher's Psychology Annex only to find it empty, not filled with crazed monkeys as expected. Crazy Reporter Ykztinvar Xam, requested comments from Psychology students, only to find he had been duped into giving them free therapy. The Neuroscience faculty expressed anger at the neighboring department having the most successful major on campus.</p><p>DuPont Chemical Company has gained control of Hoffberger as they aim to study how to maximize harm to the environment as partners in the new Masters of Environmental Destruction and Biological Warfare. 4+1 programs will be offered with the old online hybrid anti-corporate Justice of Science major.</p><p>Worker owned construction company McCarthy will be taking the land where Myerhoff stands and building their new headquarters. McCarthy representative Janet Wilty said they \"were upset to learn Goucher had only given them 38 years, instead of the 50 years plus option to buy that Whiting and Turner has.\"</p><p>In a surprise turn, the Student Recreations Center is exempted from leasing. When asked why, administrators told reporters the sports teams had the greatest puppy eyes ever imagined. New athletics director Kathlin Helstcher denies this, and says, \"they held their place as the aspect of the institution that brings the most value.\"</p><p>Goucher faces a lawsuit, having double-booked the full time leases with a Republican Youth training camp over the whole campus this summer. Bradly Yapper '27 is \"severely disappointed in Goucher\" as he was set to work as an assistant manager for the camp. Goucher paid 3 million for the rights to host this event. The Goucher Dean of Students claims, \"this would have brought much needed publicity and diversity of thought to this campus.\" Lawyers' fees are estimated to be over 8 million dollars.</p><p>1960s GOUCHER STUDENTS DISCOVERED IN DORSEY NUCLEAR SHELTER</p><p>69 Gophers, students, faculty, and staff were discovered forgotten in the basement fallout shelter under Dorsey Center, after the administration opened it to try to sell it. They claim they went for a tour, but got locked in and were forgotten about for the last sixty years. Lisa Weary '64 was outraged to learn that \"gays and communists have taken over the school.\" Conversely, Pamela Bahgly '65 was excited to learn more about safe sex in modern times, as the last discussion of the sort she attended was the Goucher Reverend's \"sex sermon.\"</p><p>Angela Jenrick '63 said she is \"glad to see the progress made on racially integrating the campus, even as [she] disapproves of the decision to admit men.\" Facilities Management Services claim \"they were unaware of the bunker\" despite cleaning records showing they sent services in, and it being a primary location in the Emergency Action Plan.</p><p>All sixty of the bunker group signed a petition to bring back the Tone Committee as they desire more control and sensibility over Goucher's fashion. Grace Pembory '67 is \"dismayed by the Student Government Association and desires a return to House culture and rule.\"</p><p>Goucher's Radio club discovers that the Goucher radio station has actually been on the air for the last twenty years thanks to 1960's Gophers who listened to radio while stuck.</p><p>Students inspired by conversations with the 1960 crew argue that the Board of Overseers should return, as they claim Goucher is not corporate enough. The Board of Overseers was an organization created by President Kraushaar to help local business owners appreciate Goucher by acting in a purely advisory role. This worked as significant donations came in, but the promise of not allowing them on the Board of Trustees was broken, as the two boards eventually merged.</p><p>Leading this effort is Frank Ly, class of 2026, who argues, \"Goucher students don't pay enough in tuition, Goucher needs to take the future on with a proper corporate attitude.\" He also criticized Quindecim reporter Jimy Kuhn, saying \"the Quindecim needs to not let hippie lunatics who want peace, love, and plants publish their work.\"</p><p>Goucher President Jack Trickle responded by saying \"Goucher will never sell out its values of family and community, which is why we are inviting so many helpful groups on campus-so they can create more opportunities for our community.\"</p><p>NEW HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM SHOCKS STUDENTS</p><p>Goucher expects students will need to take transit between the two campuses in a decade, so is starting on plans to build a High Speed Rail between the campuses in collaboration with Brightline.</p><p>Quindecim Transit expert Olim Namrevlis '27 voices concerns over how fast this will be built and worries about all the car owners on campus. \"With this rapid three month plan, the community will not have the time to set schedules around this. The richest among us will pay the brunt, and that is not okay.\" He couched his statement: \"Brightline thinks through the impacts of their projects and takes absolutely no government money, so I trust them to slow down the project and think about the bottom line for the college.\"</p><p>Vincent Grahmon '28 says, \"With college students using trains, the death rate of this development will be too low. The system should divert itself to pass by an elementary school.\" Bunker students started teaching games and songs from their time transiting between campuses to the modern students who will soon face a similar commute.</p><p>GENETICALLY MODIFIED SQUIRRELS BREACH CONTAINMENT</p><p>B.A.S.S. squirrels escape from the trap set in the bunker and wreak havoc on campus. Bald Assed Squirrels Syndrome, first reported in the 1995 Undecim by C.I. Meyers are genetically altered squirrels which mysteriously disappeared in 1996. They are responsible for incidents such as The Wall forest fire, Max's Great Fall, and for stealing a couch cushion from the library. Professor Christopher Torres was seen being chased down Van Meter Highway. Students are warned to steer clear. More mayhem is expected as President Trickle refuses to respond. Administrators who spoke on the condition of anonymity, claim everyone is afraid, and this is the true reason for leasing everything away-to escape it all.</p><p>GOUCHER COLLEGE RETURNS TO WOMEN-ONLY ROOTS</p><p>Following the bunker incident, protests over Goucher being Co-Educational re-erupt, pushing the board of trustees to return Goucher's status as a Women's College. Days into the change, students who responded to the Goucher Poll say they noticed no changes. Separately, the Goucher Poll announced it is too successful to remain named after this shitty institution and is changing its name to \"Lirpa Sloof Polling Corporation\" and is looking to scale up. Documents recently uncovered with help from insiders Nina K. and Bill H. (names redacted for privacy) show that the Poll owns Generik Shell inc.</p><p>After a week of Chaos, the Committee on Bunker People unanimously decides to force 1960s era Gophers back under Dorsey. Will Goucher force visiting Alumni from Alumni Weekend to join them? What will happen to them? Please petition Goucher to let me in the old nuclear bunker so we can all find out.</p><p>All above pieces by Xam Ykztinvar, '28.</p><p>DOES KENT \"FREAK IT?\" AND IF SO, HOW?</p><p>To freak, or not to freak. This is the timeless question we must ask of the lords of our institutions. The action of freaking carries great and complex meaning. It is not always good, it is not always bad. It is not inherently sexual. Freaking is freaking; and a freak is a freak. We must open our minds as we ponder this, in relation to our president Kent Devereaux. A great man, and a puzzle at times. The question of whether Kent freaks seems impossible to answer at first thought. After all, he seems quite the private man, how could we successfully speculate on his freaky nature or lack thereof? Well, there are some notable sciences that we can look to for answers. By respecting these pillars of thought, perhaps we can answer this question. And depending on the answer, ponder greater details of the noble Kent Devereaux.</p><p>My first piece of evidence was intended to be a deep analysis of Kent Devereaux's birth sign, and the implications of it. Unfortunately, despite searching his Wikipedia page, I couldn't find his birthday.</p><p>My second piece of evidence is his incredible fashion style. There is often great intention in the way a person presents. And if we analyze Kent's fashion, we find powerful details. A clean cut style, composed and practiced. And that hat, what a magnificent hat. It speaks of charm, wit, and a coolness to pierce through the crowd. That is the hat of a man who could freak.</p><p>Now that we have thoroughly and conclusively proven the freaky nature of Kent Devereaux, we must elaborate on the freaky nature that he almost certainly possesses. What mystifyingly magical activities occur in Kent's house after the sun sets? What fascinatingly fantastic feats have been performed? Perchance. We can attempt to guess from what we already know of him. He has great musical experience, so perhaps he plays the fiddle to enchant all his house guests. There is also his aforementioned hat. Perhaps late at night, he puts the hat back on, spins it around once or twice, and summons the \"dawg in him\" to unleash furious passion out onto the world. He is often withdrawn from the public eye, but is that because he fears the spotlight, or because he simply doesn't need one to stun his audience?\u00a0</p><p>Kent Devereaux is certainly a mystery, one that may never be solved while I still walk this campus. However, some things we are sure about in regard to him. We know he has an awesome hat. And we also know he freaks it. In these dark times, let these two facts be of solace to you, to guide you past murky rivers and eerie lands, into a comfortable bed of safety and understanding.</p><p>By Dragonslayer Willow, '26</p><p>A Galloping Success: Goucher's Jousting Team Makes It to Playoffs</p><p>Archibald Fletcher, '26, takes a victory lap after winning the joust of war.</p><p>In a tumultuous match, Goucher's jousting team beat Salisbury to advance to the playoff round. The team presented a remarkable display of athleticism, performing particularly well in the ring joust. \"Salisbury had copper rings instead of brass. Their athletics budget must be a lot higher than ours,\" observed Bartholomew Gardiner, '26. Gardiner represented his team during the ring portion, successfully hooking the ring on his lance during all three passes and winning the round 3-2.</p><p>Emotions ran high during the joust of war. After a hotly competitive training season, Archibald Fletcher, '25, was selected to represent Goucher for this portion of the tournament. During the first pass, Fletcher inadvertently formed a barricade with his lance, breaking it in half. Since this is not considered a legal break, the jousters had to reset and Fletcher's lance was replaced. After this incident, Fletcher showed sheer force and skill during every pass. He unhorsed his opponent twice, before shattering his lance on his opponent's chest plate to win the joust.</p><p>Goucher's equestrian stables worked alongside the jousting team to select the most capable horses. Following careful deliberation, Bucephalus and Nosewise were chosen to join the athletes for the tournament. Their specialized training involved subjecting the horses to random bugle fanfare to ensure they didn't startle during the joust. \"Percival was a strong candidate, but due to frequent biting incidents, he didn't make the cut,\" explained the stable manager.</p><p>Goucher's stunning victory was met with numerous \"Huzzah!\"s from the crowd. The team is set to advance to the regional playoffs, where they will face York College first. \"I'm very proud of my team this season,\" Fletcher commented. \"I hope we win regionals because the prize turkey sounds really delicious.\"</p><p>By Stella Rose '26</p><p>\"A MINECRAFT MOVIE\" IS PEAK CINEMA</p><p>The title says it all. There has never been a movie as great as Warner Bros' \"A Minecraft Movie\", released Friday, April 4th. Words can't describe the 1 hour, 34 minutes, and 34 seconds long masterpiece the world has the honor of watching. But for those of you unable to see it for yourselves, I guess I'll have to take up the monumental task of transcribing such perfect art.</p><p>Where to start? I love exposition, and if you love it too, you're in luck. Almost every second of this movie's runtime is spent narrating what's on screen-and it's amazing! We're force fed information because the directors rightfully know audiences can't understand what's going on in their movie.</p><p>The writing is just impeccable, and the humor exquisite. Stellar lines like \"Two big buffalos like us out there, in the wild, wearing unisex turquoise blazers. Oh man, that's gonna cause a commotion\" had the entire theater guffawing. We also get sentimental moments such as people sharing incredibly personal details of their life unprompted, so that the camera can pan to one of our main characters tilting their head in confusion. So much character depth! So hilarious!</p><p>I was on the edge of my seat the entire movie with its incredible pacing and well-earned tension. I loved each and every one of the 25 minutes it takes for the characters to reach the new Minecraft universe. The totally new and steller isekai plotline is a treat to watch!</p><p>Of course, I can't forget about the breathtaking visuals. It was a great choice to place real actors in a hyper realistic CGI setting. It puts an exciting spin on the boring normal Minecraft style. Creepers with fur uplift the movie to even greater heights!</p><p>\"A Minecraft Movie\" is a must-watch for the whole family. It's a testament to great cinema that you'll be able to meme it for years after its box-office breaking release. Don't miss out on this historical moment!</p><p>By Jaiden Johnson '27</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-6121368</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FHJ-42R3-RRMD-M3P0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2567\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Quindecim: Goucher College</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 8, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC0002I4N</classCode><className>E I DU PONT DE NEMOURS &amp;

(Nasdaq: RKLB) (\"Rocket Lab\" or \"the Company\"), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today successfully launched its 59th Electron mission, deploying five satellites to Low Earth Orbit for French Internet-of-Things (IoT) constellation operator Kin\u00e9is.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This press release features multimedia.

(Photo: Business Wire)</p><p>The \"IOT 4 You and Me\" mission lifted-off from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand at 9:43 am NZDT on 9 February (20:43 UTC), successfully deploying five satellites to a 647 km low Earth orbit. The mission was Rocket Lab's first Electron launch of 2025, fourth launch for Kin\u00e9is to date, and 59th Electron launch overall.</p><p>Rocket Lab founder and CEO Sir Peter Beck said: \"That's four launches done and one still to go for Kin\u00e9is, then we'll have deployed their entire constellation in less than a year. It's not uncommon for constellation operators to wait longer than that for their first launch, let alone have a full constellation deployed and operating. Once again Electron has shown its strength as a pinpoint accurate constellation launcher that lets customers tailor missions and schedules to their needs.\"</p><p>Kin\u00e9is CTO Michel Sarthou said: \"Producing 25 nanosatellites and launching them into orbit in just eight months is an unprecedented feat-and above all, a remarkable challenge! With this fourth and penultimate launch, Kin\u00e9is moves one step closer to its ambitious goal: delivering global IoT coverage through a complete constellation of 25 nanosatellites. This milestone showcases the expertise and determination of our teams and partners like Rocket Lab. We are deeply grateful for the unwavering support and commitment we have received since Kin\u00e9is was founded.\"</p><p>The Kin\u00e9is constellation is designed to make it possible to connect and locate any connected object anywhere in the world, enabling data transmission to users in near-real time, at low bit rates and with very low energy consumption. By enabling internet connection to the Earth's most remote locations, Kin\u00e9is constellation can support forest fire detection, water resource management, infrastructure and energy network monitoring, transport and logistics tracking, and much more.</p><p>The launch date for the fifth Kin\u00e9is launch in this series of missions will be announced in the coming weeks.</p><p>The next Electron launch is scheduled for lift-off in February, with the specific launch window and customer details to be announced in the coming days.</p><p>Launch images: <url normalizedValue=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.flickr.com%2Fphotos%2Frocketlab%2Falbums%2F72177720323462623&amp;esheet=54202393&amp;newsitemid=20250208666499&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.flickr.com%2Fphotos%2Frocketlab%2Falbums%2F72177720323462623&amp;index=1&amp;md5=691d3701f975cdced250502c516644f6\">https://www.flickr.com/photos/rocketlab/albums/72177720323462623</url></p><p>Launch webcast: <url normalizedValue=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D7Al5hWmjoxQ&amp;esheet=54202393&amp;newsitemid=20250208666499&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D7Al5hWmjoxQ&amp;index=2&amp;md5=a3b1b05e06f07d94588f262f91b9f67e\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Al5hWmjoxQ</url></p><p>+ About Rocket Lab</p><p>Founded in 2006, Rocket Lab is an end-to-end space company with an established track record of mission success.

They are open to managing such growth with a partial investor, Roger Smullen said.Saratoga, Calif.-based Earth Foundries upcycles forest waste into carbon negative products such as biochar and green energy to combat help wildfires and global warming in California. The company's main clients include the state government and some private companies who have a stake in wildfire damage. </p><p>Founded in 2021, the company is still getting on its feet, but already has projects that will contribute to its aggressive growth, Smullen said.Business at a Glance8 employees (full-time and part-time)Doubled revenue from 2022 to 2023Profitable in 2023400 acres treated since 202110,000 tons of forest waste upcycledOver 600 tons of biochar createdSmullen is looking to expand the company's scale by buying another pyrolysis machine, the technology that allows for the creation of the biochar through carbon sequestration, by expanding into upcycling agricultural waste and by creating a product service management structure called an Incident Command System (ICS) so the company can deploy its services where they are needed most after a wildfire has ravaged parts of the Californian landscape. The company's ideal investor would be able to provide capital in order to fund such growth plans in the coming years.The move into agricultural waste would help remove the seasonality of the business as forest waste and wildfire remediation is primarily done in the summer and spring, while agricultural waste is primarily cleaned in the fall and winter, after a harvest.The company's main competitors in the region are companies that pileburn the wood waste after a wildfire, which further contributes to global warming and is less effective in cleaning a forest of wood waste.Both native Californians, Dede Smullen has prior experience in dealing with environmental policy as the president and CEO of Wildlife Urban Interface while Roger Smullen used to work in product market and development in the semiconductor industry.\"We were heart-broken by the loss of life, property and livelihoods that the wildfires in California caused, so we decided to do something about it. We're currently partnering on a 365-acre hazardous fuels reduction project in the San Francisco Bay Area, and it's the largest mobile pyrolysis project of its kind in the state. This is just the beginning as we expand our mobile pyrolysis capacity in 2024.\"</p><h>DEAL SIZE</h><p>$ 1-25 Million</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DADEAL-0000018ef6f4d613a3def6fe73350001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DADEAL2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BWB-3M61-JBSN-1005-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244689</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"444\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Deal, L.L.C.

This year's report covers 20 years of state air monitoring data for air pollutants regulated under the Clean Air Act, including ground-level ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, particle pollution and lead. The report presents data from the 2023 calendar year, including the historic 2023 Canadian wildfire smoke events.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center, 15 million hectares (about two million acres larger than the state of Wisconsin) burned in 2023 - more than six times the annual average in Canada.</p><p>\"Five percent of the entire Canadian forest burned last year,\" said Gail Good, DNR Air Management program director. \"During the multi-day air quality advisory in late June of last year, the air monitoring network measured some of the highest PM2.5 concentrations ever recorded in the state.\"</p><p>Wildfire smoke events in 2023 resulted in the DNR issuing 15 PM2.5 air quality advisories - almost five times higher than the average over the previous 12 years. PM2.5 advisories are issued when air quality has reached or is expected to reach the orange \"unhealthy for sensitive groups\" level on the Air Quality Index (AQI).</p><p>The design values used to assess PM2.5 concentrations are calculated over a three-year period. This year's Trends Report shows an increase in PM2.5 concentrations for the most recent period (2021-2023). Despite the jump caused by 2023's wildfire smoke, overall, PM2.5 concentrations have decreased 25% in the last 20 years, and all monitors measured concentrations below the 2012 federal air quality standards.</p><p>The report shows that over the last 20 years, statewide ozone concentrations have decreased by 15%. For decades, ozone concentrations have been dropping across the state. However, that trend has slowed. Last year's wildfire smoke contained ozone-forming pollutants, which, combined with recent warmer-than-usual summers, contributed to increased ozone concentrations.</p><p>As a result, the Lake Michigan shoreline area, including the Milwaukee area and parts of Sheboygan and Kenosha counties, continues to fall short of meeting the 2015 ozone standard. Wisconsin has implemented many programs that have reduced emissions of ozone-causing pollutants from power plants, industry and transportation in the state. However, these emission reductions have not resulted in the attainment of the 2015 ozone standard because most ozone-causing emissions are transported across state boundaries and are outside Wisconsin's control.</p><p>To better illustrate the latest trends, the DNR updated its Air Quality Trends Report Interactive StoryMap (<url normalizedValue=\"https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/81082a373d334042b5381a86a34bb04b\">https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/81082a373d334042b5381a86a34bb04b</url>), which shows Wisconsin's air quality trends for each pollutant over the last 20 years.

But what about the EPs? The shorter projects call for a shorter list, so here are the five best EPs of 2024.</p><p>READ MORE: Editor's pick: The top 10 albums of 2024</p><p>5. \"Sweet Boy pt. 1\" by Malcolm Todd</p><p>Originally an EP at the start of the year, \"Sweet Boy pt. 1\" is composed of five alternative and indie songs and is an easy and fun listen. \"4Me 4Me\" is the best of the project, led by an addicting bounce and layered vocals.</p><p>Other tracks like \"Ladygirl\" and \"Thailand\" continue this vibe. Todd created an exciting experience on \"Sweet Boy pt. 1\" that is both danceable and chill, and it's absolutely worth a listen.</p><p>4. \"Descanso\" by Angela Mu\u00f1oz</p><p>This EP cultivates a heavenly feel in every single song. The 20-minute listen is well worth it; it's an experience that envelopes you fully into the music. The way the project flows is similar to Steve Lacy's \"The Lo-Fis:\" The songs almost combine into one another while keeping their own style.</p><p>But what truly makes this EP great is Angela Mu\u00f1oz's ethereal voice. \"Forest Fire\" is perhaps the best song, but \"Descanso\" as a whole is worth a listen.</p><p>3. \"For You\" by Troy Javelona</p><p>For those who enjoy a good R&amp;B and soul feel, this EP is \"For You.\" Each song flows into one another without sounding too much of the same, and though the project only lasts 17 minutes, it's still a joyful and complete ride.</p><p>Songs like \"Dance\" are groovy while songs like \"Letting Go\" are memorable and slower. The titular song \"For You\" is a good balance between the bright and joyful songs and the unhurried and more meaningful music within the EP.</p><p>2. \"JRNY\" by Jordan Ward and Joony</p><p>When looking for a chill vibe, look no further. \"JRNY\" is consistently relaxed while being upbeat one song and slow on the next. The layering of music and voices is what makes this EP stand out, especially in the track \"Jealousy.\" Whether played in the background or listened to through AirPods, all the songs have the ability to change the atmosphere in the best way possible.</p><p>Ultimately, the EP gives off similarities to Brent Faiyaz's songs \"Been away\" and \"Trust\" while still having its own flavor. So for those who enjoy Faiyaz's work, this EP could expand your taste.</p><p>1. \"14 minutes\" by Dominic Fike</p><p>Dominic Fike's newest EP is the epitome of summer music. It is meant to be blasted in the car on a hot summer day, or - quite honestly - every day of the year.</p><p>While listening, each song stands out and is memorable: TikTok sensation \"misses\" is fun and upbeat, \"hi grace\" is a catchy autotune and piano-filled hit, and \"coast2coast\" is quick and thrilling.</p><p>If anything, the biggest downfall of the project is it being only 14 minutes. Yet, it only being that long is what makes it iconic. Every song hits and this EP is a good way to spend 14 minutes of any day.</p><p>Editor's note: The opinions presented in this review are the author's and do not imply any endorsement from The State Press or its editors.</p><p>Edited by Andrew Dirst, Sophia Braccio and Natalia Jarrett.</p><p>Reach the reporter at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:sjames51@asu.edu\">sjames51@asu.edu</email> and follow @sennajames_ on X.</p><p>Like The State Press on Facebook and follow @statepress on X.</p><p>Senna JamesCommunity Editor</p><p>Senna is a sophomore studying journalism and mass communication with a minor in Spanish.

According to news originating from Shenzhen, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"In urban smart city environments, traffic hazards can lead to catastrophic outcomes, including significant property losses and severe threats to public safety.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Key Technologies Research And Development Program. <br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Shenzhen University: \"Conventional traffic monitoring systems are limited in terms of accuracy and speed, presenting significant challenges for real-time traffic surveillance. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces the GC-YOLOv9 algorithm. Specifically, we have enhanced the YOLOv9 model by incorporating Ghost Convolution, markedly improving the model's perceptual abilities and detection accuracy. Furthermore, this study designed an integrated smart city framework that includes layers for service applications, the Internet of Things, edge processing, and data centers. By deploying the enhanced YOLOv9 model within this framework, our method achieved mAP@0.5 scores of 77.15 and 74.95 on the BDD100K and Cityscapes datasets, respectively, surpassing existing technologies.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Additionally, the potential applications of this method in public area fire safety management, forest fire monitoring, and intelligent security systems further underscore its significant value in improving the safety and efficiency of smart cities.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: GC-YOLOv9: Innovative smart city traffic monitoring solution.

He served in the US Forest Service as a timber cruiser, hotshot, smokejumper, incident commander, burn boss, Wyoming state fire trainer, Fremont County rural firefighter and forester for forty-four years in his conservation calling. Karl and his wife, Marilyn, have been blessed with three children and nine grandchildren, and currently reside in Lander, Wyoming.<br/><br/>\"At 3:30 p.m. on August 21, 1937, the Blackwater Fire 'blew up' west of Cody, Wyoming, on the Shoshone National Forest,\" shares Brauneis. \"Fifteen firefighters perish in the conflagration and more than forty are injured. Travel back in time to the horse and mule days of a frontier state and engage a forest fire in the rugged Absaroka Mountains. Gain the upper hand then see it all go so terribly wrong in a matter of seconds.<br/><br/>\"How do we as individuals and organizations respond to disaster when tragedy strikes? Do we investigate to study and draw conclusions? Do we analyze the situation and file a report to be forgotten? Is that enough? Or do we say, 'No! There has to be more.' There must be a new beginning. The fallen cry out for it.<br/><br/>\"Soon, young men will parachute from airplanes to hang up in trees and attack forest fires before they become the next tragedy. They will call themselves smokejumpers, and they will be the first to get there, and they will carry the Blackwater with them in the 'crack of silk' as they jump the big sky over our western forests.\"<br/><br/>Published by Covenant Books of Murrells Inlet, South Carolina, Karl Brauneis's new book not only honors the fallen heroes of the Blackwater Fire, but also explores the resilience and innovation that was born from that day of tragedy and loss. Drawing upon the author's own years of service as a forest firefighter, \"The Blackwater Fire and the Men Who Fought It\" reveals how tragedy can spur profound change, and how individuals and organizations can turn their deepest losses into the seeds for future growth.<br/><br/>Readers can purchase \"The Blackwater Fire and the Men Who Fought It: How Firefighters Turned Tragedy into New Beginnings\" at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon or Barnes and Noble.<br/><br/>Covenant Books is an international Christian owned and operated publishing house based in Murrells Inlet, South Carolina.

The mission was Rocket Lab's 14th mission of 2024 and 56th launch overall. It also brought the total count of satellites deployed by Rocket Lab to 203, further cementing Electron's position as the leading small launch vehicle globally. The launch took place just 21 hours and 55 minutes after Rocket Lab completed a successful mission from Launch Complex 2 in Virginia, setting a new company record for fastest turnaround between launches.</p><p>Rocket Lab founder and CEO Sir Peter Beck said: \"Two successful launches less than 24 hours apart from pads in different hemispheres. That's unprecedented capability in the small launch market and one we're immensely proud to deliver at Rocket Lab. Customers like Kineis are unlocking the potential of space and we're excited to give them the keys to do so with frequent, dedicated, and reliable small launch opportunities.\"</p><p>Kineis CEO Alexandre Tisserant, says: \"The Kineis teams have once again demonstrated their technical capabilities as satellite operators by taking control of these five new satellites at a sustained launch rate. This achievement would not have been possible without Rocket Lab's Electron precision in placing our satellites in their planned positions. With 15 Kineis satellites now in orbit, we're one step closer to the full deployment of our dedicated IoT constellation for transmitting data in near-real time, anywhere on the globe. Congratulations to all our teams, who are doing an incredible job - and, let's not forget, a European first! We're equally enthusiastic about our second mission, AIS. In a rapidly consolidating market, Kineis is establishing itself as a sovereign European player, combining technological expertise and strategic independence.

According to news reporting out of Kunming, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Forest fires often cause many casualties and property losses, and it is important to explore the time and space laws of forest fires and the influencing factors.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Science And Technology Special Project of Southwest United Graduate School-major Projects of Basic Research And Applied Basic Research; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Yunnan Key Project of Basic Research; Yunnan Normal University's Research And Innovation Fund. <br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Yunnan Normal University: \"The present study used the cities (prefectures) crossed by the Tropic of Cancer (Yunnan section) as the study area. Based on burned land data, a combination of natural factors, such as climate, topography, vegetation, and human activities, such as distance from settlements and population density, a binary logistic regression model, and a boosted regression tree model, were used to analyze the temporal-spatial characteristics and influencing factors of forest fires in 2000 to 2020. The following results were obtained: (1) During 2000-2020, the overall forest fire area in the study area showed a trend of fluctuating decline. The high incidence period of forest fires occurred in 2010. After 2010, the forest fire area in the study area was greatly reduced. (2) The forest fire area in the study area was greater in the east and less in the west.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The forest fire areas in Wenshan Prefecture and Honghe Prefecture in the east were larger, accounting for 68%, and the forest fire areas in Pu'er City, Lincang City, and Yuxi City in the west were smaller, accounting for only 32%. (3) The contribution rate of the average precipitation and average temperature factors ranked in the top two in the two driving force analysis models, which indicated that precipitation and temperature had a significant effect on the incidence of forest fires in the study area.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Temporal-Spatial Characteristics and Influencing Factors of Forest Fires in the Tropic of Cancer (Yunnan Section).

The fire likely will continue to burn as the dry, warm weather is forecast to continue for the next week.</p><p>The fire has not prompted any trail or area closures. People planning to travel in that part of the Eagle Cap Wilderness should call the Wallowa Mountains Office at 541-426-5546.</p><p>Under a Forest Service policy in place for more than 30 years, fire managers can monitor, rather than try to extinguish, lightning-caused fires in the Eagle Cap, Oregon's biggest federal wilderness at 360,000 acres.</p><p>Officials typically monitor such fires so long as they don't threaten private property or public safety.</p><p>___ (c)2024 the Baker City Herald (Baker City, Ore.)

I never planned to be an officer.</p><p>\"I think I've been very lucky and I would be the first person to realise that.</p><p>\"I didn't set a goal that I was going to be firemaster. Most of the things just happened.\"</p><p>Mr Grant passed away peacefully at Raigmore Hospital on Sunday, February 2, at the age of 84. He was laid to rest by family, friends and colleagues in Inverness on Monday.</p><p>Inverness became home from an early age. At just six months old, his parents John and Christine Grant moved back north with older sisters Jean, Irene and Elizabeth, later joined by the arrival of youngest sibling, sister Jaye.</p><p>Schooled at Merkinch Primary, then the High School, the young Donnie was always sporty and football was a passion.</p><p>He became boot boy for Clach and went on to play for the 'juveniles' side Clach Rangers, with his promise attracting scouts from the rather larger Glasgow Rangers who wanted him to join their youth team.</p><p>Only 15 at the time, concerned dad John declined to give parental blessing.</p><p>Instead, he became an apprentice mechanical engineer with the firm Mackenzie and Co before the then-Northern Area Fire Brigade took notice of his football ability. He joined the day after finishing his apprenticeship in 1961.</p><p>As step-daughter Roslyn Main recounts: \"At the time, they would say you didn't even get to be a fireman unless you could play football! He was sort of head-hunted to join the Fire Brigade on the basis of his football skills.\"</p><p>Mr Grant said in the Courier interview: \"The fire service was looked on as a very secure job, which it still is today. That was the main reason I applied.</p><p>\"One good thing about the fire service is that everybody starts as a firefighter. Nobody can come in at the middle. You start at the bottom and how far you get is entirely up to yourself.\"</p><p>Secure it might be, but this was no cushy number. Candidates to join needed good lung capacity, a head for heights and other entry tests including vertigo and claustrophobia checks.</p><p>Mr Grant had to pass arithmetic and dictation exams and prove he could carry a 12-stone man for 100 yards in a minute.</p><p>Satisfying all criteria, he was sent to the Scottish Fire Service Training School at Gullane near Edinburgh for three months, winning the firemaster's prize for best recruit.</p><p/><p>Little did he know then, but by 1995, after stepping down as firemaster, he would return to the Gullane establishment as commandant, a role he fulfilled through to 2001.</p><p>He spent four years stationed in Thurso, returning to Inverness in 1971, rising to assistant then full divisional officer, then deputy firemaster in 1976.</p><p>As well as being a people person, he tirelessly attended fire brigade events and functions throughout the vast Highlands and Islands area - including a recruitment drive in Out Skerries off Shetland.</p><p>Another crucial role was overseeing the response to major critical incidents.</p><p>He later served as chairman of the Scottish branch of the Chief and Assistant Chief Fire Officers' Association; as advisor to the National Joint Council for Local Authorities' Fire Brigades; and on Cosla's proactive services committee.</p><p>Among the most infamous were major fires at the Inverness Railway Club, , Union Street's Methodist Church, a vast forest fire at Carrbridge,  and the Aviemore Four Seasons Hotel blaze.</p><p>His closest personal escape in frontline service came at a house fire in Old Edinburgh Road when a cylinder in his breathing apparatus became stuck in the joists. Luckily, he was hauled to safety by a colleague.</p><p>He kept talk of the horrors of the job, the tragedies and despair of pulling bodies from buildings, mostly within colleague circles, while admitting in interview: \"I have had more than my fair share.\"</p><p>Away from those distinguished working years, football remained an ever-present passion.</p><p>His exploits with Caley in 1964-65 brought a famous Scottish Cup victory over Raith Rovers and defeat to now defunct Third Lanark, with a goal from him in the 5-1 beating at Telford Street.</p><p>In the latter 80s, he served as referee and linesman.</p><p>He was also a prominent member of the UK-wide Fire Service Sports and Athletics Association, initially as a player, before heading up the organisation for a stint as president.</p><p>Not long before retirement, he said: \"I enjoy going to my work. I have made many new friends throughout the UK and I have had a lot of happy times.</p><p>\"Looking back, I definitely made the right move in joining the fire service all those years ago.\"</p><p>Above all, Mr Grant was a natural when it came to coaxing and looking after staff.</p><p>While he was awarded a richly-deserved OBE, also earning the Queen's Fire Service Medal (QFSM) for his dedicated service, he was just as comfortable conversing with the high and mighty as he was with colleagues and new recruits.</p><p/><p>Ross Nixon, a retired Highland area group commander, recalls: \"Donnie was an extremely well-respected and admired member of the Northern Area and Highlands and Islands fire brigade.</p><p>\"That was not only for his meritorious service as firemaster but for his contribution and dedication to the fire service's sports and athletics association, particularly football, across the UK.</p><p>\"Donnie's influence on the fire service continues to be evident today.</p><p>\"The current chief and deputy chief of the Scottish Fire and Rescue service were recruit firefighters while Donnie was commandant of the fire service training school in Gullane, East Lothian from 1995 to 2001.</p><p>The values of fairness, hard work and integrity that were the hallmarks of Donnie's tenure as commandant therefore continue to be a thread woven into the fabric of today's Scottish service.</p><p>Retired John Cheadle, a former divisional commander based in Inverness, served while Mr Grant was deputy firemaster to Bill Shand.</p><p>\"The first thing that comes to mind when I think of Donnie is football!\" Mr Cheadle said.</p><p>\"While he was firemaster, he was president of the sports and athletics association for the whole of the UK and a real driving force in it.</p><p>\"He was deputy when our Fire Brigade football team won the UK national championships. We only had about 60 or 70 to choose from, but they won against brigades of 3000 or more.</p><p>\"Before I came up here, if you applied for a job as a firefighter, I'm told it helped greatly if you had a talent with a ball at your feet!</p><p>\"Thankfully, Donnie really did. He went on to enjoy a fine career and became a very good deputy, then firemaster after Bill Shand retired, in my time.</p><p>\"He was very popular, which is saying something for someone who serves as firemaster as you sometimes have to make some not very nice decisions.</p><p>\"Donnie was a very friendly, chirpy character and seemed to get on with everybody.\"</p><p>The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service's local senior officer for Highland, area commander Michael Humphreys, said: \"Our thoughts are with Donald Grant's family at this difficult time.</p><p>\"Donald was a well-respected firefighter and officer, having served as Firemaster of the Highland and Islands Fire Brigade and Commandant of the Scottish Fire Service Training School in Gullane.</p><p>\"Known as Donnie to many of his friends, he was responsible for shaping a great many fire service careers.</p><p>\"He will be sadly missed by his family and former colleagues in the service.\"</p><p>Mr Grant is survived by wife Pat, children Rosalyn, Jenny and Don and his beloved grandchildren Brittany, Shaun, Ellie, Amy, Teigan and Isla.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Donnie Grant OBE, former Highlands and Islands firemaster.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVNSS-375811</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVNSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F8J-H8J3-S4VM-S519-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">488007</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1484\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Highland News and Media Ltd.

According to news reporting from Saskatoon, Canada, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"In the Arctic, environment and health are linked in myriad ways. A key emphasis has been on numerous long-lived contaminants in traditional foods, particularly marine mammals, and their well-documented impacts on human, animal and environmental health ('One health approach').\" </p><p><br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from the University of Saskatchewan, \"More recent concerns for Indigenous communities focus on the (side) effects of the switch to a modern, processed diet, which is accompanied by a loss of tradition and emerging health impacts. Furthermore, the availability of traditional foods is increasingly threatened by the impacts of climate change, which also causes the emergence and spread of new and old diseases, such as anthrax. Climate change, including thawing permafrost and new forest fire regimes, threatens the built environment and infrastructure. In particular, well-built, planned, and healthy housing is urgently needed, given that much time is spent indoors. Health care, particularly for remote and Indigenous communities, is sparse, and often ignores traditional knowledge and local languages. Indigenous communities in the Arctic continue to suffer from marginalization, resource colonization/extraction, and the impacts of racism. Recent examples of the green energy transition, such as in Norway, continue a pattern of ignoring Indigenous rights and lifestyles.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Overall, the connection between environment and health in the Arctic is multifaceted and complex, and investigations and solutions ought to embrace an interdisciplinary and holistic approach toward improving Environmental and Human Health in the region.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Perspective: Dimensions of Environment and Health in Arctic Communities.

In this case, the communication topology\u2019s weights may be negative, unlike most other conventional studies where the communication weights should have positive and constant values. Thus, the proposed algorithm resists changes in communication weights. The primary goal of the control strategy is to minimize control effort while ensuring fast convergence to the desired formation. Additionally, the algorithm allows agents to continuously adjust key formation parameters, such as orientation, centroid, and scale, providing flexibility and adaptability during formation. Information about the desired trajectory, rotational velocity, and scale of the formation is given to only one of the directly connected followers through a virtual leader to realize time-varying formation tracking. The designed controller, which is considered fully distributed, can be applied to modern commercial large-scale systems because it does not require information about the eigenvalues of the communication topology. Numerical simulations are implemented to validate the theoretical findings.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>The cooperative control of multi-agent robotic systems has captured significant interest because of its extensive applications in fields such as localization, load transportation, forest fire monitoring, agricultural observation, and maritime rescue1, 2, 3, 4, 5\u20136. Compared to single and expensive robots, a group of small and inexpensive robots that cooperatively exchange information with each other to obtain a specific objective can perform their assigned tasks more effectively and better. Various collaborative control algorithms, such as consensus7, formation8, 9\u201310, flocking11, and aggregation12, have been created or developed based on specific objectives. Formation control has been evaluated as a conventional and significant application in the field of collaborative control13, 14\u201315. The formation control problem can be divided into two main subproblems16: shape and maneuver control. Formation shape control seeks to achieve a fixed and predetermined geometric pattern by a group of agents. Formation shape control is utilized even in various biological systems where a regular geometric structure should be formed so that the agents are hypothesized to be cells or microorganisms17.</p><p>The maneuver control problem emphasizes that robots can change the orientation, centroid, and scale of the desired formation when necessary while maintaining an appropriate geometric pattern18. This issue is highly applicable in the real world. For example, the formation scale should change while keeping its geometric pattern unchanged when robots traverse a narrow path.</p><p>Methods for achieving formation have focused on strategies based on virtual structures19, behaviors20, artificial potential fields21, 22\u201323, and consensus24, 25\u201326, each of which has strengths and weaknesses. For instance, strategies based on virtual structure and behavior benefit from strong robustness. However, the first strategy imposes a large computational burden, while the second strategy is highly complicated for performing theoretical analysis. In addition, the artificial potential field is regarded as a conventional method for achieving the desired formation due to its potential for implementation and clear physical meaning despite its lack of robustness. The consensus-based strategy has attracted much attention due to its appropriate scalability, low computational load, and strong robustness. Based on the literature, the theoretical works are considered extremely rich despite their inability to handle the formation maneuvers, considering the change in scale and experiencing rotation and translation simultaneously.</p><p>In consensus-based formation, agents agree on a desired formation reference by exchanging information with their neighbors to maintain a minor deviation from it. The formation problem becomes formation tracking when the formation reference is regarded as the state of a virtual or physical agent. This agent, known as the leader, is called maneuvering when it has a nonzero control input. It is worth noting that the abovementioned works examined the problem of achieving fixed formations such as pentagonal23 or triangular26 formations. However, time-invariant formation methods cannot meet some needs in real-world scenarios such as cooperative detection and surveillance27, 28\u201329. Therefore, time-varying formation strategies have garnered significant interest owing to their benefits, including adaptability, reliability, enhancement of resource productivity, and task allocation29,30. Furthermore, the theoretical results obtained from the time-varying formation can be utilized for the issues of fixed formation and consensus control. As far as we know, the problem of time-varying formation tracking with a maneuvering virtual leader, where the formation changes scale, rotation, and translation within a switching topology, is still open. This challenge serves as the primary motivation for the present study.</p><p>Several studies have explored algorithms for handling rotational and translational maneuvers and scale adjustments within formations. However, addressing these changes within a switching communication topology remains a significant challenge. For instance, Chen et al.31 introduced a control method allowing agents to maneuver through mismatched angles, facilitating both rotational and translational movement. Similarly, Zhao18 developed an affine formation control algorithm for multi-agent systems, enabling dynamic adjustments in the formation structure. Furthermore, Chen et al.32 guaranteed global convergence for rigid formations under angle maneuvering, effectively handling complex geometric changes. While these studies have addressed various aspects of formation maneuvering with fixed communication topologies, our research takes a step further by focusing on fully distributed formation control within a switching communication topology.</p><p>To date, significant results have been achieved in the area of time-varying formation control. For example, Zhang et al.33 proposed a time-varying formation method based on average consensus theory specifically for underactuated systems. Moreover, Feng et al.34 created a discrete-time distributed algorithm designed to ensure time-varying formation tracking even when time-varying faults occur in linear multi-agent systems (MASs). Furthermore, Zhang et al.35 derived an optimal time-varying formation control law for omnidirectional robotic systems employing an adaptive fuzzy method based on output feedback. Furthermore, Zhang et al.36 presented the problem of time-varying formation tracking in the presence of multiple leaders using an adaptive control protocol. In another study, Wang et al.37 utilized an adaptive control protocol for swarm systems with linear dynamics to realize time-varying formation in the presence of a switching topology. To this end, the control gain matrix was achieved by solving a linear matrix inequality, and the agents could rotate with a certain angular velocity. However, all of the studies above suffer from a fundamental limitation: a positive lower bound should be established for the communication weights among the agents. In addition, none of the abovementioned studies support the change in the formation scale. Furthermore, Wang et al.37 indicated that agents leave the desired formation and that the algorithm fails when the angular velocity of the agents that reach a formation increases or decreases suddenly for various reasons. Applying the linear matrix inequality to obtain the control gain is considered an inefficient method because it imposes a large computational load, especially when there is a large-scale problem. It is worth noting that several studies, including16,18, and32, have investigated formation control with scale adjustments and negative interaction weights. However, our work stands out by tackling the challenges of switching communication topology. Furthermore, in the referenced works, the weights of the communication links in the network topology are treated as fixed values. In contrast, in this study, the weights are considered time-varying and uncertain.</p><p>Ubiquitous faults or even cyber-attacks can create faults while transmitting information between network agents. The information in a networked system is transmitted through a weighted graph, which is known as communication topology. Thus, the weights in such a communication graph can change in the event of a fault to form an uncertainty in the weights. Accordingly, the weights in the communication graph can increase, decrease, or even change signs. A critical question is whether conventional consensus algorithms or consensus-based formation strategies can still achieve their defined objectives in the presence of negative weights that vary over time. It is noteworthy that most of the aforementioned algorithms or formations presented to date have restrictive hypotheses. For instance, asymptotic consensus can be achieved by ensuring that the weights in the communication graph are part of a compact set with a positive lower limit38, 39\u201340, or they ought to be regarded as constant41,42. Based on the literature, achieving a time-varying formation when there is substantial uncertainty in the weights of the communication topology so that the weights can change signs is regarded as another motivation for conducting the current study.</p><p>On the other hand, the rate of convergence is deemed a valid metric for analyzing the efficacy of a consensus protocol. Based on the results of some studies, the rate of convergence is directly related to the algebraic connectivity, described as the second smallest eigenvalue of the communication graph\u2019s Laplacian matrix. An increase in the amount of algebraic connectivity increases the convergence rate in the same proportion43,44. Inspired by this fact, researchers have aimed to increase the convergence rate by enhancing algebraic connectivity45,46. However, increasing the convergence rate in this method necessitates identifying a communication graph with significant algebraic connectivity, which forces the control algorithm to leave the fully distributed state because the algebraic connectivity is calculated from the network\u2019s Laplacian matrix. In fact, the Laplacian matrix in the entire network of agents should be known to the designer in advance, meaning access to global information about the communication network, which contradicts the philosophy of fully distributed control47. Accordingly, this paper proposes a fully distributed consensus-based formation algorithm that achieves a high rate of convergence without relying on the approach of algebraic connectivity maximization. This is considered another contribution of the work.</p><p>In addition, researchers have sought to increase the number of robots in multi-agent robotics systems due to technological progress in the fields of electric motors, solar cells, and battery capacity. A swarm robotics problem emerges when there are a large number of robots48. Typically, robots are hypothesized to be relatively simple with limited computing resources and communication capabilities, such as those presented in49,50. Generally, there are two main control methods for large-scale swarm robotics systems: the centralized control method and distributed control architecture. In the first method, a preselected robot or a ground station makes control decisions for the entire robotics system, such as Crazyswarm, which is controlled by a central computer51. However, in the second method, collective decisions are made by exchanging information with the neighbors of each agent. Centralized control methods fail to perform efficiently for large-scale robotics teams due to data traffic and insufficient channel resources. Accordingly, Borrelli and Keviczky52 designed a distributed controller for a large-scale swarm robotics system containing one hundred robots to bring the agents to a desired formation. However, the control algorithms proposed in48, 49, 50, 51\u201352 are not considered fully distributed, as they require calculating algebraic connectivity and the Laplacian matrix to determine specific control parameters. The present study aims to design a fully distributed formation strategy for large-scale swarm robotics systems containing one hundred robots in the presence of poor communication conditions, such as changes in communication weights and the existence of uncertainty.</p><p>It is essential to highlight that optimizing formation control is just as crucial as its initial achievement, leading researchers to focus on distributed optimal formation strategies. In53, the authors developed time-varying formation control protocols for MASs, proposing both leaderless and leader-following strategies to minimize control energy consumption and enhance cooperative performance using a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) approach. However, it was not fully distributed due to reliance on the Laplacian matrix\u2019s minimum non-zero eigenvalue. In54, collision-risk-based event-triggered strategies were introduced for optimal formation control in mobile MASs, while55 explored optimal control for integrator chain MASs with strongly convex local cost functions, aiming to minimize global costs. The study in56 presented a collaborative approach for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) with six degrees of freedom, considering input saturation, and57 tackled second-order stochastic MASs with unknown nonlinear dynamics using a fuzzy logic-based adaptive control strategy integrated with an actor-critic architecture. Furthermore, Huang et al.58 proposed a generic distributed optimal formation control algorithm for second-order MASs, though all the studies53, 54, 55, 56, 57\u201358 assumed a fixed network topology. To address the challenges of switching network topologies, Gao et al.59 introduced a novel data-driven approach for cooperative adaptive control in leader\u2013follower MASs under a switching network topology. Despite these advancements, a fundamental limitation in works53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58\u201359 is their inability to handle formations with dynamic scaling, and all these strategies used positive constant weights in their network topology. In contrast, our work introduces uncertainty into the topology, allowing for unknown and potentially negative weights.</p><p>Designing controllers for large-scale swarm robotic systems poses significant challenges compared to small-scale systems. Traditional centralized control algorithms, while effective for smaller networks, become computationally prohibitive as the system size increases, while decentralized approaches often yield suboptimal performance in complex, large-scale environments60,61. Two critical questions arise in this context62: (1) How can control performance be optimized while satisfying system constraints? (2) How can scalability be ensured in the presence of a time-varying communication network? Furthermore, many existing control methods rely on linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) for their computations. Although LMIs are powerful tools, their practicality diminishes in large-scale systems as the dimensionality of the problem grows, making the LMIs unsolvable for large-scale networks63. To overcome these challenges, this research proposes a novel controller design that avoids reliance on LMIs, ensuring computational feasibility and scalability. The fully distributed approach introduced here maintains system performance while addressing the complexities of dynamic and uncertain environments inherent to large-scale swarm robotic systems.</p><p>This study aims to review the problem of fully distributed time-varying maneuver formation for 2D double integrator systems with dynamic communication topology. Accordingly, communication links between agents can be destroyed, new links can form over time, and the communication link weights are hypothesized to be uncertain and to change over time. The proposed strategy is carefully designed to achieve the desired formation using both the minimum and maximum functions concurrently. Compared to existing work, the key contributions of this study are as follows:</p><p>Unlike conventional consensus algorithms, such as those in38, 39, 40, 41\u201342, which require fixed communication topology weights with a positive lower bound to achieve asymptotic consensus, the consensus algorithm proposed in this paper eliminates these restrictive conditions. It accommodates a switching communication topology with time-varying and uncertain weights, allowing the weights to even change sign from positive to negative.</p><p>Compared to the results published in33, 34, 35, 36\u201337, the proposed formation strategy can realize formation maneuvers by changing the rotation and formation scale simultaneously. This scenario is rarely addressed in the literature.</p><p>Compared with other methods such as52, the proposed architecture can effectively transform large-scale formation systems into consensus-based systems in the presence of poor communication conditions, such as changes in the communication weights between agents. Furthermore, the process of reaching an agreement among agents is marked by a rapid rate of convergence.</p><p>Unlike the approaches in43, 44, 45\u201346, the convergence rate in this work does not depend on maximizing algebraic connectivity. Instead, the proposed strategy utilizes distinct working modes\u2014Tracker, Following, and Cross\u2014during the formation process. Once an agent switches to the Following mode, it exclusively tracks neighbors in the Tracker mode and removes itself from further comparisons with other agents in future iterations of the proposed algorithm. This targeted approach significantly accelerates the convergence process.</p><p>The subsequent sections of the study are structured as follows: section \u201cPreliminaries and problem formulation\u201d addresses the preliminaries and outlines the problem formulation. Section \u201cMain results\u201d covers the main results and introduces the proposed time-varying formation strategy. The numerical simulations employed to verify the theoretical results are detailed in section \u201cNumerical simulations\u201d. Accordingly, two examples are presented, one for the large-scale formation problem containing one hundred robots in the presence of poor communication conditions and the other for the time-varying maneuver formation problem. Ultimately, the conclusion is delivered.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Preliminaries and problem formulation</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Graph theory</emphasis></p><p>The information interaction in a robotics system is accomplished through the employment of a bidirectional graph represented as .  denotes the collection of edges within graph  whereas  signifies the collection of vertices in that graph.

Similarly,  represents the position vector of each agent  in the formation coordinate system. The primary objective of the algorithm is to compute a series of control set points, \u200b, for each agent within the communication network. By following these control set points, the  variables converge to a common value in the consensus coordinate system, achieving consensus. Once consensus is achieved, the position vector  of each agent aligns with its corresponding desired position vector , resulting in the realization of the desired geometric pattern.</p><p>The MAS is organized into two primary layers: the guidance layer and the inner layer (Fig. 1). The system comprises  agents, where the guidance layer includes the virtual leader, designated as agent , and the inner layer consists of the follower agents, represented as . Successful formation tracking depends on the coordinated interaction between both layers. The virtual leader in the guidance layer provides the overall trajectory or target formation, while the follower agents in the inner layer adjust their positions, velocities, and other states using information from both the virtual leader and their neighboring agents to maintain the desired formation. These layers work together to ensure the entire system operates harmoniously to achieve the prescribed objectives.Fig. 1</p><p>MAS control layers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Assumption 1</emphasis></emphasis></p><p>The communication topology among followers is assumed to be bidirectional, while information exchange between adjacent layers is unidirectional.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Assumption 2</emphasis></emphasis></p><p>It is assumed that the minimum system dwell time, , is adequately long to enable the implementation of all required control inputs.

Thus, time-varying communication weights are regarded as uncertain, allowing for the possibility of negative values.

A consensus strategy should be proposed in such a method that the  s in the consensus coordinate system reach a consensus.

(5) is used since the continuous-time form of Eq. (3), i.e., Eq. (5), is regarded as more appropriate for proving the properties of the consensus strategy.</p><p>There are some details in utilizing Eq. (5), which are studied here. To generate , a series of working modes are defined for each of the agents in the communication network, in addition to applying Eq. (5) for updating. Accordingly, the agents in the communication network operate under corresponding working modes, which are reviewed as follows.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Active modes in each execution of the proposed strategy</emphasis></p><p>Each agent has the ability to operate in one of three operating modes: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Tracker</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Following</emphasis>, or <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cross</emphasis>. These modes are delineated as follows:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Tracker mode</emphasis>: All of the agents are placed in this mode when strategy (5) starts to be implemented, meaning that every agent within the communication network should decide to select one of Eqs. (5-\u0399) to (5-\u0399\u0399\u0399) to update , considering its position relative to its neighbors and based on the sets , , and .</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Following mode</emphasis>: Some agents in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">tracker</emphasis> mode gradually reduce the difference in each of their  components () to zero with the corresponding components of their neighbors () when agents implement strategy (5). To this end, agent  shifts to the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">following</emphasis> mode from the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">tracker</emphasis> mode. This agent no longer needs to decide which of Eqs. (5-\u0399) to (5-\u0399\u0399\u0399) should be implemented to update  in subsequent executions of the abovementioned consensus strategy. Instead, it imitates the behavior of its neighboring agents, which reduces their  difference from  to zero. Accordingly, in subsequent executions of the proposed consensus strategy, regardless of the value  takes for its update,  takes the same value for its update.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cross mode</emphasis>: During certain times of implementing strategy (5), one of the neighboring agents in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">tracker</emphasis> mode seeks to update its  value to that of  belonging to its neighbor based on Eq.

Simultaneously, agent , which is considered to be a neighbor of agent , aims to increase its  value to that of  based on Eq. (5-II), resulting in a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cross</emphasis> state. At this time, one agent, either  or , is selected randomly to keep its  or  value constant and allows its neighboring agent to increase its  or  value to match that of the other agent. As a result, the agents transition from the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">tracker</emphasis> to the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">cross</emphasis> mode.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Remark 10</emphasis></emphasis></p><p>The strategy proposed here significantly reduces the convergence time since the agents , which are in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">following</emphasis> mode, only need to employ the  value of their neighbors, which are in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">tracker</emphasis> mode, to update their .

These control inputs guide the -th follower according to its dynamics, ensuring the desired progression toward consensus within each execution cycle.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Remark 12</emphasis></emphasis></p><p>In the literature, fully distributed consensus strategies often employ adaptive weight designs to eliminate reliance on global parameters, such as the smallest eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian, as demonstrated in64,65. These adaptive designs enable agents to dynamically adjust their weights, enhancing robustness and accelerating convergence. However, not all consensus algorithms rely on adaptive weights. For example, the algorithm in66 achieves global asymptotic min-consensus for second-order multi-agent systems using a time-derivative-based design, while the max-consensus algorithm in67 determines the maximum value of agents\u2019 initial states through purely local communication. These alternative approaches offer significant insights into achieving efficient and reliable consensus while eliminating the constraints associated with adaptive weights.</p><p>The explanations provided about work modes are presented as a visual example to help readers better understand the mode allocation mechanism.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Example 2</emphasis></emphasis></p><p>Consider four agents (Fig. 4a) so that the vector  contains a component of position (). Initially, the proposed consensus strategy is implemented, resulting in the inclusion of all agents in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">tracker</emphasis> mode, meaning that each agent should decide which of Eqs. (5-\u0399) to (5-\u0399\u0399\u0399) should be used for updating . Accordingly, the value of  becomes equal to that of  during the first implementation of the proposed strategy utilizing Eq. (5-I). In addition, the value of  becomes equal to that of  by applying Eq. (5-II) (Fig. 4b). Based on Eq. (5-III), the value of  remains unchanged because its value is between those of  and . This is also true for . Now, the status of agents 1 and 4 switches to the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">following</emphasis> mode from the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">tracker</emphasis> (Fig. 4b). Consequently, agents 1 and 4 are excluded from the subsequent iterations\u2019 assessment and comparison with their neighboring agents. From now on,  and  will adopt the same values as  and . During the second execution, the value of  seeks to obtain that of  employing Eq. (5-\u0399), and the value of  aims to be updated to that of  using Eq. (5-\u0399\u0399). Therefore, agents 2 and 3 change their status to the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cross</emphasis> mode (Fig. 4c).

The proposed control scheme is computationally efficient and straightforward to implement, making it particularly attractive for large-scale systems or those with limited processing capacity. Since it does not rely on solving optimization problems during execution, it avoids potential issues such as timing delays or numerical instability that can arise in real-time optimization. These features contribute to the consistency and reliability of the control process, especially in systems with stable dynamics where frequent real-time adjustments are not critical.</p><p>Figure 5 shows the control architecture of the proposed consensus strategy.

However, the entire formation system collapses in conventional time-varying formation algorithms such as35 with a sudden change in the rotational velocity. It is worth noting that in most studies related to time-varying formation, agents\u2019 communication topology weights possess a positive lower limit and are hypothesized to be constant; however, this critical hypothesis is abandoned here. Figures 18 and 19 illustrate the displacements of the followers in the  and  directions, as well as the velocities of the followers in these directions. As demonstrated, the followers achieve the primary desired formation until . Then, the followers seek to obtain the rotational velocity of  around the virtual leader and follow the desired trajectory generated by the virtual leader in the period of , i.e., between the moments  and . The followers keep their rotational velocity constant between the moments  and . Then, the formation scale increases from  to  at moment , and the rotational velocity increases from  to . In addition, the formation velocity and scale remain unchanged until . At the beginning of the moment , the formation scale decreases from  to , and the rotational velocity of the followers around the leader decreases from  to , representing the flexibility of the suggested algorithm.Fig. 17</p><p>State snapshots of the ten followers at different times.</p><p>Fig. 18</p><p>Profile of the displacement time evolution: (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>) Horizontal displacement  and (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>) Vertical displacement .</p><p>Fig. 19</p><p>Profile of the velocity time evolution: (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>) Horizontal velocity  and (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>) Vertical velocity .</p><p>Figure 20a and b display the profiles of the control effort in the directions  and  for the followers, respectively.

The algorithm successfully achieves the desired initial formation within 6 runs (), as illustrated in Fig. 21, demonstrating that the consensus parameter  converges within this time frame. During each execution cycle, control calculations are performed with a discrete time step , effectively dividing the -second interval into smaller steps. The choice of  has a significant impact on the accuracy, response quality, and stability of the networked control system.Fig. 21</p><p>Impact of time step  on the networked control system response.</p><p>Numerical simulations were conducted for three different  values: , , and , as depicted in Fig. 21. The results indicate that larger  values introduce noticeable fluctuations in the responses of certain agents, while smaller  values lead to smoother and more accurate responses. However, it was observed that when  exceeds , the control system becomes unstable due to overshooting and divergence.</p><p>Conversely, while smaller  values improve the smoothness and accuracy of convergence, they also significantly increase the computational load on robot hardware. This increase in computational demand can be prohibitive for battery-powered robots with limited energy resources, making excessively small  values impractical for such systems.</p><p>These findings highlight a critical trade-off in selecting : excessively large step sizes can cause oscillatory behavior or divergence, while overly small step sizes may result in computational inefficiency without yielding proportionate gains in accuracy. The optimal  typically balances these factors and is determined through trial and error, taking into account the specific application requirements and hardware constraints. This balance is crucial for maintaining system stability and achieving efficient, accurate convergence in practical implementations of the proposed algorithm.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Computational complexity and convergence efficiency</emphasis></p><p>The algorithm operates in a fully distributed manner, where each agent communicates only with its direct neighbors. During each iteration (execution cycle), every agent  compares its current consensus variable  to those of its neighbors , , to determine which update rule (, , or ) to apply. These comparisons are used to determine the agent\u2019s mode\u2014Tracker, Following, or Cross\u2014and involve only local logic. Consequently, the per-agent complexity is , and the global per-iteration complexity across all agents is  where  is the total number of communication edges.</p><p>A key factor contributing to the algorithm\u2019s convergence efficiency is the Following mode. Once an agent transitions into the Following mode, it ceases further comparisons or rule selection based on neighbor values and instead directly mirrors the consensus variable of the neighbor it is following. This behavior effectively reduces the computational burden of that agent to a constant order, , in subsequent iterations.</p><p>As more agents enter the Following mode, the cumulative decision-making effort across the network diminishes, enabling a more efficient dissemination of consensus values. This mechanism accelerates convergence by allowing agents to progressively synchronize with minimal computational overhead. Consequently, the overall convergence time is significantly reduced, and the algorithm maintains high efficiency and scalability, even as the network size increases. The design of the Following mode ensures that the algorithm remains computationally lightweight and practically implementable for large-scale distributed systems.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conclusion</emphasis></p><p>The present study aims to assess the optimal time-varying formation tracking problem for a leader\u2013follower robotics system with 2D double integrator dynamics. To this aim, by utilizing the minimum\u2013maximum consensus, a time-varying formation algorithm was presented so that the followers could realize a wide range of formations by changing their scale and rotational velocity using the proposed algorithm. In most studies in the field of time-varying formation, the communication topology\u2019s weights are positive and constant. However, this crucial hypothesis is abandoned here. Accordingly, the communication topology is regarded as switching, and its weights are hypothesized to be time-varying, unknown, uncertain, and sometimes negative. In addition, two numerical examples were presented to show and compare the efficiency of the proposed formation algorithm with that of other studies. In the first example, a simulation was performed for a large-scale problem containing one hundred robots to prove that the proposed formation algorithm has a significant convergence rate compared to conventional algorithms. In the second example, a leader\u2013follower system with a virtual leader containing ten followers was simulated so that the followers could change their scale and rotational velocity around the virtual leader and simultaneously translate at a known velocity along the predetermined desired trajectory. Furthermore, a proof of the convergence of the proposed algorithm has been provided. The authors of this paper intend to solve the formation issue with heterogeneous agents when there are delays in communication in their further research. Additionally, in our future work, we plan to tackle the critical issue of leader faults in leader\u2013follower formations, focusing on developing strategies to improve the robustness and reliability of the entire formation in such scenarios. The uniqueness of the solution introduced by the min/max computations, along with the necessary and sufficient conditions for its realization, remains an important topic for further investigation. The authors intend to address these aspects in future studies. Another potential direction for future research is to incorporate the concept of angle rigidity68 to further develop the proposed algorithm. An additional avenue for future research is the incorporation of collision avoidance strategies into the proposed framework. Ensuring safe inter-agent distances while maintaining formation under switching and uncertain communication topologies remains an open and practical challenge.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>The authors would like to express their sincere gratitude to the three anonymous reviewers for their insightful and constructive comments, which have greatly contributed to improving the quality and clarity of the manuscript.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><p>[1].Guo, K.

According to the Forest Fires 2023 report, published today by the Commission's Joint Research Centre, wildfires affected over 500 000 hectares of natural lands, roughly half the size of the island of Cyprus.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In recent years, catastrophic wildfires have been common in the European Union and neighbouring countries, 2023 was no exception. 'Megafires' and wildfires challenged traditional firefighting means, including a fire near the city of Alexandroupolis in the Greek region of East Macedonia and Thrace. This was the largest single wildfire recorded in the EU since the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) started tracking them in 2000.</p><p>The unprecedented wildfires sweeping Europe in the last four years show the undeniable effects of climate change on wildfires becoming more frequent and intense. This was underlined by the first ever European Climate Risk Assessment (EUCRA) and the Commission Communication on managing climate risks in Europe published this year.</p><p>Climate change is not only increasing the size of the areas affected by wildfires, but also making individual fires more intense, prolonging the fire season beyond the traditional summer period, and causing fires to happen in areas that were not usually affected by them.</p><p>The high frequency and intensity of wildfires during prolonged fire seasons pose a new challenge to firefighting services across Europe and globally, as aerial firefighting becomes more arduous and ground operations become more difficult or even impossible.</p><p>A downturn in wildfires in 2024 in the EU, but still above the ten-year average</p><p>The preliminary assessment of the 2024 wildfire season in the EU until mid-September shows that the area burnt by fires in the EU was below the average of the last two decades. This is mainly due to the intermittent rainfall that affected much of the EU territory throughout spring and summer.</p><p>In September, multiple wildfires broke out simultaneously in Portugal. This brought the 2024 wildfire damage above the EU average of the last decades. However, overall, 2024 can be considered a less severe wildfire season as it marks a downturn in damage after three consecutive years of devastating fires.</p><p>The Commission and the EU Member States are improving their prevention, preparedness and firefighting capabilities, which would have helped limit damage across the EU this year.</p><p>Tackling the root cause of wildfires and raising awareness about the changing climate</p><p>To tackle wildfires in Europe and globally, it is necessary to minimise the number of wildfire ignitions and manage the landscape in vulnerable regions, preventing the accumulation of high-risk fuel types and their spatial continuity. Nature-based preventive measures such as promoting tree species composition that is less fire-prone, enabling grazing by herbivores or prescribed burns, are effective in reducing wildfire risk, together with integrated landscape planning approaches.</p><p>According to the report (<url normalizedValue=\"https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC139704\">https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC139704</url>), approximately 96% of wildfires in the EU are caused by human actions, meaning that education and awareness-raising campaigns are an essential part of the solution. As the climate crisis worsens, it is crucial that Europe's population prepares for more frequent and intense wildfires. Prevention measures must involve all sections of the population, including rural communities in direct contact with natural areas, as well as the particularly vulnerable population that lives in the 'wildland-urban interface'.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Background</p><p>The European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) is a network of 43 countries that exchange harmonised information on forest fires and assess their effects in Europe. It is also a platform for exchange of good practices on fire prevention, firefighting, restoration, and other fire management activities.</p><p>Since 2015, EFFIS is one of the components of the Emergency Management Services of Copernicus, the EU Earth observation programme which provides information on the planet and its environment from both satellite monitoring and in situ data.</p><p>* * *</p><p>For More Information</p><p>2023 Forest Fires Report (<url normalizedValue=\"https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC139704\">https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC139704</url>)</p><p>Commission Communication on managing climate risks (<url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_1385\">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_1385</url>)</p><p>* * *</p><p>Quote(s)</p><p>The increasing threat of wildfires, fuelled by climate change, demands a united and evidence-based response. The Commission's Joint Research Centre plays a key role in this effort by advancing early warning systems and providing critical data to inform policy and protect vulnerable regions. With nearly all wildfires caused by human actions, prevention and education are key. By fostering stronger collaboration across the EU and leveraging scientific insights, we can better safeguard our forests, biodiversity and communities against the growing risks of wildfires.</p><p>- Iliana Ivanova, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth</p><p>* * *</p><p>When a major wildfire breaks out in Europe and around the world, the EU stands ready to help, among others with the deployment of aerial and ground firefighting forces through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. The new agreement with Canada on the production of 12 new amphibious firefighting planes that will make up the backbone of the permanent rescEU fleet, marks another important step in improving the EU's capacity and readiness to combat wildfires, in addition to the national response capacities of the EU Member States. However, response is only one side of the coin: it works hand-in-hand with preparedness and adaptation, that is why the EU is also supporting Member States with the wildfire prevention projects, guidelines on good practices, peer reviews etc.</p><p>- Janez Lenarcic, Commissioner for Crisis Management</p><p>* * *</p><p>Climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of wildfires. The 2023 wildfires again showed that we were not ready to face these risks. We must invest more to better prepare for and prevent these wildfires. Building on the findings of the recent European Climate Risk Assessment, we are currently developing a new, ambitious and robust European Climate Adaptation Plan. We will also assess the need for future legislation on climate resilience and preparedness and present options. In the face of accelerating global warming and growing wildfire risks, we must ensure that we all have a prosperous, safe and secure future.</p><p>- Wopke Hoekstra, Commissioner for Climate Action</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_5385\">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_5385</url></p><p>Contact: Thomas Regnier, +32 2 29 9 1099, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:thomas.regnier@ec.europa.eu\">thomas.regnier@ec.europa.eu</email></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>T40-MgEditor-8939195 T40-MgEditor</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8939195</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DGM-2BV1-DYG2-R2BH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1149\"/><timeReceived>1:47 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 19, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis granted the Department of Justice's request for a seven-day stay, which is in effect until April 30. This pause was granted with the agreement of both the government and Abrego Garcia's attorneys, according to a court order. Vatican prepares for Pope Francis' funeral as thousands pay their respects. More than 50,000 people have already visited St. Peter's Basilica to pay their respects to the late Pope Francis. The man who killed seven people and wounded nearly 50 more in an Independence Day mass shooting in suburban Chicago in 2022 was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole on April 24. Robert Crimo III, 24, unexpectedly pleaded guilty to 69 counts of murder and attempted murder in March for the July 4, 2022, shooting during a parade in Highland Park, Illinois. The company that owned the railcar that caused the devastating East Palestine train derailment in 2023 won't have to help pay for the $600 million settlement Norfolk Southern agreed to with residents. An Ohio jury decided Wednesday that GATX isn't liable for the settlement even though the failure of a bearing on its railcar carrying plastic pellets caused the pileup on February 3, 2023. GATX has maintained Norfolk Southern operated and inspected the train and all the cars and was responsible for delivering the cargo safely. A 19-year-old man has been arrested on arson charges in connection with a southern New Jersey wildfire that has scorched more than 15,000 acres, prompted about 5,000 evacuations and briefly shut down part of the Garden State Parkway, officials said. Joseph Kling faces charges of aggravated arson and arson after a multi-agency investigation determined the fire was caused \"by an improperly extinguished bonfire,\" according to a joint statement from the New Jersey Forest Fire Service, the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office and the State Department of Environmental Protection. The first court hearing in the legal battle between the White House and Harvard University is set for Monday. The nation's oldest university asked the court to fast track its lawsuit against the federal government after the Trump administration announced a funding freeze on more than $2 billion in federal grants and contracts. When Target announced on January 24 that it would scale back diversity, equity and inclusion commitments, customers reacted swiftly, upset that a company that had so loudly touted its diversity initiatives appeared to be backtracking. For 10 consecutive weeks, foot traffic at Target stores has declined -- down 9 percent year-over-year in February and 6.5 percent year-over-year in March, according to data from analytics firm Placer.ai. While Placer.ai notes a variety of factors were likely to blame, like weather and a drop in post-holiday spending, Rev. Jamal Bryant has driven another reason for a drop-off, a fast -- from shopping. Bryant, the senior pastor of New Birth Missionary Baptist Church near Atlanta, spearheaded a 40-day \"fast\" from shopping at the big-box store during Lent. President Donald Trump welcomed Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store to the White House Thursday to discuss the war in Ukraine, tariffs and other issues. Trump said he believes Vladimir Putin will listen when he urged the Russian leader to stop the attacks.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[13:30:22]</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN ANCHOR: A new legal twist in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland father who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The presiding judge has now ordered a one-week pause in the expedited fact-finding process intended to determine what the Trump administration is doing to facilitate his return to the U.S. This is happening a day after the judge excoriated the Trump administration for not acting in good faith and ignoring court orders.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is with us on this story. Priscilla, why did the judge order the pause?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, she certainly didn't give much of an explanation, simply saying that it was a two- sentence order and she paused the discovery for a week, quote, \"at the agreement of the parties\". Nothing more.</p><p>Now, you'll recall, Brianna, that this is a judge who has had very stern, terse words for the Justice Department. She has been frustrated over the course of this case, feeling as though the Justice Department was stonewalling her.</p><p>And that's what ultimately led to her ordering for expedited discovery, because when the question came as to how they're facilitating the return of the government, she didn't feel like she was getting enough answers, and she wanted to understand more of this process.</p><p>She also asked the government to provide daily status updates to understand, again, what exactly the administration was doing, if anything at all, to facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia, again, after the Supreme Court had required the facilitation of his return.</p><p>Now, earlier in the day yesterday, the administration had asked for a one-week pause. It was sealed. And the attorneys of Abrego Garcia had opposed it. But ultimately, as the hours went by, we got this order from the judge that suggests, or says quite clearly, that there is agreement between the two parties about pausing this for a week. So it opens up a lot of questions as to what exactly is happening behind the scenes. We know some things about Abrego Garcia since this case started. Of course, it's confirmed that he's in El Salvador.</p><p>You saw as well that Senator Van Hollen meet with Abrego Garcia, where we saw the first photos of him since he was deported in mid-March. But we've also learned he's been moved to another detention center in El Salvador. And that's similarly raised a lot of questions, because it is not as strict as on a maximum security prison the way CECOT is.</p><p>Now, he's somewhere else. So there's these little movements that have been happening over the last few days, but we just don't know what it's going to culminate into yet. But it is a good time to remind viewers, too, that the administration is in its right to remove Abrego Garcia to any other country. It's just going to be to El Salvador.</p><p>So it begs the question, what could happen next in this case? We don't know yet, but we do know that there is a pause in the discovery for now.</p><p>KEILAR: Really interesting to see why they agreed to that.</p><p>Priscilla, thank you for the reporting. Boris?</p><p>BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN ANCHOR: Right now, mourners are packing St. Peter's Basilica to see Pope Francis. These are live images as he lies in state. The Vatican says more than 50,000 people lined up in the first 24 hours. This, of course, is the second of three days for the public to pay their respects.</p><p>A procession tomorrow evening will take him slowly through the streets of Rome to his final resting place with a funeral on Saturday. And today, the Vatican released this image of Pope Francis' tomb made of marble from northern Italy.</p><p>CNN Vatican Correspondent Christopher Lamb joins us now live from Rome. And Christopher, what are you learning about what we should expect for the coming days?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER LAMB, CNN VATICAN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Boris, as you said, there are thousands of people still filing into St. Peter's Basilica, which was open all night for people to continue to go in and pay their respects to Pope Francis.</p><p>I myself paid my final respects when the Pope was in the Santa Marta Chapel. It was a very almost overwhelming experience, covered the Francis pontificate so closely for, you know, many years. It was a very moving experience to go and do that.</p><p>And you could see in the Square people really full of emotion, full of sadness at the loss of a pope who they felt was their pope, someone who they felt a deep connection to. Now, we're expecting a large number of heads of state. President Trump will be here for the funeral on Saturday, along with other dignitaries.</p><p>It's going to be an event that is going to be attended by, we're expecting tens of thousands of people. And it will be presided at by the dean of the College of Cardinals. For those who've watched the movie \"Conclave\", they'll know the dean plays a very important role in the period, in the run up to the conclave and a papal funeral.</p><p>And then after the funeral is celebrated in St. Peter's Square, the Pope's casket will be transferred to his final burial place place at the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore.</p><p>[13:35:11]</p><p>And the Vatican saying that the people who will be paying their respects to the Pope right at the end will be the poorest in Rome. A group of poor and those who are on the margins of society will be brought in to pay their respects to the Pope. A very fitting final moment for Francis, who of course said he wanted a poor church for the poor and devoted himself to those on the margins of society.</p><p>Boris?</p><p>SANCHEZ: Christopher Lamb live Force in Rome. Thank you so much for that update.</p><p>When we come back, the man who pleaded guilty to a mass shooting at a July 4th parade just learned his fate. We have new details minutes away.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[13:40:15]</p><p>SANCHEZ: The Illinois man who abruptly confessed to a deadly mass shooting just moments before his murder trial was supposed to begin just got sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The 24-year-old gunman pleaded guilty last month in the 2022 attack on a 4th of July parade just outside Chicago.</p><p>He actually refused to attend his sentencing hearing today and yesterday. That is his empty chair. What he missed were the emotional impact statements from survivors and family members who lost loved ones. You might remember he killed seven people and injured nearly 50 others.</p><p>CNN Law Enforcement Correspondent Whitney Wild is here with more on today's sentencing. Whitney, what are you learning?</p><p>WHITNEY WILD, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT CORRESPONDENT: Boris, it's been an emotional two days. Those victims that you point out, Robert Crimo, did not get to hear from recounted in quite a bit of detail the absolute nightmare that they lived through three years ago.</p><p>In some cases, these victims said their lives have been changed forever. Another victim said that, in fact, he forgives Robert Crimo. So there was really a wide range of reaction and experiences shared in court over those two days, even though they knew Robert Crimo would not hear it. The specific sentence on paper is seven consecutive life sentences for each of the people he killed. In addition, Boris, he was sentenced to 50 years for each of the 48 people he injured that day.</p><p>Following the hearing, Boris, there were a few people who spoke to the media to talk about what this day means to them. One of those people is Liz Turnipseed. She was shot in the pelvis at that parade. Here's what she said this day. This sentencing means to her.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>LIZ TURNIPSEED, SHOOTING SURVIVOR: While I don't have closure, it's closing a chapter on this, this part of our lives. And I don't have to think about him anymore. I don't have to worry about him anymore. And me and my husband and my daughter can continue to move forward, and I can continue to heal.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>WILD: Boris, during that hearing, the judge said that Robert Crimo III was simply beyond rehabilitation. His attorneys did not issue a statement from him. He didn't make an oral statement, of course, because he wasn't there, he didn't issue a written statement.</p><p>But basically, in summary, they said he understood when he abruptly pleaded guilty just before his trial was supposed to begin, that he would spend the rest of his life behind bars, Boris.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Whitney Wild, thank you so much.</p><p>Brianna?</p><p>KEILAR: Now to some of the other headlines that we're watching this hour, the company that owned the rail car responsible for the East Palestine, Ohio train derailment will not have to help pay that $600 million settlement that Norfolk Southern agreed to with residents.</p><p>A jury determined that GATX is not liable for damages, even though a failed wheel bearing on one of its rail cars caused the 2023 disaster. The company argued successfully that it was Norfolk Southern's responsibility to maintain the cars and deliver their cargo safely.</p><p>And a 19-year-old is facing arson charges in connection with the wildfire that has burned at least 15,000 acres in Southern New Jersey. Officials say Joseph Kling ignited wooden pallets to start a bonfire and left the scene before putting it out properly. No injuries have been reported, but the mayor of Lacey Township says the wildfire is the largest in the community's history.</p><p>And the spring home buying season is off to a slow start. The National Association of Realtors says sales of previously owned homes dropped 5.9 percent in March compared to February. That's the sharpest monthly decline in more than two years and the weakest number for March since 2009.</p><p>The NAR's chief economist says rising home prices and persistently high interest rates remain the biggest factors. Target walking back its commitment to diversity and some of its shoppers appear to walk away entirely. Details on the boycott that may have sparked the drop off in foot traffic, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[13:49:11]</p><p>KEILAR: The first court hearing in the legal battle between the White House and Harvard University is set for Monday. The nation's oldest university asked the court to fast track its lawsuit against the federal government after the Trump administration announced a funding freeze on more than $2 billion in federal grants and contracts.</p><p>We have Betsy Klein with us here with the details. So, Betsy, what's Harvard saying about the case?</p><p>BETSY KLEIN, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE PRODUCER: Yes, so Harvard is essentially asking this federal judge to fast track its challenge to this $2.2 billion funding freeze. Harvard arguing that the Trump administration's move here is threatening critical medical, scientific, and other research.</p><p>Now the Trump administration says that this is about combating anti- Semitism, but Harvard says that this threatens their First Amendment rights. Listen to what Harvard President Alan Garber had to say about this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>[13:50:01]</p><p>ALAN GARBER, HARVARD UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT: We don't know how much we can actually absorb, but what we do know is that we cannot compromise on basic principles like defense of our First Amendment rights.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is this bigger than Harvard at this point?</p><p>GARBER: Of course it's bigger than Harvard because we look at what's at risk here. And what's at risk is the excellence of higher education in the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>KLEIN: Now Harvard is essentially asking the court to speed up the timeline here. They want the judge to look at the case and make a decision very quickly without a jury, without a full trial. The goal here is to get this resolved faster than the years that it can typically take.</p><p>We're also seeing the Trump administration really take aggressive aim at Harvard and other higher education institutions. We are seeing -- starting to learn a little bit more about the task force led by the Justice Department here that is taking aim at some of these colleges.</p><p>Now, to get a sense of the scope of their work, the Justice Department-led Task Force on Combating Anti-Semitism earlier this month sent Harvard a letter demanding policy changes. Of course, Harvard rejected those demands and this is the task force that is responsible for that funding freeze I mentioned.</p><p>So who is on it? It's led by a former Fox News personality and civil rights leader, Leo Terrell, representatives from across the federal government. But the policy here is really being driven by Stephen Miller, the President's deputy chief of staff, of course really underscoring how much power and influence that Miller has amassed as he's trying to implement the President's agenda.</p><p>There's an initial target list of universities in addition to Harvard, Columbia University, Northwestern, Cornell, the University of Michigan. But a White House official tells me no university, Brianna, is off limits.</p><p>KEILAR: Yes, they're sending a message to higher education in America for sure.</p><p>Betsy, thank you so much for the reporting. We appreciate it. Boris?</p><p>SANCHEZ: Retail giant Target is seeing a decline in foot traffic at its stores at least for the last 10 weeks or so. A coordinated boycott of the retailer may be a factor. A boycott started after Target announced a rollback of its diversity initiatives.</p><p>CNN's Ryan Young talked to the pastor leading the charge against the retailer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>PASTOR JAMAL BRYANT, NEW BIRTH MISSIONARY BAPTIST CHURCH: It is not because of tariffs, it is not because of the stock market, it is because of the power of black unification and the black dollar.</p><p>$12 trillion in spending power is not anything that we should laugh at.</p><p>RYAN YOUNG, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): What started out as a movement to send a message against Target downsizing its DEI initiatives?</p><p>BRYANT: 200,000 people signed to be a part of the Target fast.</p><p>YOUNG (voice-over): Led to Target stores nationwide taking a nosedive in foot traffic. Down for 10 consecutive weeks, dropping 9 percent in February and falling 6.5 percent in March compared to one year ago. The significant decline also impacted by spending pullbacks during decreased consumer confidence and tariff uncertainty.</p><p>BRYANT: So the fast shifts to a full out boycott.</p><p>YOUNG (voice-over): Prominent Atlanta area megachurch Pastor Jamal Bryant's call for a boycott during Lent. A fast aimed at Target and is still not over. BRYANT: We had four asks and only walked away with one thing. Target has agreed that by July the 31st, they will complete the pledge of $2 billion for black business. We gave you 40 days to answer four not one. We ain't going back in there.</p><p>YOUNG: You met with the CEO?</p><p>BRYANT: Yes.</p><p>YOUNG: What was that like?</p><p>BRYANT: We're still meeting. I think it's a healthy start for where it is that we are.</p><p>YOUNG: Do you think they hear you?</p><p>BRYANT: Oh, they hear me. The cash register hears me.</p><p>YOUNG (voice-over): Target has not responded to CNN's interview requests or questions about the boycott's impact. In an internal note on diversity from Target's chief equity officer earlier this year, the company says they are still committed to inclusivity and offers a wide range of products and services, including items made by companies that are black and minority owned.</p><p>CHANTEL POWELL, FOUNDER, PLAY PITS: That was disappointment.</p><p>YOUNG (voice-over): Five megachurches held bullseye black markets over Easter weekend to help power small black business owners, several of them stung and saddened by Target's policy reversal.</p><p>YOUNG: You had products on the shelves at Target.</p><p>POWELL: We've definitely felt a hit, right? So our sales in store are currently 30 percent less than what they were last year. People feel hurt because it felt like Target was for us. It felt like Target believed in us.</p><p>YOUNG: When Target stepped back, what was your initial reaction?</p><p>CARLTON MACKEY, BLACK MEN SMILE CREATOR: It felt like a gut punch, to be honest. The way Target had positioned itself in the black community suggested that there was a commitment. To see it swept away in an instant, it felt like a rug pull.</p><p>PATRICE CHAPPELLE, FOUNDER, MELANBRAND SKIN: Skin care products for children, especially black and brown children.</p><p>YOUNG (voice-over): Patrice Chappelle and her son started MelanBrand Skin in 2023 with the goal of getting her product onto the shelves of Target.</p><p>[13:55:07]</p><p>CHAPPELLE: With all the rollbacks on the DEI, that's going to, you know, make it a lot harder for us to get into the store. It's no longer inclusive, and it feels that -- it feels like they have really just turned their backs on us.</p><p>BRBYANT: We ask that because black people spend upwards of $12 million a day, that they would invest a quarter of $1 billion in the black banks so people would have access to capital for businesses and for home ownership. We ask the Target to invest in HBCUs and to give a re- examination of what DEI would look like in the future.</p><p>YOUNG (voice-over): Ryan Young, CNN, Stonecrest, Georgia.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>SANCHEZ: Our thanks to Ryan Young for that report.</p><p>We should let you know that we are monitoring an event at the White House right now. President Donald Trump alongside the Norwegian Prime Minister. He is answering questions from reporters, so let's listen in.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: -- Jonas Gahr Store is here, who is the, as you know, the Prime Minister of Norway. He's a great gentleman, highly respected, beloved in his country. And we've had talks on the war with Ukraine and Russia and trade.</p><p>We're doing very well, I think, on both. We've had some pretty good movement in every respect. The war is very important. It ends with, I used to say, 2,500 people a week dying, young people, mostly soldiers from Russia and Ukraine.</p><p>And we want to end that war. We want to end it quickly. And I think we've made a long -- a lot of progress, and we'll see what happens.</p><p>This next few days is going to be very important. Meetings are taking place right now. Additionally, we talked about trade, and we will definitely we get along very well on trade. We'll do something.</p><p>But I think the Prime Minister knows that over the years, the United States has been very good to a lot of people, and it's time for us to benefit also. So we're going to have a good relationship on trade, and we discussed other things also.</p><p>But, Mr. Prime Minister, it's an honor to have you at the White House. Thank you very much.</p><p>JONAS GAHR STORE, NORWEGIAN PRIME MINISTER: Well, thank you, Mr. President. This is -- this year is 200 years since the first immigration from Norway to the U.S. We come here early in your term. Appreciate that you take time.</p><p>We have highlighted that very close cooperation. We are allies. We look after security in the north, in the Arctic. A lot of confidence between our services. We have discussed in detail the war in Ukraine.</p><p>I have saluted the President for his initiative to make progress towards something that can be a ceasefire and an end to this terrible conflict. It is a complex picture, but it needs political will and push, and we have exchanged ideas on that. And I think the President and his team have been open to hear our perspectives.</p><p>And on trade, we have also emphasized that we can benefit, both of us, by trading. We can be complementary, and we can find good solutions. But, first of all, I appreciate, Mr. President, the spirit and the tone of this conversation, which has been confirmation of a very strong partnership.</p><p>TRUMP: Thank you very much. Appreciate it.</p><p>Any questions from the press? Yes?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. President, can I ask you the President -- have you spoken about the tariff that you want to impose on Norway? Is there a chance that you can lower --</p><p>TRUMP: We spoke about trade, and we understand each other very well. I think we'll have no problem.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you think that you can get an agreement --</p><p>TRUMP: I think we'll have no problem whatsoever with Norway.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President, have you discussed a possible visit to Norway? Did you discuss a possible visit with President Trump?</p><p>TRUMP: We didn't, but I would -- I love it. I mean, I've been there, and it is a beautiful place they have.</p><p>STORE: But I told the President that, you know, he is receiving us early in the term. He is welcome to visit Norway. We would like to have him, and it will be another way of emphasizing this strong friendship.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. President, Norway has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine --</p><p>TRUMP: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- since the Russian invasion in 2022. Has something been discussed here today that have -- may have altered your views on things?</p><p>TRUMP: No, we want to -- very simply, I have no allegiance to anybody. I have allegiance to saving lives, and I want to save a lot of lives, a lot of young people, mostly young people. It's the war. It's the soldiers.</p><p>And if we can do that, I've also -- as you know, I got started because the money that's been spent on this war is insane. It should have never happened. And it would have never happened if I were president.</p><p>But Biden spent $350 billion on this, and it's a shame. And that's what got me involved. And then I looked at -- and I see the results, it's horrible. It's a --</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2025042408CNV19</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNNEC2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FN4-MTV3-RW6X-Y2BN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3500\"/><timeReceived>01:30 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Cable News Network, Inc.

According to news originating from Nanjing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"To tackle the problem of missed detections in long-range detection scenarios caused by the small size of forest fire targets, initiatives have been undertaken to enhance the feature extraction and detection precision of models designed for forest fire imagery.\" </p><p><br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Nanjing Forestry University: \"In this study, two algorithms, DenseM-YOLOv5 and SimAM-YOLOv5, were proposed by modifying the backbone network of You Only Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5). From the perspective of lightweight models, compared to YOLOv5, SimAM-YOLOv5 reduced the parameter size by 28.57%. Additionally, although SimAM-YOLOv5 showed a slight decrease in recall rate, it achieved improvements in precision and average precision (AP) to varying degrees. The DenseM-YOLOv5 algorithm achieved a 2.24% increase in precision, as well as improvements of 1.2% in recall rate and 1.52% in AP compared to the YOLOv5 algorithm.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Despite having a higher parameter size, the DenseM-YOLOv5 algorithm outperformed the SimAM-YOLOv5 algorithm in terms of precision and AP for forest fire detection.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: An Efficient Forest Fire Target Detection Model Based on Improved YOLOv5.

Deadly blazes ripped through Bar Harbor, Maine, and down the state's coast. Fires raged for over a month, leaving thousands of people homeless and ravaging <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_protection/1947_fire.html\">220,000 acres</url>.

In Connecticut, a <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/firefighter-death-connecticut-brush-fire-accident-funeral-262490478c134cfdbe680dc4e393f1e6\">longtime firefighter</url> died when he was struck by a utility vehicle as he battled a large brush fire.\u00a0</p><p>The drought conditions were a surprise given the region's long-term trend of higher rainfall, said <url normalizedValue=\"https://necasc.umass.edu/people/michael-rawlins\">Michael Rawlins</url>, a climate scientist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and associate director of its Climate System Research Center. \"What we experienced in fall 2024 was very, very anomalous,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p>Climate models outline that as global temperature averages rise, there will be <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nrcc.cornell.edu/services/blog/2023/11/15/20231115_precip_projections.jpg\">increased rainfall</url> for the Northeast this decade and beyond. The region has already seen a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nrcc.cornell.edu/services/blog/2023/11/15/index.html#:~:text=The%20Northeast%20is%20expected%20to,of%20all%20the%20U.S.%20regions.\">60 percent increase</url> in days with extreme rainfall since 1958, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nrcc.cornell.edu/services/blog/2023/11/15/20231115_extreme_precip_northeast.jpg\">data from the US Forest Service and NOAA</url>.\u00a0</p><p>This year, NOAA's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/expert_assessment/sdo_summary.php\">seasonal drought outlook</url> forecasts improving drought conditions by the end of April. But its precipitation tracker projections are less clear, falling somewhere between above-average wet and dry conditions, and offering little certainty or comfort to regional fire managers.</p><p>Part of what drives more intense rainfall is simple science. Warmer air holds more moisture. As global temperature averages increase, so does the atmosphere's moisture-holding capacity. That explains the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weather.gov/btv/The-Great-Vermont-Flood-of-10-11-July-2023-Preliminary-Meteorological-Summary\">extreme</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/0839baabf3a9483aa7fd3fadb99fdd36\">deluges</url> that parts of New England are experiencing.</p><p>But a \"warmer atmosphere is a more thirsty atmosphere,\" Rawlins said. More moisture evaporates from the land and waterways with warm temperatures. The thirstier atmosphere pulls moisture from leaf litter, twigs and soil across the forest floor, leaving behind a perfect fuel for fire.\u00a0</p><p>This was precisely the case in the fall of 2024. Massachusetts saw less than three-quarters of an inch of rain in September and warmer-than-average temperatures. \"It was beautiful,\" Celino said about the autumn months. \"Any given weekend if you went to a state park it was packed with people. But the whole time all of those factors are continuously drying out the field and continually setting the stage.\"</p><p>Leaf litter and organic material in soil dries out in drought conditions, and fire can burn through it and as deep as two feet into the ground. Celino said that drove the fire across Massachusetts, part of what he called a \"historic event\" that demanded a robust response not seen since 1947. Massachusetts experienced 663 fires in October and November when the monthly average usually falls between 15 and 20. By the end of the year, 4,600 acres had burned across the state, with 4,000 acres charred in less than 60 days. \"That's way off the charts,\" Celino said.\u00a0</p><p>Because the state had no lightning storms in October or November, each fire was determined to be human-caused, Celino said.</p><p>\"If you left a campfire going with any of those fine leaf litter fuels [like pine needles] around it, that fire was not going to go out on its own. It was going to burn through the organic layer of soil and escape and become a wildland fire, no doubt about it,\" he said.</p><p>Since the fall of 2023, the state of Maine has required <url normalizedValue=\"https://apps1.web.maine.gov/burnpermit/public/index.html\">open burn permits </url>for large campfires and brush pile burns to prevent human-caused fires from sparking into uncontrolled blazes. Whether the permits are issued depends on weather stations' daily calculations for low to moderate wildfire risk. Terri Teller, a Maine forest ranger specialist, credits the program with reducing fires there, even as Maine experienced extreme drought conditions with the rest of New England.</p><p>Teller added that homeowners can play a pivotal role. They can clean gutters and \"defensible space,\" the 30 feet around a house, of dead vegetation, leaves or plants.\u00a0</p><p>At the NFFPC annual meeting in South Portland, fire managers reflected on how states and municipal managers can better prepare. Communication among firefighters and between states proved essential in containing blazes this year, Celino said. Crews can learn to be even more nimble in recognizing their limits on the ground and knowing when to ask for help, he said.</p><p>The coalition shared resources this autumn, including firefighters, engines and hoses, among Massachusetts, Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Rhode Island and New York. But states should review the costs of equipment sharing as extreme weather events increase, Celino said. \"The lesson is that the state systems need to plan for that expense.\"</p><p>Celino and his colleagues said they have a fresh appreciation for how quickly drought can sap an environment, and how crews must prepare. The fall fires were particularly challenging to municipal and volunteer crews, which are trained primarily to respond to structure fires rather than wildfires, Celino said.</p><p>\"Boy, we need more training in wildland fire tactics and strategies for local responders,\" he said. Teller said the forest service in Maine plans to increase wildfire training this spring.</p><p>The surprising drought is part of a shift towards more climate volatility that researchers explored in a paper published in<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-024-00624-z\"> Nature Reviews in January</url>.</p><p>The authors of the journal article examined three-month swings in weather conditions that resulted in rapid drought and flood risks, using data reaching back to 1900. They calculated that the global averages of what they call \"hydroclimate whiplash\"-rapid swings between very wet and very dry conditions-had increased by 31 to 66 percent between 1975 and 2015. They forecast that such three-month swings could increase up to 113 percent under global climate warming of 3 degrees Celsius, which the world is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/nations-must-close-huge-emissions-gap-new-climate-pledges-and\">on track to reach by the end of this century</url>.</p><p>Rawlins, the University of Massachusetts climatologist, said the climate whiplash theory rests on observations that the jet stream is essentially becoming \"stuck in place\" as the pace of warming across the Arctic is faster than in the Earth's mid-latitudes. \"A wet period that used to be a week or so might stretch longer now, or a dry period may linger longer,\" he said. What can follow are big swings from extremely wet to extremely dry.</p><p>Teller says navigating the volatility is tricky. \"We're not seeing more drought. It's these alternating periods of drought and then rain,\" she said. \"I guess the lesson is just being flexible to realize that we may be having more of these extreme patterns.\"\u00a0</p><p>Meteorologists are unsure what spring will bring given that NOAA's tracker provides no clear trend for rain. Fire managers are riveted on questions of risk.\u00a0</p><p>This winter, across New England, only a slight snowpack has covered the ground. When or how early the snowpack recedes, how much vegetation will be uncovered and exposed to sunlight and when and how intensely spring rains might fall are questions for managers preparing for the next wildfire season.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The ruin of 2024 is a memory and a warning to fire crews about little-understood volatility. \"It makes us pay attention,\" Celino said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INCLNE-91511</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INCLNE2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F58-VNJ3-RST1-M51K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">462782</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1386\"/><timeReceived>10:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 InsideClimate News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Inside Climate News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"02\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>February 18, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002536</classCode><className>PEOPLE'S UNITED FINANCIAL INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS522180 SAVINGS INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER DEPOSITORY CREDIT INTERMEDIATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC6029 COMMERCIAL BANKS, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC6036 SAVINGS INSTITUTIONS, NOT FEDERALLY CHARTERED</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>PBCT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Science</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Climate Change</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Maine</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>New England</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>New York</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northeastern Forest Fire Protection Compact</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Wildfire</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>wildfire management</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Wildfires</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

According to news originating from Shenyang, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Both topography and wildfire can exert significant influences on ecosystem processes and functions during boreal forest successions. However, their impacts on ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) remain unclear.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China; Cas Key Laboratory of Forest Ecology And Silviculture, Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Major Incubation Project of Shenyang Normal University. <br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Chinese Academy of Sciences: \"A mega-fire burned an area of 8700 hectares in the Great Xing'an Mountains in 2000, creating a wide range of fire severity levels across various topographic positions. This provided a unique opportunity to explore the impacts of mixed-severity fire disturbance in boreal forests. We evaluated the effect pathways of wildfire and topography on aboveground multifunctionality (AEMF), soil multifunctionality (SEMF), and overall multifunctionality (OEMF). We found that high-severity burning resulted in lower AEMF, SEMF, and OEMF relative to low-severity burning. Topographic positions significantly influenced SEMF and OEMF, but not AEMF. Specifically, both lower SEMF and OEMF were observed on south-facing slopes.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The structure equation model analysis showed that aspect had exerted strong indirect effects on AEMF, SEMF, and OEMF by affecting soil moisture and regenerated tree density (RTD). Fire severity had indirect negative effects on AEMF and OEMF by reducing RTD and on SEMF by reducing soil bacterial diversity and RTD. Our study elucidates the necessity of considering postfire site environments to better manage forest ecosystems and, in turn, promote the rapid recovery of boreal ecosystem functions.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Topography and Wildfire Jointly Mediate Postfire Ecosystem Multifunctionality in a Chinese Boreal Forest.

According to news reporting from Vietnam National University of Forestry by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Pinus cernua L.K. Phan ex Aver., K.S.\" </p><p><br/> The news editors obtained a quote from the research from Vietnam National University of Forestry: \"Nguyen and T.H. Nguyen (Pinaceae) is a critically endangered species restricted to the Laos - Vietnam border. The population of this species has been declining due to habitat loss and forest fire. Predicting the potential distribution of the species is an important priority for conservation plans and strategies. In this study, a MaxEnt model was used for predicting the potential distribution of P. cernua using 21 occurrence data and 13 environmental variables. Precipitation of driest month (with 32.3% of contribution), annual mean diurnal range (23.4%), elevation (18.4%), and aspect (12.3%) are crucial factors for predicting the species' potential distribution in the MaxEnt model, while remaining factors are less important factors. The suitable distribution was predicted in the north-western region of Vietnam and the adjacent regions of Son La and Thanh Hoa provinces (Vietnam) and Houaphan province (Laos) with 1,544 km2 in total. The high, medium, and low suitability areas are 159 km2 (10%), 475 km2 (31%), and 910 km2 (59%), respectively.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The current protected areas do not contain many of the possible habitats for this species. Priority should be given to conservation efforts for species in these potentially suitable locations both in- and outside of current protected areas, particularly in the surrounding area of Vietnam and Laos.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: PREDICTING THE POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION OF Pinus cernua L.K.

According to news reporting from Hanoi, Vietnam, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Forest fires can cause significant harm to the biodiversity, air quality, economy, and industries that depend on forests, which is particularly critical given the current climate change scenario. Therefore, it is crucial to predict potential fire risks, especially in Dak Nong, a province located in the highland region of Vietnam, where forest farming is prevalent.\" </p><p><br/> Financial support for this research came from Van Lang University. <br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from the Hanoi National University of Education, \"In this study, the utilization of remote sensing data from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) revealed a decline in forest areas while agricultural rubber and industrial crops witnessed an increase. Furthermore, the integration of SPOT satellite images with UAV and the eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) classification algorithm proved highly efficient in mapping forest types in this province (OA = 81.446%, and Kappa = 0.803). To assess forest fire susceptibility in this study, a hybrid model known as Artificial bee colonyAdaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ABC-ANFIS) was employed, which indicated that the majority of forests in the area face high to very high of fires, particularly in bamboo and dipterocarp forest areas. The present model is proposed to suggest better prevention and suppression strategies. These facts can help managers stop fires or deal with this disturbance more effectively that may occur in the future.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Policymakers and researchers in different areas, such as the limestone forest in the north or the Dipterocarp forests in Vietnam, may consider replicating this study to evaluate specific wildfire risks and develop appropriate fire prevention strategies tailored to their local circumstances.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Classifying Forest Cover and Mapping Forest Fire Susceptibility In Dak Nong Province, Vietnam Utilizing Remote Sensing and Machine Learning.

The new pause on foreign aid is separate from a broader freeze order on federal assistance that the Trump administration issued Monday - and then rescinded Wednesday . Newly confirmed Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday put in place a 90-day freeze on foreign development assistance to give agency officials time to determine whether the programs are aligned with President Donald Trump's America First agenda. It was unclear Wednesday how the decision to rescind the broader freeze order on federal assistance applied to foreign aid, if at all. A statement from the State Department indicated it was proceeding. </p><p>No matter the determination, foreign policy experts said U.S.-funded climate projects abroad were doubly at risk with the new administration - given Trump's antipathy toward both climate action and overseas aid. With that vulnerability, they added, comes a real danger to U.S. humanitarian outreach and the global drive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \"This is going to have extremely consequential implications for years, if not decades, to come,\" said Gillian Caldwell, former chief climate officer at the U.S. Agency for International Development during the Biden administration. The directive from the State Department, which also applies to USAID, calls for groups to stop their work immediately - forcing them to contemplate layoffs, widespread furloughs and other program cutbacks. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said Tuesday on social media that the pause already has prevented $12 million in support services to USAID's Bureau for Resilience, Environment and Food Security. The State Department took a similar tone with a press statement released Wednesday. \"Without the pause, U.S. taxpayers would have provided condoms (and other contraceptive services) in Gaza, climate justice marketing services in Gabon, clean energy programs for women in Fiji,\" according to the media note . \"We are rooting out waste. We are blocking woke programs. And we are exposing activities that run contrary to our national interests.\" The rules around U.S. government spending are strict. Even if funding has gone out to implementing partners or nongovernmental organizations, they must spend it on things that are allowable or the money could get pulled back. That's according to a representative from a U.S.-based humanitarian group who was granted anonymity due to concerns that speaking out publicly could affect the group's future funding. The representative added that most groups don't have the funding reserves to keep operating without permission. \"A 90-day pause is essentially the same thing as canceling a program,\" they said. Local organizations in countries in line to benefit from U.S. funding are likely to face the greatest impacts. They also are the least likely to survive even a temporary shutdown. Plus - if the funding doesn't resume after the review period - it could halt any progress those programs had been making, said Caldwell, who also served as deputy assistant administrator in USAID's resilience, environment and food security bureau. \"For right now, all the work we've done for decades is at stake,\" she said. Climate and environment programs are likely targets. Those include efforts to combat wildlife trafficking in Africa and Asia, develop clean energy in Indonesia displaced by devastating flooding in 2023. It also covers activities such as renewable energy auctions and climate-smart investment programs that aim to make countries less reliant on foreign aid. Last November USAID committed nearly $40 million to strengthen protection of an expanse of the Brazilian Amazon the size of California through activities such as regenerative agriculture and forest fire management. Then-President Joe Biden announced the funding during his visit to the world's largest rainforest. In 2024, USAID also put another $11 million into Servir last January that the system provided advanced notice of cyclones in Malawi, helping save lives and preventing $40 million in losses. Then there is the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, a U.S.-funded program that delivers real-time information to governments and aid agencies in food-insecure countries, alerting them of impending famine and drought shocks. The program's website was down as of Wednesday evening. The loss of these and other services \"would severely restrict development and exacerbate the consequences climate change has on Ethiopia,\" said Yomif Worku, a senior consultant at the Ethiopian Humanitarian Fund, part of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Rubio issued a waiver to the funding pause for lifesaving humanitarian assistance, such as medical services, food and shelter, in addition to some limited exceptions. Cuts to climate work may not meet that criteria but could have longer-term implications for how countries develop and whether they're able to rein in planet-warming pollution and harden their defenses against worsening natural disasters. \"If you look at what USAID actually does in the energy space, it's so far from being a leftist climate agenda,\" said Katie Auth, policy director of the Energy for Growth Hub and a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"This is predominantly energy access for people who do not have power and who are struggling to access kind of basic energy services.\" USAID funding also includes support for U.S.-based universities that conduct research into subjects such as drought-tolerant seeds and other forms of resilience. The aid freeze is a double whammy for countries that have looked to the United States to help lead the global effort to tackle rising temperatures fueled by fossil fuel burning. Trump signed an order last week to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement and cease all funding under the U.N. climate change framework. Former officials argue those actions threaten America's credibility as a reliable partner and create opportunities for adversaries such as China to step in and fill the void. \"Why would partners trust us to do long-term, complicated infrastructure projects when we've proven we can't even pay our bills on time?\" said Auth, who worked at USAID from 2014 to 2020. She called the moves \"incredibly damaging\" - not only to Trump's agenda but to America's long-term goals around the world. Caldwell put it this way: \"If President Trump has an America First policy, this move is the best way to put America last.\" Reporter Karl Mathiesen contributed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CLIWRE-00000194b417d86da7b6b6dfa88d0001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CLIWRE2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F73-X743-RS8P-20K0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388351</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1124\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ClimateWire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"01\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>January 30, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news reporting out of Yunnan, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Real-time detection of forest fires through remote sensing is a challenging task, especially in the context of limited data availability. In response to this challenge, this article leverages the digital twin (DT) concept to create a comprehensive and high-fidelity synthetic forest wildfire dataset.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), Famous Teacher of Teaching\" of the Yunnan 10000 Talents Program, Research and Achievement Cultivation and Teaching Reformation Project on Graduate Education at Yunnan University, The 14th Research Innovation Project of Yunnan University School of Information Technology, Yunnan Provincial Education Science Research Fund Project, Expert Workstation in Yunnan Province, Grassroots Expert Workstation in Yunnan Province. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Yunnan University, \"Alongside this, we have made available a high-resolution forest fire remote sensing dataset from real scenarios, meticulously collected and annotated by our research team. Aiming for precision in detecting forest fires via remote sensing, we present the remote sensing forest wildfire detection network (RFWNet) and its lightweight version, RFWNet-nano. More specifically, our network's backbone, grounded on deformable convolution network v3 (DCNv3), develops a multigroup mechanism, amplifying its ability to perceive the correlations overextended distances. Utilizing our dual-path dynamic sparse attention (DDSA), we meld coarse-grained regional selection with granular token-to-token attention, adeptly capturing the evolving contours of fires and smoke. To address diverse scenarios, our Vanilla Head design, backed by a profound training approach and simultaneous stacked activations, accurately identifies flames and smoke across multiple scales. Furthermore, we advocate for a 24/7 real-time monitoring system, synergizing drones, edge computing devices, and NVIDIA GPUs.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Our experimental outcomes indicate that relative to numerous prevailing object detection algorithms, RFWNet and RFWNet-nano both manifest considerable superiority in terms of quantitative precision and visual results, substantiating the robustness and preeminence of our methodologies.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Rfwnet: a Multiscale Remote Sensing Forest Wildfire Detection Network With Digital Twinning, Adaptive Spatial Aggregation, and Dynamic Sparse Features.

The fire is east of Sea Green Drive and Bannon Lane moving northeast at a slow rate of speed, according to the Berlin Fire Department.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Overnight operations were paused due to dangerous conditions and resumed on Tuesday morning, officials said.</p><p>\"We've been monitoring it all night and probably be monitoring it throughout tonight as well and continue to make sure everybody is safe. We got some crews rotating out today and we're trying to go as easy as we can on everybody,\" said Berlin Fire Chief Jeff Pajor during a press conference Tuesday morning. \"DEEP is really leading the charge up there in terms of wilderness firefighting.\"</p><p>Despite the fire being between 10 and 15 acres, there is no threat to buildings or people, and no evacuations have been made, Pajor said. In addition, no firefighters have been injured fighting the blaze.</p><p>Additional resources were called in from Newington, Wethersfield, Rocky Hill, Cromwell and Meride. Crews said they expect the fire to be \"prolonged,\" and that it will take multiple days to contain. A no-fly restriction has been issued for the area, according to officials.</p><p>Other towns including Burlington and Vernon have also reported large brush fires due to prolonged dry conditions.</p><p>The Burlington Fire Department reported a brush fire Saturday behind Burlwood Drive, Sherman Drive and Stafford Road. On Monday afternoon, fire crews reported another large brush fire in a wooded area on Covey Road near Hotchkiss Road.</p><p>\"At both locations, there were signs of previous campfire activity,\" Burlington Fire Department said in a statement. \"We remind the public that the fire danger is VERY HIGH and the current drought conditions are extreme. Open burning under these conditions is prohibited. Your vigilance is appreciated, and your safety is our top priority. Our crews along with our mutual aid partners from Canton Fire, Farmington Fire, Harwinton Fire, Harwinton Westside, Nepaug Fire and Tunxis Hose have all worked tirelessly over the past four days keeping the community safe.\"</p><p>The Vernon Fire Department also responded to a large brush fire on Reservoir Road just south of the Interstate 84 corridor in the northeast section of town on Monday, according to fire officials. Fire crews said special equipment including tankers were used throughout the afternoon into the evening to put out the flames.</p><p>Vernon firefighters requested mutual aid from neighboring towns and the Connecticut's Department of Energy and Environmental Protection responded to the scene to assist as well. No firefighters were injured fighting the fire, Vernon officials said.</p><p>\"A total of 9 acres burned and was brought under control in just about three hours. Crews remained on the scene for several more hours. The fire continues to smolder and produce smoke but has a secure perimeter,\" according to the Vernon Fire Department.</p><p>As of Tuesday, all of Connecticut's eight counties were considered at \"very high\" forest fire danger risk, according to the daily report issued by DEEP.</p><p>\"It is unusual to have it as dry as it has been over a prolonged period, you have to go back to the end of August before we had any significant rain throughout Connecticut,\" AccuWeather senior meteorologist Tom Kines said. \"If anybody is looking for a significant amount of rain, it's definitely not happening for a while. There's some signs that at the end of the month there could be a front that brings some beneficial rain. But until then we're pretty much high and dry.\"</p><p>The state saw historic flooding in August that brought torrential downpours and caused widespread damage. Since then, it has been a relatively dry fall season, according to Kines. Since the start of the autumnal equinox on Sept. 22, there has not been significant precipitation.</p><p>Hartford County has seen the least amount of rain with 0.69 inches of rainfall over the last month, according to precipitation data from the National Weather Service. During the same period from Aug. 24 through Sept. 24, Hartford County saw 8.07 inches of rain. The normal average for Hartford County this time of year is just over four inches of rain.</p><p>According to the state's Department of Agriculture drought monitor, most of the state is experiencing \"abnormally dry\" conditions. If dry conditions persist, this will be elevated to a \"moderate drought.\"</p><p>\"Most of our rainfall we get in the summer is from thunderstorms, we're getting into the time of year now when we don't really get the thunderstorms,\" Kines said. \"What we typically get for big rainfall this time of year are tropical systems that come north. But it doesn't seem that it is likely a tropical form will make its way up to New England.\"</p><p>Stephen Underwood can be reached at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:sunderwood@courant.com\">sunderwood@courant.com</email></p><p>\u00a92024 Hartford Courant.

According to news originating from Athens, Greece, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"This paper investigates the applicability of deep learning models for predicting the severity of forest wildfires, utilizing an innovative benchmark dataset called EO4WildFires. EO4WildFires integrates multispectral imagery from Sentinel-2, SAR data from Sentinel-1, and meteorological data from NASA Power annotated with EFFIS data for forest fire detection and size estimation.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include European Union's Horizon 2020 Research And Innovation Program. <br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Agricultural University of Athens: \"These data cover 45 countries with a total of 31,730 wildfire events from 2018 to 2022. All of these various sources of data are archived into data cubes, with the intention of assessing wildfire severity by considering both current and historical forest conditions, utilizing a broad range of data including temperature, precipitation, and soil moisture. The experimental setup has been arranged to test the effectiveness of different deep learning architectures in predicting the size and shape of wildfire-burned areas. This study incorporates both image segmentation networks and visual transformers, employing a consistent experimental design across various models to ensure the comparability of the results. Adjustments were made to the training data, such as the exclusion of empty labels and very small events, to refine the focus on more significant wildfire events and potentially improve prediction accuracy. The models' performance was evaluated using metrics like F1 score, IoU score, and Average Percentage Difference (aPD). These metrics offer a multi-faceted view of model performance, assessing aspects such as precision, sensitivity, and the accuracy of the burned area estimation. Through extensive testing the final model utilizing LinkNet and ResNet-34 as backbones, we obtained the following metric results on the test set: 0.86 F1 score, 0.75 IoU, and 70% aPD. These results were obtained when all of the available samples were used. When the empty labels were absent during the training and testing, the model increased its performance significantly: 0.87 F1 score, 0.77 IoU, and 44.8% aPD. This indicates that the number of samples, as well as their respectively size (area), tend to have an impact on the model's robustness.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"This restriction is well known in the remote sensing domain, as accessible, accurately labeled data may be limited. Visual transformers like TeleViT showed potential but underperformed compared to segmentation networks in terms of F1 and IoU scores.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Deep Learning Approaches for Wildfire Severity Prediction: A Comparative Study of Image Segmentation Networks and Visual Transformers on the EO4WildFires Dataset.

According to news reporting from Guizhou, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Pine and fir wood is commonly used in furniture, gardening and construction industries, and has high economic value. It is in great demand in the timber industry.\" </p><p><br/> Financial support for this research came from Guizhou Provincial Science and Technology Projects. <br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Guizhou Normal University, \"Therefore, pine and fir trees are now widely planted in China. However, pine and fir trees belong to flammable species, with a high content of oil and grease, and the ignition point of pine and fir leaf litter is extremely low. Once burning occurs, it spreads rapidly and can easily turn into a major forest fire. Therefore, the use of extinguishing agents to mitigate and prevent the spread of forest fires is of great importance. In this paper, fire and extinguishing tests were investigated using mixed wood stack burning of pine and fir and mixed fuel from leaf litter. The suppression effects of three different extinguishing agents, AFFF, CAF and hydrogel, on wood fires and leaf litter combustion were compared. And the suppression supply strength of different extinguishing agents to suppress pine and fir trees was determined. The results show that both hydrogel and CAF can effectively extinguish wood stack fires, and AFFF shows re-ignition phenomenon after extinguishing wood stack fires; Comparison of extinguishing time, cooling rate and heat dissipation capacity revealed that hydrogel was superior to CAF; Hydrogel has a highly efficient fire extinguishing properties.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"It is calculated that the amount of hydrogel used to extinguish pine and cedar fires is only 54 % of the water required, about 87 % of the amount of Class A foam required under the same circumstances, and about 79 % of the amount of aqueous film-forming foam required; Compared with the foam extinguishing agent, the hydrogel extinguishing agent showed better cooling effect, less extinguishing agent dosage, and shorter extinguishing time of 11 s when extinguishing fires in leaf litter; For the rapid spread of leaf litter combustion and easy to re-ignite characteristics, hydrogel has a significant anti-reignition effect.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Experimental Study On Fire Extinguishing Efficiency of Polymer Hydrogel Fire Extinguishing Agent In Pine-fir Mixed Coniferous Forest Fires.

Most are barely half full, due to the ongoing drought. (Photo courtesy of New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">New Jersey environmental officials are expected to declare a drought warning as soon as Wednesday, requiring water systems possibly statewide to take mandatory water conservation measures.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The state has been under a drought watch since Oct. 12 after two months without measurable precipitation, and the ongoing dry spell \u2014 October was the driest month in New Jersey since climate record-collecting began in 1895 \u2014 shows little sign of ending.</p><p>'You can see a very bleak picture across the entire state, one that is only worsening,' state climatologist David Robinson said.</p><p>Robinson and state geologist Steven Domber helmed a virtual public hearing Tuesday on the state's fast-dwindling water resources, where they laid out the case for New Jersey to declare a drought warning. Gov. Phil Murphy, Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Shawn LaTourette, and other state officials are scheduled to brief the press Wednesday on next steps.</p><p>If they move from watch to warning, it would be the first such declaration in over two decades. The last statewide drought warning was declared in March 2002 and lasted 10 months. Officials could declare a statewide warning or emergency, or make a declaration that targets the driest regions or counties in the state.</p><p>Under a drought watch, water conservation is voluntary and outdoor fire restrictions are in place. Under a warning, LaTourette could order water systems to comply with a series of restrictions, including bulk transfers of water between water systems, development of alternative water supplies, and a temporary modification of water allocation permits, such as reservoir releases.</p><p>After a warning, the governor could declare a drought emergency, under which he would order broader mandatory restrictions on water usage.</p><p>At Tuesday's public hearing, Robinson and Domber largely blamed a months-long lack of precipitation for plummeting levels in water-supply reservoirs \u2014 some are barely half full \u2014 and severely depleted groundwater levels and streamflows statewide.</p><p>Robinson showed <url normalizedValue=\"https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?Northeast\">a recent national map of drought conditions updated weekly by the U.S. Drought Monitor, a partnership between the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</url></p><p>While the map indicates much of the country now has abnormally dry conditions to moderate drought, most of New Jersey is in severe drought, while much of Atlantic, Burlington and Ocean counties were colored red to show extreme drought conditions.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://newjerseymonitor.com/2024/11/12/state-mulls-drought-warning-or-emergency-with-weather-forecast-offering-no-relief/screenshot-2024-11-12-at-2-02-19-pm/\"> (Drought map courtesy of U.S. Drought Monitor)</url></p><p>'It has been 20 years since the Drought Monitor had any part of New Jersey colored in red, in an extreme drought,' Robinson said.</p><p>September was the state's third driest on record, while October, when 4.19 inches of rain normally falls in the Garden State, 'was essentially a shutout for precipitation,' he said.</p><p>The dry conditions are expected to continue 'at least over the short term,' Domber said.</p><p>'We are certainly hoping for a return to normal, but there is no sign of that,' he added.</p><p>The prolonged dry conditions have been accompanied by warmer temperatures than usual, contributing to worsened wildfire risks statewide, the scientists noted.</p><p>Recent wildfires have ravaged the state's north and south, with a 360-acre blaze between Voorhees and Evesham and another 181-acre wildfire in Pompton Lakes largely contained. A separate ongoing fire, dubbed the Jennings Creek Wildfire, has expanded to 3,500 acres in Passaic County and Orange County, N.Y. That was just 20% contained as of Tuesday, with 35 mph winds creating 'significant challenges,' according to the New Jersey Forest Fire Service.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://newjerseymonitor.com/2024/11/12/state-mulls-drought-warning-or-emergency-with-weather-forecast-offering-no-relief/screenshot-2024-11-12-at-3-34-14-pm/\"> The Jennings Creek Wildfire is now burning 3,500 acres in Passaic County and across the state border into Orange County, N.Y.

More than 200 people tuned in, with dozens voicing their concerns and asking questions for over an hour.</p><p>Beyond the weather, many laid the blame for the state's water woes on suburban homeowners who water their lawns.</p><p>'One out of every three gallons that's being used in the summer is lawn irrigation,' said Bob Kecskes, a retired water supply planner at the state Department of Environmental Protection. 'So a small fraction of water customers is helping to go into this drought warning and possible drought emergency We have to start putting some type of regulation on those.'</p><p>Several people who testified worried the state's driest towns and counties would run out of drinking water and water to fight fires.</p><p>Others fretted about water quality, wondering if subsiding water levels in the reservoirs could expose lurking contaminants. One woman asked how the drought was impacting private wells and what restrictions might be placed on property owners who don't rely on public water systems.</p><p>Farmer Jeff Tober of Rancocas Creek Farm in Burlington County warned the drought would impact food supply and threaten farms' winter growing season and next year's crops.</p><p>John Saccenti of the New Jersey Association of Local Boards of Health Association asked if medical facilities would be a priority for water supplies, if the drought persists.</p><p>Morgan Crouch of the New Jersey AmeriCorps Watershed Ambassadors Program testified that as the drought depletes aquifers, where most of South Jersey's drinking water comes from, salt water can be drawn in and pollute the aquifers.</p><p>She also does stream assessments in the Great Egg Harbor watershed in South Jersey and warned of the drought's impact beyond humans.</p><p>'When we're sampling for benthic macroinvertebrates \u2014 little mostly larval insects that are living at the bottom of the stream \u2014 their habitat is being dried up recently with the drought, and those are critters that are supplying food for the entire ecosystem,' Crouch said. 'So that's very concerning.'</p><p>But officials had no answers, with a moderator assuring those who testified that they'd consider their concerns but couldn't address individual questions during the hearing.</p><p>No one argued against the state declaring a drought warning or emergency.</p><p>'We should go to the drought emergency. I think we meet the requirements of that at this point,' said Mike Pisauro, policy director of the Pennington-based nonprofit Watershed Institute. 'Doing the emergency designation, having water conservation, immediately will save water \u2014 water we may not have if we wait too long to take those steps.'</p><p>Nikita Biryukov contributed.</p><p>GET THE MORNING HEADLINES.</p><p> SUBSCRIBE </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-STNW1000995153232304888325217800177</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">Newstex Blogs</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DDC-X3G1-JCMN-Y4BV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1192\"/><timeReceived>9:17 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

It stated that whenever a fire was reported, it was to be put out by 10 a.m. the following morning. In part due to this policy and in part due to a lack of firefighters, the iconic Smokey Bear campaign was launched in 1944, stating, \"Only YOU can prevent wildfires.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The idea that wildfires were purely destructive became ingrained in both American culture and policy. Although meant to mitigate and eliminate fires and their possibility of destruction, in the long term this mindset resulted in the destructive fires now seen almost yearly across the country. By eliminating fires quickly, the USFS was stopping the ecological benefits of burning.</p><p>First, a distinction needs to be made. Although the terms wildfire and forest fire are often used interchangeably, wildfire refers to all natural fires, including forests, brush and grasses, while forest fire refers to only the burning of trees, as the name suggests. For simplicity and consistency, wildfire will be used to talk about all natural fires. However, forests will be the main focus of this issue as those garner the most public interest and are often the most destructive.</p><p>The key issue created by the suppression mindset is underbrush in forests begins to build up. Small fires naturally occur in environments from lightning strikes or dry conditions. These burns help to clear away brush and debris that has built up on the ground. This could include bushes, leaves, sticks or fallen trees.</p><p>When these materials get cleared away, it allows for plants and other organisms close to the forest floor to receive sunlight, water and other nutrients they otherwise would not get. Also, the dead matter burning releases nutrients that help the underbrush to grow and thrive, as well as providing nourishment for the soil. In spaces where fire is more common, light burning can also help weed out invasive and non-native species.</p><p>Some plants also rely on fire to be able to spread and germinate their seeds. Although not as common in the eastern U.S., certain trees have seeds only released under heat only fire can produce. Take the lodgepole pine, found throughout the west, which has its seeds enclosed in cones that have to be melted for them to be released.</p><p>Wildfires both large and small do not only occur in the west. Even in typically wet areas such as Appalachia and the Northeast, natural fires occur to accomplish the same goal of clearing underbrush. During the Canadian wildfires of 2023, a large fire south of the Hudson Bay caused smoke to loom over much of the East Coast and Midwest.</p><p>Without the burning of dead matter on the forest floor, the buildup creates fuel for larger fires. Combine that with a changing climate bringing higher temperatures and less rainfall, massive fires that turn out of control become increasingly common.</p><p>Centuries before Europeans arrived on this continent, Indigenous people were performing controlled burns to manage the natural fires. This entailed getting a designated area to burn away at the underbrush, all while controlling it to make sure it does not spread beyond the area.\u00a0</p><p>In the 1970s, the USFS began doing its own prescribed burns. Although it has been practicing these since then, the public idea of fire as bad still largely looms, and many areas still have a buildup of organic fuel from decades of fire suppression.</p><p>Take Paradise, California for example. In the 2018 Camp Fire, the town was effectively burned to the ground. In 2010, the town had a population of over 26,000. As of the 2020 census, it had just over 4,700.</p><p>In nearby Wayne National Forest, the USFS conducted prescribed burns as recently as late last year. This was an effort to prevent larger fires due to things such as drought, which Athens County has recently experienced.</p><p>Just past Smokey Bear's 80th birthday, remember that although fire can ravage an ecosystem if left unchecked, it can also be a force for good to make that environment thrive.\u00a0</p><p>Ethan Herx is a sophomore studying photojournalism at Ohio University.
