A pin with only 20 hours of service failed, initiating a catastrophic separation of the helicopter\u2019s rotor blades and the main rotor head. The pin, manufactured by Fore Aero and its related entities in Haltom City, Texas, was not made using the proper material required by the manufacturer\u2019s engineering specifications.\u00a0 After the crash, The Federal Aviation Administration and Transport Canada jointly grounded the entire fleet of Bell 212, 204B, and 205 helicopters until they were inspected, and the defective pins were removed and replaced. In all about 400 aircraft were affected by the grounding.\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cA critical component was manufactured from steel that was weaker than that required by the specifications,\u201d stated Sanger, a licensed helicopter pilot. \u201cBecause these pins were made from a weaker type of steel, the pin sheared under ordinary flight conditions resulting in the catastrophic failure of the main rotor assembly.\u201d Sanger noted that a pin made from the proper material would have been able to sustain a shear force 300% greater than the pin which failed.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>According to the accident investigation report, one of the main rotor blades separated from the rotor head assembly as the pilot was landing to pick up a group of firefighters. That caused the catastrophic sequence in which the other rotor blades and the entire main rotor head assembly rapidly separated from the helicopter causing it to crash. Investigators discovered that the main rotor hub strap retaining pin of the first blade assembly to fail was defective and initiated the fatal failure sequence.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOur client was a very skilled pilot and had safely flown in far more dangerous conditions,\u201d said Sanger. \u201cThe defective shear pin and the lack of quality control in the manufacturing process resulted in the death of a very experienced pilot and family member under routine flying conditions. This tragedy should have never happened.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Since 1993, Slack Davis Sanger has been serving clients nationally and internationally, with a combined experience of more than 250 years.

Detroit, a mostly Black city with a poverty rate of about 30%, had some of the worst air quality in the U.S. on Wednesday, prompting the Environmental Protection Agency to warn that \"everyone should stay indoors.\"</p><p>\"The more breaths you're taking, you're inhaling, literally, a fire, camp smoke, into your lungs,\" said Darren Riley, who was diagnosed with asthma in 2018, a few years after arriving in Detroit.</p><p>\"Many communities face this way too often,\" said Riley, who is Black. \"And while this wildfire smoke allows, unfortunately, many people to feel this burden, this is a burden that far too long communities have faced day in and day out.\"</p><p>The EPA's AirNow.gov site showed cities including Chicago, Detroit, Indianapolis and Cleveland, Ohio, had \"very unhealthy air\" as of Wednesday afternoon. A wider circle of unhealthy air spread into Pittsburgh, St. Louis and Louisville, Kentucky.</p><p>Earlier this month, smoke from the wildfires blanketed the U.S. East Coast for days.</p><p>Another round of drifting smoke from the wildfires was moving through western Pennsylvania and central New York and headed toward the Mid-Atlantic, said National Weather Service meteorologist Bryan Jackson. In Canada, smoke will migrate across Quebec and Ontario over the next few days, Environment and Climate Change Canada meteorologist Steven Flisfeder said.</p><p>Detroit's southwest side is home to a number of sprawling refineries and manufacturing plants. It is one of the poorest parts of the city. According to a 2022 report by the American Lung Association, the city's long- and short-term particle pollution ranked among the worst in the nation.</p><p>\"Being close to those refineries - that's an environmental factor that's difficult to control,\" said Dr. Ruma Srivastava, a pediatric pulmonologist at Children's Hospital of Michigan in Detroit. \"It does increase their risk for asthma flareups. For them, it's even more important to follow the (air quality safety) recommendations.\"</p><p>Riley's own experiences prompted him to start JustAir, which provides air pollution monitoring.</p><p>\"Just because you're born in a certain ZIP code or you're born into a certain family with a certain skin color doesn't mean that you should have an unequal go at it,\" he said.</p><p>Upper Midwest</p><p>Elsewhere, Milwaukee County Emergency Medical Services saw a spike in calls for residents with respiratory complaints, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. Office of Emergency Management data show a disproportionate number of calls for respiratory issues - 54.8% - have been for Black people in Milwaukee, according to the newspaper. Milwaukee County's population is 27.1% Black.</p><p>In Chicago, where about 29% of the population is Black, Mayor Brandon Johnson urged young people, older adults and residents with health issues to spend more time indoors. He pledged \"swift action to ensure that vulnerable individuals have the resources they need to protect themselves and their families.\"</p><p>Minnesota issued a record 23rd air quality alert for the year through late Wednesday night, as smoky skies obscured the skylines of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Michigan, Wisconsin and Indiana were among other states issuing air quality alerts, and cities including Louisville also advised people to limit prolonged or intense outdoor activity.</p><p>\"This is particularly thick smoke,\" said Jackson, with the National Weather Service.</p><p>Fires and smoke</p><p>Across Canada, 490 fires are burning, with 255 of them considered to be out of control. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre reported Monday that 29,393 square miles of land including forests has burned across Canada since Jan. 1. That exceeds the previous record set in 1989 of 29,187 square miles, according to the National Forestry Database.</p><p>\"As long as the fires are burning and the smoke is in the atmosphere it is going to be a concern not just for Canadians but Americans as well,\" said Flisfeder, the Canadian meteorologist.</p><p>The small particles in wildfire smoke can irritate the eyes, nose and throat, and can affect the heart and lungs, making it harder to breathe. Health officials say it's important to limit outdoor activities to avoid breathing in the particles.</p><p>The warming planet will produce hotter and longer heat waves, making for bigger, smokier fires, said Joel Thornton, professor and chair of the department of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington.</p><p>Quentin Hernandez, a 24-year-old event planner from Detroit, was out skateboarding for about an hour Wednesday at a skate park near the Ambassador Bridge, which connects the city and Windsor, Ontario.</p><p>\"It just sits like this all day,\" said Hernandez, saying that it smelled like being at a barbecue. \"Literally, the smoke just sits in the air.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Paul Sancya, Associated Press A freighter passes through the Detroit River Wednesday as smoke fills the sky reducing visibility to Windsor, Ontario, as seen from Detroit.

A wider circle of unhealthy air spread into St. Louis and Louisville, Ky.</p><p>\"The more breaths you're taking, you're inhaling, literally, a fire, camp smoke, into your lungs,\" said Detroit resident Darren Riley, who said he would wear a mask if he had to go outside at all on Wednesday.</p><p>The smoke is exacerbating air quality issues for poor and Black communities that already are more likely to live near polluting plants, and in rental housing with mold and other triggers.</p><p>Detroit's southwest side is home to a number of sprawling refineries and manufacturing plants and has battled air pollution for decades. It is also one of the poorest parts of a mostly Black city, which has an overall poverty rate of about 30%. According to a 2022 report by the American Lung Association, the city's ozone and short-term particle pollution ranked among the worst in the nation.</p><p>Elsewhere, Milwaukee County Emergency Medical Services has seen a spike in calls for residents with respiratory complaints, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. Office of Emergency Management data show a disproportionate amount of calls for respiratory issues - 54.8% - have been for Blacks in Milwaukee, according to the newspaper. Milwaukee County's population is 27.1% Black.</p><p>In Chicago, Mayor Brandon Johnson urged young people, older adults and residents with health issues to spend more time indoors and pledged \"swift action to ensure that vulnerable individuals have the resources they need to protect themselves and their families.\"</p><p>Minnesota issued a record 23rd air quality alert for the year through late Wednesday night, as smoky skies obscured the skylines of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Michigan, Wisconsin and Indiana were among other states issuing air quality alerts, and cities including Louisville also advised people to limit prolonged or intense outdoor activity.</p><p>\"This is particularly thick smoke,\" National Weather Service meteorologist Byran Jackson said Wednesday.</p><p>Jackson added that another round of smoky air is going through western New York, western Pennsylvania later Wednesday. \"And then that continues over the northern Mid-Atlantic. It will persist there into Thursday,\" he said.</p><p>Across Canada, 490 fires are burning, with 255 of them considered to be out of control.</p><p>The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre reported Monday that 76,129 square kilometers (29,393 square miles) of land including forests has burned across Canada since Jan. 1. That exceeds the previous record set in 1989 of 75,596 square kilometers (29,187 square miles), according to the National Forestry Database.</p><p>Some wet weather in Quebec gave firefighters a chance to get ahead of some of the flames, but there hasn't been enough rain to extinguish the wildfires. Environment Canada meteorologist Simon Legault said he expects rain to stop falling by Wednesday morning in the regions most affected by forest fires. Many of the fires burning in Canada are in Quebec and Ontario, nearer to North America's most populated areas than western wilderness areas.</p><p>Earlier this month, massive fires burning stretches of Canadian forests blanketed the northeastern United States and the Great Lakes region with smoke, turning the air yellowish gray and prompting warnings for people to stay inside and keep windows closed.</p><p>The small particles in wildfire smoke can irritate the eyes, nose and throat, and can affect the heart and lungs, making it harder to breathe. Health officials say it's important to limit outdoor activities as much as possible to avoid breathing in the particles.</p><p>President Joe Biden could see the impact first-hand Wednesday during a visit to Chicago, where he was expected to promote his renewable energy policies during a major address on the economy. Biden has described the Canadian wildfires as clear evidence of climate change.</p><p>The warming planet will produce hotter and longer heat waves, making for bigger, smokier fires, said Joel Thornton, professor and chair of the department of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington.</p><p>\"You can smell it bad,\" said Priti Marwah, who was beginning a run along Chicago's lakefront on Tuesday. \"I run a hundred miles a week, so this is going to be dangerous today. You can feel it ... just even parking right there and coming out, I can feel it in my lungs.\"</p><p>The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency said a cold front will bring cleaner air from the west across the Great Lakes region by early Thursday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELHLD-5229157</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELHLD2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68KB-9XM1-JCDM-J37F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">156396</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"863\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Woodward Communications, Inc.

The new land designation was conceived as a counterpart to Brownfields, which refers to previously developed lands; and Greenfields, which refers to those sites that have never been developed.</p><p>GHD\u2019s Burntfields Wildfire Risk Management Solution focuses on keeping people and property safe by determining what drives wildfire risks, where and when those risks can occur and offering effective solutions to improve business and community resiliency.

The New York team will join firefighters from New Hampshire and Maine in Quebec. Hundreds of fires in Quebec have triggered several days of air quality health advisories across New York State.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"While we continue to monitor the haze caused by smoke from Canadian wildfires, we are fortunate to have Forest Rangers trained and ready to take on the daunting task ahead,\" Governor Hochul said. \"New Yorkers are always at the ready to help those in need, and I thank our brave wildland firefighters whose efforts will be critical in containing these wildfires.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/I8Biq-0m9Q4\">https://www.youtube.com/embed/I8Biq-0m9Q4</url></p><p>Audio Photos</p><p>New York State often deploys highly trained wildland firefighters to help battle fires as part of interstate and international firefighting compacts. Last week, a Forest Ranger was deployed to serve as the crew boss of an interstate Northeastern Forest Fire Protection Compact crew comprised of firefighters from Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Maine to assist efforts in Nova Scotia.</p><p>New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Basil Seggos said, \"DEC Forest Rangers are world-class wildland firefighters and bring a wealth of knowledge to assist our partners in Canada. Oftentimes, they're traveling out west where we only see the effects of the fire on tv. This time, we've been feeling the effects for days. Their work will be instrumental in helping lead the firefighting efforts and we look forward to their safe return.\"</p><p>These two missions are the first time New York State Forest Rangers have been deployed to Canada since wildfires in Quebec in 2005. In 1979, New York sent its first firefighting crew to assist western states with large wildfires. On average, one or two crews are sent as needed to assist with wildfires nearly every year. In addition to helping contain wildfires and minimize damage, these crews gain valuable experience that can be utilized fighting wildfires and managing all-risk incidents in New York.</p><p>An Air Quality Health Advisory for the Long Island, New York City Metro, Lower Hudson Valley, Upper Hudson Valley, Eastern Lake Ontario, Central New York and Western New York regions remains in effect through at least the end of the day.</p><p>\"New Yorkers are always at the ready to help those in need, and I thank our brave wildland firefighters whose efforts will be critical in containing these wildfires.\"</p><p>Governor Kathy Hochul</p><p>Yesterday, Governor Hochul announcedapproximately one million high-quality N95-style masks are available to New Yorkers to help address air quality impacts. According to recent forecasts and advisories, the air quality index is expected to be unhealthy for most of the state, outside of the North Country, through today. Governor Hochul recommendedthat outdoor school activities be suspended while air quality remains a concern. The Governor also encouraged New Yorkers to postpone any outdoor activities in impacted regions until conditions improve.</p><p>Exposure to current air quality conditions can pose negative health impacts, including:</p><p>Irritation to Eyes, Nose or Throat</p><p>Coughing</p><p>Sneezing</p><p>Runny Nose</p><p>Shortness of Breath</p><p>These conditions are especially dangerous for vulnerable New Yorkers with medical conditions such as asthma and/or heart disease.</p><p>The Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) and Department of Health (DOH) issue Air Quality Health Advisories when DEC meteorologists predict levels of pollution, either ozone or fine particulate matter are expected to exceed an Air Quality Index (AQI) value of 100. Today's advisory is due to fine particulate matter carried by the wind from the wildfires. The AQI was created as an easy way to correlate levels of different pollutants to one scale, with a higher AQI value indicating a greater health concern.</p><p>The latest AQI Forecast can be viewed here.</p><p>Tips for New Yorkers to Stay Safe</p><p>Limit time outdoors to reduce exposure to smoke</p><p>Keep windows of homes and buildings closed</p><p>Avoid strenuous activities</p><p>Outdoor activity across all groups should be limited or minimized when possible, as those with asthma, allergies or other conditions may be affected.</p><p>Avoid prolonged exposure</p><p>Individuals with health vulnerabilities, such as cardiovascular or lung disease, as should those who are pregnant</p><p>For those who must travel outdoors for significant periods, properly fitted, high-quality masks help reduce exposure.</p><p>New York State is at \"moderate\" fire risk and the DEC fire danger map is regularly updated on the DEC website. While the statewide burn ban is no longer in effect, brush burning should only be done when absolutely necessary. Burning garbage or leaves is prohibited year-round in New York State.

According to news reporting from Zaragoza, Spain, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Identification of forest fuels is a key step for forest fire prevention since they provide valuable information of fire behavior. This study assesses NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) system to classify fuel types in Mediterranean environments according to the Prometheus model in a forested area of NE Spain.\" </p><p><br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from University of Zaragoza: \"We used 59,554 GEDI footprints and extracted variables related to height metrics, canopy profile metrics, and aboveground biomass density estimates from products L2A, L2B, and L4A, respectively. Four quality filters were applied to discard high uncertainty data, reducing the initial footprints to 9,703. Spectral indices from Landsat-8 OLI scenes were created to test the effect of their integration with GEDI variables on fuel types estimation. Ground-truth data were comprised of Prometheus fuel types estimated in two previous studies. Only the types that matched in each GEDI footprint in both studies were used, resulting in a final sample of 1,112 footprints. Spearman's correlation coefficient, Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's tests determined the variables to be included in the classification models: the relative height at the 85th percentile, the Plant Area Index, and the Aboveground Biomass Density from GEDI, and the brightness from Landsat-8 OLI.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Best performances were achieved with Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine with radial kernel (SVM-R), which were lower including only GEDI variables (accuracies: RF and SVM-R = 61.54 %) than integrating the brightness from Landsat-8 OLI (accuracies: RF = 83.71 %, SVM-R = 81.90 %). These results allow validating GEDI for fuel type classification of Prometheus model, constituting a promising information for forest management over large areas.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Assessing GEDI-NASA system for forest fuels classification using machine learning techniques.

New York residents were advised to wear face masks outside as one way to prevent respiratory issues. The city was covered in an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/wildfire-smoke-new-york-quebec-air-pollution-1805247?utm_source=Synacor&amp;utm_medium=Attnet&amp;utm_campaign=Partnerships\">orange haze</url> and its air quality was ranked as the worst in the world. Scientists estimate that breathing the city's smoke-filled air is equal to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/health-risks-wildfires-smoke-new-york-city-1805254?utm_source=Synacor&amp;utm_medium=Attnet&amp;utm_campaign=Partnerships\">smoking six cigarettes a day.</url></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, Milloy insisted that the air quality poses no health risks and said that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conducted clinical research on asthmatics and on the elderly, including those with heart disease, and children that showed no \"cough or wheeze\" from any of them.</p><p>\"We have this kind of air in India and China all the time. No public health emergency speaking,\" he said <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/JunkScience/status/1666812695218368520\">during an appearance</url> on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/fox-news?utm_source=Synacor&amp;utm_medium=Attnet&amp;utm_campaign=Partnerships\">Fox News</url>' <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ingraham Angle</emphasis> on Wednesday.</p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/\">Air Quality Index</url> in some parts of New York is over 300 on the scale as of Thursday morning, which is classified as \"hazardous.\" According to a 2020 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/stanford-university?utm_source=Synacor&amp;utm_medium=Attnet&amp;utm_campaign=Partnerships\">Stanford University</url> study, an index reading of 20 is the same as smoking one cigarette a day. Each cigarette shortens a person's life by 11 minutes, according to the National Institute of Health. This means that if the smoke in New York City really is equal to smoking six cigarettes, New Yorkers could have already lost an hour of their life.</p><p>Still, Milloy, a science commentator, said on Wednesday: \"This (New York City's smoke-filled air) is like clean air in China. It's really that in the winter they never turn on their scrubbers for the air pollution because they don't care. This doesn't kill anybody. This doesn't make anybody cough. This is not a health event. This has got nothing to do with climate...this is wildfire smoke. This is natural. This is not because of climate change, fossil fuel [or] internal combustion engines.\"</p><p>Milloy received backlash from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/twitter?utm_source=Synacor&amp;utm_medium=Attnet&amp;utm_campaign=Partnerships\">Twitter</url> users for his remarks, with political scientist <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/lindsaypcohn/status/1666819747730821123\">Lindsay P Cohn saying</url> that particulate pollution such as smoke is a \"leading cause of death worldwide.\" Cohn cited a report by Our World in Data which stated that air pollution is attributed to 11.65 percent of deaths globally.</p><p>Humorist George Hahn wrote: \"Dear Fox News Staff and Guests: Please start smoking. By your logic and reasoning, the experts who claim this smoke is harmful are also probably wrong about cigarettes.\"</p><p>\"Fun fact: The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/fox?utm_source=Synacor&amp;utm_medium=Attnet&amp;utm_campaign=Partnerships\">Fox</url> News fake expert who declares that there is no health risk from wildfire smoke has also long been paid by the tobacco industry to downplay the health effects of cigarette smoke,\" tweeted Nathan Robinson, a political commentator and the editor-in-chief of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Current Affairs</emphasis> magazine.</p><p>Milloy became the executive director of The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition in 1997. The group was launched by tobacco company Phillip Morris that reportedly aimed to disprove scientific facts that revealed the harmful health effects of smoking, according to Climate of Denial, a non-profit that tracks local and national climate change denial.</p><p>In similar remarks to Milloy's, conservative TV host Greg Kelly also downplayed the impact of New York's air quality on Wednesday.</p><p>\"I'll tell you, it actually smells like wood smoke. It's not an unpleasant odor, to be honest. It's kind of weird when it seeps into the building, but outdoors, I can deal with it,\" he said during a segment on his <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/newsmax?utm_source=Synacor&amp;utm_medium=Attnet&amp;utm_campaign=Partnerships\">Newsmax</url> show. \"Folks with respiratory issues though, that's a real thing, a real complication.\"</p><p>Kelly continued: \"The White House is trying to exploit this, saying it's all because of global warming and the normal talking points that go with that. I don't think that's the case. I think it's a forest fire. This actually has happened a couple of times before in history. And for the time being, we can live with it.

But smoke from Canadian wildfires blanketed the Chicago area, blotting out the sun here \u2014 as well as much of the upper Midwest \u2014 with a dense haze reflecting the worst air quality here since the wildfires began. The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency issued an air quality alert for Chicago and Rockford region through tonight, citing \"unhealthy\" conditions and continued dangers for those with \"sensitive respiratory systems.\" People in the affected areas are urged to limit their time outdoors. </p><p>Some activities in the suburbs are being canceled. AirNow.gov, which monitors and tracks air quality throughout the country, listed the Chicago area in the \"Very Unhealthy\" category. As of 4 p.m., the website listed Chicago air quality at 258, the worst air quality of any major city in the world, ABC 7 Chicago reported. Parts of Northwest Indiana, eastern Iowa and large patches of Michigan also were listed as \"Very Unhealthy,\" the fourth-worst condition on the system's five-level scale. The area has not reached the \"Hazardous\" air quality level, which is the worst. When wildfire haze blanketed New York City earlier this month, the AQI peaked at 460, The New York Times reported, citing data from city and state agencies. Wildfire smoke contains small particles called aerosols, some of which can worsen air quality and exacerbate respiratory and cardiovascular health problems. The McHenry County Department of Health released an air quality alert active through today, recommending precautions to reduce exposure to the smoke. Those precautions include shortening time spent active outdoors, keeping windows closed overnight and reducing vehicle trips and idling. For older adults, people with heart or lung disease, pregnant women, children and teenagers, the department recommends avoiding strenuous activities, keeping outdoor activities short and considering moving physical activities indoors or rescheduling them. For those who choose to wear a face covering, the department noted that masks rated N95 or greater are the most effective at stopping fine fire particles. Visibility also is down to one to three miles for much of the region, meteorologists at the National Weather Service's Romeoville bureau said. Besides the haze, the smell of the fires was more noticeable as the air stagnated from low wind speeds, meteorologists explained. \"This summer, cities across North America have seen unhealthy levels of air quality as a result of wildfire smoke, impacting over 20 million people from New York City, Washington, D.C., Montreal, and today here in Chicago,\" Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said in a statement Tuesday. \"As we work to respond to the immediate health concerns in our communities, this concerning episode demonstrates and underscores the harmful impact that the climate crisis is having on our residents, as well as people all over the world.\" Wheaton police officials canceled an event at Northside Park because of air quality issues. They are planning to reschedule at a later date. The Batavia Park District closed Hall Quarry Beach through today, canceling both lessons and open swim. The Geneva Park District closed Sunset Pool at 4:30 p.m. Tuesday and advised people to check the RainOut app or telephone line, at (630) 206-1174, today. Though it is difficult to determine whether the fires are a direct result of climate change, experts say the unprecedented impact of the blazes is in line with the science \u2014 which says extreme weather events are likely to occur more frequently as the planet warms. A storm system expected to move into the area later this week is anticipated to push out the haze and ultimately bring higher temperatures, according to weather service forecasts. The wildfires, spurred on by dry conditions and unusually high temperatures, numbered 490 as of Tuesday. Half are considered \"out of control,\" meaning the fires are expected to grow, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. The fires have scorched more than 14 million acres since the start of the year, which is 15 times the 10-year average. Since 1959, Canada has experienced a significant rise in the number of large fires and area burned, according to a 2018 study published in the Canadian Journal of Forest Research. The study reported that the country's fire season is starting approximately one week earlier and ending one week later than in the past.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Jeff <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Knox/jknox@dailyherald.com\">Knox/jknox@dailyherald.com</email> Paddleboarders and kayakers work their way up the Fox River through the heavy haze Tuesday in Geneva.

According to news reporting originating from Kayseri, Turkey, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Smoke is the first visible sign of forest fires and the most commonly used feature for early forest fire detection using data from cameras. However, one of the natural challenges is the dense fog that appears in forests, which decreases the detection accuracy or triggers false alarms.\" </p><p><br/> Financial support for this research came from Ministry of National Education - Turkey. <br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Abdullah Gul University, \"In this study, we propose a system with a deep neural network-based image preprocessing approach that significantly improves the smoke segmentation and classification performance by dehazing the camera view. Our experimental results provide that the classification models reach 99% F1 score for the correct classification of smoke when the image dehazing method is used before the training process. The smoke localization system achieves 60% average precision when the mask region-based convolutional neural network is used with the ResNet101-FPN backbone.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The proposed approach can be utilized for all smoke segmentation frameworks to increase fire detection performance.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Camera-based Wildfire Smoke Detection for Foggy Environments.

But smoke from Canadian wildfires blanketed the Chicago area, blotting out the sun here \u2014 as well as much of the upper Midwest \u2014 with a dense haze reflecting the worst air quality here since the wildfires began. The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency issued an air quality alert for Chicago and Rockford region through tonight, citing \"unhealthy\" conditions and continued dangers for those with \"sensitive respiratory systems.\" People in the affected areas are urged to limit their time outdoors. </p><p>Some activities in the suburbs are being canceled. AirNow.gov, which monitors and tracks air quality throughout the country, listed the Chicago area in the \"Very Unhealthy\" category. As of 4 p.m., the website listed Chicago air quality at 258, the worst air quality of any major city in the world, ABC 7 Chicago reported. Parts of Northwest Indiana, eastern Iowa and large patches of Michigan also were listed as \"Very Unhealthy,\" the fourth-worst condition on the system's five-level scale. The area has not reached the \"Hazardous\" air quality level, which is the worst. When wildfire haze blanketed New York City earlier this month, the AQI peaked at 460, The New York Times reported, citing data from city and state agencies. Wildfire smoke contains small particles called aerosols, some of which can worsen air quality and exacerbate respiratory and cardiovascular health problems. The McHenry County Department of Health released an air quality alert active through today, recommending precautions to reduce exposure to the smoke. Those precautions include shortening time spent active outdoors, keeping windows closed overnight and reducing vehicle trips and idling. For older adults, people with heart or lung disease, pregnant women, children and teenagers, the department recommends avoiding strenuous activities, keeping outdoor activities short and considering moving physical activities indoors or rescheduling them. For those who choose to wear a face covering, the department noted that masks rated N95 or greater are the most effective at stopping fine fire particles. Visibility also is down to one to three miles for much of the region, meteorologists at the National Weather Service's Romeoville bureau said. Besides the haze, the smell of the fires was more noticeable as the air stagnated from low wind speeds, meteorologists explained. \"This summer, cities across North America have seen unhealthy levels of air quality as a result of wildfire smoke, impacting over 20 million people from New York City, Washington, D.C., Montreal, and today here in Chicago,\" Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said in a statement Tuesday. \"As we work to respond to the immediate health concerns in our communities, this concerning episode demonstrates and underscores the harmful impact that the climate crisis is having on our residents, as well as people all over the world.\" Wheaton police officials canceled an event at Northside Park because of air quality issues. They are planning to reschedule at a later date. The Batavia Park District closed Hall Quarry Beach through today, canceling both lessons and open swim. The Geneva Park District closed Sunset Pool at 4:30 p.m. Tuesday and advised people to check the RainOut app or telephone line, at (630) 206-1174, today. Though it is difficult to determine whether the fires are a direct result of climate change, experts say the unprecedented impact of the blazes is in line with the science \u2014 which says extreme weather events are likely to occur more frequently as the planet warms. A storm system expected to move into the area later this week is anticipated to push out the haze and ultimately bring higher temperatures, according to weather service forecasts. The wildfires, spurred on by dry conditions and unusually high temperatures, numbered 490 as of Tuesday. Half are considered \"out of control,\" meaning the fires are expected to grow, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. The fires have scorched more than 14 million acres since the start of the year, which is 15 times the 10-year average. Since 1959, Canada has experienced a significant rise in the number of large fires and area burned, according to a 2018 study published in the Canadian Journal of Forest Research. The study reported that the country's fire season is starting approximately one week earlier and ending one week later than in the past.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Jeff <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Knox/jknox@dailyherald.com\">Knox/jknox@dailyherald.com</email> Paddleboarders and kayakers work their way up the Fox River through the heavy haze Tuesday in Geneva.

The fire, which began Aug. 3, is the most severe of hundreds in the past week across Greece, gobbling up pristine pine forests as well as homes and businesses and forcing hundreds to quickly evacuate by sea to save their lives.</p><p>Greece has been baked by its worst heat wave in three decades, which sent temperatures up to 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) and turned its prized pine forests into bone-dry tinderboxes.</p><p>In a televised nationwide address, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the destruction in Evia and elsewhere \u201cblackens everyone's hearts\u201d and pledged compensation for all affected, as well as a huge reforestation and regeneration effort. He also apologized for \u201cany weaknesses\u201d shown in addressing the emergency, a nod to criticism from some residents and officials who said Greece's firefighting efforts and equipment were woefully inadequate.</p><p>\u201cThese last few days have been among the hardest for our country in decades,\u201d Mitsotakis said. \u201cWe are dealing with a natural disaster of unprecedented dimensions.\u201d</p><p>With roads on the island cut off by the flames, residents and tourists fled to Evia's beaches and jetties to be ferried to safety by a flotilla of ferries and boats.</p><p>\u201cWe were completely forsaken. There were no fire brigades, there were no vehicles, nothing!\u201d David Angelou, who had been in the seaside village of Pefki, said Sunday night after leaving by ferry to the mainland.</p><p>\u201cYou could feel the enormous heat, there was also a lot of smoke. You could see the sun, a red ball, and then, nothing else around,\u201d he said.</p><p>Mitsotakis said Monday he \u201cfully understands\u201d the pain of those who lost homes or property, and the anger of those seeking airborne assistance \u201cwithout knowing whether the firefighting aircraft were operating elsewhere or whether conditions made it impossible for them to fly.\u201d</p><p>But he urged Greeks to reflect \u201cnot only on what was lost but also on what was saved in such an unprecedented natural disaster.\u201d</p><p>Other big wildfires were still burning Monday in Greece's southern Peloponnese region. Over the past week, hundreds of homes and businesses have been destroyed or damaged, and at least 40,000 hectares (nearly 100,000 acres) have been burned. Power cuts on Monday affected at least 17,000 households.</p><p>The causes of the blazes are as yet undetermined, though several people have been arrested for alleged arson. Greece's top prosecutor has ordered an investigation into whether the high number of fires could be linked to criminal activity.</p><p>More than 20 countries in Europe and the Mideast have responded to Greece's call for help, sending planes, helicopters, vehicles and manpower.</p><p>On Monday, Greece's Foreign Ministry tweeted that neighboring Turkey \u2014 Greece's historic regional rival \u2014 will be sending two firefighting planes because a top envoy said Turkey's wildfires \u201care now under control.\u201d The ministry also said Russia would be sending two firefighting planes and two helicopters.</p><p>Greek authorities, scarred by a deadly wildfire in 2018 near Athens that killed more than 100 people, have emphasized saving lives, issuing dozens of evacuation orders. The coast guard said 2,770 people had been evacuated by sea across the country between July 31 and Aug. 8.</p><p>Some residents ignored the orders to try to save their villages, spraying homes with garden hoses and digging mini firebreaks.</p><p>\u201cThe villagers themselves, with the firefighters, are doing what they can to save their own and neighboring villages,\" said Yiannis Katsikoyiannis, a volunteer from Crete who came to Evia to help his father save his horse farm near Avgaria.</p><p>\u201cIf they had evacuated their villages, as the civil protection told them to, everything would have been burnt down \u2013 perhaps even two days sooner,\" he said. \"Of course, they never saw any water-dropping aircraft. And of course now the conditions are wrong for them to fly, due to the smoke.\u201d</p><p>On Monday, the flames raced across northern Evia, threatening yet more villages even as 600 firefighters struggled to tame the inferno, aided by emergency teams from Ukraine, Romania and Serbia, 5 helicopters and 5 water-dropping planes.</p><p>One Greek volunteer firefighter died near Athens last week while four more were in the hospital Monday, two in critical condition with extensive burns.</p><p>Wildfires were also burning in southern Italy, North Macedonia and Montenegro, where a large fire in the Malo Brdo district of the capital Podgorica was coming close to houses on Monday.</p><p>In Italy, authorities urged the public to be careful with fire amid a heat wave forecast for this week, when many Italians take summer vacations. Firefighters for weeks have been battling blazes in Sardinia, Sicily and Calabria, and two have died.</p><p>\u201cWe have faced very difficult and dramatic days fighting fires, and the temperatures that are forecast require the utmost attention,\u2019\u2019 said Fabrizio Curcio, head of Italy\u2019s Civil Protection agency. \u201cWe are asking the maximum collaboration and caution from citizens ... to avoid any behavior that can set off a fire and report immediately the smallest blaze.\u201d</p><p>In North Macedonia, dozens of wildfires followed the worst heat wave in decades. At least eight were still burning Monday, mostly in remote areas where only helicopters and planes could be deployed. Thousands of acres of forest have been destroyed and authorities have arrested five suspected arsonists.</p><p>___</p><p>Becatoros reported from Athens, Greece.

Now as you no doubt know by now, I have a love for shows dealing with the supernatural. From so-called documentaries such as \"Paranormal Witness\" or \"A Haunting\" to more accepted fiction such as \"Teen Wolf\" or \"Lost Girl.\" One of my favorites however would have to be \"Buffy The Vampire Slayer.\" This show along with the spinoff \"Angel\" are two of my favorite shows of all time. I mean, for the longest time these were the main shows I watched obsessively to the point that I could quote certain scenes verbatim. This was the show which really got me into other supernatural series including the above TV shows. So imagine my absolute joy when I learned that Buffy Summers herself, Sarah Michelle Gellar, was starring in and producing a brand new werewolf oriented show, and when I learned that it was the brainchild of Jeff Davis, the creator of \"Teen Wolf.\" I was absolutely pumped and the results were... interesting.</p><p>\"Wolf Pack\" which is very loosely based on a book series of the same name, largely tells the tale of an ensemble group of teenage protagonists who upon a deadly wildfire, discover they share an unlikely connection and are forced to band together both to find out who started the wildfire and to discover who or what has been murdering people in their town. The whole time a mysterious arson investigator is hot on their trail, and seems to know far more about what's going on than she should.</p><p>\"Wolf Pack\" stars Armani Jackson as Everette Lang, a high schooler with anxiety issues who upon being bitten by a strange wolf-like creature has gained superhuman strength. Bella Shepard plays the part of Blake Navarro, a girl from an impoverished background who upon being bitten\u00a0 \u00a0 gains superhuman speed. Chloe Rose Robertson stars as Luna Briggs, another teenager who was born with her abilities rather than being bitten and possesses a superhuman sense of smell. Tyler Lawerence Gray plays the role of Harlan Briggs, Luna's more abrasive and foul mouthed brother who possesses a superhuman sense of hearing and was also born with his abilities. Rodrigo Santoro, known for roles in movies such as \"300\" and TV shows such as \"Lost\" and \"Westworld\" stars in the role of Garret Briggs, the adopted father of Luna and Harlan, a firefighter and one of the few aware of what Luna and Harlan really are. The above-mentioned Gellar stars as Kristin Ramsey, a mysterious arson investigator who seems to know exactly what's really happening. Gideon Emery known for playing the werewolf Deucalion in \"Teen Wolf\" also has a recurring role as Malcolm, a firefighter who watched his entire unit die in an oddly similar forest fire years ago and was scoffed at upon insisting they were killed by a werewolf-like creature.</p><p>This show was something. The computer-generated imagery for the murderous werewolf left a bit to be desired and some of the acting was a bit stiff at times. Though as the season went on, the show got better to the point where I actually really enjoyed the last episode. Gellar was definitely the highpoint of the show as were the other main adult actors. All in all not bad, solid five and a half torches out of 10. I really hope they make a season two so that they can hopefully build on the great last episode of the first season.\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5498948</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67VN-5TW1-DY7P-T26S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"571\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Collegiate: Grand Rapids Community College</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"03\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>March 24, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Grand Rapids</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>MI</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>STX000113</classCode><className>ARSON</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>N611310GM</classCode><className>COMMUNITY COLLEGES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DNON</classCode><className>PARANORMAL PHENOMENA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009V6I</classCode><className>DOCUMENTARY FILMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001849</classCode><className>WITNESSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp; OPINIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>N611310GM</classCode><className>COMMUNITY COLLEGES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009V6I</classCode><className>DOCUMENTARY FILMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001704</classCode><className>TELEVISION PROGRAMMING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DDKV</classCode><className>SARAH MICHELLE GELLAR</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1O1</classCode><className>GRAND RAPIDS, MI, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

These missions continue to look for fires started by people or lightning. No new fires have been detected on RRSNF-administered lands.</p><p>Several RRSNF resources were utilized on the Upper Applegate fire near Jackson Campground on Saturday including Air Attack to assist in fire management, engines, prevention units and a Type 1 handcrew. Responding units assisted as needed to secure a landing zone for Mercy Flights helicopter for medical response.</p><p>The RRSNF is now hosting two Canadair CL 415 Superscooper air tankers in Medford. Both of these airtankers were shared with the Fir Mountain Fire near Hood River, Oregon.</p><p>A local Type 3 Incident Management Team made up of Bureau of Land Management and Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest personnel has taken command of the Worthington Fire. Mobilizing a Type 3 team for this fire has many benefits. All members are located locally, so no fire camp or lodging is needed. The incident gives the participants the opportunity to utilize their skills in a larger capacity than day-to-day operations. While the team is called a Type 3, some of its members have achieved higher type ratings demonstrating more experience with managing larger events.</p><p>Despite a cooling trend this week, the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest is in high fire danger. Recreationists are encouraged to be on alert to prevent fires from starting and to be aware of fire restrictions wherever you go. For information on current fire restrictions, go to: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/rogue-siskiyou/alerts-notices\">https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/rogue-siskiyou/alerts-notices</url></p><p>Year-to-date, the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest has responded to 19 fires with a total of 2.2 acres burned. Three of these fires were caused by lightning, and 16 were human-caused.</p><p>USDA is an equal opportunity provider, employer, and lender.

The fire, which began Aug. 3, is the most severe of hundreds in the past week across Greece, gobbling up pristine pine forests as well as homes and businesses and forcing hundreds to quickly evacuate by sea to save their lives.</p><p>Greece has been baked by its worst heat wave in three decades, which sent temperatures up to 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) and turned its prized pine forests into bone-dry tinderboxes.</p><p>In a televised nationwide address, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the destruction in Evia and elsewhere \u201cblackens everyone's hearts\u201d and pledged compensation for all affected, as well as a huge reforestation and regeneration effort. He also apologized for \u201cany weaknesses\u201d shown in addressing the emergency, a nod to criticism from some residents and officials who said Greece's firefighting efforts and equipment were woefully inadequate.</p><p>\u201cThese last few days have been among the hardest for our country in decades,\u201d Mitsotakis said. \u201cWe are dealing with a natural disaster of unprecedented dimensions.\u201d</p><p>With roads on the island cut off by the flames, residents and tourists fled to Evia's beaches and jetties to be ferried to safety by a flotilla of ferries and boats.</p><p>\u201cWe were completely forsaken. There were no fire brigades, there were no vehicles, nothing!\u201d David Angelou, who had been in the seaside village of Pefki, said Sunday night after leaving by ferry to the mainland.</p><p>\u201cYou could feel the enormous heat, there was also a lot of smoke. You could see the sun, a red ball, and then, nothing else around,\u201d he said.</p><p>Mitsotakis said Monday he \u201cfully understands\u201d the pain of those who lost homes or property, and the anger of those seeking airborne assistance \u201cwithout knowing whether the firefighting aircraft were operating elsewhere or whether conditions made it impossible for them to fly.\u201d</p><p>But he urged Greeks to reflect \u201cnot only on what was lost but also on what was saved in such an unprecedented natural disaster.\u201d</p><p>Other big wildfires were still burning Monday in Greece's southern Peloponnese region. Over the past week, hundreds of homes and businesses have been destroyed or damaged, and at least 40,000 hectares (nearly 100,000 acres) have been burned. Power cuts on Monday affected at least 17,000 households.</p><p>The causes of the blazes are as yet undetermined, though several people have been arrested for alleged arson. Greece's top prosecutor has ordered an investigation into whether the high number of fires could be linked to criminal activity.</p><p>More than 20 countries in Europe and the Mideast have responded to Greece's call for help, sending planes, helicopters, vehicles and manpower.</p><p>On Monday, Greece's Foreign Ministry tweeted that neighboring Turkey \u2014 Greece's historic regional rival \u2014 will be sending two firefighting planes because a top envoy said Turkey's wildfires \u201care now under control.\u201d The ministry also said Russia would be sending two firefighting planes and two helicopters.</p><p>Greek authorities, scarred by a deadly wildfire in 2018 near Athens that killed more than 100 people, have emphasized saving lives, issuing dozens of evacuation orders. The coast guard said 2,770 people had been evacuated by sea across the country between July 31 and Aug. 8.</p><p>Some residents ignored the orders to try to save their villages, spraying homes with garden hoses and digging mini firebreaks.</p><p>\u201cThe villagers themselves, with the firefighters, are doing what they can to save their own and neighboring villages,\" said Yiannis Katsikoyiannis, a volunteer from Crete who came to Evia to help his father save his horse farm near Avgaria.</p><p>\u201cIf they had evacuated their villages, as the civil protection told them to, everything would have been burnt down \u2013 perhaps even two days sooner,\" he said. \"Of course, they never saw any water-dropping aircraft. And of course now the conditions are wrong for them to fly, due to the smoke.\u201d</p><p>On Monday, the flames raced across northern Evia, threatening yet more villages even as 600 firefighters struggled to tame the inferno, aided by emergency teams from Ukraine, Romania and Serbia, 5 helicopters and 5 water-dropping planes.</p><p>One Greek volunteer firefighter died near Athens last week while four more were in the hospital Monday, two in critical condition with extensive burns.</p><p>Wildfires were also burning in southern Italy, North Macedonia and Montenegro, where a large fire in the Malo Brdo district of the capital Podgorica was coming close to houses on Monday.</p><p>In Italy, authorities urged the public to be careful with fire amid a heat wave forecast for this week, when many Italians take summer vacations. Firefighters for weeks have been battling blazes in Sardinia, Sicily and Calabria, and two have died.</p><p>\u201cWe have faced very difficult and dramatic days fighting fires, and the temperatures that are forecast require the utmost attention,\u2019\u2019 said Fabrizio Curcio, head of Italy\u2019s Civil Protection agency. \u201cWe are asking the maximum collaboration and caution from citizens ... to avoid any behavior that can set off a fire and report immediately the smallest blaze.\u201d</p><p>In North Macedonia, dozens of wildfires followed the worst heat wave in decades. At least eight were still burning Monday, mostly in remote areas where only helicopters and planes could be deployed. Thousands of acres of forest have been destroyed and authorities have arrested five suspected arsonists.</p><p>___</p><p>Becatoros reported from Athens, Greece.

The training is an example of how DEM is building capacity for local wildfire response.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The destructive, almost simultaneous wildfires that occurred in West Greenwich and Exeter in April have heightened public awareness of wildfires. In 2022, which was marked by a severe drought, the state experienced more than 80 wildfires. These fires are expected to become more frequent as climate change continues to create warmer, drier conditions, leading to longer and more active fire seasons.</p><p>MEDIA AVAILABILITY</p><p>What: Observing municipal firefighters and DEM employees being trained in specialized techniques to fight wildfires including demonstrations on firing devices, fire line construction, water use, and mop-up.</p><p>When: Wednesday, June 7, 10 AM-3 PM</p><p>Where: The DEM George Washington Management Area</p><p>2185 Putnam Pike, Chepachet, RI 02814</p><p>The course includes in-class teaching and in-field training, which will offer the best action shots. The field is located behind the management area's office building.</p><p>Misc. This is an outdoor availability that is contingent on the weather. DEM will notify of any changes due to weather. Please RVSP via Mike Healey, 401-258-0787, or <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Michael.Healey@dem.ri.gov\">Michael.Healey@dem.ri.gov</email></p><p>\"DEM's Forest Fire Program works closely with Rhode Island fire departments to suppress wildfires,\" said Principal Forest Ranger and Training Officer Ben Arnold of the DEM Division of Agriculture and Forest Environment. \"We rely on municipal fire departments to fight wildfires and fire departments rely on us in the same way. This training will allow us to build the capacity needed to address the increasing wildfire activity we've seen in recent years. The program offers an opportunity to both DEM employees and Rhode Island firefighters who seek wildfire suppression training at the national standard.\"</p><p>Earlier this year, DEM announced a policy of increasing the use of prescribed fires in 2023. Arnold noted that training firefighters is one of the major goals of prescribed fires, so the training course aligns with DEM's forest management strategy. \"We strongly believe that more planned, prescribed fires mean fewer unplanned, extreme wildfires,\" Arnold said.</p><p>Description/explanation of terms used in wildland firefighter training:</p><p>o Firing devices: Wildland firefighters often use firing operations to control fires by \"backfiring\" or burning out to consume fuel between a control line and the main body of a fire. Drip torches, fusees, and other items are considered primary firing devices. A drip torch allows the burning fuel to drip onto the vegetation where the firefighter wants it to burn. Essentially, a fusee is a torch used to light fires. Fusees burn phosphorous contained within the body of the device.</p><p>o Fire line construction: A fire line is a break in fuel made by cutting, scraping, or digging. It can be done by mechanized equipment such as bulldozers &amp;#151; one of which was used very effectively at the Exeter wildfire in April &amp;#151; but in most wildfires, it is done using hand tools. In building a fire line, all fuels are removed, and the surface is scraped to mineral soil on a strip of a specified size depending on the fuel and slope. It needs to be wide enough to prevent smoldering, burning, or spotting by embers blowing or rolling across the line.</p><p>o Water use: Unlike a housefire on an urban or suburban street where firefighters can connect hose to fire hydrants and spray massive amounts of water until the fire is extinguished, water is very much at a premium at a wildfire and a wildland firefighter must know where and how to use each component of their water delivery system. The course will instruct on backpack pumps, hose, nozzles, simple and progressive hose lays, and appliances used for water application.</p><p>o Mop-up: For wildland firefighters, mopping up describes the hard, physical labor process of extinguishing or removing burning material near fire lines down to the mineral soil, felling fire-damaged trees, and cooling hot spots to make a fire line less likely to escape or to reduce residual smoke. This is followed up by \"cold-trailing\" with the back of one's hand along the ground near the fire line to make sure no heat remains.</p><p>For more information on DEM programs and initiatives, visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dem.ri.gov\">www.dem.ri.gov</url>.

(\u201cHarfang\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSX-V: HAR) is pleased to announce it has resumed its summer-fall program on its lithium and gold projects southeast of the Radisson locality in the northwestern region of Eeyou Istchee James Bay, Qu\u00e9bec. The Government of Qu\u00e9bec has recently lifted all restrictions including travel and access to the forest in force since early June in response to the forest fire situation. Work will continue up to the end of the prospecting season on different projects throughout the entire region (Figure\u00a01).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr. Ian Campbell, President and CEO, commented: \u201cWe are both relieved and excited to resume our field exploration activities in this part of James Bay where the bulk of our gold and lithium projects are located. The program is a \u201cboots on the ground\u201d approach including both a prospecting and geological evaluation combined with onsite geochemistry with the focussed objective of rapidly developing high-priority drill targets on our lithium and gold projects. Our team has extensive operational experience which will be invaluable in making up for lost time during the fire ban.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ongoing Lithium and Gold Exploration</p><p>The field crew is actually based in Radisson and accesses the different properties by helicopter on a daily basis. Prospecting will continue for as long as the weather conditions permit it.</p><p>A first-phase surface exploration campaign (prospecting, mapping, rock sampling) is in progress on the La Passe, Ewart and Sakami properties where large pegmatite occurrences are known but have never been explored for their lithium potential. Ongoing prospecting has confirmed the presence of tourmaline, garnet, apatite and beryl in muscovite-bearing peraluminous pegmatites at La Passe and Ewart.</p><p>Harfang also continues surface exploration in the eastern part of the Serpent-Radisson property where several pegmatite dykes were sampled in 2022. Some of them contain highly anomalous beryllium (up to 25,000 ppm), lithium (up to 1,420 ppm), cesium (up to 998 ppm), tantalum (up to 173 ppm), niobium (up to 278 ppm) and rubidium (up to 1,095 ppm). The main objective of this program on lithium assets is to find Lithium-Cesium-Tantalum Pegmatites (\u201cLCT Pegmatites\u201d) warranting more advanced exploration, including drilling.</p><p>Harfang is also continuing targeted exploration on its Lake Menarik and Serpent-Radisson gold assets (see news release dated June 8, 2023).</p><p>At Lake Menarik, the surface work is a follow-up on the drill and geophysical programs completed last winter and focuses primarily on prospecting the Induced Polarization (\u201cIP\u201d) anomalies detected in the Timiskaming-type conglomerate and along the ankerite-rich shear zone which was discovered during summer 2022 (see news releases dated January 12 and May 11, 2023).</p><p>The 2023 winter program included the Company\u2019s first drill program on the project which successfully demonstrated that wide zones of gold mineralization associated with increasing intensity of alteration extend at depth in the southeast area of the Pierre monzonite. Drilled highlights include 21.0\u00a0metres grading 1.75 g/t Au including 14.1\u00a0metres grading 2.49\u00a0g/t\u00a0Au (LMN-23-001), 75.0\u00a0metres grading 0.54\u00a0g/t Au including 3.0\u00a0metres grading 6.75\u00a0g/t Au and 1.0\u00a0metres grading 12.65\u00a0g/t Au (LMN-23-004), and 47.0\u00a0metres grading 1.15\u00a0g/t Au including 7.0\u00a0metres grading 3.75\u00a0g/t Au (LMN-23-017) (see news release dated May 11, 2023).</p><p>The Lake Menarik Property is characterized by multiple high-grade gold occurrences hosted in intermediate intrusive (syenite, monzonite and monzodiorite) and volcano-sedimentary rocks in a geological setting reminiscent of the Timmins gold mining camp.</p><p>On Serpent-Radisson, the gold exploration is being conducted specifically in an area where 65 soil samples (up to 2.27 g/t Au), spatially associated with gold-rich till samples, define a strong gold anomaly covering 2.2 km2 where no drilling has taken place yet (see news release dated October 5, 2022).</p><p>The intent of the exploration program on these two gold assets is to define priority drill targets. Harfang will also proceed to a geological assessment of the data collected during previous programs to generate these targets.</p><p>Update on Conviac, Ross and Lemare</p><p>Harfang has just completed a five-week field program on the new Conviac, Ross and Lemare properties in Eeyou Istchee James Bay. All operations were conducted from the Nemiscau camp located 290\u00a0kilometres north of Chibougamau along the Route du Nord. These properties were recently acquired from map designation based on the occurrence of calculated lithium anomalies in lake sediments, known pegmatite outcrops and the proximity of limits between subprovinces. The field intervention confirmed the presence of pegmatite dykes, up to 30 metres thick, intruded into paragneiss (a metamorphosed sedimentary rock) and granitic rocks. No spodumene or other lithium-bearing minerals have been observed. A total of 226\u00a0rock samples were sent to ALS (Val-d\u2019Or) and all results are pending. Harfang will evaluate the next exploration phase to be conducted on these three properties according to the analytical results.</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>The technical information in this news release was prepared and approved by Fran\u00e7ois Huot, professional geologist and Vice President Exploration of Harfang, who is a non-independent qualified person for the technical disclosure as defined by the National Instrument 43-101\u00a0Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\u201cNI43-101\u201d).</p><p>About Harfang Exploration Inc.</p><p>Harfang Exploration Inc. is well financed with approximately $6.2\u00a0M in the treasury as of September 1, 2023 and is a technically driven mineral exploration company with the primary mission to discover ore deposits in Qu\u00e9bec and Ontario.

The fire, which began Aug. 3, is the most severe of hundreds in the past week across Greece, gobbling up pristine pine forests as well as homes and businesses and forcing hundreds to quickly evacuate by sea to save their lives.</p><p>Greece has been baked by its worst heat wave in three decades, which sent temperatures up to 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) and turned its prized pine forests into bone-dry tinderboxes.</p><p>In a televised nationwide address, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the destruction in Evia and elsewhere \u201cblackens everyone's hearts\u201d and pledged compensation for all affected, as well as a huge reforestation and regeneration effort. He also apologized for \u201cany weaknesses\u201d shown in addressing the emergency, a nod to criticism from some residents and officials who said Greece's firefighting efforts and equipment were woefully inadequate.</p><p>\u201cThese last few days have been among the hardest for our country in decades,\u201d Mitsotakis said. \u201cWe are dealing with a natural disaster of unprecedented dimensions.\u201d</p><p>With roads on the island cut off by the flames, residents and tourists fled to Evia's beaches and jetties to be ferried to safety by a flotilla of ferries and boats.</p><p>\u201cWe were completely forsaken. There were no fire brigades, there were no vehicles, nothing!\u201d David Angelou, who had been in the seaside village of Pefki, said Sunday night after leaving by ferry to the mainland.</p><p>\u201cYou could feel the enormous heat, there was also a lot of smoke. You could see the sun, a red ball, and then, nothing else around,\u201d he said.</p><p>Mitsotakis said Monday he \u201cfully understands\u201d the pain of those who lost homes or property, and the anger of those seeking airborne assistance \u201cwithout knowing whether the firefighting aircraft were operating elsewhere or whether conditions made it impossible for them to fly.\u201d</p><p>But he urged Greeks to reflect \u201cnot only on what was lost but also on what was saved in such an unprecedented natural disaster.\u201d</p><p>Other big wildfires were still burning Monday in Greece's southern Peloponnese region. Over the past week, hundreds of homes and businesses have been destroyed or damaged, and at least 40,000 hectares (nearly 100,000 acres) have been burned. Power cuts on Monday affected at least 17,000 households.</p><p>The causes of the blazes are as yet undetermined, though several people have been arrested for alleged arson. Greece's top prosecutor has ordered an investigation into whether the high number of fires could be linked to criminal activity.</p><p>More than 20 countries in Europe and the Mideast have responded to Greece's call for help, sending planes, helicopters, vehicles and manpower.</p><p>On Monday, Greece's Foreign Ministry tweeted that neighboring Turkey \u2014 Greece's historic regional rival \u2014 will be sending two firefighting planes because a top envoy said Turkey's wildfires \u201care now under control.\u201d The ministry also said Russia would be sending two firefighting planes and two helicopters.</p><p>Greek authorities, scarred by a deadly wildfire in 2018 near Athens that killed more than 100 people, have emphasized saving lives, issuing dozens of evacuation orders. The coast guard said 2,770 people had been evacuated by sea across the country between July 31 and Aug. 8.</p><p>Some residents ignored the orders to try to save their villages, spraying homes with garden hoses and digging mini firebreaks.</p><p>\u201cThe villagers themselves, with the firefighters, are doing what they can to save their own and neighboring villages,\" said Yiannis Katsikoyiannis, a volunteer from Crete who came to Evia to help his father save his horse farm near Avgaria.</p><p>\u201cIf they had evacuated their villages, as the civil protection told them to, everything would have been burnt down \u2013 perhaps even two days sooner,\" he said. \"Of course, they never saw any water-dropping aircraft. And of course now the conditions are wrong for them to fly, due to the smoke.\u201d</p><p>On Monday, the flames raced across northern Evia, threatening yet more villages even as 600 firefighters struggled to tame the inferno, aided by emergency teams from Ukraine, Romania and Serbia, 5 helicopters and 5 water-dropping planes.</p><p>One Greek volunteer firefighter died near Athens last week while four more were in the hospital Monday, two in critical condition with extensive burns.</p><p>Wildfires were also burning in southern Italy, North Macedonia and Montenegro, where a large fire in the Malo Brdo district of the capital Podgorica was coming close to houses on Monday.</p><p>In Italy, authorities urged the public to be careful with fire amid a heat wave forecast for this week, when many Italians take summer vacations. Firefighters for weeks have been battling blazes in Sardinia, Sicily and Calabria, and two have died.</p><p>\u201cWe have faced very difficult and dramatic days fighting fires, and the temperatures that are forecast require the utmost attention,\u2019\u2019 said Fabrizio Curcio, head of Italy\u2019s Civil Protection agency. \u201cWe are asking the maximum collaboration and caution from citizens ... to avoid any behavior that can set off a fire and report immediately the smallest blaze.\u201d</p><p>In North Macedonia, dozens of wildfires followed the worst heat wave in decades. At least eight were still burning Monday, mostly in remote areas where only helicopters and planes could be deployed. Thousands of acres of forest have been destroyed and authorities have arrested five suspected arsonists.</p><p>___</p><p>Becatoros reported from Athens, Greece.

Smoke has been visible from the interstate through the Gorge for most of the week.</p><p>Haywood County 911 received about 200 calls from passing motorists alarmed by the smoke on Monday morning.</p><p>\"That call volume quickly decreased when signage was placed along the interstate,\" said Allison Richmond, public information officer for Haywood County Emergency Services.</p><p>While the fire is concentrated in Pisgah National Forest lands, there are several private cabins and structures within the fire's vicinity. So far, forest service fire crews have successfully protected all the structures.</p><p>The fire was considered only 40% contained as of Thursday afternoon. Fire crews have been focused on battling hotspots and holding firelines.</p><p>\"It is expected that some locations in the interior of the fire area will continue to reignite,\" according to a statement from the National Forest Service. \"Firefighters are continuing to monitor and patrol the firelines, as well as extinguishing hot spots along the edge of the fire area.\"</p><p>While the rain Tuesday night and Wednesday morning helped beat back the fire some, it also created hazardous conditions along gravel forest service roads, limiting access to the interior of the fire. Aerial reconnaissance was also limited due to high winds Wednesday.</p><p>The Hurricane Ridge Fire began burning last Wednesday afternoon, Nov. 23. At its peak, more than 90 firefighters with the U.S. Forest Service and N.C. Forest Service were battling the fire.</p><p>Haywood County Emergency Services has assisted by providing a planning trailer for incident command to work out of and a light tower.</p><p>\"We have also deployed a resource unit leader to supplement their team and a special operations medic on standby in the event of a medical emergency,\" Richmond said.</p><p>The public is asked to avoid recreating in the area as to not interfere with firefighting operations.</p><p>The cause of the Hurricane Ridge Fire is under investigation.</p><p>___ (c)2022 The Mountaineer (Waynesville, N.C.)

Climate change is also likely to further impoverish a natural resource base already degraded by overexploitation, deforestation, and slash and burn agricultural practices. Land use change and the use of fossil fuels for transportation and agriculture contribute around half of overall greenhouse gas emissions, followed by cattle ranching and the use of fossil fuels to generate energy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Government of Guatemala Climate Priorities</p><p>Since 1992, Guatemala has taken significant actions to fulfill its commitments under the Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), including drafting a National Climate Change Policy, pledging to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC), and signing and ratifying the Paris Agreement. Guatemala has a National Climate Change Policy and one of the first climate change laws in the world: The Framework Law on Climate Change. Under this law, Guatemala created the National Climate Change Council, which serves as a regulatory body for the country's key sectors. Key goals relating to mitigation and adaptation under Guatemala's Nationally Determined Contributions include:</p><p>The Government of Guatemala endorsed the National Low Emission Development Strategy (LEDS), developed with the support of USAID, as the official strategy for climate change mitigation in the country. The strategy was presented by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources to the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in November 2020.</p><p>The reduction of 11.2 percent of its total GHG emissions from the 2005 base year projected to 2030; this reduction means that emissions in a baseline scenario (BAU) of 53.85 million tons of CO2 equivalent for the year 2030, will be reduced to a value of 47.81 million tons of CO2 equivalent in that year.</p><p>The reduction of 22.6 percent of its total GHG emissions from the 2005 base year by 2030 contingent upon technical and financial support from new and additional international public and private resources.</p><p>The development of Early Warning Systems and unification of climate information to reduce disaster risks linked to extreme weather events and a changing climate.</p><p>USAID'S Climate Change Program: Objectives and Results</p><p>USAID supports the Government of Guatemala's development and climate priorities through a series of complementary programs and partnerships across the climate adaptation, renewable energy, and natural climate solutions sectors.</p><p>Adaptation</p><p>USAID enhances the resilience of communities and livelihoods within Guatemala's Western Highlands and Verapaces, the country's most vulnerable regions to climate change. These are the highest priority regions for capacity building in climate change adaptation due to their strong dependence on agriculture, high levels of poverty, proximity to Mexico, and high rates of outward migration.</p><p>Feed the Future (FTF): USAID/Guatemala's FTF value chain activities apply an integrated approach to watershed, land-use and water resources management. FTF activities also promote the use of agroforestry and climate smart agriculture technologies to increase the resilience of crops and soil to extreme weather events and climate pressures, while increasing overall productivity. These technologies include drip irrigation, water catchments, improved seed/tree varieties, soil fertility management and conservation, biopesticides and locally produced organic fertilizers, and locally appropriate agro-structures such as greenhouses, micro and macro tunnels, and screen houses that provide physical protection from heavy rain and hail.</p><p>Results 20172022</p><p>Climate Smart Practices: 36,823 smallholder producers who are using climate smart agricultural practices on 22,801 hectares of land.</p><p>Watershed Restoration: Eighteen watershed management plans have been implemented, directly benefiting 13,334 small-scale producers in a total area of 122,072 hectares, in twelve prioritized municipalities that represent the water recharge areas in the western highlands of Guatemala. Ten thousand additional hectares are proposed for reforestation over the next ten years in coordination with the municipal authorities.</p><p>Reforestation: More than 9,500 hectares have been registered in the Government of Guatemala's forestry incentive program, providing a supplemental income of $6.1 million dollars to more than 3,000 families and enhancing the protection of water recharge sources and the conservation of soils and forests in the western highlands of Guatemala.</p><p>Coffee Improvements: Agroforestry approaches improved 4,465 hectares of coffee with more rust resistant varieties of coffee, soil conservation, and shade tree reforestation, benefitting 4,160 small coffee producers. Production of local agro-ecological fertilizers are helping 569 small coffee producers improve soil health and coffee yields. From 2017-2022, 1,569,600 coffee seedlings were established in 386 hectares, including varieties with better resistance to drought and pests. In addition, 174,763 fruit and timber trees with high commercial value (avocado, citrus, banana, macadamia, cocoa, orange, peach, and forest species such as cedar and mahogany) were planted in coffee plots of 8,537 small-scale coffee producers (4,459 men and 4,078 women, including 1,010 youth under 30 years of age) to improve coffee agroforestry systems.</p><p>Solar Energy: More than 93 coffee solar dryers have been constructed which support 500 smallholder coffee farmers from 36 Cooperatives. Solar tunnels decrease the humidity rate of coffee beans from 65 percent to 11 percent in a shorter period, compared to drying coffee in open field tables, leading to improved quality coffee suitable for export markets.</p><p>Natural Climate Solutions</p><p>USAID and its partners are mitigating climate change by reducing Guatemala's primary sources of land-based Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions: deforestation and forest degradation in the Peten, Alta Verapaz, and Baja Verapaz departments, and the Western Highlands region. By promoting forest management, USAID helps to increase forest-cover, forest productivity, and rural economic development, to establish agroforestry systems, and to incentivize reforestation and forest restoration. USAID also works to strengthen partner systems for forest fire monitoring on both public and private lands, in order to reduce CO2 emissions. As a result, Guatemala's community fire brigades, park guards, and other government entities are provided with continual capacity-building support and training to prevent and control forest fires.</p><p>To mitigate increased emissions in the Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use (AFOLU) sectors, the Government of Guatemala maintains contracts with community groups in northern Guatemala, in the Maya Biosphere Reserve (MBR), that derive significant income by sustainably managing over 500,000 hectares of Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified forests. Between 2020-2022, the Government of Guatemala renewed the community concessions contracts for another 25 years, for a total of 50 years. In 2022, the government established two additional community managed concessions bringing the total to eleven. Through these concessions, community incomes are expected to continue to increase as interest grows in certified sustainable forest products. Of the income generated from sales, community forest concessions invest around 46% in protecting forests against fires and other threats of land use change. To safeguard gains in sustainable forest management, USAID supports periodic evaluations to facilitate the extension of community forest concessions in the Mayan Biosphere Reserve beyond current agreement periods and supports policy initiatives to reinitiate expired or canceled concessions.</p><p>Results 2013-2022</p><p>Forest Product Development: US$199.1 million in total sales from 25 sustainable and inclusive value chains for forest timber products such as furniture and moldings, non-timber forest products such as xate palm, allspice, and ramon nut, and services such as community tourism.</p><p>Forest Sector Job Creation: 61,813 full-time equivalent jobs were created or strengthened (approximately 18 percent women) for work in agroforestry and sustainable forest value chains.</p><p>Certified Forest Management: 555,650 hectares (an area six times larger than Shenandoah National Park) of forest certified through Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certifications which means that forest dependent communities undertake economically viable, socially, and environmentally conscious forest management.</p><p>Carbon Sequestration: 2,709,597 tons of greenhouse emissions sequestered (approximately three times more than Washington D.C.'s annual transportation CO2 emissions) and reduced as part of the sustainable management of the Community Forest Concessions in the framework of the Guatecarbon project in the MBR, as well as forest areas in Verapaces and Western Highlands regions.</p><p>Renewable Energy</p><p>USAID promotes the generation and use of renewable energy and energy efficient and low emissions infrastructure, technologies, and production processes. This includes feasibility studies for a solar energy generating plant in the municipality of Quetzaltenango with an installed power of 1.88 megawatts (MW) which has the potential to generate 4,300 megawatt hours (MWh) annually, reduce CO2 emissions by 1,824 tons annually and provide electricity to 10,000 people.</p><p>Clean Energy Training: Almost 400 youth (50% female) are receiving technical training in clean energy as part of technical vocational training or as a complement to sustainable agriculture training.</p><p>Finance: USAID is developing new financing mechanisms to help increase investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency in the Western Highlands. Since August 2022, activities have facilitated $4.2 million in investments for the renewable energy sector and reduced carbon emissions by at least 920 tons of CO2. Partnerships with business accelerators and incubators have also facilitated business technical assistance, capacity building, and investment support to 12 renewable energy companies with nationwide outreach, positively impacting more than 1,000 direct beneficiaries in clean energy and climate change activities.</p><p>Street Lighting: In the municipality of Huehuetenango, switching street lighting to energy-efficient LED lighting is expected to reduce CO2 emissions by 1,354 tons annually and save 3,385 megawatt hours (MWh) and benefit 60,000 people in the municipality.</p><p>Solar Energy: USAID is also promoting the use of clean energy in the Western Highlands, through the installation of solar panels and solar dryers in coffee cooperatives and agriculture schools, thereby reducing labor requirements and operating costs, and creating a better-quality coffee independent of traditional fuel-based dryers. Ten farmers' organizations installed 396 solar panels in their collection centers, cold rooms, and offices to reduce their CO2 emissions and generate cost savings. They expect to reduce more than 85 tons of CO2 originating in their processes and operations and save more than $31,000 USD in energy costs, which will be invested in new community projects to improve farmers' productivity, transform their products, and promote the inclusion of women and youth. In addition, 9 solar panels were installed at six cooperatives in Huehuetenango, two cooperatives in San Marcos, and one in the Camoja Complex to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, minimize the cost of electric power, and increase the competitiveness of small-scale coffee producer cooperatives. In the same region, USAID provided solar panels to schools damaged by Hurricanes Eta and Iota, as part of a project preparing schools to reopen following COVID-19 closures. In addition, through its Guatemala Entrepreneurship Development Initiative, USAID is developing new financing mechanisms to help increase investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency in the Western Highlands.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126262607</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69RJ-44B1-JCBF-S05H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2081\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 27, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news reporting from Tianjin, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Fuel moisture content (FMC), which is the ratio of equivalent water thickness (EWT) to dry matter content (DMC), plays a crucial role in the estimation of vegetation ignition probability and the fire propagation rate. The PROSAIL model can adequately simulate the canopy reflectance of vegetation, with the input of field-measured data into the model ensuring conformity with the ecological rules.\" </p><p><br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Tianjin Chengjian University: \"If the EWT and DMC can be estimated by an empirical statistical method according to the reflectance spectrum, the universality of the physical model and the efficiency of the empirical statistical method can be considered. In this study, a fast and versatile method is established for estimating FMC based on the EWT, DMC, leaf area index measured data, and the PROSAIL model. The Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII) and Normalized Dry Matter Index (NDMI) were obtained from the spectral curves, with the results showing an obvious linear relationship between the NDII and EWT, NDMI, and DMC. Therefore, EWT and DMC can be estimated using the NDII and NDMI. The accuracy of the estimation results is verified to be high. The estimation model can be extended to Landsat 8 data to estimate FMC. The estimated FMC data verified by the measured data showed that R\u00b2 was 0.743 and the RMSE was 34.2%. The model accuracy was reliable owing to large dynamic changes in the FMC. However, the estimated value of the FMC shifted significantly to the left during this study. The reasons for this are as follows: 1) The field-measured points are not sufficient to support the analysis according to different vegetation types, and the physical and chemical properties of different types are varied, leading to altered simulated spectral curves; 2) The vegetation spectrum is sensitive to the DMC at 1,650 nm, 1,720 nm, and 2,270 nm bands, and the sensitivity near the 1,650 nm and 1,720 nm bands is greater than that at 2,270 nm.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"However, because the Landsat 8 image does not have a 1,720 nm band, the 2,270 nm band was selected to calculate the NDMI, making the value of the estimated DMC too large, resulting in a small value of the estimated FMC and a significant shift to the left; 3) 1,650 nm and 2,270 nm are not in the central wavelength of the two bands of Landsat 8; therefore, the estimated DMC and FMC are shifted. In addition, the fast and versatile method, which is established based on the EWT, DMC, leaf area index measured data and the PROSAIL model, can realize large-scale and high-precision monitoring of the FMC, providing a scientific reference for forest fire prevention.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Estimation of Fuel Water Content in the Forest Ecotone of Guangzhou Based on the PROSAIL Model.

In internal emails and texts, top-rated host Tucker Carlson profanely ridiculed pro-Trump conspiracy theorist <url normalizedValue=\"https://lawandcrime.com/2020-election/f-ing-b-tucker-carlson-unloads-on-sidney-powell-in-jaw-dropping-unsealed-exhibits/\">Sidney Powell</url>  as a \"f-- b--\" \u2014 and privately stewed that he hates the former president \" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64886188\">passionately</url> .\" (Carlson later sat down for a friendly interview with Trump, and neither man mentioned the revelation.)</p><p>News Corp CEO Rupert Murdoch acknowledged in a deposition that some of his hosts appeared to endorse conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, even though he never believed them.

The company dropped a claim of $600 million in lost profits on the eve of trial, but they made clear that didn't mean that their demand has gotten more modest.</p><p> \"In the coming weeks, we will prove Fox spread lies causing enormous damage to Dominion,\" a spokesperson said in a statement before the settlement was announced. \"We look forward to trial.\"</p><p>Davis issued a number of pretrial rulings that would have put Fox News at a disadvantage.

Fox cannot argue that the false allegations were newsworthy, or that they were the fault of Trump surrogates like Powell or Rudy Giuliani.</p><p> First Amendment scholar Jeff Kosseff noted that the pretrial rulings left Fox News primarily with a single, yet potentially potent, defense: actual malice, the doctrine in defamation law established by New York Times v. Sullivan.

(the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cPatriot\u201d) (TSX-V: PMET) (ASX: PMT) (OTCQX: PMETF) (FSE: R9GA) provides this update on the Company\u2019s operations at its Corvette Property (\u201cThe Property\u201d) in Quebec, Canada. The ban on entry to the forest due to wildfires has been lifted for the area, including The Property. Due to some on-going road closures, the Company is remobilising personnel with materials to site using fixed wing aircrafts. It is anticipated that the road closures will be lifted as the fires continue to be extinguished. The Company will have access to one helicopter, which will allow for the commencement of drilling and environmental baseline data collection at site by this weekend. The Company continues to monitor the situation closely and is working with regulators to ensure the health and safety of our employees and contractors. We hope to have access to additional helicopters in August as the fire fighters continue to make progress in the western reaches of the province.</p><p>\u201cOur thoughts are with those communities, particularly the Cree Nation, that have experienced losses with these unprecedented wildfires,\u201d said Blair Way, Patriot President and CEO. \u201cOn behalf of Patriot I would like to thank all those involved, for their tireless efforts in containing and suppressing the wildfires throughout Quebec and Canada.\u201d</p><p>The Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) remains on track and is scheduled for release in late July.</p><p>The Company is working on upgrading the winter snow road to an all-weather exploration road to enable the drill program to continue through the months of October, November and December when typically fog in the region limits transportation by helicopters. This initiative is of critical importance to the Company in order to facilitate a longer drilling season to make up for lost time due to wildfires.</p><p>Patriot will recommence advancing its 100%-owned exploration camp to further enable a more efficient drilling program for the latter part of the year. The new camp will decrease travel time significantly, while reducing the dependency on helicopters when combined with the all-weather exploration road.</p><p>The 2023 summer-fall exploration program includes both drill and surface exploration, which commenced at the Property in late May. The multi-rig drill program is targeting further delineation of the CV5 and CV13 pegmatites, and includes drill testing of other previously identified spodumene pegmatite clusters (i.e., CV4, CV8-12, CV9, and CV10). The surface program comprises mapping of the known spodumene pegmatite clusters and local trends as well as prospecting and rock sampling across a large portion of the remaining 20+ km of prospective lithium pegmatite trend.</p><p>About Patriot Battery Metals Inc.</p><p>Patriot Battery Metals Inc. is a hard-rock lithium exploration company focused on advancing its district-scale 100%-owned Corvette Property located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of Quebec, Canada. The Corvette Property is one of the largest and highest-grade hard rock lithium projects being explored, with over 50 kilometres of strike length over a 214 square kilometre land package and over 70 lithium bearing pegmatite outcrops identified to date.</p><p>The Corvette Property is situated proximal to the all-weather Trans Taiga Road and Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec power line infrastructure in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of Quebec.\u00a0The Property hosts significant lithium potential highlighted by the CV5 Pegmatite, which has been traced by drilling over a strike length of at least 3.7 km with spodumene pegmatite encountered as deep as 425 m vertical depth.</p><p>For further information, please contact us at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:info@patriotbatterymetals.com\">info@patriotbatterymetals.com</email>  or by calling +1 (604) 279-8709,or visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.patriotbatterymetals.com\">www.patriotbatterymetals.com</url>.

Nearly a quarter of the land area of the Northern Hemisphere has permafrost below it, and Russia, home of Siberia, has a particularly large share.</p><p>Scientists believe that permafrost could play a key role in climate change, as it stores enormous amounts of carbon dioxide and other global warming gases that are then emitted if it melts. In the Arctic alone, permafrost is estimated to hold almost double the current amount of carbon found in the atmosphere, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC).</p><p>Another issue caused by melting permafrost is that it can dramatically alter the landscape. When ice-rich permafrost melts it can lead to what's known as a thaw slump, in which the ground collapses leaving behind a large hole.

According to news reporting originating from Kosice, Slovakia, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Following the creation of a new organic layer after a forest fire, there is an initial build-up phase of overall biota. We studied soil nematode community development in a chronosequence of post-fire coniferous forest sites in relation to different fire severity.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Effect of Fire on Soil Organic Matter And The Community of Soil Transforming Organisms. <br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Slovak Academy of Sciences: \"The taxonomic and functional composition of the soil nematode community was analyzed to detect immediate changes and levels of post-fire recovery in soil food web structures, i.e., 0, 1, 4, 8, 14, 20, 45, and 110 years after the event. Unburned forest sites served as controls. With small exceptions recorded immediately after the burn (mean nematode abundance, total biomass), the low severe wildfires had no impacts on the structures of nematode communities. The structures of nematode communities were found to be stable on sites affected by low severe wildfires, without considerable fluctuations in comparison to the unburned sites during chronosequence. On the contrary, nematode communities responded considerably to fires of high severity. The significant changes, i.e., a decrease of mean nematode abundance, plant parasites, omnivores and predators, species number, and nematode diversity, the values of CI, SI, MI, but an increase in the number of bacterivores and EI were recorded immediately after the fire. Such status, one year after a fire of high severity, has been observed.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Full recovery of nematode communities 14 years after the disruption was found. Overall, our results showed that fire severity was a considerable element affecting soil nematode communities immediately after events, as well as the time needed to recover communities' structure during post-fire chronosequence.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Post-Fire Recovery of Soil Nematode Communities Depends on Fire Severity.

There are also some damaged structures outside the volcano. </p><p>The high temperatures calcinate the stone of the moais, which leads it to crack and with time \"it starts to collapse,\" Edmunds Paoa told a local radio station. </p><p>The mayor blamed locals who raise cattle and horses in the island and burn grassland. </p><p>Edmunds Paoa accused the state of abandoning the island. </p><p>\"The work of avoiding accidents and fires involves a prevention plan that requires resources, and that's what we don't have,\" he said. </p><p>Ninoska Huki, the local head of the National Forest Corp., had said earlier that the island lacks firefighters. </p><p>Officials are working to determine how much the fire has affected the island, which is about 2,300 miles from mainland Chile and is inhabited by some 7,700 people. </p><p>The island is known around the world for its moais, stone structures that are thought to weigh around 14 tons, and the Rapa Nui National Park covers around 40 percent of the island. </p><p>Since 2019, Easter Island is locally known as Rapa Nui-Easter Island. </p><p>The island reopened to tourists in August after it was closed off for more than two years during the covid-19 pandemic. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TRBREV-5509063</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TRBREV2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66K8-5SD1-JBXT-N54H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">279169</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-10-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"322\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Tribune Review Publishing Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Tribune-Review (Greensburg, PA)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"10\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>October 8, 2022 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>CC0009L27</classCode><className>FOREST CORP</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>Mayors</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qjc5QjBGQUU4M0Y4NDVEMEI4Njk1MUVGRjU1NzREMzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

In consonance with NFP, 1988, the Ministry has been taking several initiatives for promoting forestry including fallow lands. The Ministry is implementing, the Centrally Sponsored Scheme, National Mission for a Green India (GIM) on landscape approach also covers fallow lands in which appropriate interventions as applicable are taken up by the concerned implementing agencies</p><p>Government is implementing several schemes/programmes to combat desertification through increasing forest cover. Various afforestation related schemes implemented by Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFandCC) and other ministries aim at increasing and improving forest and tree cover. MoEFandCC supports the States/Union Territories for carrying out various afforestation activities through Centrally Sponsored Scheme for conservation, development and promotion of forests under its major schemes namely, National Mission for a Green India (GIM) and Forest Fire Protection and Management Scheme (FFPM). Compensatory afforestation under CAMPA has also been used to increase forest cover across the country. State Governments also implement various schemes for restoration of degraded forest areas.</p><p>Mangroves are the first line of defence for coastal communities. They stabilize shorelines by slowing erosion and provide natural barriers protecting coastal communities from increased storm surge, flooding, and hurricanes. The Government of India has taken steps to protect sustain, conserve and augment forests in the country through promotional as well as regulatory measures. The promotional measures are being implemented through a Central Sector Scheme under National Coastal Mission Programme on Conservation and Management of Mangroves and Coral Reefs. Under this programme, annual Management Action Plan (MAP) for conservation and management of mangroves are formulated and implemented in all the coastal States and Union Territories.</p><p>The Government under Centrally sponsored scheme for conservation and Management of Mangroves, extend assistance to Coastal State/UTs for implementation of action plans including survey and demarcation, alternation and supplementary livelihood, protection measures and education and awareness activities. The Ministry piloted an Integrated Coastal Zone management Project in Coastal stretches of three states namely Gujarat, Odisha and West Bengal, with objective of Conservation and Protection of Coastal resources which included plantation of mangroves as one of the major activities.</p><p>This information was given by the Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125624433</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6748-KN31-JCBF-S0WP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-12-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"500\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"12\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>December 19, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Gorman. The jury deliberated about 7 hours before convicting Justin Andrew Wilke, 39, of conspiracy, theft of public property, depredation of public property, trafficking in unlawfully harvested timber, and attempting to traffic in unlawfully harvested timber. U.S. District Judge Benjamin H. Settle scheduled sentencing for October 18, 2021.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"When people steal trees from our public lands, they are stealing a beautiful and irreplaceable resource from all of us and from future generations,\" said Acting U.S. Attorney Gorman. \"That theft, coupled with the sheer destruction of the forest fire that resulted from this activity, warrants federal criminal prosecution. I commend the various branches of the U.S. Forest Service who worked diligently to investigate and hold this defendant accountable.\"</p><p>According to records filed in the case, between April and August 2018, Justin Andrew Wilke conducted an illegal logging operation in the Elk Lake area of the Olympic National Forest, near Hood Canal. In July 2018, just days after his release from state prison, another defendant, Shawn Edward Williams, 49, joined the conspiracy, helping Wilke remove maple from the National Forest and transporting it with Wilke to a mill in Tumwater, Washington. The type of maple harvested by the defendants is highly prized and used to produce musical instruments.</p><p>This was the first use of tree DNA evidence in a federal criminal trial. Wilke claimed the wood he sold to a Tumwater mill had been harvested from private property with a valid permit. However, at trial, Richard Cronn, Phd., a Research Geneticist for the USDA Forest Service, testified that the wood Wilke sold was a genetic match to the remains of three poached maple trees investigators had discovered in the Elk Lake area. The DNA analysis was so precise that it found the probability of the match being coincidental was approximately one in one undecillion (one followed by 36 zeroes). Based on this evidence, the jury concluded the wood Wilke sold the mill had been stolen.</p><p>On August 3, 2018, the group decided to cut a maple tree that contained a wasp's nest near the base of the tree. To remove the nest, the group sprayed insecticide and gasoline on the nest and base of the tree and then lit the nest on fire. The group failed to extinguish the fire, which developed into a wildfire later named the \"Maple Fire.\" The Maple Fire consumed more than 3,300 acres between August and November 2018 and cost approximately $4.2 million to contain. Some witnesses testified at trial that Wilke was standing next to the nest when it was lit on fire, and therefore appeared to have set the fire. However, because the fire was set at night, they were not able to see his exact actions. The jury did not convict Wilke of the two federal counts related to the forest fire: setting timber afire and using fire in furtherance of a felony.</p><p>One of those who testified that Wilke set the fire, Shawn Williams, pleaded guilty in December 2019 to theft of public property and setting timber afire. He was sentenced in September 2020 to 30 months in prison.</p><p>Quick and diligent investigative work by a U.S. Forest Service law enforcement officer and by a U.S. Forest Service Wildland firefighter preserved important evidence in the case.</p><p>The counts of conviction are punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Judge Settle will determine the appropriate sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p><p>The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Seth Wilkinson and Will Dreher.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124572797</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:633T-BKT1-JCBF-S39N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"672\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 9, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

They didn't stop there. </p><p><br/>A 2001 PDF report on Wildland fire management[2] is no longer available. It's gone, but then it's not. Tony Heller at RCSB found it on the Wayback machine in its entirety, a problem the Feds will have to address at some point if their 1984ish obsession with rewriting history is to succeed. <br/>I'm sure they can get Google or that Zuckerberg fellow to buy the site and manage the material to suit the needs of their political masters. <br/>In this case, what exactly do they hope to hide? <br/>The 2021 data tampering I mentioned above looks like this[1]. <br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://granitegrok.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/US-wildfire-NIFC-data-compared-1024x609-1.png\">https://granitegrok.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/US-wildfire-NIFC-data-compared-1024x609-1.png</url><br/><br/>The 2001 report, which you can read here[3], has a similar unadulterated graph to the one above. It looks like this. <br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://granitegrok.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Wildfire-acres-burned-annualy-1920-to-2000.png\">https://granitegrok.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Wildfire-acres-burned-annualy-1920-to-2000.png</url><br/><br/>That doesn't prop up the approved narrative, so I can see why that had to go. But if you read the copy around it, you'll find something that might be even more concerning to the Ministry of Truthers. The benefits and necessity of wildfires. <br/><br/>This decrease in wildland fire has been a destabilizing influence in many fireadapted ecosystems such as ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, pinyon/juniper woodlands, southern pinelands, whitebark pine, oak savanna, pitch pine, aspen, and tallgrass prairie. Fuels increased and understory vegetation became more dense. As a result, those wildland fires that did occur were larger and more severe than historical fires. Eliminating fire also affected individual plant species. For example, Hessl and Spackman (1995) found that, of the 146 threatened, endangered, and rare plant species found in the conterminous U. S. for which there is conclusive information on fire effects, 135 species benefit from wildland fire or are found in fire-adapted ecosystems. <br/><br/>If true, wildfires, regardless of an ignition source, aid in propagating plant species that have and or will adapt further to the phenomenon. <br/>Seeing as the Planeteers are big on evolution theory, having more species due to burning woodlands instead of fewer could befuddle the narrative. <br/>And they can't have that either. <br/><br/><br/>The post Big Brother 'Disappears' Inconvenient Federal Wildland Fire Management Document[4] appeared first on Granite Grok[5]. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://granitegrok.com/blog/2021/05/us-forest-fire-data-tampering-they-dissapeared-57-years-of-inconvenient-truth\">https://granitegrok.com/blog/2021/05/us-forest-fire-data-tampering-they-dissapeared-57-years-of-inconvenient-truth</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://realclimatescience.com/2022/07/page-not-found/\">https://realclimatescience.com/2022/07/page-not-found/</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://granitegrok.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/FederalWildlandFireManagementPolicy_2001.pdf\">https://granitegrok.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/FederalWildlandFireManagementPolicy_2001.pdf</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://granitegrok.com/blog/2022/07/big-brother-disappears-inconvenient-federal-wildland-fire-management-document\">https://granitegrok.com/blog/2022/07/big-brother-disappears-inconvenient-federal-wildland-fire-management-document</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://granitegrok.com\">https://granitegrok.com</url></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

According to news reporting originating from Bihar, India, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Wireless sensor network found immense uses in the daily life. Also, the random deployment of nodes is a preferable option in many applications such as earthquake observation, military applications, and forest fire detection.\" </p><p><br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from the National Institute of Technology, \"It is expected that deployed nodes should be able to monitor the field of interest (FoI) with the optimum capacity. In order to maximize the coverage of area, each node should be repositioned to an optimal position inside the FoI. A modified particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm has been proposed to achieve optimize coverage while keeping the number of nodes minimum. It introduces the concept of negative velocity in order to avoid premature convergence of the algorithm. This paper describes a way to tackle the two dimensional obstacles present inside the FoI.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The simulated results show a significant improvement in the performance with compared to the standard PSO in presence of obstacles.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: 2-d Coverage Optimization In Obstacle-based Foi In Wsn Using Modified Pso.
