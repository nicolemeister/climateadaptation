Melinda Adams instead is pulled toward the term pyromantic a lover of \"good fire\" for the benefits it can bring to people, communities and the environment as a whole.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Langston Hughes Assistant Professor in Indigenous Studies and Geography and Atmospheric Science at the University of Kansas, Adams extols the benefits of cultural or ceremonial fire in a new paper she has co-written for the journal Ecopsychology.</p><p>Adams collaborated on the paper, titled \"Solastalgia to Soliphilia: Cultural Fire, Climate Change, and Indigenous Healing,\" with Erica Tom, instructor in English at the Santa Rosa (Calif.) Junior College, and Ron Goode, honorable chairman of California's North Fork Mono Tribe. They detail the benefits to university students and community members who took part in a series of ceremonial burns on Indigenous lands in California that they organized as part of ongoing community-based participatory research project in partnership with the University of California-Davis (where Adams obtained her doctorate) and the Southwest Climate Adaptation Science Center.</p><p>The researchers wrote that by taking part in a ceremonial burn (the term Goode and Adams both use) a few acres at a time usually through pile burning or grass burning for the restoration of culturally significant plants and guided by traditional environmental knowledge, the participants shifted in significant ways from the \"Solastalgia\" of the paper's title a word coined by Australian philosopher Glenn Albrecht for looming environmental dread to \"Soliphilia,\" defined as a heightened state of environmental awareness and concern, which the authors say also engenders feelings of control.</p><p>\"Whether you are a Native person that's learning about fire, an allied person that's wanting to learn about the presence of Indigenous peoples and our land stewardship and climate solutions, or community members that care about the places that we all live and work in and hopefully all care about, there's a role for everybody in learning about good fire,\" Adams said.</p><p>As wildfires have grown larger and more frequent as the result of climate change, so, too, has the fear of them grown in the Western states.</p><p>\"We've had young people and students who experienced the Carr Fire or the Paradise fire, so they've lost their family homes or been affected in some way,\" Adams said. \"Or they were already afraid of fire from engrained ideas that all fire is bad fire. So students participated in the ceremonial burn demonstrations to learn an Indigenous perspective of not running from fire but working with it as a land stewardship tool. The experience is powerful as a healing concept. ... There's growing interest in cultural fire because it's a mitigation tool that people are starting to educate themselves about. These are practices that we have held onto, as Indigenous peoples, since time immemorial.\"</p><p>Adams studies and leads cultural/ceremonial fire from an Indigenous lens and invites others to learn from traditional practices, with Indigenous peoples always leading these demonstrations. She says her eco-cultural work serves to reiterate what Indigenous communities have always known: Through close connections with lands and waters, and scientific observation over time, there are numerous benefits to purposely lit cultural fire.</p><p>\"In addition to the cultural-social effects of cultural fire, I also study the soil effects of cultural fire, of native fire, and its potential for carbon storage everybody's raving about carbon storage with climate effects and I also talk about the water-holding capacity that good fire invites to soilscapes,\" Adams said.</p><p>The authors wrote that the benefits of \"placing fire on the land\" can be expanded from an individual to an environmental level as participants in programs like the one Adams helped lead in California take the lessons they've learned into their careers in the field.</p><p>Adams, who joined KU's faculty in spring 2023, led her first ceremonial burn at the KU Field Station in March. She looks forward to more, working with tribes, nearby Haskell Indian Nations University (of which Adams is also an alumna), faculty and community members and Indigenous peoples in the Midwest.</p><p>\"That's part of my work in trying to widen the scope of good fire,\" Adams said. \"We say good fire, meaning it's purposeful, it has an ecological, cultural or social benefit that it's bringing, as opposed to catastrophic wildfire, forest fire, which in most of us it's ingrained to be dangerous and something to stay away from. ... Not all fire is bad fire.\"</p><p>The University of Kansas is a major comprehensive research and teaching university.

Behind the colorful world of Oz and the beloved characters lies a tale of hardship, danger, and sacrifice endured by the cast and crew during its production. From toxic makeup to on-set accidents, this list explores 24 shocking and little-known facts about the making of the film.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1. Deadly Snowfall</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let's start with the seemingly innocent and harmless snowfall. The \"snow\" used in the poppy field scene was actually asbestos. This highly toxic material was commonly used on movie sets for its fireproof properties.</p><p>2. Judy Garland's Nightmare</p><p>Judy Garland, who played Dorothy, endured brutal treatment from MGM studio executives, including cruel insults about her appearance and her smoking habits. She was sometimes insultingly called \"a fat little pig with pigtails.\"</p><p>3. Extreme Diet</p><p>Film producer Louis B. Meyer had Judy Garland on an extremely constricted diet: black coffee, 80 cigarettes daily, and chicken soup. And not to forget the diet pills she had to consume to lower her appetite. Not only this, but the producer hired individuals to surveil her.</p><p>4. Munchkin Misbehaviour </p><p>As if that wasn't bad enough, even the male actors who played Munchkins would often harass the actress. In the memoir Judy and I: My Life with Judy Garland, Sidney Luft writes that many older Munchkin actors had been quite \"naughty.\"</p><p>5. Munchkin Mayhem </p><p>Many Munchkin actors had been so problematic that they had to be watched over during the shooting. Several of them ended up being arrested as well. What's disturbing is that these actors \"thought they could get away with anything because they were so small.\"</p><p>6. A Fiery Ordeal</p><p>Margaret Hamilton, who played Wicked Witch of the West, suffered severe burns on her hand and face following a stunt gone wrong. It appeared \"as though someone had taken the top of her hand and peeled it like an orange.\"</p><p>The scene in question is from her dramatic exit from Munchkinland, but unfortunately, due to an issue with the trap door, she could not escape and got stuck in the flames. The burns were so horrible she was hospitalized for 6 weeks.</p><p>7. Toxic Makeup</p><p>Back in 1939, there wasn't as much variety in makeup. The toxins in the green makeup used for Margaret's role were so high that she had to be put on a liquid diet. This would ensure she didn't mistakenly ingest the paint. The green makeup used for her contained copper oxide, making it unsafe.</p><p>8. Lion's Roar Skin</p><p>Talking about toxic makeup, Bert Lahr, the actor who played the Cowardly Lion, suffered numerous burns from the lion costume's makeup. Though the actor's dedication to his craft is commendable, we hope no such instance will be repeated.</p><p>9. Jell-O Horses </p><p>At least the horses were safe from this torture. The paint used on the colorful horses in Emerald City consisted of Jell-O powder. They had to experiment with food coloring to avoid using toxic materials but ultimately landed on Jell-O due to its thick consistency. Filming wasn't easy as \"the horses invariably managed to lick off most of the Jell-O between shots.\"</p><p>10. Stunt Double's Tragedy </p><p>Margaret's stunt double, Betty Danko, was hospitalized for 11 days during the shooting. The culprit? One of the pipes in her broomstick exploded.</p><p>11. The Unfortunate Replacement </p><p>Returning to the world of toxic makeup, the initial actor cast for Tin Man, Buddy Ebsen, had to be replaced by Jack Haley because his toxic makeup \"nearly choked him to death.\" The actor's experience eventually led the studio to shift to aluminum. Unfortunately, he got stuck with respiratory issues for the entirety of his life due to this demanding role.</p><p>12. Small Sum</p><p>The movie lives in the hearts of many! It was one of a kind for its time and eventually brought massive profit to the production company. Yet, the Munchkins actors were paid $50 per week, translating to roughly $920 in 2023.</p><p>13. The Toto-tally Unexpected </p><p>Terry, the dog who played Toto, earned nearly three times more than the Munchkin actors, making $125 per week back in 1939. The dog alone earned almost $2,298 on a weekly basis.</p><p>14. Pill Pressure </p><p>A sad reality is that Judy Garland's mother had introduced her to diet pills as a way for her to have an \"energetic performance.\" Later, the studio executives at MGM put her on more drugs to ensure she stayed physically frail.</p><p>15. Lavatory Help</p><p>One of the Munchkin actors had to endure a painfully embarrassing ordeal. He got stuck in the toilet due to his short stature for 45 minutes! The studio hired one of the attendants to help the Munchkin's on and off the toilet.</p><p>16. Suffocating Scarecrow</p><p>Did you know Ray Bolger's Scarecrow face mask almost suffocated him several times? At one instance, he said, \"I had a rubber mask. It sort of closed the pores in my face, and when the lights got real hot and ate up all the oxygen, I couldn't breathe.\" Talk about some commitment to your role!</p><p>17. Judy Garland's Tumultuous Journey</p><p>Many believe Judy Garland's treatment on the set eventually led to her demise. The actual cause of her death had been an accidental barbiturate overdose due to her lifelong substance use disorder. On the scene, as a 16-year-old, she was encouraged to live an unhealthy lifestyle and given barbiturates to fall asleep.</p><p>18. The Weighty Truth </p><p>Sadly, the Cowardly Lion costume consisted of genuine lion skin and hair. This costume, weighing 90 pounds, was later sold at a New York auction for a staggering $3 million. Such a decision inevitably raises questions about animal rights in film and media.</p><p>19. Director Departure</p><p>The film's original director, Richard Thorpe, was fired after only 2 weeks of shooting. Though it isn't rare for directors to get changed, this decision undoubtedly led to a rocky start in the production.</p><p>20. Forest Fire Fiasco</p><p>The set of the forest was extremely flammable due to the fake trees being made of highly combustible materials. These posed a fire hazard during filming. Thankfully, no such accidents occurred.</p><p>21. A Box Office Let Down</p><p>Although so much work went into the film's production, it initially struggled at the box office and failed to produce big numbers. It only became a classic through later re-releases and television broadcasts.</p><p>22. A Tornado of Trouble </p><p>Due to the limitations of special effects at the time, the tornado scene was created using a 35-foot-long muslin stocking spun around by a propeller. It was physically demanding and potentially dangerous for the actors involved.</p><p>23. Slap of Silence </p><p>The director, Victor Fleming, allegedly slapped 16-year-old Judy Garland hard across her face. The reason behind it was that she could not successfully complete a scene due to giggling.</p><p>24. Auntie Em's Tragic Farewell </p><p>Actress Clara Blandick suffered from poor health following the film's release. This beloved actress left us in the most harrowing way imaginable. Unable to cope with her aging body and growing ailments, she decided to take her own life in 1962.</p><p>Source: (Buzzfeed).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WALTFG-150624754</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WALTFG2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:699C-HNS1-JDJN-64V4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484388</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1159\"/><timeReceived>12:30 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Wealth of Geeks LLC Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

Another major blaze on the outskirts of Athens torched homes, reducing some to piles of smoking rubble, and encroached into the national park on Mount Parnitha, one of the last green areas near the Greek capital.</p><p>From Friday to Tuesday, 355 wildfires broke out, Climate Crisis and Civil Protection Minister Vassilis Kikilias said. On Wednesday, firefighters were tackling 99 blazes, fire department spokesman Ioannis Artopios said in an evening briefing, including 55 that had broken out in the previous 24 hours.</p><p>Authorities made 140 wildfire-related arrests, including 117 for negligence and 23 for deliberate arson, Artopios said, adding that nearly all were for heat-inducing or agricultural outdoor work.</p><p>Gale-force winds combined with hot, dry weather to whip up the flames, making the blazes exceptionally difficult to bring under control, authorities said.</p><p>Weather conditions this summer have been \"the worst since meteorological data have been gathered and the fire risk map has been issued in the country,\" Kikilias told a news conference. Extensive parts of Greece have been placed at Level 5, the highest for fire risk, seven times this year, which Kikilias said was double the number of 2021, four times that of 2019 and seven times more than in 2012.</p><p>Authorities issued dozens of evacuation orders for villages, Alexandroupolis' outskirts and seaside areas, with the coast guard and private boats plucking some people from beaches and coasts.</p><p>Although winds were gradually abating in many parts of the country, the risk of new fires remained high.</p><p>\"Conditions remain difficult and in many cases extreme,\" Artopios said.</p><p>Firefighters searching recently burnt areas in the Alexandroupolis region, which is near the border with Turkey, discovered the bodies of 18 people believed to be migrants in a forest Tuesday.</p><p>Alexandroupolis coroner Pavlos Pavlidis said all were male and two were minors.</p><p>Greece's Disaster Victim Identification Team was tasked with identifying the bodies and was setting up a telephone hotline that would operate in English, Arabic, Pashto, Turkish and Urdu for potential relatives of the victims.</p><p>Two other people died Monday, one in northern and one in central Greece.</p><p>With firefighting forces stretched to the limit, Greece asked other European countries for assistance. Germany, Sweden, Croatia and Cyprus sent water-dropping aircraft. Romanian, French and Czech firefighters helped on the ground.</p><p>Evacuations were ordered for several neighborhoods and a migrant camp on the northwestern fringe of the Greek capital, as a wildfire that started Tuesday raced up a mountain toward Parnitha national park, threatened a military base and torched homes in the foothills.</p><p>More than 200 firefighters backed by volunteers, military and police forces, were battling the blaze, supported until nightfall by 12 planes and 14 helicopters. In Alexandroupolis, 17 planes and eight helicopters provided air support to the ground firefighting forces.</p><p>Supreme Court prosecutor Georgia Adilini asked the Alexandroupolis prosecutor to launch investigations into whether organized arson groups were operating in the region. Kikilias said the fire in the northeastern border region started in 15 different places inside a forest, with strong winds and dry conditions contributing to create a massive fire front.</p><p>\"Any firefighting forces, no matter how strong they were, would not have been able to bring it under control,\" Kikilias said.</p><p>Adilini also asked the Alexandroupolis prosecutor to investigate incidents of racist violence after police arrested three men on suspicion of imprisoning 13 migrants whom they accused of being linked to the wildfire.</p><p>One Albanian and two Greeks were charged Wednesday with a series of crimes, including kidnapping, and were being held pending a preliminary court hearing. A video posted online showed one of them referring to the migrants in terminology used for livestock and urging members of the public to round up migrants.</p><p>Across the border in Turkey's Canakkale province, strong winds fanned a wildfire for a second day.

(Crisanta Espinosa Aguilar/Cuartoscuro) <br/>'Considering that we have a plane with all the equipment to seed clouds we checked with Conagua to see whether we could support [them] with the plane in the area where they needed to be able to make it rain,' Sandoval said. <br/>He explained the plane normally works in northern Mexico and is now in Baja California but could be brought to Mexico City to tackle the capital's current water crisis. <br/>'The conditions in the Cutzamala area are very good because there is humidity, there is cloudiness,' Sandoval said. <br/>Sedena's announcement came after Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum said that water pressure in the Valley of Mexico would be reduced in March, April and May due to low water levels in the reservoirs that supply the capital. <br/>According to Conagua, the Cutzamala reservoir system is currently at only 47.6% of storage capacity \u2014 the lowest level[1] recorded in its history. Rain is desperately needed in order to refill the dams that keep the water flowing to Mexico City. <br/>The cloud seeding process works by discharging supercooled silver iodide into certain types of rain clouds. This causes water particles in the cloud to bunch together until they are heavy enough to fall. It can only work on existing clouds and cannot create more water in the sky. <br/>Mexico first used this process to control a forest fire in Coahuila and Nuevo Le\u00f3n in April 2021. <br/>It has since been employed to induce rains in the drought-stricken states[2] of Baja California, Sinaloa, Sonora, Chihuahua, Durango and Zacatecas, but has never yet been used near the capital. <br/>Mexico has faced increasingly serious droughts[3] over the last decade. Annual rainfall has fallen from 10,000 cubic meters in 1960 to 4,000 since 2012, and the World Resources Institute now ranks the country 24th for water stress.The problem is worsened[4] by poor water management systems and misuse of water extraction rights.  <br/>Twelve million Mexicans currently do not have access to clean drinking water, and the Water Advisory Council[5] (CCA) nonprofit has warned the issue is likely to cause social and economic conflicts over the coming years. <br/>With reports from El Financiero[6] and Infobae[7] <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://aristeguinoticias.com/1503/mexico/sistema-cutzamala-llega-al-nivel-mas-bajo-de-su-historia/\">https://aristeguinoticias.com/1503/mexico/sistema-cutzamala-llega-al-nivel-mas-bajo-de-su-historia/</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/air-force-has-a-new-mission-seed-clouds-and-combat-drought/\">https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/air-force-has-a-new-mission-seed-clouds-and-combat-drought/</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/experts-concern-water-scarcity-mexico/\">https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/experts-concern-water-scarcity-mexico/</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/mexican-institute-calls-better-water-legislation/\">https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/mexican-institute-calls-better-water-legislation/</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://latinno.net/en/case/13029/\">https://latinno.net/en/case/13029/</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/cdmx/2023/03/22/bombardeo-de-nubes-en-cdmx-que-es-y-cuando-comienza-el-plan-para-combatir-la-sequia/\">https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/cdmx/2023/03/22/bombardeo-de-nubes-en-cdmx-que-es-y-cuando-comienza-el-plan-para-combatir-la-sequia/</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.infobae.com/mexico/2023/03/24/como-es-el-bombardeo-de-nubes-el-plan-de-la-sedena-para-combatir-sequia-en-cdmx/\">https://www.infobae.com/mexico/2023/03/24/como-es-el-bombardeo-de-nubes-el-plan-de-la-sedena-para-combatir-sequia-en-cdmx/</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/defense-ministry-cloud-seeding-plan-combat-drought/\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-MXND10009654167970274394725876100252</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MXND-10009654</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67VN-7NG1-F03R-N32M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567764</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"575\"/><timeReceived>12:05 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

Greece's largest forest fire was burning out of control for the fifth day near the city of Alexandroupolis in the northeast. Another major blaze on the outskirts of Athens torched homes, reducing some to piles of smoking rubble, and encroached into the national park on Mount Parnitha, one of the last green areas near the Greek capital. From Friday to Tuesday, 355 wildfires broke out, Climate Crisis and Civil Protection Minister Vassilis Kikilias said. </p><p>On Wednesday, firefighters were tackling 99 blazes, fire department spokesperson Ioannis Artopios said in an evening briefing, including 55 that had broken out in the previous 24 hours. Authorities made 140 wildfire-related arrests, including 117 for negligence and 23 for deliberate arson, Artopios said, adding that nearly all were for heat-inducing or agricultural outdoor work. Gale-force winds combined with hot, dry weather to whip up the flames, making the blazes exceptionally difficult to bring under control, authorities said. Weather conditions this summer have been \"the worst since meteorological data have been gathered and the fire risk map has been issued in the country,\" Kikilias told a news conference. Extensive parts of Greece have been placed at Level 5, the highest for fire risk, seven times this year, which Kikilias said was double the number of 2021, four times that of 2019 and seven times more than in 2012. Authorities issued dozens of evacuation orders for villages, Alexandroupolis' outskirts and seaside areas, with the coast guard and private boats plucking some people from beaches and coasts. Although winds were gradually abating in many parts of the country, the risk of new fires remained high. \"Conditions remain difficult and in many cases extreme,\" Artopios said. Firefighters searching recently burnt areas in the Alexandroupolis region, which is near the border with Turkey, discovered the bodies of 18 people believed to be migrants in a forest Tuesday. Alexandroupolis coroner Pavlos Pavlidis told the Associated Press all were male and two were minors between 10 and 15 years old. Greece's Disaster Victim Identification Team was tasked with identifying the bodies and was setting up a telephone hotline that would operate 9am-5pm local time from Thursday in English, Arabic, Pashto, Turkish and Urdu for potential relatives of the victims. Two other people died Monday, one in northern and one in central Greece. With firefighting forces stretched to the limit, Greece asked other European countries for assistance. Germany, Sweden, Croatia and Cyprus sent water-dropping aircraft. Romanian, French and Czech firefighters helped on the ground. Evacuations were ordered for several neighborhoods and a migrant camp on the northwestern fringe of the Greek capital, as a wildfire that started Tuesday raced up a mountain toward Parnitha national park, threatened a military base and torched homes in the foothills. More than 200 firefighters backed by volunteers, military and police forces, were battling the blaze, supported until nightfall by 12 planes and 14 helicopters. In Alexandroupolis, 17 planes and eight helicopters provided air support to the ground firefighting forces. Supreme Court prosecutor Georgia Adilini asked the Alexandroupolis prosecutor to launch investigations into whether organized arson groups were operating in the region. Kikilias said the fire in the northeastern border region started in 15 different places inside a forest, with strong winds and dry conditions contributing to create a massive fire front. \"Any firefighting forces, no matter how strong they were, would not have been able to bring it under control,\" Kikilias said. Adilini also asked the Alexandroupolis prosecutor to investigate incidents of racist violence after police arrested three men on suspicion of imprisoning 13 migrants whom they accused of being linked to the wildfire. One Albanian and two Greeks were charged Wednesday with a series of crimes, including kidnapping, and were being held pending a preliminary court hearing. A video posted online showed one of them referring to the migrants in terminology used for livestock and urging members of the public to round up migrants. Across the border in Turkey's Canakkale province, strong winds fanned a wildfire for a second day. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said winds reaching 40 mph at times were hampering efforts to extinguish the blaze but said firefighters had managed to halt its spread. \"Hopefully, we will get it under control soon,\" Erdogan said in a televised address. Ibrahim Yumakli, Turkey's forestry minister, said firefighting teams and more than two dozen fire-dousing planes and helicopters had largely blocked the blaze from spreading beyond the 5.8 square miles it had already affected. Authorities suspended maritime traffic through the narrow Dardanelles Strait linking the Aegean Sea to the Sea of Marmara, which the water-dropping aircraft were using to refill, the minister said. Authorities evacuated an elderly care home and more than 1,250 people from nine villages and closed down a highway. Hospitals treated more than 80 people for the effects of smoke. Erdogan urged citizens to exercise care and help prevent wildfires. \"Unfortunately, more than 90 percent of fires in our country are caused by humans,\" he said. \"Negligence or carelessness lead to great disasters.\" In Tenerife in Spain's Canary Islands, authorities said a wildfire burning for more than a week was nearly under control after scorching 58 square miles. \"It's a very tough battle that the firefighting teams are winning,\" said Canary regional government counselor Manuel Miranda. Spain is sweltering under its fourth heat wave this summer. The country's weather service said up to 16 temperature records for August were broken Tuesday. Sporadic fires were also reported in Italy, which has been engulfed in a heat wave expected to extend into the weekend with temperatures above 100 F in many cities. With their hot, dry summers, southern European countries are particularly prone to wildfires. European Union officials have blamed climate change for the increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires in Europe, noting that 2022 was the second-worst year for wildfire damage on record after 2017.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CLIWRE-0000018a2465d0b1a7eb667571090000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CLIWRE2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6975-26W1-F0YC-P008-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388351</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1086\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ClimateWire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 24, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Greece's largest forest fire was burning out of control for the fifth day near the city of Alexandroupolis in the northeast, while another major blaze on the northwestern fringe of Athens was torching homes and heading into Parnitha national park, one of the last green areas near the Greek capital, sending plumes of smoke over the city. Firefighters tackled 355 forest fires over five days from Friday to Tuesday, Climate Crisis and Civil Protection Minister Vassilis Kikilias said Wednesday, including 209 over the last 48 hours alone. Gale-force winds combined with hot, dry summer conditions to whip up the flames, making the blazes exceptionally difficult to bring under control, authorities said. </p><p>This summer's weather conditions have been \"the worst since meteorological data have been gathered and the fire risk map has been issued in the country,\" Kikilias said at a news conference. Extensive parts of the country have been placed at Level 5, the highest for fire risk, seven times so far this year, which Kikilias said was double the number in 2021, four times that of 2019 and seven times more than in 2012. Authorities issued dozens of evacuation orders for villages and seaside areas this week, with the coast guard and private boats plucking some people from beaches and coasts. The main hospital in Alexandroupolis was evacuated overnight Monday, with nearly 70 of its more than 200 patients transferred to a ferry docked in the city's port turned into a temporary floating hospital. Although winds were gradually abating in many parts of the country, the risk of new fires remained high. \"Conditions remain difficult and in many cases extreme,\" fire department spokesperson Ioannis Artopios said. Firefighters searching recently burnt areas in the Alexandroupolis region, which is near the border with Turkey, discovered the bodies of 18 people believed to be migrants in a forest Tuesday. Two other people were found dead Monday, one in northern Greece and another in a separate fire in central Greece. With firefighting forces stretched to the limit, Greece called for assistance from other European countries. Germany, Sweden, Croatia and Cyprus sent water-dropping aircraft; Romania and the Czech Republic sent dozens of firefighters and water tanks; and French firefighters were helping tackle a persistent wildfire on the island of Evia. Evacuations were ordered for several neighborhoods and a migrant camp on the northwestern fringe of the Greek capital, as a wildfire that started Tuesday raced up a mountain toward Parnitha national park, threatened a military base in the area and torched homes in the foothills. More than 200 firefighters backed by volunteers; military and police forces; eight helicopters; and seven planes, including two from Germany and two from Sweden, were battling the blaze. The fire in Alexandroupolis continued to burn out of control, with dozens of Romanian firefighters joining the battle, backed by eight helicopters and five planes, including two from Cyprus. Supreme Court prosecutor Georgia Adilini asked the Alexandroupolis prosecutor to launch investigations into whether organized arson groups were operating in the region. Kikilias said the fire in the northeastern border region started in 15 different places inside a forest, with strong winds and dry conditions contributing to create a massive fire front. \"Any firefighting forces, no matter how strong they were, would not have been able to bring it under control,\" Kikilias said. Adilini also asked the Alexandroupolis prosecutor to investigate incidents of racist violence after three men in the Alexandroupolis area allegedly sequestered 13 migrants whom they accused of being linked to the wildfire. Police late Tuesday arrested one Albanian and two Greek nationals on suspicion of imprisoning the 13 Syrians and Pakistanis in a car trailer. A video posted online showed one of the three referring to the migrants in terminology used for livestock and urging other members of the public to round up migrants. The three were charged Wednesday with a series of crimes, including kidnapping, and were being held pending a preliminary court hearing. Across the border in Turkey's Canakkale province, strong winds were fanning a wildfire for a second day. Authorities evacuated an elderly care home and more than 1,250 people from nine villages and closed down a highway. More than 80 people were treated in hospitals for the effects of smoke. Ibrahim Yumakli, Turkey's forestry minister, said firefighting teams and more than two dozen fire-dousing planes and helicopters had largely blocked the blaze from spreading beyond the 3,700 acres it has affected so far. Authorities also suspended maritime traffic through the narrow Dardanelles Strait linking the Aegean Sea to the Sea of Marmara, which the water-dropping aircraft were using to refill, the minister said. On Tenerife in Spain's Canary Islands, authorities said a wildfire burning for more than a week was nearly under control after scorching 37,000 acres. \"It's a very tough battle that the firefighting teams are winning,\" said Canary regional government counselor Manuel Miranda. Authorities said firefighters were working on securing the perimeter, which had reached 55 miles. Spain is sweltering under its fourth heat wave this summer. The country's weather service said up to 16 temperature records for August were broken Tuesday. Sporadic fires were also reported in Italy, which has been engulfed in a heat wave expected to extend into the weekend with temperatures above 38 degrees Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit) in many cities. Forty firefighters and three aircraft were battling a brush fire that broke out early Wednesday on the outskirts of the Ligurian seaside town of Sanremo, a popular summer destination. No injuries or property damage were reported. With their hot, dry summers, southern European countries are particularly prone to wildfires. European Union officials have blamed climate change for the increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires in Europe, noting that 2022 was the second-worst year for wildfire damage on record after 2017.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-0000018a22c0d2a3a3fee7fa392e0000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:696Y-3071-DY7N-F00B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1075\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 23, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

And about as bad as it gets \u2014 until more warming kicks in. Killer floods, droughts and heat waves hit around the world, costing many billions of dollars. </p><p>Global ocean heat and acidity levels hit record highs and Antarctic sea ice and European Alps glaciers reached record low amounts, according to the United Nations' climate agency's State of Global Climate 2022 report released Friday. While levels have been higher before human civilization, global sea height and the amount of heat-trapping carbon dioxide and methane in the air reached highest modern recorded amounts. The key glaciers that scientists use as a health check for the world shrank by more than 1.3 meters (51 inches) in just one year and for the first time in history no snow survived the summer melt season on Switzerland's glaciers, the report said. Sea level is now rising at about double the rate it did in the 1990s, WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said in a news conference. Oceans can rise another half a meter to a meter (20 to 39 inches) by the end of century as more ice melts from ice sheets and glaciers and warmer water expands, he said. \"Unfortunately these negative trends in weather patterns and all of these parameters may continue until the 2060s\" despite efforts to reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases because of the pollution already spewed, Taalas said. \"We have already lost this melting of this glaciers game and sea level rise game. So that's bad news.\" Last year was close to but not quite the hottest year on record, ranking fifth or sixth hottest depending on measuring techniques. But the past eight years are the hottest eight years on record globally. The world kept that warm despite the rare third year of a La Nina, a natural temporary cooling of parts of the Pacific Ocean that changes weather worldwide. The United Kingdom, France, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy, Germany, Switzerland and New Zealand had their hottest years on record. Global heat and other weather records go back to 1850. \"In 2022, continuous drought in East Africa, record breaking rainfall in Pakistan and record-breaking heat waves in China and Europe affected tens of millions, drove food insecurity, boosted mass migration, and cost billions of dollars in loss and damage,\" Taalas said. China's heat wave was its longest and most extensive in that country's record with its summer not just hottest on record but smashing the old record by more than 0.5 degrees Celsius (0.9 degrees Fahrenheit), the 55-page report said. Africa's drought displaced more than 1.7 million people in Somalia and Ethiopia, while Pakistan's devastating flooding \u2014 which put one-third of the nation under water at one point \u2014 displaced about 8 million people, the report said.

Arizonans understand that living in harmony with the environment is good for our health and good for our economy.</p><p><br/>Knowing that they have the support of voters across the political spectrum presents an incredible opportunity for elected officials to take action toward a more sustainable future for Arizona. How do we know this is the will of Arizona voters? Because that\u2019s what they\u2019ve told us.<br/>Results of multiple surveys conducted for Center for the Future of Arizona reveal that regardless of political affiliation, Arizona voters prioritize water security, improved air quality, preventing wildfires and preserving natural areas and wildlife. Near supermajorities also support a transition to clean energy.<br/>And if resources to take these actions are a concern, Arizona does not have to make these investments alone! The state of Arizona is eligible to receive federal funding to address environmental and water issues, including drought resiliency, clean air, energy improvement in rural areas, electric grid resiliency and forest fire management. Eighty-five percent of Arizona voters support these investment opportunities.<br/>The recent creation of Arizona\u2019s Office of Resiliency aligns with these bipartisan priorities, and it allows the state to maximize federal investment dollars made available by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). This office, coupled with the funds it allows the state to tap into, has the potential to not only fuel investment but promote job growth, savings for households, and billions of dollars in economic impact for Arizona.<br/>All of this means that at this moment, those with decision-making power have arrived at a confluence of factors that point toward action as the priorities of voters align, funds have been made available, and systems have been designed to facilitate the outcomes voters want.<br/>Water is, of course, high on that list of priorities. We are at a critical turning point with the long-term drought and the likelihood of cutbacks to Arizona\u2019s water supply.<br/>When we asked Arizona voters what they believe should be the top priorities for water use, they were evenly distributed between those who prioritize using water for agriculture, those who believe recreation and conservation should be the top priority, and those who would advocate for water to support growth. This means that water-related solutions need to offer ways to do more with what we have.<br/>This is a tall order, without a doubt. But it is top of mind for Arizona voters. Nearly 75% of voters don\u2019t believe Arizona will have enough water for the long term. And 95% of voters believe securing Arizona\u2019s water future and long-term water supplies is a top priority.<br/>Arizona voters prioritize sustainable solutions that move our state forward and ultimately create the Arizona we want. Water is top of mind for Arizona voters, but so are other issues like clean air, clean energy, and rising temperatures.

She recently split from the father of her 20-month-old daughter, Evie, and is raising the girl on her own. The bedside table is piled high with children's books, the default reading material of the new mom, who has been introducing Evie to the magic of stories while trying to write fiction of her own. \"It's been extra hard being alone a lot of the time, but I absolutely love being a mom-and a writer. I become emotional and sort of obsessed with what I'm working on. If I don't feel that, I can't really write.\"   </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The daughter of Cypriot refugees, Lefteri writes intimate novels about global issues-war, migration, the refugee crisis-that explore the plight of humanity. Her three previous books (including <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Beekeeper of Aleppo</emphasis>, winner of the 2020 Aspen Word Literary Prize, about a family of refugees during the Syrian Civil War, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Songbirds</emphasis>, about migrant domestic workers in Cyprus) have sold more than two million copies worldwide and have been translated into 35 languages, according to the Marianne Gunn O'Connor Literary, Film &amp; TV Agency, which represents the author.   </p><p>Lefteri's new novel, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Book of Fire</emphasis>, due out in January from Ballantine, addresses climate change as it follows a contemporary Greek family-music teacher Irini; her painter husband, Tasso; and their daughter, Chara-who live in a village in an ancient forest and whose lives are upended when a fire erupts, decimating both forest and village. The villagers blame a developer who started the fire while clearing land to build a hotel, but he isn't the sole culprit, as prolonged high temperatures created dry conditions that turned the forest into a tinderbox.   </p><p>\"How do we deal with situations where there's someone to blame, but there's also something bigger happening?\" Lefteri says. \"And how do we deal with that during times of trauma?\"   </p><p>The first time Lefteri saw an out-of-control forest fire in Greece was in 2017, when she was working as a volunteer at an Athens refugee center for women and children who'd been displaced during the Syrian Civil War. \"I woke up one morning and the sky was filled with smoke,\" she recalls. \"There was a fire in a nearby town. It haunted me.\"   </p><p>Lefteri decided to write <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Book of Fire </emphasis>in 2021, after another, bigger fire on the Greek island of Evia destroyed an ancient forest, killed more than 100 people, and left others homeless and physically scarred. She went to Greece for six weeks, while three months pregnant, to do research for the novel.   </p><p>This included visiting the town of Mati, the site of yet another fatal fire, in 2018, and talking with still-traumatized locals, many of whom rejected the idea that climate change was responsible.   </p><p>\"Being there was overwhelming,\" Lefteri says. \"I wanted to leave, which I felt horrible about. Every time I write a book I feel guilt, about being able to go home, a home that hasn't been destroyed, that isn't a camp. There's this thing that happens to me where I become frightened about life. I can be quite robust, but when I'm alone I feel the fragility of life. It gets to me. I find it hard to regain my grounding, but then I remember what other people are dealing with.\"   </p><p>Lefteri is disarmingly open about her personal life and displays a genuine interest in others, which makes her effective as a field researcher who's willing to be the sympathetic ear. \"Christy is one of the most caring and compassionate people I've ever met,\" says Lefteri's agent, Marianne Gunn O'Connor. \"She has a beautiful personality and a sweet nature. She worries about the world and writes with her heart.\"   </p><p>Born in 1980 in London, Lefteri was a sensitive child who enjoyed oil painting and stories. Her father, who'd been an officer in the war in Cyprus in 1974, came to the U.K. with Lefteri's mother. Lefteri remembers her childhood home as a warm place, but her father, who she says had undiagnosed PTSD, was prone to outbursts. \"That was the impact of someone not speaking about their trauma,\" Lefteri explains. \"I remember thinking as a child, what am I doing wrong? I still carry that. I'm constantly thinking I'm doing something wrong. That's how unspoken trauma gets passed from one generation to the next.\"   </p><p>As she grew older, Lefteri became interested in writing as a way to express trauma. She worked for a time as a psychoanalyst, and in 2010 she earned her PhD in creative writing from Brunel University and wrote her first novel, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A Watermelon, a Fish and a Bible</emphasis>, about the war in Cyprus, as part of her thesis project.   </p><p>\"Writing really gets to my heart,\" says Lefteri, whose characters often use art to cope with their troubles. \"I think sometimes we have to go into our pain to overcome it.\"   </p><p>Anne Speyer, Lefteri's editor, appreciates the author's ability to make big topics feel accessible. \"Christy is wonderful at taking things that you read about in the news and making them personal,\" she says. \"She also makes you feel deeply about her characters. That's the key to a great story, and she's done it with every book.\"   </p><p>Lefteri's next novel will be about European women's football and will be set during World War I and in the present as it explores women's lives across generations. \"The book is linked to what I experienced with my daughter's dad after she was born,\" Lefteri says. \"I left like I had lost my independence, that everything was put on me. This book will be about women's dreams, about how far we've come, and if we've come as far as we think.\"   </p><p>As evening sets in, Lefteri hears a voice downstairs and checks the clock. The nanny is about to leave and it's time to get her daughter. The pair may go for a walk with their dog, Alfie. (An emphatic animal lover, Lefteri is \"completely obsessed\" with him.)   </p><p>She hopes <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Book of Fire</emphasis> will inspire people to pay attention to how humanity treats the planet and every living thing on it. \"There's a grief we feel at the loss of our environment, and we don't often realize that it causes such sadness,\" she says. \"If we lose our world, we're nothing. Perhaps this book can make people pause and feel. When we really feel, it can impact a decision.\"   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Elaine Szewczyk's writing has appeared in </emphasis>McSweeney's<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> and other publications. She's the author of the novel </emphasis>I'm with Stupid.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PUBWKY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PUBWKY2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6995-TFF1-DXMV-W003-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404869</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1061\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 PWxyz, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Publisher's Weekly</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5977\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><volume>Vol. 270</volume><issueNumber>No. 40</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>September 29, 2023</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

dry enough to burn.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By now, we've had more than three days of sun and the woods are so dry you can smell the hot fir and spruce pitch.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's like a toxic perfume that hints at a danger that is not unlike sitting in a house with a basement full of dynamite.</p><p>The history of the Pacific Northwest is a history of fire.</p><p>These devastating natural disasters have swept through the country since time immemorial.</p><p>The most devastating forest fire the Olympic Peninsula ever saw occurred long before there were any loggers or stump ranchers to blame.</p><p>About 120 miles of coastline between Willapa Bay and Lake Ozette burned, leaving standing dead cedars as a witness to this pre-historic disaster.</p><p>It may have occurred during the Medieval Warm Period, when from 900-1300 A.D., the Earth's climate warmed up enough for the Vikings to settle in Greenland.</p><p>The Peninsula may have been exceptionally dry.</p><p>The fire could have been started by lightning or the Native American practice of setting fires to maintain the prairies where camas was dug and game was lured by the fresh growth.</p><p>We'll never know.</p><p>All we know for sure is this cataclysm was followed by an even more devastating disaster, the arrival of the Europeans.</p><p>Fires became more frequent.</p><p>James Swan described a Fourth of July on Shoalwater Bay in 1855, where the oystermen filled a cedar stump that was 60 feet around and 20 feet tall with dry spruce limbs as part of the celebration.</p><p>The party agreed they had never had a \"pleasanter\" Fourth.</p><p>The fire burned the surrounding forest until extinguished by the winter rains.</p><p>In 1890, a fire above Sequim was started by a homesteader who tried to burn out a neighbor.</p><p>The wind shifted and burned west to the hills above Port Angeles.</p><p>Old photographs of these towns show bare hills in the background.</p><p>In 1891, a homesteader set fire to some logging slash to clear land for a blackberry patch that burned about 3,000 acres between Lake Quinault to Neilton.</p><p>These fires were nothing compared to the darkest day in Olympic Peninsula history, Sept. 12, 1902, when the sky went dark at noon from a conflagration burning in Oregon and Washington from the Cascades to the Pacific Ocean.</p><p>Known collectively as the Yacolt Burn, it was a perfect firestorm caused by everything from boys burning a hornet's nest, a locomotive, campers, berry pickers, loggers and lightning.</p><p>The Olympic National Forest was created in 1905 to control wildfires with a series of ranger stations, fire lookouts, shelters and fire tool sheds connected by trails and phone lines throughout the Olympic Mountains.</p><p>With the completion of Highway 101 between Port Angeles and Forks in 1923, motorists started chucking cigarettes out the window.</p><p>That's how the 12,000-acre Sol Duc Burn of 1926 started west of Lake Crescent, burning 11 miles to Bear Creek in five hours \u2014 incinerating trees that had been planted in the previous Sol Duc Burn of 1907.</p><p>That was nothing compared to the Forks Fire of Sept. 20, 1951, when buried, smoldering logs from an earlier fire that was supposed to be out were fanned into flames by an east wind that pushed the fire 18 miles west in eight hours.</p><p>It burned 38,000 acres and almost incinerated Forks before the wind shifted and saved the town.</p><p>Now we're faced with an early fire season with record temperatures and an east wind.</p><p>Be careful.</p><p>The forest you save could be your own.</p><p>_________</p><p>Pat Neal is a Hoh River fishing and rafting guide and \"wilderness gossip columnist\" whose column appears here every

Background</p><p>II. Final Action</p><p>III. Incorporation by Reference</p><p>IV. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews</p><p>I. Background</p><p>On March 23, 2023, the EPA proposed to approve Washington's August 10, 2022, SIP submission revising the Washington Smoke Management Plan (88 FR 17481). The reasons for our proposed approval are included in the proposal and will not be restated here. The public comment period closed on April 24, 2023. We received one anonymous comment in support of our proposed action; therefore, we are finalizing our action as proposed.</p><p>II. Final Action</p><p>The EPA is approving and incorporating by reference, where appropriate, Washington's 2022 submitted revisions into the Washington SIP 40 CFR part 52, subpart WW as discussed in our March 23, 2023, proposed approval (88 FR 17481). Once this approval becomes effective, the Washington SIP will include the following statutes and regulations:</p><p>- RCW 52.12.103, Burning Permits--Issuance--Contents (state effective March 27, 1984);</p><p>- RCW 52.12.104, Burning Permits--Duties of permittee (state effective March 27, 1984);</p><p>* RCW 76.04.005, Definitions.

Incorporation by Reference</p><p>In this document, the EPA is finalizing regulatory text that includes incorporation by reference. In accordance with requirements of 1 CFR 51.5, EPA is finalizing the incorporation by reference of regulatory provisions described in section II of this preamble and set forth in the amendments to 40 CFR part 52 in this document. The EPA has made, and will continue to make, these materials reasonably available through <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.regulations.gov\">https://www.regulations.gov</url> and at the EPA Region 10 Office (please contact the person identified in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section of this preamble for more information). Therefore, these materials have been approved by the EPA for inclusion in the SIP, have been incorporated by reference by the EPA into that plan, are fully federally enforceable under sections 110 and 113 of the Clean Air Act as of the effective date of the final rule of the EPA's approval, and will be incorporated by reference in the next update to the SIP compilation.[1]</p><p>IV. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews</p><p>Under the Clean Air Act, the Administrator is required to approve a SIP submission that complies with the provisions of the Clean Air Act and applicable Federal regulations. 42 U.S.C. 7410(k); 40 CFR 52.02(a). Thus, in reviewing SIP submissions, the EPA's role is to approve state choices, provided that they meet the criteria of the Clean Air Act. Accordingly, this action merely approves state law as meeting Federal requirements and does not impose additional requirements beyond those imposed by state law. For that reason, this action:</p><p>- Is not a \"significant regulatory action\" subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Orders 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) and 13563 (76 FR 3821, January 21, 2011);</p><p>* Does not impose an information collection burden under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.);</p><p>* Is certified as not having a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.);</p><p>- Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4);</p><p>- Does not have federalism implications as specified in Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999);</p><p>- Is not an economically significant regulatory action based on health or safety risks subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997);</p><p>- Is not a significant regulatory action subject to Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001); and</p><p>- Is not subject to requirements of Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 note) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent with the Clean Air Act.</p><p>Executive Order 12898 (Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations, 59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994) directs Federal agencies to identify and address \"disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects\" of their actions on minority populations and low-income populations to the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law. The EPA defines environmental justice (EJ) as \"the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies.\" The EPA further defines the term fair treatment to mean that \"no group of people should bear a disproportionate burden of environmental harms and risks, including those resulting from the negative environmental consequences of industrial, governmental, and commercial operations or programs and policies.\"</p><p>The air agency did not evaluate environmental justice considerations as part of its SIP submittal; the Clean Air Act and applicable implementing regulations neither prohibit nor require such an evaluation. The EPA did not perform an EJ analysis and did not consider EJ in this action. Due to the nature of this action, it is expected to have a neutral to positive impact on the air quality of the affected area. Consideration of EJ is not required as part of this action, and there is no information in the record inconsistent with the stated goal of Executive Order 12898 of achieving environmental justice for people of color, low-income populations, and Indigenous peoples.</p><p>In addition, the SIP is not approved to apply on any Indian reservation land in Washington except as specifically noted below and is also not approved to apply in any other area where the EPA or an Indian tribe has demonstrated that a tribe has jurisdiction. In those areas of Indian country, the rule does not have tribal implications as specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000), nor will it impose substantial direct costs on tribal governments or preempt tribal law. Washington's SIP is approved to apply on non-trust land within the exterior boundaries of the Puyallup Indian Reservation, also known as the 1873 Survey Area. Under the Puyallup Tribe of Indians Settlement Act of 1989, 25 U.S.C. 1773, Congress explicitly provided state and local agencies in Washington authority over activities on non-trust lands within the 1873 Survey Area. Consistent with EPA policy, the EPA provided a consultation opportunity to potentially affected tribes in a letter dated May 24, 2022.</p><p>This action is subject to the Congressional Review Act, and the EPA will submit a rule report to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the United States. This action is not a \"major rule\" as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).</p><p>Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by October 10, 2023. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this action for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. See section 307(b)(2).</p><p>List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52</p><p>- Environmental protection</p><p>- Air pollution control</p><p>- Incorporation by reference</p><p>- Intergovernmental relations</p><p>- Lead</p><p>- Nitrogen dioxide</p><p>- Ozone</p><p>- Particulate matter</p><p>- Reporting and recordkeeping requirements</p><p>- Sulfur oxides</p><p>- Volatile organic compounds</p><p>Dated: July 12, 2023.</p><p>Casey Sixkiller,</p><p>Regional Administrator, Region 10.</p><p>Footnotes</p><p>1. 62 FR 27968 (May 22, 1997).</p><p>[FR Doc. 2023-16409 Filed 8-9-23; 8:45 am]</p><p>BILLING CODE 6560-50-P</p><p>* * *</p><p>The document was published in the Federal Register: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/08/10/2023-16409/air-plan-approval-wa-smoke-management-plan-update\">https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/08/10/2023-16409/air-plan-approval-wa-smoke-management-plan-update</url></p><p>TARGETED NEWS SERVICE (founded 2004) features non-partisan 'edited journalism' news briefs and information for news organizations, public policy groups and individuals; as well as 'gathered' public policy information, including news releases, reports, speeches.

WOMBLE AND PATRICK GERLACH</nameText></person></author><nitf:byttl>FOR LNP | LANCASTERONLINE</nitf:byttl></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If Donald Trump is reelected to the White House next year, it will happen not only because of ardent \u201cAlways Trumpers,\u201d but because of another group of voters: the \u201cAlways Republicans.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Many people always and only vote for candidates of their own party. But if Donald Trump is the Republican nominee in next year\u2019s presidential election, it would be a good time for people who always vote for Republicans to make a different choice.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I am truly worried that a return of Trump to the White House will fundamentally change the nature of our constitutional republic for the worse, and possibly even destroy it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As former U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyoming, told PBS \u201cNewsHour\u201d earlier this month, Trump would \u201cput people around him who are willing to help him do what he failed to do last time\u201d \u2014 which was to try to subvert democracy to stay in power, even after losing a legitimate and fair election. As Cheney observed, that\u2019s \u201ca very grave threat.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not as though I don\u2019t see many problems with President Joe Biden and some of his policies. But those issues fall in the realm of debatable policy within normal political parameters, and they are things that can be fixed \u2014 they are not existential threats to our country.</p><p>So, when I read my friend Keith Vogt\u2019s declaration in the Dec. 3 Sunday LNP | LancasterOnline Perspective section (\u201cA local conservative\u2019s view of the looming 2024 election\u201d) that he plans to vote for Trump again for president, despite Trump\u2019s many flaws, it made me wonder: What, if anything, would cause a person like Keith not to vote for a Republican? How bad does it need to get? How much more fundamentally does the Republican Party have to change for voters like Keith to see that the party is no longer conservative in any meaningful way?</p><p>The GOP is beholden to one man whose only platform is to exact retribution on anyone who crosses him and, according to his own words, rule like a dictator and suspend the Constitution if he deems it necessary. Revenge, retribution, retaliation: These are the ruinous precursors of violent revolutions. A conservative, by definition, is not a revolutionary.</p><p>I decided to talk to another Lancaster County friend, someone who followed a similar path as I did some years ago in leaving the Republican Party. His name is Patrick Gerlach.</p><p>Patrick became a Democrat in 2015 and is a district leader for the local party now. I became an independent in 2016 and have assisted both Democrats and Republicans ever since. Patrick and I got to know each other this year on a campaign, and found out we had a lot in common. I invited Patrick to join me in this column in the format of a conversation. (It has been edited for newspaper style and clarity.)</p><p>\u2014 Ann Womble</p><p>Womble: Patrick, I\u2019ve told everyone the basics above, but would you describe your political journey in more depth?</p><p>Gerlach: I was raised in a staunchly Republican family on the (Philadelphia) Main Line and my first involvement in a campaign was working for the election of John McCain in the 2000 presidential primary against George W. Bush. I honestly thought that John McCain was the better candidate and of higher moral character.</p><p>Bush v. Gore (the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that controversially settled the 2000 presidential election in favor of George W. Bush over Al Gore), 9/11 and finally the 2003 invasion of Iraq all combined to make me start to reevaluate my political leanings. Also during these years I was very involved with my church and I watched as people started to combine their patriotic love of country with their religion. It struck me at the time as somewhat twisted and misguided, so even church life began to feel like a garment that no longer fit.</p><p>I was pleased with the election of Barack Obama (in 2008) because it heralded the best of America and I was honestly shocked to hear folks refer to him with a racial slur. Then came Donald Trump, intent on \u201cexposing\u201d Obama as illegitimate and not a \u201creal American\u201d with false claims he was born in another country. When Trump was rewarded with the GOP nomination for president in 2016 ... that sent me over the edge! He was a TV personality who had never been elected to any position of public trust. Those were his main claims to fame.</p><p>I switched parties and worked to get Hillary Clinton elected. I was not super-enthusiastic about her candidacy because I did not feel that power should pass from the king to the queen, but I decided it was better than electing a political neophyte. But Donald Trump won the 2016 election fair and square, and Clinton gave a gracious concession speech several days later, something that President Trump did not do after he lost to Joe Biden four years later.</p><p>Womble: We share similar backgrounds in the Christian faith. Why do you think so many Christians are drawn to Trump, a man so manifestly immoral and power-hungry? Nothing could be further from the fruits of the spirit of Jesus\u2019 teachings or the qualities we were taught to admire and expect in leaders.</p><p>Gerlach: Ann, that is a confounding question. I honestly cannot understand because all through the Bill Clinton years what we heard constantly was how disgusting his behavior was, and how it was a stain on the presidency.</p><p>Womble: I consider myself a conservative in the traditional sense. Do you?</p><p>Gerlach: If we are talking about the real definition of the word \u201cconservative\u201d \u2014 to conserve \u2014 then, yes. To me, a conservative believes in fiscal responsibility, strong defense, the international rules-based order, capitalism, free trade and especially the rule of law. It also means to conserve farmland and to protect God\u2019s magnificent Earth and to look out for those less fortunate, which is a central tenet of the Christian Gospel.</p><p>Womble: That brings me to another question. I see a streak of cruelty \u2014 or at least a comfort level with cruelty \u2014 now in the Republican Party that I didn\u2019t see before. I attribute a lot of it to the accommodation of Trump. For example, there\u2019s an almost heartlessness about how to deal with immigrants and refugees. To me, it\u2019s completely at odds with the pro-life ethic of defending the most vulnerable among us. What do you think?</p><p>Gerlach: To bring this issue close to home, one of the most wonderful attributes of our Lancaster County ethos is seen in organizations like Church World Service and the welcome and support we give to refugees. Lancaster County residents know how to do this better than anyone. We put Matthew 25:35-40 into practice (\u201cFor I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in ...\u201d). I will never understand how devout Christians can support wanton cruelty such as separating children from parents at the border. This policy was done on purpose.</p><p>Womble: In many ways, the extremists in both parties think and act alike. For example, they encourage a victimhood mindset over individual responsibility, or use identity politics to divide people. Do you see these similarities? It\u2019s the horseshoe theory \u2014 the extremes are actually closer to each other in both positions and tactics than they are to the broad center.</p><p>Gerlach: Of course. Each side engages in the very thing that they accuse the other of doing. During the protests in response to George Floyd\u2019s murder in 2020, the left erupted into violence in some cities, yet the right equally erupted into violence on Jan. 6, 2021, when summoned by Trump to Washington, D.C., after he tweeted \u201cBe there, will be wild!\u201d We are on a dangerous path if it becomes acceptable for either side to engage in violence to achieve its ends. Another conservative thought: The ends do not justify the means.</p><p>Womble: I want to see an alliance to stop Trump in 2024. Maybe it would have to be a temporary alliance, like animals fleeing a forest fire. To get out of danger and save their lives, predators and prey suspend the natural order of things for a while and work toward the same goal. This would require enough \u201cAlways Republicans\u201d to overcome their natural instinct to reflexively vote for the letter after a candidate\u2019s name, and to vote instead to save the republic from a larger danger. How can we work together to accomplish it?</p><p>Gerlach: Wow. Work together? Red and blue? How about we all strive to be purple for the sake of the republic in 2024? Because otherwise, we are cooked. Are there things that we all can agree on? Red and blue, believer and doubter? A Venn diagram for America? We all want to be understood and valued for our uniqueness as individuals. We want to live free. Free from hunger and free from violence. We want a bright future for our children and we want to grow old with dignity. This list could be expanded, but you get my point.</p><p>Womble: I like that \u2014 a Venn diagram for America. What unites us has to be stronger than what divides us. If we can avert this immediate threat, there will be plenty of future elections to argue and compromise about policies, reforms and new political realignments. When I changed my voter registration, I stopped feeling forced to cheer for only one team and started to cheer more for the preservation of the big, consequential game itself \u2014 our American democracy.</p><p>Gerlach: For the past several elections when knocking on the doors of voters, I was often accosted with, \u201cAre you a Republican or a Democrat?\u201d</p><p>My reply is always, \u201cI am an American, just like you.\u201d That always elicits an agreeable smile, and then we have a good conversation, regardless of their party. Most people understand that this angry screaming match hurts everyone, and they wish it would stop.</p><p>Womble: There was so much more Patrick and I explored in our conversation that I wish I could convey here. We strongly agreed on the need for Americans to unite in 2024 to reclaim our democracy from the allure of dangerous, strongmen-style politicians like Trump.</p><p>To the \u201cAlways Republican\u201d voters out there prepared to once again vote for Trump, I ask you: What happens when the next president after Trump, perhaps a Democrat, gets elected, flush with the juiced-up dictatorial powers a second Trump presidency might provide? Maybe then, but maybe too late, we would agree that wise constraints such as constitutional order and the rule of law are more important than preferred policy outcomes.</p><p>Ann S. Womble is a former chair of the Republican Committee of Lancaster County and former community member of the LNP | LancasterOnline Editorial Board; she resides in Lancaster Township. Patrick Gerlach lives in Mount Joy and is the district leader of the Donegal Democrats.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWERA-396773429abf11ee8a3ecf6f4fac1b39</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWERA2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69WN-P0X1-JC8F-21WM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">222875</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1760\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 LNP Media Group, Inc.

The announcement was made during a convening with leaders of the Brazilian government and representatives of the Council of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) in Bras\u00edlia this week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The future of the BrazilianAmazon is critical to our planet and to the Indigenous Peoples and local communities who call it home,\" said Lauren S\u00e1nchez, Vice Chair of the Earth Fund. \"Prosperity and sustainability can go hand in hand \u2014 protecting the AmazonRainforest is good for people and for the planet.\"</p><p>The grants announced today will support local and international groups working on the creation and management of protected areas and Indigenous territories, the early detection and response to forest fires, supporting economic development and jobs based on the forest, and building capacity for carbon markets.</p><p>\"Elevating socio-environmental protection and the fight against climate change to the center of government decisions is a priority for the Brazilian government,\" said Marina Silva, minister of the Environment and Climate Change of Brazil. \"The Amazon is the greatest resource the country has to reintegrate itself into the world, attract investment, generate jobs, and once again be a protagonist in solving humanity's greatest collective problem \u2013 the climate crisis.\"</p><p>\"The Amazon is one of the most important areas in the world for biodiversity and climate and supports the lives of millions of Indigenous Peoples and local communities,\" said Cristi\u00e1n Samper, Managing Director and Leader of Nature Solutions at the Bezos Earth Fund. \"The Bezos Earth Fund is committed to helping Brazil to protect this critical region while also reducing the drivers of deforestation by finding alternative paths to prosperity for the people living in the Amazon.\"</p><p>Creating and Enhancing Protected and Conserved Areas Across the Amazon</p><p>The Earth Fund granted $30.9 million to support the creation of over 8 million hectares of new protected and conserved areas and to improve the protection of 60 million hectares of tropical forests, an area larger than California. These grants will support the designation and protection of Indigenous territories in the northern Amazon of Wayamu, Tumucumaque, Roraima, and Rio Negro, as well as the Javari territories on the border of Peru.</p><p>The funding will support the work of local and international organizations, including Nia Tero, the Rainforest FoundationNorway, Rainforest Trust, and the Wildlife Conservation Society to work with other local partners.</p><p>Preventing and Fighting Forest Fires\u00a0</p><p>As peak fire season approaches in Brazil, forest fire prevention, monitoring, and preparedness are critical. The Earth Fund granted $5 million to Re:Wild to be distributed across more than 20 organizations in the nine Amazonian States to support the early detection of fires through remote sensing, training of forest guardians, providing equipment required to combat fires, and mobilizing fire crews to the impacted areas of the BrazilianAmazon.\u00a0</p><p>Finding Alternative Paths to Prosperity</p><p>Protecting the Amazon region requires developing alternative paths for people to prosper, including innovative measures to derive greater value from healthy forests, sustainable agricultural methods, expanding local bioeconomies, and stronger economies across the Amazon.</p><p>Carbon Market Training for Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities</p><p>Only a small fraction of climate and forest finance reaches Indigenous and local communities, leaving critical rightsholders and stakeholders too often pushed to the margins when negotiating climate and forest finance. The Earth Fundgrantedthe Environmental Defense Fund, leading Brazilian NGOs, and Indigenous organizations $9.7 million to provide training and legal and logistical support to Indigenous and community leaders in two Brazilian States. The grant will help them engage and benefit from emerging carbon market opportunities in the BrazilianAmazon.</p><p>Building Forest-Protecting Economies in the BrazilianAmazon</p><p>To create a prosperous and sustainable Amazon, the communities, cities, and states in the Amazon need strong economies and good jobs that are based on healthy, biodiverse forests. The Earth Fund is providing a $6 million grant to Instituto Clima e Sociedade (iCS) to bring together a network of Brazilian economic researchers and analysts, especially from universities and think tanks in the Amazon. The network will provide leaders in government, business, finance, and civil society with the research, data, and advice they need to design policies, make investments, and create businesses that support standing forests and provide economic opportunities for the people of the Amazon.</p><p>About the Bezos Earth Fund\u00a0<br/>TheBezos Earth Fundis Jeff Bezos' $10 billion commitment to fund scientists, activists, NGOs, and other actors who will drive climate and nature solutions. By allocating funds creatively, wisely, and boldly, the Bezos Earth Fund has the potential for transformative influence in this decisive decade.

According to news reporting originating from Tamil Nadu, India, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"In object detection, spatial knowledge assisted systems are effective. Object detection is a main and challenging issue to analyze object-related information.\" </p><p><br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Manonmaniam Sundaranar University, \"Several existing object detection techniques were developed to consider the object detection problem as a classification problem to perform feature selection and classification. But these techniques still face, less computational efficiency and high time consumption. This paper resolves the above limitations using the Fuzzy Tversky index Ontology-based Multi-Layer Perception method which improves the accuracy of object detection with minimum time. The proposed method uses a multilayer for finding the similarity score. A fuzzy membership function is used to validate the score for predicting the burned and non-burned zone. Experimental assessment is performed with different factors such as classification rate, time complexity, error rate, space complexity, and precision by using the forest fire dataset.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The results show that this novel technique can help to improve the classification rate and reduce the time and space complexity as well as error rate than the conventional methods.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: An Ontology Based Multilayer Perceptron for Object Detection.

They had carved hundreds of miles of canals in the Sonoran Desert with stone tools and channeled the waters of the Salt and Gila Rivers to irrigate their crops for a thousand years until, in the middle of the 15th century, because of social conflict or climate change-drought, floods-their technology became obsolete, their civilization collapsed, and the Hohokam scattered. Four hundred years later, when white settlers reached the territory of southern Arizona, they found the ruins of abandoned canals, cleared them out with shovels, and built crude weirs of trees and rocks across the Salt River to push water back into the desert. Aware of a lost civilization in the Valley, they named the new settlement Phoenix.</p><p><br/><br/>It grew around water. In 1911, Theodore Roosevelt <url normalizedValue=\"https://news.asu.edu/20240410-roosevelt-envisions-arizonas-future-1911-speech\">stood on the steps of the Tempe Normal School</url>, which, half a century later, would become Arizona State University, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://prism.lib.asu.edu/items/110458/view\">declared</url> that the soaring dam just completed in the Superstition Mountains upstream, established during his presidency and named after him, would provide enough water to allow 100,000 people to live in the Valley. There are now 5 million.<br/>The Valley is one of the fastest-growing regions in America, where a developer decided to put a city of the future on a piece of virgin desert miles from anything. At night, from the air, the Phoenix metroplex looks like a glittering alien craft that has landed where the Earth is flat and wide enough to host it. The street grids and subdivisions spreading across retired farmland end only when they're stopped by the borders of a tribal reservation or the dark folds of mountains, some of them surrounded on all sides by sprawl.<br/>Phoenix makes you keenly aware of human artifice-its ingenuity and its fragility. The American lust for new things and new ideas, good and bad ones, is most palpable here in the West, but the dynamo that generates all the microchip factories and battery plants and downtown high-rises and master-planned suburbs runs so high that it suggests its own oblivion. New Yorkers and Chicagoans don't wonder how long their cities will go on existing, but in Phoenix in August, when the heat has broken 110 degrees for a month straight, the desert golf courses and urban freeways give this civilization an air of impermanence, like a mirage composed of sheer hubris, and a surprising number of inhabitants begin to brood on its disappearance.<br/>Growth keeps coming at a furious pace, despite decades of drought, and despite political extremism that makes every election a crisis threatening violence. Democracy is also a fragile artifice. It depends less on tradition and law than on the shifting contents of individual skulls-belief, virtue, restraint. Its durability under natural and human stress is being put to an intense test in the Valley. And because a vision of vanishing now haunts the whole country, Phoenix is a guide to our future.<br/>1. The Conscience of Rusty Bowers<br/>Among the white settlers who rebuilt the Hohokam canals were the Mormon ancestors of Rusty Bowers. In the 1890s, they settled in the town of Mesa, east of Phoenix and a few miles downstream from where the Verde River joins the Salt. In 1929, when Bowers's mother was a little girl, she was taken to hear the Church president, believed to be a prophet. For the rest of her life, she would recall one thing he told the assembly: \"I foresee the day when there will be lines of people leaving this valley because there is no water.\"<br/>The Valley's several thousand square miles stretch from Mesa in the east to Buckeye in the west. Bowers lives on a hill at Mesa's edge, about as far east as you can go before the Valley ends, in a pueblo-style house where he and his wife raised seven children. He is lean, with pale-blue eyes and a bald sunspotted head whose pinkish creases and scars in the copper light of a desert sunset give him the look of a figure carved from the sandstone around him. So his voice comes as a surprise-playful cadences edged with a husky sadness. He trained to be a painter, but instead he became one of the most powerful men in Arizona, a 17-year state legislator who rose to speaker of the House in 2019. The East Valley is conservative and so is Bowers, though he calls himself a \"pinto\"-a spotted horse-meaning capable of variations. When far-right House members demanded a 30 percent across-the-board budget cut, he made a deal with Democrats to cut far less, and found the experience one of the most liberating of his life. He believes that environmentalists worship Creation instead of its Creator, but he drives a Prius as well as a pickup.<br/>In the late 2010s, the Arizona Republican Party began to worry Bowers with its growing radicalism: State meetings became vicious free-for-alls; extremists unseated mainstream conservatives. Still, he remained a member in good standing-appearing at events with Donald Trump during the president's reelection campaign, handing out Trump flyers door-to-door-until the morning of Sunday, November 22, 2020.<br/>Bowers and his wife had just arrived home from church when the Prius's Bluetooth screen flashed WHITE HOUSE. Rudy Giuliani was calling, and soon afterward the freshly defeated president came on the line. As Bowers later recalled, there was the usual verbal backslapping, Trump telling him what a great guy he was and Bowers thanking Trump for helping with his own reelection. Then Giuliani got to the point. The election in Arizona had been riddled with fraud: piles of military ballots stolen and illegally cast, hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens and dead people voting, gross irregularities at the counting centers. Bowers had been fielding these stories from Republican colleagues and constituents and found nothing credible in them.<br/>\"Do you have proof of that?\" Bowers asked.<br/>\"Yeah,\" Giuliani replied.<br/>\"Do you have names?\"<br/>\"Oh yeah.\"<br/>\"I need proof, names, how they voted, and I need it on my desk.\"<br/>\"Rudy,\" Trump broke in, \"give the man what he wants.\"<br/>Bowers sensed some further purpose to the call. \"To what end? What's the ask here?\"<br/>\"Rudy, what's the ask?\" Trump echoed, as if he didn't know.<br/>America's ex-mayor needed Bowers to convene a committee to investigate the evidence of fraud. Then, according to an \"arcane\" state law that had been brought to Giuliani's attention by someone high up in Arizona Republican circles, the legislature could replace the state's Biden electors with a pro-Trump slate.<br/>The car was idling on the dirt driveway by a four-armed saguaro cactus. \"That's a new one,\" Bowers said. \"I've never heard that one before. You need to tell me more about that.\"<br/>Giuliani admitted that he personally wasn't an expert on Arizona law, but he'd been told about a legal theory, which turned out to have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23559226-20220422_mark-finchem-jan-6-committee-testimony-transcript\">come from a paper</url> written by a 63-year-old state representative and avid Trump partisan named Mark Finchem, who was studying for a late-in-life master's degree at the University of Arizona.<br/>\"We're asking you to consider this,\" Trump told Bowers.<br/>\"Mr. President \"<br/>Bowers prayed a lot, about things large and small. But prayer doesn't deliver instant answers. So that left conscience, which everyone is blessed with but some do their best to kill. An immense number of Trump-era Republican officeholders had killed theirs in moments like this one. Bowers, who considered the Constitution divinely inspired, felt his conscience rising up into his throat: Don't do it. You've got to tell him you won't do it.<br/>\"I swore an oath to the Constitution,\" Bowers said.<br/>\"Well, you know,\" Giuliani said, \"we're all Republicans, and we need to be working together.\"<br/>\"Mr. President,\" Bowers said, \"I campaigned for you. I voted for you. The policies you put in did a lot of good. But I will do nothing illegal for you.\"<br/>\"We're asking you to consider this,\" Trump again told Bowers.<br/>At the end of November, Trump's legal team <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/30/republican-lawmakers-arizona-hold-meeting-rudy-giuliani/6468171002/\">flew to Phoenix and met with Republican legislators</url>. Bowers asked Giuliani for proof of voter fraud. \"We don't have the evidence,\" Giuliani said, \"but we have a lot of theories.\" The evidence never materialized, so <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/arizona-republican-party-civil-war-somehow-keeps-getting-weirder\">the state party pushed the theories</url>, colleagues in the legislature attacked Bowers on Twitter, and a crowd swarmed the capitol in December to denounce him. One of the most vocal protesters was a young Phoenix man a month away from world fame as the QAnon Shaman.<br/>On December 4, Bowers wrote in his diary:<br/>It is painful to have friends who have been such a help to me turn on me with such rancor. I may, in the eyes of men, not hold correct opinions or act according to their vision or convictions, but I do not take this current situation in a light manner, a fearful manner, or a vengeful manner. I do not want to be a winner by cheating  How else will I ever approach Him in the wilderness of life, knowing that I ask this guidance only to show myself a coward in defending the course He led me to take?<br/>Caravans of trucks climbed the road to Bowers's house with pro-Trump flags and video panels and loudspeakers blasting to his neighbors that he was corrupt, a traitor, a pervert, a pedophile. His daughter Kacey, who had struggled with alcoholism, was now dying, and the mob outside the house upset her. At one point, Bowers went out to face them and encountered a man in a Three Percenter T-shirt, with a semiautomatic pistol on his hip, screaming abuse. Bowers walked up close enough to grab the gun if the Three Percenter drew. \"I see you brought your little pop gun,\" he said. \"You gonna shoot me? Yell all you want-don't touch that gun.\" He knew that it would take only one would-be patriot under the influence of hateful rhetoric to kill him. He would later <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/GPO-J6-TRANSCRIPT-CTRL0000928883/\">tell the January 6 congressional committee</url>: \"The country is at a very delicate part where this veneer of civilization is thinner than my fingers pressed together.\"<br/>Emails poured in. On December 7, someone calling themselves hunnygun wrote:<br/>FUCK YOU, YOUR RINO COCKSUCKING PIECE OF SHIT. STOP BEING SUCH A PUSSY AND GET BACK IN THERE. DECERTIFY THIS ELECTION OR, NOT ONLY WILL YOU NOT HAVE A FUTURE IN ARIZONA, I WILL PERSONALLY SEE TO IT THAT NO MEMBER OF YOUR FAMILY SEES A PEACEFUL DAY EVER AGAIN. <br/>Three days before Christmas, Bowers was sitting on his patio when Trump called again-this time without his attorney, and with a strange message that might have been an attempt at self-exculpation. \"I remember what you told me the last time we spoke,\" Trump said. Bowers took this as a reference to his refusal to do anything illegal, which he repeated. \"I get it,\" Trump said. \"I don't want you to.\" He thanked Bowers for his support during the campaign. \"I hope your family has a merry Christmas.\"<br/>Kacey Bowers died at age 42 on January 28, 2021. COVID rules kept the family from her hospital bedside until her final hours. Bowers, a lay priest in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, gave his daughter a blessing, and at the very end, the family sang a hymn by John Henry Newman:<br/>Lead, kindly Light, amid th'encircling gloom,<br/> Lead thou me on!<br/> The night is dark, and I am far from home,<br/> Lead thou me on!<br/>The gloom thickened. Bowers's enemies launched an effort to recall him, with foot soldiers provided by the Trump youth organization Turning PointUSA, which is headquartered in Phoenix. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2021/06/17/effort-to-recall-arizona-house-speaker-rusty-bowers-appears-fall-short/7739484002/\">recall failed</url>, but it was an ill omen. That summer, a wildfire in the mountains destroyed the Bowers ranch, taking his library, his papers, and many of his paintings. In 2022, after Bowers <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/21/us/rusty-bowers-testimony-hearing-jan-6.html\">testified before the January 6 committee</url> in Washington, D.C., the <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-capitol-siege-donald-trump-presidential-censures-f8892631bd14e1b2266af4c9d00f6af8\">state party censured him</url> and another stream of abuse came to his doorstep. Term-limited in the House, he ran for a Senate seat just to let the party know that it couldn't bully him out. He was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/dave-farnsworth-interview-rusty-bowers-trump-qanon-mormon-2022-7\">demolished by a conspiracist</url> with Trump's backing. Bowers's political career was over.<br/>\"What do you do?\" Bowers said. \"You stand up. That's all you can do. You have to get back up. When we lost the place and saw the house was still burning and now there's nothing there, gone, and to have 23-plus years of a fun place with the family to be gone-it's hard. Is it the hardest? No. Not even close. I keep on my phone (I won't play it for you) my last phone call from my daughter-how scared she was, a port came out of her neck, they were transporting her, she was bleeding all over, and she says: ~Dad, please, help me, please!' Compared to a phone call from the president, compared to your house burning down? So what? What do you do, Dad? Those are hard things. But they come at us all. They're coming at us as a country  What do we do? You get up.\"<br/>Bowers went back to painting. He took a job with a Canadian water company called EPCOR. Water had obsessed him all his life-he did not want the prophet's vision to come to pass on his watch. One bright day last October, we stood on the Granite Reef Diversion Dam a few miles from his house, where the two main water systems that nourish the Valley meet at the foot of Red Mountain, sacred to the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indians, whose reservation stood just across the dry bed of the river. Below the dam's headgate three-foot carp thrashed in the turbulent water of the South Canal, and wild horses waded in the shallows upstream.<br/>\"What's the politics of water here?\" I asked.<br/>Bowers laughed, incredulous. \"Oh my gosh, that question. It's everywhere. You've heard the dictum.\"<br/>I had heard the dictum from everyone in the Valley who thought about the subject. \"Whiskey's for drinking-\"<br/>\"Water's for fighting,\" Bowers finished, and then he amended it: \"Water's for killing.\"<br/>2. The Heat Zone <br/>Summer in the Valley for most of its inhabitants is like winter in Minnesota-or winter in Minnesota 20 years ago. People stay inside as much as possible and move only if absolutely necessary among the artificial sanctuaries of home, car, and work. Young professionals in the arts district emerge after dark to walk their dogs. When the sun is high, all human presence practically disappears from the streets, and you notice how few trees there are in Phoenix.<br/>Frank Lloyd Wright <url normalizedValue=\"https://franklloydwright.org/frank-lloyd-wright-air-conditioning/\">disliked air-conditioning</url>. During a visit to Taliesin West, the home and studio he built from desert stone in the 1930s on a hillside north of Phoenix, I read in his book The Natural HouseS:<br/>To me air conditioning is a dangerous circumstance. The extreme changes in temperature that tear down a building also tear down the human body  If you carry these contrasts too far too often, when you are cooled the heat becomes more unendurable; it becomes hotter and hotter outside as you get cooler and cooler inside.<br/>The observation gets at the unnaturalness of the Valley, because its civilization is unthinkable without air-conditioning. But the massive amount of energy required to keep millions of people alive in traffic jams is simultaneously burning them up, because air-conditioning <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(22)00094-0\">accounts for 4 percent</url> of the world's greenhouse-gas emissions, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.iea.org/energy-system/transport/aviation\">twice that of all aviation</url>.<br/>One morning last August, goaded by Wright and tired of air-conditioned driving, I decided to walk the mile from my hotel to an interview at the Maricopa County Recorder's Office. Construction workers were sweating and hydrating on the site of a new high-rise. A few thin figures slouched on benches by the Valley Metro tracks. At a bus shelter, a woman lay on the sidewalk in some profound oblivion. After four blocks my skin was prickling and I thought about turning back for my rental car, but I couldn't face suffocating at the wheel while I waited for the air to cool. By the time I reached the Recorder's Office, I was having trouble thinking, as if I'd moved significantly closer to the sun.<br/>Last summer-when the temperature reached <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weather.gov/psr/yearinreview2023\">at least 110 degrees on 55 days</url> (above 110, people said, it all feels the same), and the midsummer monsoon rains never came, and Phoenix found itself an object of global horror-heat <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.maricopa.gov/ArchiveCenter/ViewFile/Item/5796\">officially helped kill 644 people</url> in Maricopa County. They were the elderly, the sick, the mentally ill, the isolated, the homeless, the addicted (methamphetamines cause dehydration and fentanyl impairs thought), and those too poor to own or fix or pay for air-conditioning, without which a dwelling can become unlivable within an hour. Even touching the pavement is dangerous. A woman named Annette Vasquez, waiting in line outside the NourishPHX food pantry, lifted her pant leg to show me a large patch of pink skin on her calf-the scar of a second-degree burn from a fall she'd taken during a heart attack in high heat after seven years on the streets.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/08/phoenix-record-excessive-heat-wave-streak/674924/?utm_source=feed\">Read: The problem with ~Why do people live in Phoenix?'</url>]<br/>It was 115 on the day I met Dr. Aneesh Narang at the emergency department of Banner\"University Medical Center. He had already lost four or five patients to heatstroke over the summer and just treated one who was brought in with a body temperature of 106 degrees, struggling to breathe and unable to sweat. \"Patients coming in at 108, 109 degrees-they've been in the heat for hours, they're pretty much dead,\" Narang said. \"We try to cool them down as fast as we can.\" The method is to strip off their clothes and immerse them in ice and tap water inside a disposable cadaver bag to get their temperature down to 100 degrees within 15 or 20 minutes. But even those who survive heatstroke risk organ failure and years of neurological problems.<br/>Recently, a hyperthermic man had arrived at Narang's emergency department lucid enough to speak. He had become homeless not long before and was having a hard time surviving in the heat-shelters weren't open during the day, and he didn't know how to find the city's designated cooling centers. \"I can't keep up with this,\" he told the doctor. \"I can't get enough water. I'm tired.\"<br/>Saving a homeless patient only to send him back out into the heat did not feel like a victory to Narang. \"It's a Band-Aid on a leaking dam,\" he said. \"We haven't solved a deep-rooted issue here. We're sending them back to an environment that got them here-that's the sad part. The only change that helps that situation is ending homelessness. It's a problem in a city that'll <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/heat-dome-southwest-arizona/674689/?utm_source=feed\">get hotter and hotter every year</url>. I'm not sure what it'll look like in 2050.\"<br/>The mayor of Phoenix, Kate Gallego, has a degree in environmental science and has worked on water policy in the region. \"We are trying to very much focus on becoming a more sustainable community,\" she told me in her office at city hall. Her efforts include the appointment of one of the country's first heat czars; zoning and tax policies to encourage housing built up rather than out (downtown Phoenix is a forest of cranes); a multibillion-dollar investment in wastewater recycling; solar-powered shipping containers used as cooling centers and temporary housing on city lots; and a shade campaign of trees, canopies, and public art on heavily walked streets.<br/>But the homeless population of metro Phoenix <url normalizedValue=\"https://azmag.gov/Portals/0/Homelessness/PIT-Count/2023/2023-PIT-Count-Report-Final.pdf?ver=8CRzv7xw28C-V2G0sMdKfw%3D%3D\">has nearly doubled in the past six years</url> amid a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/local/phoenix/2024/01/02/housing-phoenix-expensive-chart-inventory\">housing shortage</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://azmag.gov/Programs/Maps-and-Data/Land-Use-and-Housing/Housing-Data-Explorer\">soaring rents</url>, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2024/01/15/phoenix-area-housing-nimby-not-in-my-backyard-opposition-apartments/70171279007/\">NIMBYism</url>; multifamily affordable housing remain dirty words in most Valley neighborhoods. Nor is there much a mayor can do about the rising heat. A <url normalizedValue=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.2c09588#\">scientific study published in May 2023</url> projected that a blackout during a five-day heat wave would kill nearly 1 percent of Phoenix's population-about 13,000 people-and send 800,000 to emergency rooms.<br/>Near the airport, on the treeless streets south of Jefferson and north of Grant, there was a no-man's-land around the lonely tracks of the Union Pacific Railroad, with scrap metal and lumber yards, stacks of pallets, a food pantry, abandoned wheelchairs, tombstones scattered across a dirt cemetery, and the tents and tarps and belongings and trash of the homeless. I began to think of this area, in the dead center of the Valley, as the heat zone. It felt hotter than anywhere else, not just because of the pavement and lack of shade, but because this was where people who couldn't escape the furnace came. Most were Latino or Black, many were past middle age, and they came to be near a gated 13-acre compound that offered meals, medical and dental care, information about housing, a postal address, and 900 beds for single adults.<br/>Last summer, the homeless encampment outside the compound stretched for several desolate blocks-the kind of improvised shantytown I've seen in Manila and Lagos but not in the United States, and not when the temperature was 111 degrees. One day in August, with every bed inside the compound taken, 563 people in varying states of consciousness were living outside. I couldn't understand what kept them from dying.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/heat-dome-southwest-arizona/674689/?utm_source=feed\">Read: When will the Southwest become unlivable?</url>]<br/>Mary Gilbert Todd, in her early 60s, from Charleston, South Carolina, had a cot inside Respiro, a large pavilion where men slept on one side, women on the other. Before that she'd spent four years on the streets of Phoenix. Her face was sunburned, her upper teeth were missing, and she used a walker, but her eyes gleamed bright blue with energy.<br/>\"If you put a wet shirt on and wet your hair, it's gonna be cool,\" she told me cheerfully, poking with a fork at a cup of ramen. \"In the daytime, you don't wanna walk. It's better, when you're homeless, to find a nice, shady tree and build yourself a black tent that you can sleep in where there's some breeze. The black, it may absorb more heat on the outside, but it's going to provide more shade. Here you got the dry heat. You want to have an opening so wind can go through-something that the police aren't going to notice too much. Because if you're in a regular tent, they're gonna come bust you, and if you're sitting out in the open, they're gonna come mess with you.\" She said that she'd been busted for \"urban camping\" 600 times.<br/>My guide around the compound was Amy Schwabenlender, who directs it with the wry, low-key indignation of a woman working every day in the trenches of a crisis that the country appears readier to complain about than solve. \"It's America-we don't have to have homelessness,\" she said. \"We allow homelessness to happen. We-the big we.\" The neighbors-a casket maker, an electric-parts supplier, the owners of a few decaying houses-blamed Schwabenlender for bringing the problem to their streets, as if she were the root cause of homelessness. In the face of a lawsuit, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/08/us/phoenix-homeless-encampment-the-zone/index.html\">the city was clearing the encampment</url>.<br/>Schwabenlender had come to the Valley to get away from depressing Wisconsin winters. After her first night in a motel in Tempe, she went out to her car and found the window heat-glued to the door by its rubber seal. \"What did I just do to myself?\" she wondered. Now she lives in North Phoenix in a house with a yard and a pool, but she has seen enough misery to be a growth dissident.<br/>\"I <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/08/phoenix-record-excessive-heat-wave-streak/674924/?utm_source=feed\">don't know why people want to live here</url>,\" she said, smiling faintly, her pallor set off by thick black hair. \"We can't have enough housing infrastructure for everyone who wants to live here. So why are we celebrating and encouraging more business? Why are we giving large corporations tax breaks to move here? How can we encourage people to come here when we don't have enough housing for the people who are here, and we don't have enough water? It doesn't add up to me.\"<br/>While we were talking, a woman with a gray crew cut who was missing her left leg below the thigh rolled up to Schwabenlender in a wheelchair. She had just been released after a long prison term and had heard something that made her think she'd get a housing voucher by the end of the month.<br/>Schwabenlender gave an experienced sigh. \"There's a waitlist of 4,000,\" she told the woman.<br/>On my way out of Respiro, I chatted with a staff member named Tanish Bates. I mentioned the woman I'd seen lying on the sidewalk by the bus shelter in the heat of the day-she had seemed beyond anyone's reach. \"Why didn't you talk to her?\" Bates asked. \"For me, it's a natural instinct-I'm going to try. You ask them, ~What's going on? What do you need? Do you need water? Should I call the fire department?' Nothing beats failure but a try.\" She gave me an encouraging pat. \"Next time, ask yourself what you would want.\"<br/>Utterly shamed, I walked out into the heat zone. By the compound's gate, a security guard stood gazing at the sky. A few lonely raindrops had begun to fall. \"I been praying for rain,\" she said. \"I am so tired of looking at the sun.\" People were lining up to spend an hour or two in a city cooling bus parked at the curb. Farther down Madison Street, the tents ended and street signs announced: THIS AREA IS CLOSED TO CAMPING TO ABATE A PUBLIC NUISANCE.<br/>Every time I returned to Phoenix, I found fewer tents around the compound. The city was clearing the encampment block by block. In December, only a few stragglers remained outside the gate-the hardest cases, fading out on fentanyl or alert enough to get into fights. \"They keep coming back,\" said a skinny, shirtless young man named Brandon Bisson. \"They're like wild animals. They'll keep coming back to where the food and resources are.\" Homeless for a year, he was watering a pair of healthy red bougainvillea vines in front of a rotting house where he'd been given a room with his dog in exchange for labor. Bisson wanted a job working with animals.<br/>\"There's no news story anymore,\" Schwabenlender said as she greeted me in her office. The city had opened a campground where 15th Avenue met the railroad tracks, with shipping containers and tents behind screened fencing, and 41 people were now staying there. Others had been placed in hotels. But it was hard to keep tabs on where they ended up, and some people were still out on the street, in parks, in cars, under highway overpasses. \"How do we keep the sense of urgency?\" Schwabenlender murmured in her quizzical way, almost as if she were speaking to herself. \"We didn't end homelessness.\" The housing waitlist for Maricopa County stood at 7,503. The heat was over for now.<br/>3. Democracy and Water<br/>Civilization in the Valley depends on solving the problem of water, but because this has to be done collectively, solving the problem of water depends on solving the problem of democracy. My visits left me with reasons to believe that human ingenuity is equal to the first task: dams, canals, wastewater recycling, underground storage, desalination, artificial intelligence. But I found at least as many reasons to doubt that we are equal to the second.<br/>It's easy to believe that the Valley could double its population when you're flying in a helicopter over the dams of the Salt River Project, the public utility whose lakes hold more than 2 million acre-feet-650 trillion gallons-of water; and when Mayor Gallego is describing Phoenix's multibillion-dollar plan to recycle huge quantities of wastewater; and when Stephen Roe Lewis, the leader of the Gila River Indian Community, is walking through a recharged wetland that not long ago had been barren desert, pointing out the indigenous willows and cattails whose fibers are woven into traditional bracelets like the one around his wrist.<br/>But when you see that nothing is left of the mighty Colorado River as it approaches the Mexican border but dirt and scrub; and when you drive by a road sign south of the Valley that says EARTH FISSURES POSSIBLE because the water table is dropping four feet a year; and when sprinklers are watering someone's lawn in Scottsdale in the rain-then the prophet's vision feels a little closer.<br/>American sprawl across the land of the disappeared Hohokam looks flimsy and flat and monotonous amid the desert's sublime Cretaceous humps. But sprawl is also the sight of ordinary people reaching for freedom in 2,000 square feet on a quarter acre. Growth is an orthodox faith in the Valley, as if the only alternative is slow death.<br/>Once, I was driving through the desert of far-northern Phoenix with Dave Roberts, the retired head of water policy for the Salt River Project. The highway passed a concrete fortress rising in the distance, a giant construction site with a dozen cranes grasping the sky. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's three plants would employ 6,000 people; they would also consume billions of gallons of Phoenix's water every year. Roberts filled in the empty space around the site: \"All this desert land will be apartments, homes, golf courses, and who knows what-Costcos. There's going to be malls out here. Gobs of people.\" As long as people in places like Louisiana and Mississippi wanted to seek a better life in the Valley, who was he to tell them to stay away? A better life was the whole point of growth.<br/>I asked Roberts, an intensely practical man, if he ever experienced apocalyptic visions of a dried-up Valley vanishing.<br/>\"We have three things that the Hohokam didn't,\" he said-pumping, storage (behind dams and underground), and recycling. When I mentioned this to Rusty Bowers, I couldn't remember the third thing, and he interjected: \"Prayer.\" I offered that the Hohokam had probably been praying for water too. \"I bet they were,\" Bowers said. \"And the Lord says, ~Okay. I could go Bing! But that's not how I work. Go out there and work, and we'll figure this thing out together.'S\"<br/>This famously libertarian place has a history of collective action on water. Thanks to the bipartisan efforts of the 20th century-the federal dams built in the early 1900s; the 330-mile canal that brought Colorado River water to the Valley in the late 20th century; a 1980 law regulating development in Arizona's metro regions so they'd conserve groundwater, which cannot be replaced-Phoenix has a lot of water. But two things have happened in this century: a once-in-a-millennium drought set in, and the political will to act collectively dried up. \"The legislature has become more and more partisan,\" Kathleen Ferris, an architect of the 1980 law, told me. \"And there's a whole lot of denial.\"<br/>At some point, the civilization here stopped figuring this thing out together. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.azwater.gov/sites/default/files/media/Arizona%20Groundwater_Code_1.pdf\">1980 groundwater law</url>, which required builders in regulated metro areas like the Valley to ensure a 100-year supply, left groundwater unregulated in small developments and across rural Arizona. In the mid-1990s, the legislature cut loopholes into the 100-year requirement. The God-given right to pursue happiness and wealth pushed housing farther out into the desert, beyond the reach of the Valley's municipal water systems, onto groundwater. In the unregulated rural hinterland, megafarms of out-of-state and foreign agribusinesses began to pump enormous quantities of groundwater. The water table around the state was sinking, and the Colorado River was drying up.<br/>Ferris imagined a grim future. Without new regulation, she said, \"we will have land subsidence, roads cracking, destroying infrastructure, and in some cases people's taps going dry.\" The crisis wouldn't hit the water-rich Phoenix metroplex first. \"It's going to be on the fringes, and all the people who allowed themselves to grow there are going to be really unhappy when they find out there's no water.\"<br/>Most people in the Valley come from somewhere else, and John Hornewer came from Chicago. One summer in the early 1990s, when he was about 25, he went for a hike in the Hellsgate Wilderness, 75 miles northeast of Phoenix, and got lost. He ran out of water and couldn't find a stream. When he grew too weak to carry his backpack, he abandoned it. His eyes began to throb; every muscle hurt; even breathing hurt. He sank to his knees, his face hit the ground, and as the flies buzzed around he thought: Just stop my heart. He was saved by campers, who found him and drove him the 20 miles he'd wandered from his car.<br/>Almost dying from dehydration changed Hornewer's life. \"I take water very seriously,\" he told me. \"I'm passionate about water.\"<br/>In the late '90s, Hornewer and his wife bought two and a half acres several miles up a dirt road in Rio Verde Foothills, a small community on the northeastern edge of the Valley. To the southwest, the city of Scottsdale ends and unincorporated Maricopa County starts where the golf courses give way to mesquite and the paved roads turn to dirt. Over the years, the desert around the Hornewers was filled in by people who wanted space and quiet and couldn't afford Scottsdale.<br/>Seeing a need, Hornewer started a business hauling potable water, filling his 6,000-gallon trucks with metered water at a Scottsdale standpipe and selling it to people in Rio Verde with dry wells or none at all. What kept Rio Verde cheaper than Scottsdale was the lack of an assured water supply. Wildcat builders, exploiting a gap in the 1980 law, didn't tell buyers there wasn't one, or the buyers didn't ask. Meanwhile, the water table under Rio Verde was dropping. One of Hornewer's neighbors hit water at 450 feet; another neighbor 150 feet away spent $60,000 on a 1,000-foot well that came up dry.<br/>Hornewer wears his gray hair shoulder-length and has the face of a man trying to keep his inherent good nature from reaching its limit. In the past few years, he began to warn his Rio Verde customers that Scottsdale's water would not always be there for them, because it came to Scottsdale by canal from the diminishing Colorado River. \"We got rain a couple of weeks ago-everything's good!\" his customers would say, not wanting to admit that climate change was causing a drought. He urged the community to form a water district-a local government entity that would allow Rio Verde to bring in water from a basin west of the Valley. The idea was killed by a county supervisor who <url normalizedValue=\"https://theintercept.com/2022/11/28/maricopa-supervisors-saudi-lobbyist-thomas-galvin/\">had done legal work for a giant Saudi farm</url> that grew alfalfa on leased state land, and who <url normalizedValue=\"https://kjzz.org/content/1864357/arizona-corporation-commission-approves-long-term-water-solution-rio-verde\">pushed for EPCOR</url>, the private Canadian utility, to service Rio Verde. The county kept issuing building permits, and the wildcatters kept putting up houses where there was no water. When the mayor of Scottsdale announced that, as of January 1, 2023, his city would stop selling its water to Rio Verde, Hornewer wasn't surprised.<br/>Suddenly, he had to drive five hours round trip to fill his trucks in Apache Junction, 50 miles away. The price of hauled water went from four cents a gallon to 11-the most expensive water anywhere in the country. Rio Verde fell into an uproar. The haves with wet wells were pitted against the have-nots with hauled water. Residents tried to sell and get out; town meetings became shouting matches with physical threats; Nextdoor turned septic. As soon as water was scarce, disinformation flowed.<br/>In the middle of it all, Hornewer tried to explain to his customers why his prices had basically tripled. Some of them accused him of trying to get their wells capped and enrich his business. He became so discouraged that he thought of getting out of hauling water.<br/>\"I don't have to argue with people anymore about whether we're in a drought-they got that figured out,\" he told me. \"It would be nice if people could think ahead that they're going to get hit on the head with a brick before it hits you on the head. After what I saw, I think the wars have just begun, to be honest with you. You'd think water would be unifying, but it's not. Whiskey is for drinking; water is for fighting.\"<br/>One of Hornewer's customers is a retiree from Buffalo named Rosemary Carroll, who moved to Rio Verde in 2020 to rescue donkeys. The animals arrived abused and broken at the small ranch where she lived by herself, and she calmed them by reading to them, getting them used to the sound of her voice, then nursed them back to health until she could find them a good home. Unfairly maligned as dumb beasts of burden, donkeys are thoughtful, affectionate animals-Carroll called them \"equine dogs.\"<br/>After Scottsdale cut off Rio Verde on the first day of 2023, she repaired her defunct well, but she and her two dozen donkeys still relied on Hornewer's hauled water. To keep her use down in the brutal heat, she took one quick shower a week, bought more clothes at Goodwill rather than wash clothes she owned, left barrels under her scuppers to catch any rainwater, and put double-lock valves, timers, and alarms on her hoses. Seeing water dripping out of a hose into the dirt filled her with despair. In the mornings, she rode around the ranch with a pail of water in a wagon pulled by a donkey and refilled the dishes she'd left out for rabbits and quail. Carroll tried to avoid the ugly politics of Rio Verde's water. She just wanted to keep her donkeys alive, though an aged one died from heat.<br/>And all summer long, she heard the sound of hammering. \"The people keep coming, the buildings keep coming, and there's no long-term solution,\" Carroll told me, taking a break in the shade of her toolshed.<br/>Sometimes on very hot days when she was shoveling donkey manure, Carroll gazed out over her ranch and her neighbors' rooftops toward the soft brown hills and imagined some future civilization coming upon this place, finding the remains of stucco walls, puzzling over the metal fragments of solar panels, wondering what happened to the people who once lived here.<br/>\"If we thought Rio Verde was a big problem,\" Kathleen Ferris said, \"imagine if you have a city of 100,000 homes.\"<br/>An hour's drive west from Phoenix on I-10, past truck stops and the massive skeletons of future warehouses, you reach Buckeye. In 2000, 6,500 people lived in what was then a farm town with one gas station. Now it's 114,000, and by 2040 it's expected to reach 300,000. The city's much-publicized goal, for which I never heard a convincing rationale, is to pass 1 million residents and become \"the next Phoenix.\" To accommodate them all, Buckeye has annexed its way to 642 square miles-more land than the original Phoenix.<br/>In the office of Mayor Eric Orsborn, propped up in a corner, is a gold-plated shovel with TERAVALIS on the handle. Teravalis, billed as the \"City of the Future,\" is the Howard Hughes Corporation's planned community of 100,000 houses. Its several hundred thousand residents would put Buckeye well on its way to 1 million.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/moving-south-sun-belt-housing-economy/675010/?utm_source=feed\">Olga Khazan: Why people won't stop moving to the Sun Belt</url>]<br/>I set out to find Teravalis. I drove from the town center north of the interstate on Sun Valley Parkway, with the White Tank Mountains to the right and raw desert all around. I was still in Buckeye-this was recently annexed land-but there was nothing here except road signs with no roads, a few tumbledown dwellings belonging to ranch hands, and one lonely steer. Mile after mile went by, until I began to think I'd made a mistake. Then, on the left side of the highway, I spotted a small billboard planted in a field of graded dirt beside a clump of saguaros and mesquite that seemed to have been installed for aesthetic purposes. This was Teravalis.<br/>Some subdivisions in the Valley are so well designed and built-there's one in Buckeye called Verrado-they seem to have grown up naturally over time like a small town; others roll on in an endless sea of red-tile sameness that can bring on nausea. But when I saw the acres of empty desert that would become the City of the Future, I didn't know whether to be inspired by the developer's imagination or appalled by his madness, like Fitzcarraldo hauling a ship over the Andes, or Howard Hughes himself beset by some demented vision that the open spaces of the New World arouse in willful men bent on conquest. And <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/southwest-valley/2023/10/22/buckeyes-teravalis-in-legal-battle-with-state-water-department/71085070007/\">Teravalis has almost no water</url>.<br/>In her first State of the State address last year as Arizona's governor after narrowly defeating Kari Lake, Katie Hobbs revealed that her predecessor, Doug Ducey, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-environment/2023/01/11/developers-must-find-new-water-for-homes-planned-west-of-phoenix/69796936007/\">had buried a study</url> showing that parts of the Valley, including Buckeye, had fallen short of the required 100-year supply of groundwater. Because of growth, all the supply had been allocated; there was none left to spare. In June 2023, Hobbs announced <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-environment/2023/06/01/new-arizona-groundwater-model-shows-shortfall-state-will-halt-growth/70279189007/\">a moratorium on new subdivisions that depended on groundwater</url>.<br/>The national media declared that Phoenix had run dry, that the Valley's fantastic growth was over. This wasn't true but, as Ferris warned, the edge communities that had grown on the cheap by pumping groundwater would need to find other sources. Only 5,000 of Teravalis's planned units had received certificates of assured water supply. The moratorium halted the other 95,000, and it wasn't obvious where Teravalis and Buckeye would find new water. Sarah Porter, who directs a water think tank at Arizona State, once gave a talk to a West Valley community group that included Buckeye's Mayor Orsborn. She calculated how much water it would take for his city to be the next Phoenix: nearly 100 billion gallons every year. Her audience did not seem to take in what she was saying.<br/>Orsborn, who also owns a construction company, is an irrepressible booster of the next Phoenix. He described to me the plans for finding more water to keep Buckeye growing. Farmland in the brackish south of town could be retired for housing. Water from a basin west of the Valley could be piped to much of Buckeye, and to Teravalis. Buckeye could negotiate for recycled wastewater and other sources from Phoenix. (The two cities have been haggling over water in and out of court for almost a century, with Phoenix in the superior position; another water dictum says, \"Better upstream with a shovel than downstream with a lawyer.\") And there was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/19/arizona-mexico-water-pipeline-housing-boom\">radical idea of bringing desalinated water</url> up from the Gulf of California through Mexico. All of it would cost a lot of money.<br/>\"What we've tried to do is say, ~Don't panic,'S\" the mayor told me. \"We have water, and we have a plan for more water.\"<br/>At certain moments in the Valley, and this was one, ingenuity took the sound and shape of an elaborate defense against the truth.<br/>When Kari Lake ran for governor in 2022, everyone knew her position on transgenderism and no one knew her position on water, because she barely had one. The subject didn't turn out voters or decide elections; it was too boring and complicated to excite extremists. Water was more parochial than partisan. It could pit an older city with earlier rights against the growing needs of a newer one, or a corporate megafarm against a nearby homesteader, or Native Americans downstream against Mormon farmers upstream. Stephen Roe Lewis, the leader of the Gila River Indian Community, described years of court battles and federal legislation that finally restored his tribe's water rights, which were stolen 150 years ago. The community, desperately poor in other ways, had grown rich enough in water that nearby cities and developments were lining up to buy it.<br/>As long as these fights took place in the old, relatively sane world of corrupt politicians, rapacious corporations, overpaid lawyers, and shortsighted homeowners, solutions would usually be possible. But if, like almost everything else in American politics, water turned deeply partisan and ideological, contaminated by conspiracy theories and poisoned with memes, then preserving this drought-stricken civilization would get a lot harder, like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube while fending off a swarm of wasps that you might be hallucinating.<br/>4. Sunshine Patriots<br/>They descended the escalators of the Phoenix Convention Center under giant signs-SAVE AMERICA, BIG GOV SUCKS, PARTY LIKE IT'S 1776-past tables explaining the 9/11 conspiracy and the Catholic Church conspiracy and the rigged-election conspiracy; tables advertising conservative colleges, America's Leading Non-Woke Job Board, an anti-abortion ultrasound charity called PreBorn!, a $3,000 vibration plate for back pain, and the One and Only Patriot Owned Infrared Roasted Coffee Company, into the main hall, where music was throbbing, revving up the house for the start of the largest multiday right-wing jamboree in American history.<br/>In the undersea-blue light, I found an empty chair next to a pair of friendly college boys with neat blond haircuts. John was studying in North Carolina for a future in corporate law; Josh was at Auburn, in Alabama, about to join the Marines. \"We came all the way here to take back the country,\" John said. From what or whom? He eagerly ticked off the answers: from the New York lady crook who was suing Donald Trump; from the inside-job cops who lured the J6 patriots into the Capitol; from the two-tier justice system, the corrupt Biden family, illegal immigrants, the deep state.<br/>The students weren't repelled by the media badge hanging from my neck-it seemed to impress them. But within 90 seconds, the knowledge that these youths and I inhabited unbridgeable realms of truth plunged me into a surprising sadness. One level below, boredom waited-the deepest mood of American politics, disabling, nihilistic, more destructive than rage, the final response to an impasse that resists every effort of reason.<br/>I turned to the stage. Flames and smoke and roving searchlights were announcing the master of ceremonies.<br/>\"Welcome to AmericaFest, everybody. It's great to be here in Phoenix, Arizona, it's just great.\"<br/>Charlie Kirk-lanky in a patriotic blue suit and red tie, stiff-haired, square-faced, hooded-eyed-is the 30-year-old founder of Turning Point USA, the lucrative right-wing youth organization. In 2018, it moved its headquarters to the Valley, where Kirk lives in <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/election-2024-trump-turning-point-maga-d08a98e439fa4e902cb756d7e35153db\">a $4.8 million estate</url> on the grounds of a gated country club whose price of entry starts at $500,000. In December, 14,000 young people from all 50 states as well as 14 other countries converged on Phoenix for Turning Point's annual convention, where Kirk welcomed them to a celebration of America. Then his mouth tightened and he got to the point.<br/>\"We're living through a top-down revolution, everybody. We're living through a revolution that's different than most others. It is a cultural revolution, similar to Mao's China. But this revolution is when the powerful, the rich, the wealthy decide to use their power and their wealth to go after you. Instead of building hospitals and improving our country, they are spending their money to destroy the greatest country ever to exist in the history of the world.\"<br/>Kirk started Turning Point in 2012, when he was 18 years old, and through tireless organizing and demagogy he built an 1,800-chapter, 600,000-student operation that brings in $80 million a year, much of it in funding from ultrarich conservatives.<br/>\"The psychology is that of civilizational suicide. The country has never lived through the wealthiest hating the country. What makes this movement different is that you are here as a grassroots response to the top-down revolution happening in this country.\"<br/>When the young leader of the grassroots counterrevolution visited college campuses to recruit for Turning Point and record himself baiting progressive students, Kirk sometimes wore a T-shirt that said THE GOVERNMENT IS LYING TO YOU, like Mario Savio and Jerry Rubin 60 years ago, demonstrating the eternal and bipartisan appeal for the young of paranoid grievance. His business model was generational outrage. He stoked anger the way Big Ag pumped groundwater.<br/>\"This is a bottom-up resistance, and it terrifies the ruling class.\" Kirk was waving a finger at the students in the hall. \"Will the people, who are the sovereign in this country, do everything they possibly can with this incredible blessing given to us by God to fight back and win against the elites that want to ruin it?\" Elites invite 12,000 people to cross a wide-open border every day; they castrate children in the name of medicine; they try to put the opposition leader in jail for 700 years. \"They hate the United States Constitution. They hate the Declaration.\"<br/>The energy rose with each grievance and insult. Kirk's targets included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (\"that go-go dancer\"); LinkedIn's co-founder, Reid Hoffman; Laurene Powell Jobs, the majority owner of this magazine; Senator Mitt Romney; satanists; \"weak beta males\" on campus; and even the Turning Pointers who had come to the convention from Mexico and Honduras (\"I'm told these people are here legally\"). Kirk is an accomplished speaker, and his words slide out fluidly on the grease of glib hostility and grinning mockery. But standing inside the swirl of cross-and-flag hatreds\u00ef\u00bf whipped up by speeches and posts and viral videos is a 6-foot-4 son of the Chicago suburbs with a smile that exposes his upper gums and the smooth face of a go-getter who made it big and married a beauty queen-as if the hatred might just be an artifice, digitally simulated.<br/>\"Elon Musk liberating Twitter will go down as one of the greatest free-speech victories in the history of Western civilization,\" Kirk said. \"We can say that ~January 6 is probably an inside job; it's more of a fed-surrection than anything else.' And that ~99 percent of people on January 6 did nothing wrong.' That we can go on Twitter and say, ~George Floyd wasn't a hero, and Derek Chauvin was targeted in a Soviet-style trial that was anti-American and un-American.' One of the reasons why the powerful are getting nervous is because we can finally speak again online.\"<br/>The other good news was that American high-school boys were <url normalizedValue=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/4125661-high-school-boys-are-trending-conservative/\">more conservative than they'd been in 50 years</url>-Turning Point's mass production of memes had given a sense of purpose to a generation of males known for loneliness and suicidality. Kirk is obsessed with their testosterone levels and their emasculation by elites who \"want a guy with a lisp zipping around on a Lime scooter with a fanny pack, carrying his birth control, supporting his wife's career while he works as a supportive stay-at-home house husband. He has a playlist that is exclusively Taylor Swift. And their idea of strength is this beta male's girlfriend opening a pickle jar just for him.\"<br/>Kirk erected an index finger.<br/>\"At Turning Point USA, we resoundingly reject this. We believe strong, alpha, godly, high'T, high-achieving, confident, well-armed, and disruptive men are the hope, not the problem, in America.\"<br/>The picture of the American experiment grew grimmer when Kirk was followed onstage by Roseanne Barr. She was dressed all in beige, with a baseball cap and a heavy skirt pleated like the folds of a motel-room curtain, chewing something in her hollowed cheeks.<br/>She could not make sense of her laptop and shut it. \"What do you want to talk about?\"<br/>Without a speech, Barr sank into a pool of self-pity for her canceled career, which reminded her of a quote by Patrick Henry, except the words were on her laptop and all she could remember was \"the summer soldier,\" until her son, in the front row, handed her a phone with the quote and told her that it was by Thomas Paine.<br/>\"I'm just all in for President Trump, I just want to say that. I'm just all in  'cause I know if I ain't all in, they're going to put my ass in a Gulag,\" Barr said. \"If we don't stop these horrible, Communist-do you hear me? I'm asking you to hear me!\" She began screaming: \"STALINISTS-COMMUNISTS-WITH A HUGE HELPING OF NAZI FASCISTS THROWN IN, PLUS WANTIN' A CALIPHATE TO REPLACE EVERY CHRISTIAN DEMOCRACY ON EARTH NOW OCCUPIED. DO YOU KNOW THAT? I JUST WANT THE TRUTH! WE DESERVE TO HEAR THE TRUTH, THAT'S WHAT WE WANT, WE WANT THE TRUTH, WE DON'T CARE WHICH PARTY IS WRONG, WE KNOW THEY'RE BOTH NOTHIN' BUT CRAP, THEY'RE BOTH ON THE TAKE, THEY'RE BOTH STEALIN' US BLIND. WE JUST WANT THE TRUTH ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT WE FOUGHT AND DIED AND SUFFERED TO PROTECT!\"<br/>The college boys exchanged a look and laughed. The hall grew confused and its focus began to drift, so Barr screamed louder. This was the pattern during the four days of AmericaFest, with Glenn Beck, Senator Ted Cruz, Vivek Ramaswamy, Kari Lake, Tucker Carlson, and every other far-right celebrity except Donald Trump himself: A speaker would sense boredom threatening the hall and administer a jolt of danger and defilement and the enemy within. The atmosphere recalled the politics of resentment going back decades, to the John Birch Society, Phyllis Schlafly, and Barry Goldwater. The difference at AmericaFest was that this politics has placed an entire party in thrall to a leader who was once the country's president and may be again.<br/>I wanted to get out of the hall, and I went looking for someone to talk with among the tables and booths. A colorful flag announced THE LIONS OF LIBERTY, and beside it sat two men who, with their round shiny heads and red 19th-century beards and immense girth, were clearly brothers: Luke and Nick Cilano, who told me they were co-pastors of a church in central Arizona. I did not yet know that the Lions of Liberty were linked to the Oath Keepers and had helped organize an operation that sent armed observers with phone cameras to monitor county drop boxes during the 2022 midterm election. But I didn't want to talk with the Lions of Liberty about voter fraud, or border security, or trans kids, because I already knew what they would say. I wanted to talk about water.<br/>No one at AmericaFest ever mentioned water. Discussing it would be either bad for Turning Point (possibly leading to a solution) or bad for water policy (making it another front in the culture wars). But the Cilano brothers, who live on five acres in a rural county where the aquifer is dropping, had a lot to say about it.<br/>\"The issue is, our elected officials are not protecting us from these huge corporations that are coming in that want to suck the groundwater dry,\" Nick said. \"That's what the actual issue is.\"<br/>\"The narrative is, we don't have enough water,\" Luke, who had the longer beard by three or four inches, added. \"That's false. The correct narrative is, we have enough water, but our elected officials are letting corporations come in and waste the water that we have.\"<br/>This wasn't totally at odds with what experts such as Sarah Porter and Kathleen Ferris had told me. The Cilano brothers said they'd be willing to have the state come in and regulate rural groundwater, as long as the rules applied to everyone-farmers, corporations, developers, homeowners-and required solar panels and wind turbines to offset the energy used in pumping.<br/>\"This is a humanity issue,\" Luke said. \"This should not be a party-line issue. This should be the same on both sides. The only way that this becomes a red-blue issue is if either the red side or the blue side is legislating in their pocket more than the other.\" And unfortunately, he added, on the issue of water, those legislators were mostly Republicans.<br/>As soon as a view of common ground with the Lions of Liberty opened up, it closed again when the discussion turned to election security. After withdrawing from Operation Drop Box in response to a lawsuit by a prodemocracy group, Nick had softened his opposition to mail-in voting, but he wanted mail ballots taken away from the U.S. Postal Service in 2024 and their delivery privatized. He couldn't get over the sense that 2020 and 2022 must have been rigged-the numbers were just too perfect.<br/>Before depression could set in, I left the convention center and walked out into the cooling streets of a Phoenix night.<br/>The Arizona Republican Party is more radical than any other state's. The chief qualification for viability is an embarrassingly discredited belief in rigged elections. In December 2020, Charlie Kirk's No. 2, Tyler Bowyer, and another figure linked to Turning Point <url normalizedValue=\"https://azmirror.com/2022/02/01/trumps-fake-electors-heres-the-full-list/\">signed on to be fake Trump electors</url>, and on January 6, several Arizona legislators marched on the U.S. Capitol. In the spring of 2021, the state Senate hired a pro-Trump Florida firm called Cyber Ninjas to \"audit\" Maricopa County's presidential ballots with a slipshod hand recount intended to show massive fraud. (Despite Republicans' best efforts, the Ninjas <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/cyber-ninjas-company-led-arizona-gop-election-audit-shutting-down-n1287145\">increased Joe Biden's margin of victory by 360 votes</url>.) After helping to push Rusty Bowers out of politics, Bowyer and others orchestrated a MAGA party takeover, out-organizing and intimidating the establishment and enlisting an army of precinct-committee members to support the most extreme Republican candidates.<br/>In 2022, the party nominated three strident election deniers for governor, attorney general, and secretary of state. After all three lost, Kari Lake repeatedly accused election officials of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2022/10/kari-lake-arizona-governor-trump-2022-election/671679/?utm_source=feed\">cheating her out of the governorship</url>, driving Stephen Richer, the Maricopa County recorder, to sue her successfully for defamation. This past January, just before the party's annual meeting, Lake <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/us/politics/kari-lake-arizona-gop.html\">released a secret recording</url> she'd made of the party chair appearing to offer her a bribe to keep her from running for the U.S. Senate. When she hinted at more damaging revelations to come, the chair, Jeff DeWit, quit, admitting, \"I have decided not to take the risk.\" His successor was chosen at a raucous meeting where Lake was booed. Everyone involved-Lake, DeWit, the contenders to replace him, the chair he'd replaced-was a Trump loyalist, ideologically pure. The party bloodletting was the kind of purge that occurs in authoritarian regimes where people have nothing to fight over but power.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2022/10/kari-lake-arizona-governor-trump-2022-election/671679/?utm_source=feed\">Read: In Kari Lake, Trumpism has found its leading lady</url>]<br/>In April Arizona's attorney general <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/arizona-fake-electors-charges-2020-election-9da5a7e58814ed55ceea1ca55401af85\">indicted 11 fake Trump electors</url> from 2020, including two state senators, several leaders of the state Republican Party, and Tyler Bowyer of Turning Point, as well as Giuliani and six other Trump advisers. The current session of the legislature is awash in Republican bills to change election procedures; one would simply put the result of the state's presidential vote in the hands of the majority party. I asked Analise Ortiz, a Democratic state representative, if she trusted the legislature's Republican leaders to respect the will of the voters in November. She thought about it for 10 seconds. \"I can't give you a clear answer on that, and that worries me.\"<br/>Richer, the top election official in Maricopa County, is an expert on the extremism of his fellow Arizona Republicans. After taking office in 2021, he received numerous death threats-some to his face, several leading to criminal charges-and he stopped attending most party functions. Richer is up for reelection this year, and Turning Point-which is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/02/far-right-youth-group-turning-point-charlie-kirk\">trying to raise more than $100 million to mobilize the MAGA vote</url> in Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin-is coming after him.<br/>Election denial is now \"a cottage industry, so there are people who have a pecuniary interest in making sure this never really dies out,\" Richer told me drily. \"Some of these organizations, I'm not even sure it's necessarily in their interest to be winning. You look at something like a Turning Point USA-I'm not sure if they want to win. They certainly have been very good at not winning. When you are defined by your grievances, as so much of the party is now and as so much of this new populist-right movement is, then it's easier to be mad when you've lost.\"<br/>Richer listed several reasons MAGA is 100 proof in Arizona while its potency is weaker in states such as Georgia. One reason is the presence of Turning Point's headquarters in Phoenix. Another is the border. \"The border does weird things to people,\" he said. \"It contributes to the radicalization of individuals, because it impresses upon you the sense that your community is being stolen and changed.\" A University of Chicago study showed that January 6 insurrectionists came disproportionately from areas undergoing rapid change in racial demographics. And, Richer reminded me, Phoenix \"contributed the mascot.\"<br/>Jacob Chansley, the QAnon Shaman, sat waiting at a table outside a Chipotle in a northwest-Phoenix shopping mall. He was wearing a black T-shirt, workout shorts, and a ski hat roughly embroidered with an American flag. Perhaps it was the banal setting, but even with his goat's beard and tattoos from biceps to fingernails, he was unrecognizable as the horned and furred invader of the Capitol. For a second, he disappeared into that chasm between the on-screen performance and the ordinary reality of American life.<br/>The Shaman was running as a Libertarian in Arizona's red Eighth Congressional District for an open seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. \"Can you imagine the kind of statement it would send to the uniparty in D.C. to send me back as a congressman?\" Chansley wouldn't be able to vote for himself-he was still on probation after serving more than two years in a federal prison. It was hard to tell to what extent his campaign actually existed. He was accepting no money from anyone, and when I asked how many signatures he'd collected for a petition to get on the ballot, he answered earnestly, \"Over a dozen.\" (He would ultimately fail to submit any at all.) That was how Chansley talked: with no irony about circumstances that others might find absurd. There was an insistent strain in his voice, as if he had spent his life trying to convince others of something urgent that he alone knew, with a stilted diction-\"politics and the government and the legislation therein has been used to forward, shall we say, a less than spiritual agenda\"-that seemed familiar to me.<br/>Why was he running for Congress? Unsurprisingly, because politicians of the uniparty were all in the pocket of special interests and international banks and did not represent the American people. His platform consisted of making lobbying a crime, instituting term limits for congresspeople and their staff, and prosecuting members engaged in insider trading. Meanwhile, Chansley was supporting himself by selling merch on his website, ForbiddenTruthAcademy.com, and doing shamanic consultations.<br/>Why had he gone to the Capitol in regalia on January 6? He had a spiritual answer and a political answer. The Earth's electromagnetic field produces ley lines, he explained, which crisscross one another at sacred sites of civilizational importance, such as temples, pyramids, and the buildings on the National Mall. \"If there's going to be a million people assembling on the ley lines in Washington, D.C., it's my shamanic duty, I believe, to be there and to ensure that the highest possible frequencies of love and peace and harmony are plugged into the ley lines.\" That was the spiritual answer.<br/>The political answer consisted of a long string of government abuses and cover-ups going back to the Tuskegee experiment, and continuing through the Warren Commission, Waco, Oklahoma City, 9/11, Iraq, Afghanistan, Hillary Clinton's emails, COVID and the lockdowns, Hunter Biden's laptop, and finally the stolen 2020 election. \"All of these things were like a culmination for me,\" he said, \"S'cause I have done my research, and I looked into the history. I know my history.\" Chansley's only regret about January 6 was not anticipating violence. \"I would have created an environment that was one of prayer and peace and calm and patience before anything else took place.\" That day, he was at the front of the mob that stormed the Capitol and broke into the Senate chamber, where he left a note on Vice President Mike Pence's desk that said, \"It's only a matter of time, justice is coming.\"<br/>As for the conspiracy theory about a global child-sex-trafficking ring involving high-level Democrats: \"Q was a successful psychological operation that disseminated the truth about corruption in our government.\"<br/>One leader had the Shaman's complete respect-Donald Trump, who sneered at globalists and their tyrannical organizations, and who, Chansley said with that strain of confident knowing in his voice, declassified three vital patents: \"a zero-point-energy engine, infinite free clean energy; a room-temperature superconductor that allows a zero-point-energy engine to function without overheating; and what's called a TR3B-it's a triangular-shaped antigravity or inertia-propulsion craft. And when you combine all these things together, you get a whole new socioeconomic-geopolitical system.\"<br/>When the Shaman got up to leave, I noticed that he walked slew-footed, sneakers turned outward, which surprised me because he was extremely fit, and I suddenly thought of a boy in my high school who made up for awkward unpopularity by using complex terms to explain forbidden truths that he alone knew and everyone else was too blind to see. Chansley was a teenage type. It took a national breakdown for him to become the world-famous symbol of an insurrection, spend two years in prison, and run for Congress.<br/>5. The Aspirationalist<br/>\"Can the American experiment succeed? It's not ~can'-it has to. That doesn't mean it will.\"<br/>Michael Crow, the president of Arizona State University, wore two watches and spoke quickly and unemotionally under arched eyebrows without smiling much. He was physically unimposing at 68, dressed in a gray blazer and blue shirt-so it was the steady stream of his words and confidence in his ideas that suggested why several people described him to me as the most powerful person in Arizona.<br/>\"I am definitely not a declinist. I'm an aspirationalist. That's why we call this the ~new American university.'S\"<br/>If you talk with Crow for 40 minutes, you'll probably hear the word innovative half a dozen times. For example, the \"new American university\"-he left Columbia University in 2002 to build it in wide-open Phoenix-is \"highly entrepreneurial, highly adaptive, high-speed, technologically innovative.\" Around the Valley, Arizona State has four campuses and seven \"innovation zones,\" with 145,000 students, almost half online; 25,000 Starbucks employees attend a free program to earn a degree that most of them started somewhere else but never finished. The college has seven STEM majors for every one in the humanities, graduating thousands of engineers every year for the Valley's new tech economy. It's the first university to form a partnership with OpenAI, spreading <url normalizedValue=\"https://news.asu.edu/20240229-arts-humanities-and-education-generative-ai-humanities-classroom\">the free use of chatbots into every corner of instruction</url>, including English. Last year, the law school invited applicants to use AI to help write their essays.<br/>Under Crow, Arizona State has become the kind of school where faculty members are encouraged to spin off their own companies. In 2015, a young materials-science professor named Cody Friesen founded one called Source, which manufactures hydropanels that use sunlight to pull pure drinking water from the air's moisture, with <url normalizedValue=\"https://data.unicef.org/topic/water-and-sanitation/drinking-water/\">potential benefits for the world's 2.2 billion people</url> who lack ready access to safe water, including those on the Navajo reservation in Arizona. \"If we could do for water what solar did for electricity, you could then think about water not as a resource underground or on the surface, but as a resource you can find anywhere,\" Friesen told me at the company's headquarters in the Scottsdale innovation zone.<br/>But the snake of technology swallows its own tail. Companies such as Intel that have made the Valley one of the largest job-producing regions in the country are developing technologies that will eventually put countless people, including engineers, out of work. Artificial intelligence can make water systems more efficient, but the data centers that power it, such as the new one Microsoft is building west of Phoenix in Goodyear, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/03/ai-water-climate-microsoft/677602/?utm_source=feed\">have to be cooled with enormous quantities of water</url>. Arizona State's sheer volume and speed of growth can make the \"new American university\" seem like the Amazon of higher education. Innovation alone is not enough to save the American experiment.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/03/ai-water-climate-microsoft/677602/?utm_source=feed\">Read: AI is taking water from the desert</url>]<br/>For Crow, new technology in higher education serves an older end. On his desk, he keeps a copy of the 1950 course catalog for UCLA. Back then, top public universities like UCLA had an egalitarian mission, admitting any California student with a B average or better. Today they compete to resemble elite private schools-instead of growing with the population, they've become more selective. Exclusivity increases their perceived value as well as their actual cost, and it worsens the heart-straining scramble of parents and children for a foothold in the higher strata of a grossly unequal society. \"We've built an elitist model,\" Crow said, \"a model built on exclusion as the measurement of success, and it's very, very destructive.\"<br/>This model creates the false idea that certain credentials are the only proof of a young person's worth, when plenty of capable students can't get into the top schools or don't bother trying. \"I'm saying, if you keep doing this-everyone has to be either Michigan or Berkeley, or Harvard or Stanford, or you're worthless-that's gonna wreck us. That's gonna wreck the country,\" Crow said, like a Mad Max film whose warring gangs are divided by political party and college degree. \"I can't get some of my friends to see that we, the academy, are fueling it-our sanctimony, our know-it-all-ism, our ~we're smarter than you, we're better than you, we're gonna help you.'S\"<br/>The windows of his office in Tempe look out across the street at a block of granite inscribed with <url normalizedValue=\"https://newamericanuniversity.asu.edu/about/asu-charter-mission-and-goals\">the words of a charter he wrote</url>: \"ASU is a comprehensive public research university, measured not by whom it excludes, but by whom it includes and how they succeed.\" Arizona State admits almost every applicant with at least a B average, which is why it's so large; what allows the university to educate them all is technology. Elite universities \"don't scale,\" Crow said. \"They're valuable, but not central to the United States' success. Central to the United States' success is broader access to educational outcomes.\"<br/>The same windows have a view of the old clay-colored Tempe Normal School, on whose steps Theodore Roosevelt once foresaw 100,000 people living here. Today the two most important institutions in the Valley are the Salt River Project and Arizona State. Both are public enterprises, peculiarly western in their openness to the future. The first makes it possible for large numbers of people to live here. The second is trying to make it possible for them to live together in a democracy.<br/>In 2016, the Republican majority in the Arizona legislature insisted on giving the university $3 million to start a School of Civic and Economic Thought and Leadership. SCETL <url normalizedValue=\"https://news.asu.edu/content/new-asu-center-engage-community-politics-leadership\">absorbed two earlier \"freedom schools\"</url> dedicated to libertarian economics and <url normalizedValue=\"https://charleskochfoundation.org/news/2842/\">funded in part</url> by the Charles Koch Foundation. The new school is one innovation at Arizona State that looks backwards-to the founding principles and documents of the republic, and the classical philosophers who influenced them. Republican legislators believed they were buying a conservative counterweight to progressive campus ideology. Faculty members resisted this partisan intrusion on academic independence, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2018/04/22/professor-a-disturbing-story-about-the-influence-of-the-koch-network-in-higher-education/\">one left Arizona State in protest</url>. But Crow was happy to take the state's money, and he hired a political-science professor from the Air Force Academy named Paul Carrese to lead the school. Carrese described himself to me as \"an intellectual conservative, not a movement conservative,\" meaning \"America is a good thing-and now let's argue about it.\"<br/>I approached SCETL with some wariness. Koch-funded libertarian economics don't inspire my trust, and I wondered if this successor program was a high-minded vehicle for right-wing indoctrination on campus, which is just as anti-intellectual as the social-justice orthodoxy that prevails at elite colleges. Yet civic education and civic virtue are essential things for an embattled democracy, and generally missing in ours. So is studying the classics of American history and thought in a setting that doesn't reduce them to instruments of present-day politics.<br/>As we entered the campus building that houses SCETL, a student stopped Carrese to tell him that she'd received a summer internship with a climate-change-skeptical organization in Washington. On the hallway walls I saw what you would be unlikely to see in most academic departments: American flags. But Carrese, who stepped down recently, hired a faculty of diverse backgrounds and took care to invite speakers of opposing views. In a class on great debates in American political history, students of many ethnicities, several nationalities, and no obvious ideologies parsed the shifting views of Frederick Douglass on whether the Constitution supported slavery.<br/>Crow has defended SCETL from attempts by legislators on the right to control it and on the left to end it. Republican legislatures in half a dozen other states are bringing the model to their flagship universities, but Carrese worries that those universities will fail to insulate the programs from politics and end up with partisan academic ghettos. SCETL's goal, he said, is to train students for democratic citizenship and leadership-to make disagreement possible without hatred.<br/>\"The most committed students, left and right, are activists, and the center disappears,\" Carrese said. This was another purpose of SCETL: to check the relentless push toward extremes. \"If students don't see conservative ideas in classes, they will go off toward Charlie Kirk and buy the line that ~the enemy is so lopsided, we must be in their face and own the libs.'S\"<br/>Turning Point has a large presence at Arizona State. Last October, two Turning Point employees went on campus to get in the face of a queer writing instructor as he left class in a skirt, pursuing and filming him, and hectoring him with questions about pedophilia, until the encounter ended with the instructor on the ground bleeding from the face and the Maricopa County attorney <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.12news.com/article/news/local/valley/tpusa-employees-court-ordered-diversion-program-harassing-queer-asu-educator/75-46a2401a-763b-4964-b3ae-d450442ec8b7\">filing assault and harassment charges against the two Turning Point employees</url>. \"Cowards,\" Crow <url normalizedValue=\"https://newsroom.asu.edu/statement/president-crow-turning-point-usa-bullying-asu-faculty\">said in a statement</url>. He had previously <url normalizedValue=\"https://newsroom.asu.edu/statement/freedom-of-speech-at-arizona-state-university\">defended Kirk's right to speak</url> on campus, but this incident had nothing to do with free speech.<br/>Leading an experiment in mass higher education for working- and middle-class students allows Crow to spend much less time than his Ivy League counterparts on speaker controversies, congressional investigations, and Middle East wars. The hothouse atmosphere of America's elite colleges, the obsessive desire and scorn they evoke, feels remote from the Valley. During campus protests in the spring, Arizona State suspended 20 students-0.0137 percent of its total enrollment.<br/>6. The Things They Carried<br/>Two hours before sunrise, Fernando Quiroz stood in the bed of his mud-caked truck in a corner of Arizona. Eighty people gathered around him in the circle of illumination from a light tower while stray dogs hunted for scraps. It was February and very cold, and the people-men with backpacks, women carrying babies, a few older children-wore hooded sweatshirts and coats and blankets. Other than two men from India, they all came from Latin America, and Quiroz was telling them in Spanish that Border Patrol would arrive in the next few hours.<br/>\"You will be asked why you are applying for asylum,\" he said. \"It could be violence, torture, communism.\"<br/>They had been waiting here all night, after traveling for days or weeks and walking the last miles across the flat expanse of scrubland in the darkness off to the west. This was the dried-up Colorado River, and here and there on the far side, the lights of Mexico glimmered. The night before, the people had crossed the border somewhere in the middle of the riverbed, and now they were standing at the foot of the border wall. They were in America, but the wall still blocked the way, concealing fields of winter lettuce and broccoli, making sharp turns at Gate 6W and Gate 7W and the canal that carried Mexico's allocated Colorado River water from upstream. Quiroz's truck was parked at a corner of the wall. Its rust-colored steel slats rose 30 feet overhead.<br/>Seen from a distance, rolling endlessly up and down every contour of the desert, the wall seemed thin and temporary, like a wildly ambitious art installation. But up close and at night it was an immense and ominous thing, dwarfing the people huddled around the truck.<br/>\"Put on your best clothes,\" Quiroz told them. \"Wear whatever clothes you want to keep, because they'll take away the rest.\" They should make their phone calls now, because they wouldn't be able to once Border Patrol arrived. They would be given a gallon-size ziplock bag and allowed into America with only what would fit inside: documents, phones, bank cards. For all the other possessions that they'd chosen out of everything they owned to carry with them from all over the world to the wall-extra clothes, rugs, religious objects, family pictures-Border Patrol would give them a baggage-check tag marked Department of Homeland Security. They would have 30 days to come back and claim their belongings, but hardly anyone ever did-they would be long gone to Ohio or Florida or New York.<br/>At the moment, most of them had no idea where they were. \"This is Arizona,\" Quiroz said.<br/>As he handed out bottled water and snacks from the back of his truck, a Cuban woman asked, \"Can I take my makeup?\"<br/>\"No, they'd throw it out.\"<br/>A woman from Peru, who said she was fleeing child-kidnappers, asked about extra diapers.<br/>\"No, Border Patrol will give you that in Yuma.\"<br/>I watched the migrants prepare to abandon what they had brought. No one spoke much, and they kept their voices low. A man gave Quiroz his second pair of shoes in case someone else needed them. A teenage girl named Alejandra, who had traveled alone from Guatemala, held a teddy bear she'd bought at a Mexican gas station with five pesos from a truck driver who'd given her a ride. She would leave the teddy bear behind and keep her hyperthyroid medicine. Beneath the wall, a group of men warmed themselves by the fire of a burning pink backpack. In the firelight, their faces were tired and watchful, like the faces of soldiers in a frontline bivouac. A small dumpster began to fill up.<br/>For several years, Quiroz had been waking up every night of the week and driving in darkness from his home in Yuma to supply the three relief stations he had set up at the wall and advise new arrivals, before going to his volunteer job as a high-school wrestling coach. He had the short, wiry stature and energy of a bantamweight, with a military haircut and midlife orthodontia installed cheap across the border. He was the 13th child of Mexican farmworkers, the first to go to college, and when he looked into the eyes of the migrants he saw his mother picking lettuce outside his schoolroom window and asked himself, \"If not me, then who?\"<br/>He was volunteering at the deadliest border in the world. A few miles north, the wall ended near the boundary of the Cocopah reservation, giving way to what's known as the \"Normandy wall\"-a long chain of steel X's that looked like anti-craft obstacles on Omaha Beach. Two winters ago, checking his relief station there, Quiroz found an old man frozen to death. Last summer, a woman carrying a small child crossed the canal on a footbridge and turned left at the wall instead of going right toward Gates 6W and 7W. She walked a few hundred yards and then sat down by the wall and died in the heat. (The child survived.) Afterward, Quiroz put up a sign pointing to the right.<br/>Over time, he began to find heaps of discarded objects in the dirt-clothing, sleeping bags, toiletries, a stroller. Border Patrol didn't have a policy of confiscating migrants' possessions-if anything, this violated official policy-but the practice was widespread, varying from post to post and day to day depending on the volume of influx and the mood of agents. So mounds of what looked like trash piled up at the wall, and right-wing media portrayed the sight as the filth and disorder that migrants were bringing into the country. Through a collaboration with Border Patrol and Yuma County, Quiroz set up dumpsters, toilets, and shade tents at his relief stations. He was also spending his own money, sometimes $200 a day, and his house filled up with migrants' lost property-hundreds of abandoned Bibles and rosaries, and backpacks that he emptied, cleaned, and donated to migrant shelters.<br/>East of Yuma, near a remote border crossing called Lukeville, I met a man with a plastic bag and a trash-picker walking alone on a dirt track along the wall. He was a retired public historian named Paul Ferrell, and he was collecting what migrants had left behind: brand-new backpacks, prescription medicine, silk saris, Muslim prayer rugs, a braided leather waistband from West Africa, money in 13 currencies, identity cards from dozens of countries. Ferrell intended to throw away or sell some items, and donate others to the University of Arizona-as if here, a few miles from the reservation of the Tohono O'odham Nation, believed to be descendants of the vanished Hohokam, he'd stumbled on the relics of another civilization, a recent one spanning the entire world, but already abandoned: a notebook from Delhi filled with a young person's fantasy story, handwritten in English, called \"Murder in Paradise\"; pages of notes in Punjabi detailing the writer's persecution; a notebook with a Spanish prayer titled \"God I Love You\":<br/>Please help me fulfill my American dream I ask you my saint God that I can stay working there God I need you so much heavenly father without you I am nothing  I feel fear that they will return me to my country there I don't have anything but debts except my family loves me so much they with so much pain help effort gave me money heavenly father I ask you to help me heavenly father.<br/>Like the things you would try to save from a fire, migrants' possessions are almost by definition precious. Having already left nearly everything behind, at the wall some lose their contacts' information, some their evidence for asylum, some their money, and some their identity. Quiroz was trying to bring these indignities to the attention of officials in Washington, but the border seems designed more for posturing than for solutions.<br/>His daily efforts didn't win him universal admiration. A couple of years ago, self-described patriots drove along the wall and trashed his water stations, threw away bananas and oranges, and harassed him and other volunteers. After that, he kept his coolers padlocked to the wall, and on the morning in early February of this year when a gun-carrying convoy that called itself God's Army rolled through Yuma, he stayed home, not wanting a confrontation. The migrant numbers had grown so high that public opinion was moving against them. \"It's going to be what wins the election: Where do you stand on the border?\" Quiroz said. \"Politicians will throw everything out of our faith and humanity to get leverage. It's sad-I see it in my friends, good people, the children of immigrants. It breaks my heart. My wife kicks me under the table: Don't say anything.\"<br/>Even the most sympathetic humanitarian knew that some asylum seekers were gaming the system. One morning, at a Spanish-speaking church in Mesa that receives migrants from the border every Thursday, I watched 24 single men emerge from a Border Patrol bus holding ziplock bags; one of them, a 20-year-old from India, told me that he had left his father's car-parts yard and traveled nine months to start his own business in Indiana.<br/>I went to the border believing that any country has to control whom it admits; that 2.5 million apprehensions in a single year are a crisis; that an overwhelmed asylum system intended for the persecuted is being exploited by the desperate; that the migrant influx shows this country's enduring appeal while undermining it by inflaming extremism and convincing less advantaged Americans that the government and the elites don't care about them.<br/>A few hours at the wall didn't change these beliefs. But the immeasurable distance between the noise in Washington and the predawn hush around Quiroz's truck reminded me, not for the first time in Arizona, that our battles royal take our attention from the things that matter most-a human face, a lost notebook.<br/>The sun's yellow rays in the east were beginning to pierce the slats when Gate 6W slid open and a Border Patrol van appeared. The agent had the migrants line up, women and children first, and, one by one, he photographed them and their passports. A light rain fell, and the arch of a rainbow rose over the invisible border in the riverbed. People began removing their shoelaces as Border Patrol required and Quiroz had instructed, presumably to prevent suicide attempts. They would leave their belongings at the wall and then be taken to the Yuma Sector, where they would be held for a day or two, or longer, some to be sent on to an immigration detention center, some to be deported, while others-the ones who convinced an official in a hurried interview that they might face danger if forced to return home-would be put on a bus to Phoenix, clutching their ziplock bag.<br/>But Phoenix was almost never their ultimate destination. Phoenix was an overnight church shelter, a shower and a meal, a set of used clothes, a call to someone somewhere in the country for an onward ticket-then the Greyhound station or Sky Harbor Airport, the longest journey's second-to-last stop for an Indian traveling from Gujarat to Fresno, an Ecuadorean from Quito to Orlando, a Guinean from Conakry to the Bronx. The drama at the border kept Arizona's political temperature near boiling, but otherwise it left little impression on the rest of the state. The latest immigrants to the Valley are engineers coming from California and Seattle. Those who arrived speaking other languages have already been here long enough to have changed the place forever.<br/>7. American Dreams <br/>My traveling companion to the border was a young man named Ernie Flores. He had spent his childhood on both sides, waking in darkness at his mother's house in San Luis, Mexico, and crossing over every day to attend school in Yuma. He had been a troublemaker, always tired and angry, but he grew up with a kind of mystical optimism. \"I remind myself constantly: If I'm suffering, I like to be present,\" he said, \"because that's my life.\"<br/>Tall and husky, with a fade haircut and a reserved face under heavy black brows, Flores was canvassing for Working America, an organization that connected nonunion households to the labor movement. As the sun set, he went door-to-door in the city's poorer neighborhoods like his own in South Phoenix, informing residents about the power company's price gouging; asking their views on health care, jobs, education, and corporate accountability; and collecting their email addresses on his tablet. He would stand back from the doorway and speak quietly, neither presenting nor inviting a threat. It was slow, unglamorous work on issues that mattered to everyone and resisted hot takes, and Flores was good at it. He relished these brief encounters, windows into other people's lives, hearing them out even when he knew they wouldn't give him their email.<br/>On his own time, he ran a small business helping migrants start their own, so that they would contribute to the American economy rather than burden it. At the wall, he advised a tailor from Ecuador. Gate 6W of the Yuma Sector reminded Flores of Ellis Island. He wanted the border where he'd spent his childhood to be a highway someday, with off-ramps into both countries, integrating their economies. Right now the border seemed to exist so that political parties could exploit it. There were all kinds of people, he said, and everyone had to be represented, including Trump supporters. Education and information would gradually lead voters like the ones he met at front doors to make better demands of their leaders. \"Everything has a cycle, I guess,\" he said. \"This division that we have because of Trump will fade away as it usually does.\"<br/>His long, calm, generous view was rare in this Year of American Panic. It escaped the gravity of polarization. In a way, it made Ernie Flores someone Charlie Kirk should fear.<br/>Phoenix is only slightly more white than Latino, and carne asada joints and the sound of Spanish are so ubiquitous that it feels less like a divided city than a bicultural one. \"Ethnic politics are not as strong here as in the East,\" Joaquin Rios, a leader of Arizona's teachers' union, told me. Michael Crow, the Arizona State president, went a step further and called Phoenix \"a post-ethnic city.\" He added: \"It didn't grow up around ethnic communities that then helped to define its trajectories, with a series of political bargains along the way. It was wide open.\"<br/>But for much of the 20th century, the city <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.azcentral.com/in-depth/money/real-estate/2022/04/18/effects-redlining-still-being-felt-south-phoenix-more-than-50-years-later/7293622001/\">restricted its Latino and Black populations to the area below the Salt River</url>, and South Phoenix remains mostly working-class. When newer waves of immigrants from Mexico began coming in the 1980s, many settled in a neighborhood of modest single-family houses in West Phoenix called Maryvale, a postwar master-planned community-Arizona's first-that white families were abandoning for gated swimming pools in North Phoenix and Scottsdale.<br/>To call Phoenix wide open-a place where people from anywhere can arrive knowing no one and make their way up and leave a mark-is truer than to say it of Baltimore or Cleveland or Dallas. But the fault lines around a lousy school district are just as stark here as everywhere else in America, and white professionals' children are just as unlikely to be trapped inside one. Our tolerance of inequality is bottomless, but sunshine and sprawl have a way of hiding it. You can drive the entire length of the Valley, from Queen Creek to Buckeye, and start to feel that it all looks the same. Only if you notice the concentration of vape and smoke shops, tire stores, panhandlers at freeway entrances, and pickups in the dirt yards of beige stucco houses do you realize you're passing through Maryvale.<br/>The Cortez family-Fabian, Erika, and their four daughters-lives in a tiny two-room apartment just outside Maryvale, with less space than a master bathroom in one of the $6 million Paradise Valley houses whose sales are reported in The Arizona Republic. The girls-Abigail, Areli, Anna, and Arizbeth, ranging from 18 to 10-sleep in the back room, and their parents sleep in the front, where there's a sofa, a small kitchen, a washer-dryer, and a partly inaccessible table pushed into a corner.<br/>Erika-a former athlete, tall, with a round face and large glasses-first came to the U.S. on a visa from Mexico in 2004, to see her mother and give birth to Abigail. Then they went back to Ju\u00a1rez, where Fabian was working in a warehouse and Erika attended college. But a few months later, when Erika tried to reenter the U.S. to have Abigail vaccinated, an immigration officer at the border in El Paso demanded: \"Why is she a citizen and you're not? If I see you again, I'll take away your visa.\" Afraid of being separated from her mother forever, a day later Erika was in Phoenix with the baby. That was the end of her education. After a month, Fabian joined them and found work as a maintenance man. They began to raise an American family: the children as citizens, the parents, in Erika's word, \"illegal.\"<br/>Mixed-status families are common in Maryvale. Analise Ortiz, who represents the area in the state legislature, told me, \"It's not so much the everyday flow of traffic over the border that impacts my district-people come to Phoenix and then they leave. It's immigration policy on the federal level.\" The country's failure year after year to address the dilemma of its millions of undocumented residents shapes every aspect of the Cortez family's life. When Fabian spent weekends doing landscape work for a man who then refused to pay what he owed him-saying, \"I'll call immigration; get off my property\"-he had no recourse. In 2006, he fell from the second floor of a job site onto a concrete slab and fractured his back. Fabian spent a year in bed recovering while Erika sold tamales from their kitchen to make ends meet. He still feels pain today, but the company paid him no compensation.<br/>In 2010, a punitive state law known as S.B. 1070-nicknamed the \"Show Me Your Papers\" law, and enforced by the rabidly anti-immigrant sheriff of Maricopa County at the time, Joe Arpaio-instituted a reign of terror for people in the Valley with dark skin. Every day, the Cortezes risked a police check that might break up the family, and Erika was afraid to go outside. Once, two policemen stopped Fabian when he was driving a friend's car-one cop wanted to take him in, but the other, seeing two child seats in the back, let Fabian go and impounded the car. (S.B. 1070 significantly <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/immigration/2020/03/02/sb-1070-legacy-arizonas-immigration-enforcement-law/4732918002/\">reduced the number of undocumented immigrants in Arizona</url>; it also galvanized Latinos to vote Democratic and helped turn the state purple.)<br/>Several years ago, Erika became diabetic, and she's been plagued ever since by serious illnesses and chronic fatigue. But with Fabian's minimum-wage pay and no health insurance, she's limited to a discount clinic where the wait time is long and the treatment is inadequate. In 2020, amid the depths of the pandemic, the owner of the four-bedroom house they were renting near the interstate broke the lease, saying that he was going to sell, and gave the family a month to leave. They had no choice but to put most of their furniture in storage and squeeze into the two cramped rooms. The girls made their mother weep by saying, \"Don't be sad. We're together, we have a ceiling, we have food. If we're together, we're happy-that's all that matters.\"<br/>Arizona ranks 48th among states in spending per student, ahead of only Utah and Idaho, in spite of poll after poll showing wide support for public education. A universal-voucher law is sending nearly <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona-education/2023/05/31/arizona-private-school-voucher-program-esa-cost-hit-900-million/70273679007/\">$1 billion annually in tax money to the state's private schools</url>. With little regulation, Phoenix is the Wild West of education-the capital of for-profit, scandal-plagued colleges and charter schools, many of them a mirage, a few of them a lifeline for desperate parents.<br/>The Cortez girls attended Maryvale public schools, where Erika and Fabian always volunteered. The girls were studious and introverted; the classrooms were often chaotic. When Areli was in fifth grade, her teacher warned Erika that the local middle school would be a rough place for her, as it had been for Abigail. The teacher recommended a Maryvale charter school that was part of a network in the Valley called Great Hearts. Its curriculum was classical-essentially a great-books program, with even geometry taught using Euclid's Elements-and its mission was education through \"truth, beauty, and goodness.\" Erika didn't know any of this when she toured the school, but she was impressed by the atmosphere of discipline and respect. Children were learning in a safe place-that was enough for her and Fabian. Areli got in off the waitlist, Abigail was admitted into the school's first ninth-grade class, their younger sisters entered the elementary school, and the girls began their education in Latin, Shakespeare, van Gogh, and Bach.<br/>The family's life revolved around school. Erika woke before dawn and drove Fabian to his job at 5:30 a.m., then returned home to take the girls to Great Hearts. She was the classic Team Mom and spent hours every afternoon driving her kids and others to basketball games and track meets. Unlike Maryvale's Great Hearts, which is overwhelmingly Latino and poor, most schools in the network are largely white and middle-class, and the Cortez girls weren't always made to feel welcome at away games. But Erika loved that her daughters were studying books she'd only heard of and learning to think more deeply for themselves. The family never gathered at home before eight at night, when Erika was often exhausted; the girls-straight'A students-did homework and read past midnight. Their mother lived with the fear that she wouldn't see them all grown. She wanted \"to give them wonderful memories. I don't want to waste time.\"<br/>I spent a morning at Great Hearts in Maryvale, where hallways displayed replicas of paintings by da Vinci, Brueghel, and Renoir. A 12th-grade class in \"Humane Letters\" was studying The Aeneid, and on the whiteboard the teacher had written, \"To whom or what is duty owed? Can fate and free will coexist?\" Students were laboring to understand the text, but Aeneas's decision to abandon Dido for his destiny in Rome sparked a passionate discussion. \"What if Aeneas, like, asked Dido to come with him?\" one boy asked.<br/>If you accept the assumption that children won't learn unless they see their own circumstances and identities reflected in what they're taught, then the pedagogy at Great Hearts must seem perverse, if not immoral. I asked Rachel Mercado, the upper-school headmaster, why her curriculum didn't include the more \"relevant\" reading now standard at most schools in poorer districts. \"Why do my students have to read that?\" she demanded. \"Why is that list for them and not this list? That's not fair to them. I get very worked up about this.\" Her eyes were filling. \"They deserve to read good things and have these conversations. They're exposed to all that\"-the problems of race and gender that animate many contemporary teen novels. \"Why is that the only thing they get to read? You saw them reading The Aeneid. These books are about problems that humans relate to, not just minority groups.\"<br/>Like SCETL at Arizona State, classical education at Great Hearts runs the risk of getting caught in the constantly grinding gears of the culture wars. The network was co-founded by a Republican political operative, and sponsors of its annual symposium include the Heritage Foundation and Hillsdale College. Great Hearts' leaders worry that some people associate classical education with the right. \"But teachers don't think about it,\" Mercado said. \"This whole political thing is pushed by people who don't think about what to do in the classroom.\"<br/>Great Hearts has made it difficult for students to change their gender identity in school. For some progressives, this is evil, and, what's more, the Cortez girls only appear to be thriving in an inequitable education that marginalizes them. For some conservatives-Charlie Kirk, for example, and Kari Lake, now running for the U.S. Senate-the girls' parents are criminals who should be sent back to Mexico, destroying everything they've sacrificed to build, and depriving America of everything they would contribute.<br/>In a place like Maryvale, you realize how righteously stupid the culture wars make both sides. There's no reason to think that great books and moral education have anything to do with MAGA. There's no reason reading Virgil should require banning children from changing names. There's no reason to view Western civilization as simply virtuous or vicious, only as the one that most shaped our democracy. There's no reason to dumb down humanistic education and expect our society to become more just. If we ever do something about the true impediments to the Cortez family's dreams-if Fabian could earn enough from his backbreaking work for the six of them to live in four rooms instead of two; if insurance could cover treatment for Erika's illnesses so she doesn't have to delay seeing a doctor until her life is threatened; if the local public schools could give their daughters a safe and decent education; if America could allow the family to stop being afraid and live in the sunlight-then by all means let's go back to fighting over name changes and reading lists.<br/>8. Campaigners<br/>Ruben Gallego was hopping up and down in the middle of the street in a tie-dyed campaign T-shirt and shorts and a pair of cheap blue sunglasses. The Phoenix Pride Parade was about to start, and everyone was there, every class and color and age: Old Lesbians Organizing for Change, NASCAR, McKinsey, the Salt River Project, Gilbert Fire &amp;amp; Rescue, Arizona Men of Leather. Gallego, the U.S. representative from Arizona's Third District (and the ex-husband of the mayor of Phoenix), is running for the U.S. Senate against Kari Lake.<br/>Gallego grew up in a small apartment outside Chicago with his mother, a Colombian immigrant, and his three sisters after their Mexican father abandoned the family. Ruben slept on the floor, worked in construction and meatpacking, got into Harvard, was suspended for poor grades before graduating in 2004, and enlisted with the Marine reserves. In 2005, he was sent to Iraq and fought for six months in the hardest-hit Marine battalion of the war. His <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/01/he-doesnt-understand-war/604648/?utm_source=feed\">deployment still haunts him</url>. He looks more like a labor organizer than a congressman-short and bearded, with the face and body of a middle-aged father who works all the time but could have taken care of himself on January 6 if an insurrectionist had gotten too close.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/01/he-doesnt-understand-war/604648/?utm_source=feed\">Radio Atlantic: \"He doesn't understand war\"</url>]<br/>The Third District includes South Phoenix and Maryvale, and Gallego was campaigning as a son of the working class on behalf of people struggling to afford rent or buy groceries. The Third District borders the Ninth, whose median income is not much higher, and whose congressman, Paul Gosar, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/11/lawless-masculinity-gop/620732/?utm_source=feed\">inhabits the more paranoid precincts of the Republican Party</url>. The district line might as well be a frontier dividing two countries, but some of the difference dissolves in the glare of sunlight hitting the metal roof of a Dollar General. <url normalizedValue=\"https://censusreporter.org/profiles/50000US0403-congressional-district-3-az/\">Three-quarters of Gallego's constituents</url> are the urban Latino and Black working class. I asked him if his message could win over Gosar's rural white working class.<br/>\"You can win some of them-you're not going to win them all,\" he said. \"They hate pharmaceutical companies as much as I do. They hate these mega-monopolies that are driving up the cost of everything as much as I do. They worry about foreign companies sucking up the water as much as I do.\"<br/>In 2020, Gallego received national attention when <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/RubenGallego/status/1324071039085670401\">he tweeted his rejection of the term Latinx</url>. He criticizes his own Democratic Party for elitism. \"We should not be afraid to say, ~You know what-we messed up,'S\" he told me. \"S~We lost our focus on working-class issues, and we need to fight to get it back.'S\" I asked Gallego about the recent turn of Latino and Black Americans toward the Republican Party. He was more concerned that sheer cynicism would keep them from voting at all.<br/>The parade started up Third Street, and Gallego went off looking for every hand he could shake. In the first 10 minutes, he counted 86.<br/>It struck me that a parade for the child tax credit would never draw such a large, diverse, and joyous crowd, or any crowd at all. Even with a resurgence of union activism, \"We are wage workers\" doesn't excite like \"LGBTQ together.\" When the Arizona Supreme Court voted in April that <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/arizona-abortion-restrictions-1864-9c68866d69dca38c728dd27b80592e8f\">a Civil War\"era ban on almost every abortion should remain state law</url>, the dominant theme of Gallego's campaign became that familiar Democratic cause, not the struggles of the working class.<br/>Americans today are mobilized by culture and identity, not material conditions-by belonging to a tribe, whether at a Pride march or a biker rally. Political and media elites stoke the culture wars for their own benefit, while government policies repeatedly fail to improve conditions for struggling Americans. As a result, even major legislation goes unnoticed. Joe Biden's infrastructure, microchip, and climate bills are sending billions of dollars to the Valley, but I hardly ever heard them mentioned. \"Right now they are not a factor in my district,\" Analise Ortiz, the state representative, told me. When she went door-to-door, the bills hardly ever came up. \"Honestly, it's rare that Biden even comes up.\"<br/>The professional class has lost so much trust among low-income voters that a Democratic candidate has to be able to say: \"I don't despise you. I talk like you, I shop like you-I'm one of you.\" This was the approach of Bernadette Greene Placentia.<br/>She started working as a long-haul trucker in 1997, became the owner of a small trucking company, and at age 50 still drove one of the three rigs. She grew up in rural Nebraska and Wyoming, the daughter of a union railroader who was a conservative Democrat and National Rifle Association lifer-a type that now barely exists. She's married to the son of a MexicanAmerican labor leader who worked with Cesar Chavez, and together they raised an adopted daughter from China. She's a pro-union, pro\"death penalty, pro-choice gun owner-\"New Deal instead of Green New Deal.\" She struggles with medical bills and rig payments, and she was running for Congress as a Democrat in Arizona's Eighth Congressional District, which encompasses the heavily Republican suburbs northwest of Phoenix.<br/>The open seat in the Eighth was more likely to go to the Republican speaker of the Arizona House, Ben Toma; or to Blake Masters, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/26/blake-masters-house-bid-arizona-00123783\">Peter Thiel disciple</url> who lost his run for U.S. Senate in 2022; or to Anthony Kern, a state senator and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2024/05/01/anthony-kerns-campaign-fundraises-off-being-indicted-as-fake-elector/73518551007/\">indicted fake Trump elector</url> who <url normalizedValue=\"https://azmirror.com/2021/05/05/where-was-anthony-kern-on-jan-6/\">joined the mob outside the Capitol on January 6</url>; or to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/12/08/former-president-donald-trump-endorses-abe-hamadeh-for-congress-in-cd8/71857539007/\">Trump's personal choice</url>, Abe Hamadeh, another election denier who was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/court-sanctions-election-deniers-and-dismisses-challenge-to-arizonas-2022-election-results/\">still suing after losing the attorney-general race</url> in 2022. But I wanted to talk with Greene Placentia, because she confounded the fixed ideas that paralyze our minds with panic and boredom and deepen our national cognitive decline.<br/>We met at a Denny's next to the interstate in Goodyear. She was wearing an open-shoulder cable-knit turtleneck sweater with crossed American and Ukrainian flag pins. Her long hair was pulled back tight, and her eyes and mouth were also tight, maybe from driving 3.5 million miles around the country. As soon as I sat down, she said, \"The Democratic Party purports to be the party of the working class. Bullshit.\"<br/>When she knocked on doors in her district and introduced herself, the residents couldn't believe she was a Democrat. \"We need to get rid of the political elites; we need to get rid of the multimillionaires,\" she would tell them. \"We need representative democracy. That means people like you and me.\" And they would say, \"Yeah, you're not like the other Democrats.\"<br/>The image is a caricature, and unfair. The Republican Party is dominated by very rich men, including its leader. But populist resentments in America have usually been aroused more by cultural superiority than by great wealth. In 2016, Greene Placentia knew that Trump would win, because she worked every day with the targets of his appeal. \"As rich as that fucker is, he stood up there and said, ~You know what? It's not your fault; it's their fault. They don't care about you-I care about you. I will fight for you. They're busy fighting to get guys in dresses.' Crude, but that's what he said. And when your life has fallen apart, when you're not making shit, and somebody stands there and says, ~I will help you. I believe in you,' you're gonna go there. We gotta belong to a pack. If that pack isn't paying attention to us, you're gonna go to another pack.\" The pack, she said, is Trump's, not the Republican Party's, and its bond is so strong that a road-rage encounter between two members will end in apologies and bro hugs.<br/>For nearly a decade, journalists and academics have been trying to understand Trump's hold on white Americans who don't have a college degree. Racism, xenophobia, economic despair, moral collapse, entertainment value? Greene Placentia explained it this way: The white working class is sinking, while minority groups, with the support of Democrats, are rising-not as high, but getting closer. \"When you're falling and the party that built its back on you isn't there, and you look over and they're busy with everybody else and the environment and all this shit, and your life is falling apart, and all you see is them rising, it breeds resentment.\"<br/>She wasn't justifying this attitude, and she despised Trump (\"a con man\"), but she was describing why she was running for Congress. \"The reason they don't listen to us-it isn't because of the message we're saying; it's because of the messenger. They don't trust any establishment Democrats. You're gonna have to start getting people in there that they believe in and trust, and it has to be people that's more like them and less like the Gavin Newsoms and the Gretchen Whitmers that grew up in the political world. Otherwise, every presidential election is gonna be on the margins.\"<br/>Stashed under her car's dashboard was a pack of Pall Malls along with a \"Black Lives Matter / Women's Rights Are Human Rights / No Human Is Illegal \" leaflet. In a sense, Greene Placentia was trying to do for the Democrats what Sarah Palin had done for the Republicans. She was trying to make working-class into a political identity that could attract voters who seemed to belong to the other party or neither.<br/>\"The problem is, both the establishment Republicans and the establishment Democrats are gonna fight like hell against that person,\" she said, \"S'cause that kind of person isn't for a party; it's for the people.\"<br/>The Arizona Democratic Party ignored Greene Placentia. In the end, like the Shaman, she didn't gather enough signatures to get on the ballot.<br/>Jeff Zink drove around South Phoenix wearing a black Stetson, stitched boots, and a Love It or Leave It belt buckle, with a pistol holstered on his right hip-as if to say, That's right, I'm a Second Amendment guy from Texas, which is what he is. Zink was campaigning for Gallego's seat in the Third Congressional District on a Republican brand of identity politics-an effort at least as quixotic as Greene Placentia's in the Eighth, because South Phoenix, where Zink lives, is solidly Democratic and Latino. Like her, he didn't have much money and was spending down his retirement funds on the campaign. He was betting that his surname and party wouldn't matter as much as the area's crime and poverty and the empty warehouses that should have been turned into manufacturing plants with good jobs by the past three congressmen with Hispanic surnames-that his neighbors were fed up enough to vote for a white MAGA guy named Zink.<br/>Zink believed that his background as an NFL trainer and ordained Christian minister showed that he couldn't be the racist some called him because of January 6. That day, he and his 32-year-old son, Ryan, had crossed police barriers and joined the crowd on the Capitol steps, though they hadn't entered the building itself. Zink wasn't charged, but Ryan-who had posted video on social media of himself cheering the mob as it stormed the doors-was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/texas-man-found-guilty-felony-and-misdemeanor-charges-related-jan-6-capitol-breach\">found guilty on three counts and faces up to 22 years</url> in federal prison. Zink complained to me that a rigged court in Washington had convicted his son for exercising his First Amendment rights. He also believed that the 2020 presidential and 2022 state elections in Arizona<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/12/30/this-candidate-congress-worked-discredited-az-election-audit/72040325007/\">had been fraudulent</url>, and he'd participated in \"recounts\" of both. Even his own congressional-race loss to Gallego in 2022, by a 77\"23 margin, had left him suspicious. Nothing was on the level, evil was in control-but a heavenly God was watching, and soon America would be governed biblically by its true Christians of every color.<br/>Zink drove along Baseline Road, the main east-west drag through South Phoenix. He wanted to show me crime and decay, and it didn't take long to find it. A fire truck with lights flashing was parked outside a Taco Bell in a shopping center. \"I guarantee you we have a fentanyl overdose,\" Zink said-but the man lying on the floor inside had only passed out drunk. The next stop was a tire shop in the same mall. Zink had already heard from the store manager that drug dealers and homeless people from a nearby encampment had broken in dozens of times.<br/>The manager, Jose Mendoza-lean, with a shaved head and a fringe of beard along his jawline, wearing his store uniform, jacket, and cap-seemed harassed. The local police force was understaffed, and he had to catch criminals himself and haul them down to the precinct. After a break-in at his house while his wife and kids were there, he had moved out to Buckeye. On the long commutes, he listened to news podcasts. Standing by the store counter, he had a lot to say to Zink.<br/>\"My biggest thing, the reason I don't like Trump, is because he politically divided the nation,\" Mendoza said. \"If he wins, I am leaving, I'm going back south, I'm selling everything I have and getting out of here. I am 100 percent serious, brother, because I'm not going to be put inside a camp like he threatened to do already. I'm not going to stand for any of my people being put inside of a camp.\" Mendoza was furious that Trump had pardoned Joe Arpaio, who had treated Latinos like criminals for two decades.<br/>\"Right,\" Zink said. \"These are the things where that division that has happened and-\"<br/>\"I don't see Biden coming in here and getting the sheriffs to start profiling people,\" Mendoza said.<br/>\"Right, right.\"<br/>The candidate kept trying to agree with Mendoza, and Mendoza kept showing that they disagreed. He ended the conversation in a mood of generalized disgust. \"You know what? Get rid of both of 'em. Put somebody else,\" he said. \"Put Kennedy, shit, put somebody's Labrador-I'll vote for a Labrador before I'll vote for any of those two guys.\"<br/>Zink had neglected to tell Mendoza that he and his gun had just been at the border in Yuma with the anti-migrant God's Army convoy. Or that the friend who'd first urged him to move to the Valley was one of Arpaio's close aides. But back in his truck, Zink said, \"My father told me this: ~Until you've walked a mile in somebody's shoes, you don't know where they're coming from.' It's going to take me a long time to listen to Jose, with all of the things that's gone on.\"<br/>A warmer reception awaited him from Dania Lopez. She owned a little shop that sold health shakes in the South Plaza mall, where her husband's low-rider club gathered on weekends. She had been raised Democratic, but around 2020 she began to ask herself whether she agreed with what she'd watched all her life on Univision. She and her husband, an auto mechanic, opposed abortion, worried about undocumented immigrants bringing fentanyl across the border, and distrusted the notion of climate change (\"It's been hot here every year\"). Their Christian values aligned more with the Republican Party, so they began listening to right-wing podcasts. But the decisive moment came on Election Day in 2020, when a voting machine twice rejected her husband's ballot for Trump. The paper size seemed too large to fit.<br/>\"If that happened to me, how many more people that happened to?\" Lopez asked me in the back of her shop. \"It really raised those red flags.\" This procedural mistake was enough to make her believe that the 2020 election was rigged. Now there was a Zink for Congress sign in her store window. \"I think that God has opened my eyes to be able to see something that I couldn't see before.\" A lot of her friends were making the same change.<br/>Lopez and her husband are part of a political migration among working-class Latino and Black voters, especially men. The trend might get Trump elected again this year. Biden's margin of support among Black voters has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/03/05/us/elections/times-siena-poll-registered-voter-crosstabs.html\">dropped by as much as 28 percent</url> since 2020, and among Latino voters by as much as 32 percent, to nearly even with Trump's. Attendance at the Turning Point USA convention was overwhelmingly white, but outside the center I met a Black woman from Goodyear, in a red America First jacket, named Christy Kelly. She was collecting signatures to get her name on the ballot for a seat on the state utility commission, in order to block renewable energy from causing rolling blackouts and soaring prices, she said. She called herself a \"walkaway\"-a defector from a family of longtime Democrats, and for the same reason as Dania Lopez: She was a conservative.<br/>I asked if she didn't regard Trump as a bigot. \"Absolutely not,\" Kelly said cheerfully. \"Trump has been one of the No. 1 names quoted in rap music going back to the '80s, maybe the '90s. Black people have loved Trump. Mike Tyson loved him.\" Republicans just had to learn to speak with more sensitivity so they didn't get automatically labeled racist.<br/>Kelly and Lopez defied the rules of identity politics. They could not be counted on to vote according to their race or ethnicity, just as Greene Placentia could not be counted on to vote according to her class. Whether or not we agreed, talking with these women made me somewhat hopeful. Identity is a pernicious form of political division, because its appeal is based on traits we don't choose and can't change. It's inherently irrational, and therefore likely to lead to violence. Identity politicians-and Trump is one-don't win elections with arguments about ideas, or by presenting a vision of a world more attractive than their opponent's. They win by appealing to the solidarity of group identity, which has to be mobilized by whipping up fear and hatred of other groups.<br/>Unlike identities, ideas are open to persuasion, and persuasion depends on understanding and reaching other people. But when partisanship itself becomes a group identity, a tribal affiliation with markers as clear as Jeff Zink's handgun, dividing us into mutually unintelligible blocs with incompatible realities, then the stakes of every election are existential, and it becomes hard to live together in the same country without killing one another.<br/>9. The Good Trump Voter<br/>Bernadette Greene Placentia's account of Trump voters wasn't completely satisfying. Resentment of elites is a powerful motive in democratic politics, and so is the feeling-apparently universal among long-haul truckers-that the economy was better under Trump. But that disregards the moral and psychological cesspool himself: a bully, a liar, a bigot, a sexual assaulter, a cheat; crude, cruel, disloyal, vengeful, dictatorial, and so selfish that he tried to shatter American democracy rather than accept defeat. His supporters have to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/01/trump-2024-win-american-identity/676143/?utm_source=feed\">ignore all of this, explain it away, or revel in displays of character</url> that few of them would tolerate for a minute in their own children. Now they are trying to put him back in power. Beyond the reach of reason and even empathy, nearly half of my fellow citizens are unfathomable, including a few I personally like. The mystery of the good Trump voter troubled me.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/01/trump-2024-win-american-identity/676143/?utm_source=feed\">From the January/February 2024 issue: Trump voters are America too</url>]<br/>Most people are better face-to-face than when performing online or in an anonymous crowd. At the Turning Point convention, where four days of rage and hatred spewed from the stage, everyone I spoke with, my media badge in full view, was friendly (other than 30 seconds of scorn from Charlie Kirk himself when I tried to interview him). Did this matter? I didn't want to live in a country where politics polluted every cranny of life, where communication across battle lines was impossible. It was important to preserve some civic ties for the day after the apocalypse, yet the enormity of the threat made it hard to see any basis for them.<br/>A man was attending the convention with the pass of a friend who had recently lost his wife during the coronavirus pandemic. The friend had been invited to speak about the staggering losses of the pandemic and the reasons for them, but some days were still bad, and he had skipped the day's session. His name was Kurtis Bay. I wanted to meet him.<br/>Bay lived in a gated subdivision in Mesa at the eastern edge of the Valley, three miles from Rusty Bowers. Bay's house, like all the ones around it, was beige, stucco-walled, and tile-roofed, with a small desert yard. A Toyota Tacoma was parked in the driveway and an American flag hung from a pole on the garage wall. The rooms inside were covered in pictures of a middle-aged blond woman with a warm smile and, occasionally beside her, a man with the silvering goatee and easy, sun-reddened face of someone enjoying his late 50s with his wife.<br/>This was the man who greeted me in a half-zip windbreaker. But all the pleasure was gone from his blue eyes, and his voice easily broke, and the house felt empty with just him and his dog, Apollo, and an occasional visit from the housekeeper or the pool guy. His sons and grandsons couldn't bear to come over since Tammy's death, so Bay had to get in his truck to see them.<br/>He had come up in Washington State from next to nothing, deserted by his father, raised by his mother on food stamps in Section 8 housing, leaving home at 15 and boxing semi-pro. Though he never forgot the humiliations of poverty and the help of the state, his belief in personal responsibility-not rugged individualism-led him, in the binary choice, to vote Republican. Kurtis and Tammy married when they were in their early 20s and raised two boys in the Valley, while he ran a business selling fire and burglar alarms and started a nonprofit basketball program for disadvantaged youth that was later taken over by the Phoenix Suns. A generation or two ago, the Bay family might have been an ad for white bread, but one of the sons was gay and the other was married to a Black woman, and the two grandsons were growing up, Bay said, in a society where \"they will never be white enough or Black enough.\"<br/>These themes kept recurring with people I met in the Valley: mixed-race families, dislike of political extremes, distrust of power, the lingering damage of COVID.<br/>The coronavirus took Tammy's mother in the early months of the pandemic. Kurtis and Tammy had moved back to Washington to be near her, but after her death they returned to the Valley, where their married son had just moved his family so that the boys could attend school in person. Kurtis and Tammy didn't get vaccinated, not because they were anti-vax but because they'd already had COVID. \"We are not anti-anything,\" he said, \"except anti-evil, anti-mean, anti-crime, anti-hate.\"<br/>The year 2021 was golden for them: projects on the new house in Mesa, their sons and grandsons nearby, Kurtis retired and golfing, Tammy starting a business restoring furniture. \"We got back to running around chasing each other naked, living our best life in the home of our dreams,\" he said. \"We'd witnessed the worst and seen the best. We were together 39 years.\"<br/>Tammy came down with something after a large Christmas party at their son's house. By early January 2022, she was so exhausted that she asked Kurtis to drive her to the nearest hospital. A COVID test came back negative, while chest X-rays showed pneumonia. Still, the doctors brought Tammy up to the COVID unit, where the staff were all wearing hazmat suits and next of kin were allowed to stay only an hour. The disorientation and helplessness of a complex emergency at a big hospital set in, nurses who didn't know the patient's name coming and going and a doctor with the obscure title \"hospitalist\" in charge, needing immediate answers for alarming decisions and insisting on treating a virus that Kurtis was adamant Tammy didn't have. When he refused to leave her side, a nurse called security and he was physically escorted out, but not before he wrote on the room's whiteboard: \"No remdesivir, no high-flow oxygen, no sedation, no other procedures without my approval. Kurtis Bay.\"<br/>To the hospital, Bay was a combative husband who was resisting treatment for his extremely sick wife. To Bay, the hospital was slowly killing his beloved and recently healthy wife with antiviral drugs and two spells on a ventilator. The ordeal lasted 15 days, until Tammy died of sepsis on January 20, 2022.<br/>Bay told me the story with fresh sorrow and lingering disbelief rather than rancor. \"I have a lot of pain, but I'm not going to be that person that's going to run around with a sandwich board and stand in front of the courthouse and scream, ~You murdered my wife!'S\" He believed that federal agencies and insurance companies created incentives for hospitals to diagnose COVID and then follow rigid protocols. The tragedy fed his skepticism toward what he called the \"managerial class\"-the power elite in government bureaucracy, business, finance, and the media. The managerial class was necessary-the country couldn't function without it-but it accumulated power by sowing conflict and chaos. Like the hospital's doctors, members of the class weren't individually vicious. \"Yes, they are corrupt, but they're more like AI,\" Bay said. \"It's morphing all by itself. It's incestuous-it breeds and breeds and breeds.\" As for politicians, \"I don't think either political party gives a shit about the people\"-a dictum I heard as often as the one about whiskey and water.<br/>Bay saw Trump as the only president who tried to disrupt the managerial class and empower ordinary citizens. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. would do it too, but voting for him would be throwing his vote away. If Trump loses this year, the managerial class will acquire more power and get into more wars, make the border more porous, hurt the economy by installing DEI algorithms in more corporations. \"I'll vote for Trump,\" Bay said, \"but that's, like, the last thing I think about in terms of how I'm going to impact my neighbor, my friend, my society.\" Everyone wanted clean air, clean water, opportunity for all to make money and raise a family. If the extremes would stop demonizing each other and fighting over trivia, then the country could come together and solve its immense problems-poverty, homelessness <br/>I listened, half-agreeing about the managerial class, still wondering how a man who dearly loved his multiracial family and cared about young people on the margins and called his late wife \"the face of God on this Earth\" could embrace Trump. So I asked. Bay replied that good people had done bad things on January 6 but not at Trump's bidding, and he might have gone himself if the timing had been different; that he didn't look to the president for moral guidance in raising children or running a business; that he'd easily take \"grab her by the whatever\" from a president who would end the border problem and stop funding wars. All of this left the question unanswered, and maybe it was unanswerable, and I found myself looking away from his watery eyes to the smiling woman in the large framed picture behind his left shoulder.<br/>\"There are no good days,\" Bay said.<br/>10. Dry Wells<br/>In the spring of 2023, Governor Hobbs <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.azwater.gov/gwpc\">convened an advisory council</url> to find solutions to the two parts of the water problem: how to allow urban areas to keep growing without using more groundwater, and how to prevent rural basins from running out of water altogether. The council began to meet in Room 3175 at the Arizona Department of Water Resources, two blocks north of the homeless compound in the heat zone, and a dozen blocks west of the convention center's noise and smoke machines. Around a long horseshoe table sat every interested party: farmers, builders, tribal leaders, politicians, environmentalists, experts, and the state's top water officials. The Salt River Project was there; so were Kathleen Ferris and Sarah Porter; so was Stephen Roe Lewis, the leader of the Gila River Indian Community, who had <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-nearly-6-million-innovative-solar-panel\">secured federal funding to install experimental solar panels</url> over the tribe's canals to conserve water and power. At one end of the table, frown lines extending from the corners of her mouth, sat Gail Griffin, the diminutive and stubborn 80-year-old Republican chair of the House committee on natural resources. Rusty Bowers, working as a lobbyist for the water company EPCOR, listened from the back of the room.<br/>They studied documents and took turns asking questions, challenging proposals, seeking consensus on the Rubik's Cube of water. They had until the end of the year. Maybe it was the heat, but I began to think of Room 3175 as one of the places where the fate of our civilization would be decided. These people had to listen to one another, but that didn't guarantee any agreement. Developers remained unhappy with the governor's halt to building on groundwater in the Valley's edge towns, like Buckeye. In October, two women quit the council, complaining that farm interests were going unheard. They were replaced by a farmer named Ed Curry, who grew chili peppers down in Cochise County.<br/>Cochise interested me. It is one of the most conservative counties in Arizona. Last November, two county supervisors were <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/11/29/cochise-county-supervisors-charged-with-election-interference/71742834007/\">indicted for refusing to validate votes</url> without a hand count and delaying certification of the 2022 midterms, which elected Hobbs governor over Kari Lake. Cochise was also the county most threatened by the depletion of groundwater. Its Willcox Basin had <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.azwater.gov/sites/default/files/2023-12/2023_WillcoxBasin.pdf\">lost more than 1 trillion gallons since 1990</url>, at least three times the amount of water restored by rain or snowmelt, and the water table was now below the reach of the average well. Cochise was where you saw a road sign that said Earth Fissures Possible.<br/>The convergence of these two extremes-MAGA politics and disappearing water-made for unusual alignments in rural Arizona. As the Lions of Liberty told me at Turning Point's convention, water didn't divide strictly red and blue-the issue was more local. Rural groundwater in Arizona was left unregulated by the 1980 law, and around the state, some conservative county supervisors whose constituents' wells had gone dry were urging the legislature to impose rules. In some places, the crisis pitted homesteaders against large agribusinesses, or a retiree against a neighboring farmer, with Republicans on both sides. I sometimes thought the problem could be solved as long as Turning Point never hears about it.<br/>Cochise County is a three-hour drive southeast from Phoenix. Its flat expanse of land ends at distant ranges made of rock formations in fantastic shapes. The Willcox Basin has a sparse population and little in the way of jobs other than farming. In the past few years, retirees and young pioneers looking to live off the grid have begun moving to Cochise. So have agricultural businesses-wineries, large pecan and pistachio growers from California, and Riverview, a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hcn.org/issues/53-8/agriculture-a-mega-dairy-is-transforming-arizonas-aquifer-and-farming-lifestyles/\">giant Minnesota cattle operation with some 100,000 heifers</url>, known locally as the Dairy. The Willcox Basin has no reservoirs or canals; almost all of the available water lies hundreds of feet below the dry ground. The Dairy <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.myheraldreview.com/news/a-mega-dairy-and-a-dwindling-aquifer-in-willcox/article_1eb7f652-54bf-11ee-9fd9-77706bee033f.html\">drilled more than 100 wells, some 2,500 feet deep</url>, to suck out groundwater and irrigate 40,000 acres of corn and wheat, heavy water-use crops, to raise the heifers before shipping them back north for milking. Cochise County simply provided the water, for free. Ferris predicted how the story would end: \"The water will dry up and Riverview will leave town and take their cows and go. And all the people that love it down there because it's so gorgeous are going to run out of water.\"<br/>Last July, a retired construction worker from Seattle named Traci Page, who had 40 acres near the Dairy, turned on her tap to wash the dishes and got a lukewarm brown stream. Her well had gone dry. In a panic, she called the Dairy and was offered a 3,000-gallon tank so she could replace her well with expensive hauled water. \"Thanks,\" she said, \"but will you please deepen my well? You're out here drilling these holes.\" Page's state representative was Gail Griffin, from the governor's advisory council-a devout believer in property rights and an adamant opponent of regulation. Griffin never replied to her appeals. Page ended up selling her tractor to cover part of the $16,000 it cost to have her well deepened.<br/>\"During this dry-up, I feel like I'm sprinting up a gravel hill and it's giving way under my feet. I can't get ahead,\" Page told me. \"And this economy, and the corruption on both sides, and the corrupt corporations coming in here-can we just catch a break? Can you stop a minute so we can breathe?\"<br/>The sinking aquifer and relentless pumping by agribusiness led some locals to put an initiative on the ballot in 2022 that would have required the state to regulate groundwater in the Willcox Basin much as it did in the Phoenix area. The initiative set neighbor against neighbor, just like the water cutoff in Rio Verde, with rumors and falsehoods flying on Facebook and the Farm Bureau advertising heavily against it. A retired feed-store owner named Lloyd Glenn, whose well had dropped sharply, supported the initiative and found himself on the opposite side of most people he knew. \"I guess I'm not a good Republican anymore,\" he told me.<br/>\"That's the thing-they've gone a bit radical,\" his wife, Lisa, a retired schoolteacher, said. \"It's lent itself to the disbelief. We can't get the same information and facts.\" She added, \"And Gail Griffin has not let anything come forward in 10 years. She shuts down legislation and is thick as thieves with the Farm Bureau. If the water goes, there will be no more life here.\"<br/>The initiative was overwhelmingly defeated. I talked with several farmers who argued that it was appropriate for an urbanizing area like the Valley but not for the hinterlands. One of them was Ed Curry.<br/>His 2,000-acre farm has sat alongside Highway 191 for 43 years. Curry was 67, white-haired and nearly deaf in one ear, a religious conservative and an agricultural innovator. His farm produced 90 percent of the world's green-chili seed and experimented with new genetic strains all the time, including one that had signs of success in arresting Alzheimer's. To save water, Curry used drip irrigation and planted 300 acres of rosemary. He wanted to hand the farm down to his kids and grandkids, and that meant finding ways to use less water.<br/>Curry was always hugging people and saying he loved them, and one person he loved was Gail Griffin. They had a special relationship that went back 30 years, to an incident at a community musical program in a local public school, where Curry told a story about Sir Isaac Newton that seemed to insist on the existence of a Creator. When the local \"witchcraft group\" called the American Civil Liberties Union on him, he told me, Griffin contacted a lawyer from the Christian Coalition in Washington and rescued him, and ever since then Curry had put up Griffin signs at election time. But he hated the labeling and demonizing by the right and the left. In Sunday school, he taught the kids that \"the ills of society are because we've forgotten we belong to each other.\"<br/>When the governor's water advisers asked Curry to join the council in November, he took the chance, and went up to Phoenix to meet with the people in Room 3175 and try to work something out. As a farmer who practiced sustainability, who understood property rights but also obligations to your neighbors, he believed that he could reach both sides, including his old friend Griffin. \"Guys, we can't get nothin' done, because we got the far right over here scared of the far left,\" Curry told the governor's people. \"It's all this new sexual revolution of the transgender stuff. Country people deal with cows, bulls-we know better than all this crap. God didn't make us goofy. So you've got the far right taking this stand against the far left because they see 'em as way out there. And yet the far left says the far right are a bunch of bigots. None of that affects this water deal-none of it! Doesn't matter.\"<br/>On my way back to Phoenix from Curry's farm, I stopped in the town of Willcox to see Peggy Judd, one of the county supervisors indicted for election interference. By then it was dark, and the front door opened into the small living room of a very small house decorated for Christmas. Judd sat on the sofa, a heavyset woman with flat hair and a tired smile. Her husband, Kit, who had bone cancer, lay under a blanket in a recliner, wearing a Trump cap and taking Vicodin. He was a mechanic and had once installed Curry's irrigation engines.<br/>I sat beside Peggy on the sofa and we talked about water. She had opposed the initiative, but she had come to realize the urgency of acting to save the county's groundwater. Griffin, with whom she'd once been close, for a time stopped talking to her. \"Representative Griffin wants water to be free. We can't fix that. She is a private-property-rights, real-estate-broker person, and her brain cannot be fixed.\"<br/>In Arizona, I hoped for surprises that would break down the hardened lines of politics, and here was one. Gail Griffin, a traditional conservative, remained an immovable champion of the farm lobby, but Peggy, a MAGA diehard, wanted action on water because her neighbors' wells were going dry. In this one case, partisanship mattered less than facts. Disinformation and conspiratorial thinking had no answer for a dry well.<br/>We talked for an hour, and the whole time, the threat of prison hung in the room unmentioned. Suddenly Peggy brought up politics. She had loved being a county supervisor, passing budgets, solving local problems-until COVID. \"It wasn't political 'til then,\" she said, when mask mandates and vaccines set people against one another.<br/>\"COVID flipped us upside down,\" Kit said in a faint, throaty voice. \"People don't know how to act anymore.\"<br/>Peggy had driven with her daughter and grandkids to Washington for January 6, to let the president know how much they loved him and would miss him. It was a beautiful day of patriotic songs and prayer, but they got cold and headed for the Metro before things turned ugly. Then came the midterm election of 2022, when she ignored the Cochise County attorney's opinion and refused to validate the votes without a hand count. She told me that she just wanted to help her constituents get over their suspicion of the voting machines: \"I'm surprised I'm being indicted, because I was election-denier lite.\"<br/>She didn't consider that she was part of a wider effort, going back to that beautiful, patriotic day in Washington, to abuse the public trust and take away her fellow citizens' votes. In three days she would be arraigned in Phoenix.<br/>Peggy had received a lot of ugly messages. She played a voicemail that she'd saved on her phone. \"You're a fat, ignorant cunt. You're a disgrace and embarrassment to this country,\" said a man's voice. \"At least you're old as fuck and just look unhealthy as hell and hopefully nature wipes you off this planet soon. From a true American patriot. Worthless, ignorant scum of the planet  All because of you fucking scumbags on the right just don't understand that you're too psychologically weak and damaged to realize that you are acting against this country  Again, from a true American patriot, you fucking fat cunt.\"<br/>Peggy wiped away tears. A week ago, she said, she had woken up at four in the morning and couldn't face another day as county chair, because of the comments that came her way at public meetings. Then she made some fudge and ate it off the spoon and felt better. She texted a woman out east who worked for Mike Lindell, the right-wing pillow salesman, who was going to help pay Peggy's legal bills. \"I'm miserable,\" she told the woman. \"Things are not going to be okay. I don't even know if I can go to work today.\" But she made herself drive down to the county seat.<br/>When she returned home that evening, a sheriff's sergeant was waiting at her house. Someone had reported comments Peggy made while waiting to be fingerprinted at the county jail. A suicide-prevention lady gave Peggy a little pamphlet that she now took with her everywhere. She had learned a lesson: If you feel like you're going to kill yourself, tell someone.<br/>\"I pray, I pray that Trump comes back,\" Kit moaned from the recliner. \"There'll be nothing left of this country if we have to go through another bout of the Democrats.\" He had just two months to live.<br/>\"There, see, you want to know why we're divided?\" Peggy said to me. \"Because people that believe that believe that. And people that believe the opposite believe that. It's all in their heart.\"<br/>I had the sense that she would have talked until midnight. But it was getting late, and I didn't want to feel any sorrier for her than I already did, so I drove back to Phoenix with a plate of Peggy's Christmas cookies.<br/>11. Epilogue<br/>\"I'm going to do something weird,\" Rusty Bowers said. Seated at the wheel of his truck in his dirt driveway, he uttered a short prayer for our safety. Then we drove out of the Valley east into the Sierra Ancha mountains.<br/>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2021/06/08/telegraph-fire-destroys-family-cabin-arizona-house-speaker-rusty-bowers/7605077002/\">fire that took his ranch and studio</url> had burned over the escarpment and left behind the charred stumps of oak trees. The air tankers' slurry spray had just missed his house, and most of the nearby forest was gone. But a stand of ponderosa pines had survived, and the hillsides were already coming back green with manzanita shrubs and mountain mahogany. Up here, the Salt River was a narrow stream flowing through a red canyon. From the remains of the ranch, we climbed the switchbacks of a muddy road to almost 8,000 feet. On Aztec Peak, we could see across to the Superstition range and over a ridge down into Roosevelt Lake, cloud-covered, holding the water of the Salt River Project. The Valley that it fed was hidden from view.<br/>It was just before Christmas, the start of the desert winter. A few weeks earlier, the governor's water council had released its recommendations: Where rural groundwater was disappearing, the state should regulate its use, while giving each local basin a say in the rules' design. Ed Curry, the chili farmer, considered this a reasonable approach, but he was unable to move Gail Griffin, who blocked the council's bill in her House committee and instead proposed a different bill that largely left the status quo in place. The logic of partisanship gave Griffin full Republican support, but Curry warned that she was losing touch with her constituents, including some farmers. \"We're two friends in desperate disagreement about water,\" he told me. In February, 200 people-including Traci Page, whose well had gone dry-<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.myheraldreview.com/news/cochise_county/mayes-hears-concerns-from-residents-in-thirsty-willcox-and-douglas-basin/article_e9ead10c-d58c-11ee-874d-bfb1e7b48ae9.html\">crowded a community meeting near Curry's farm</url>. Many of those who spoke described themselves as conservatives, but they denounced the Dairy's irresponsible pumping, the state's inaction, and Griffin herself, who was in the room and appeared shaken by their anger. Groundwater continued to disappear much faster than it could be restored, but something was changing in people's minds, the wellsprings of democracy.<br/>Peggy Judd's voicemail had reminded me of the abuse directed at Bowers from the other extreme. As he drove, I asked what he thought of her. \"Zealously desirous to follow the cause, but not willfully desirous,\" he said, distinguishing between true believers like Judd and power-hungry manipulators, like Charlie Kirk, \"cloaked in Christian virtue and ~We're going to save America.' And that is a very dangerous thing.\" He went on, \"You will push her into the cell and then use her as a pawn for fundraising.\" Bowers believed that Satan seared consciences with hate like a hot iron until people became incapable of feeling goodness. He also believed that faith led to action, and action led to change-\"even if it's just in your character. You may not be able to change the world. You may not be able to change a forest fire. But you can act. You can choose: I will act now.\"<br/>Bowers wanted to show me a ranch that he was fantasizing about buying. We drove on a forested mountain road that ran along a stream and came to a metal barrier. On the other side, in an opening of pine trees, was a small meadow of yellow grass, an apple orchard, and a red cabin with a rusted roof and a windmill. In the sunlight, it looked like the setting of a fairy tale, beautiful and abandoned.<br/>\"Hellooo!\" Bowers called three times, but no one answered.<br/>He had an idea for what to do with the ranch if he bought it. He would build a camp for kids in the Valley-kids of all backgrounds, ethnicities, religions, but especially ones with hard lives. They would leave their phones behind and come up here in the mountains with proper chaperoning-no cussing or spitting-and learn how to make a bivouac, cook for themselves, and sit around the campfire and talk. The talking would be the main point. They would discuss water and land use, the environment, \"all the things that could afflict us today.\" It would be a kind of training in civil discourse.<br/>\"Point being, division has to be bridged in order to keep us together as a country,\" Bowers said. \"One at a time. That's why you get a little camp. Can I save all the starfish after a storm? No. But I can save this little starfish.\"<br/>We got in the truck and started the drive back down to the Valley. It was late afternoon. We'd been alone in the mountains all day, and I'd forgotten about the 5 million people just west of us. It had been a relief to be away from them all-the strip malls, the air-conditioned traffic, the swimming-pool subdivisions, the half-built factories, the pavement people in the heat zone, COVID and January 6, the believers and grifters, the endless fights in empty language over elections and migrants and schools and everything else. But now I realized that I was ready to go back. That was our civilization down in the Valley, the only one we had. Better for it to be there than gone.<br/><br/>This article appears in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/toc/2024/07/?utm_source=feed\">July/August 2024</url> print edition with the headline \"The Valley.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLANT-phoenixclimatedroughtrepublicanpolitics678494</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLANT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C8W-H061-DYY9-J1SD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">368376</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"24006\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

November is on track to become the state's deadliest month of the pandemic, with 625 fatalities in 19 days. That accounts for 20% of the 3,082 deaths so far. The entire month of May saw 696 die from COVID-19 complications.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It pains me beyond belief to know, with almost certainty, that each day I am going to stand in front of you and tell you that we have another record number of deaths,\" Gov. Tim Walz said at a Thursday afternoon news conference.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The number of new confirmed coronavirus cases in the state was the second-highest reported so far, with 7,877 additional infections, bringing the state's total to 249,906.</p><p>The surge in cases and deaths is affecting the state's hospitals and causing state health officials to question their approach to investigating and tracing the flood of illness that is sweeping across Minnesota.</p><p>As was predicted, the expanding pool of people infected with the new coronavirus has disrupted business as usual.</p><p>\"As an emergency physician right now, this has been one of the hardest times in my life,\" said Dr. Carolyn McClain, who is on the board of the Minnesota Medical Association.</p><p>She recently had to tell a patient who had shortness of breath that he had tested positive for COVID-19.</p><p>\"When you do that to someone in their nineties, they know what that means,\" she said, adding that the patient told her, \" 'I don't think I've been this scared since I fought in Korea.' \"</p><p>Days later, he died.</p><p>\"I am watching people die, and that is hard, and it has been going on for a long time,\" she said.</p><p>McClain was among three health care professionals who spoke at Thursday's news conference, asking state residents to follow pandemic safety guidelines, especially as hospitals scramble to cope with new patients.</p><p>\"Don't call health care workers heroes if you can't put a piece of cloth or paper over your face to protect them,\" said Dr. Cindy Firkins Smith, co-CEO of Carris Health, which serves west central and southwestern Minnesota.</p><p>Carris and its parent company, CentraCare, have 1,200 workers out due to either COVID-19 infection, quarantining because of a high-risk COVID-19 exposure or caring for a sick family member.</p><p>\"Because the virus is so widespread in our communities, they are catching it just like anyone else,\" said Smith.</p><p>Forty-two percent of the patients at the Carris Health Rice Memorial Hospital in Willmar are there because of COVID-19. The test positivity rate in the city is 30%.</p><p>For 10 of the first 11 days of November, the hospital diverted patients to other hospitals because there was no bed space.</p><p>\"This is an historically unprecedented number,\" said Smith.</p><p>Carris officials are shifting patients among hospitals to free up those beds that are needed for the most critical patients while still giving care to those who don't have COVID-19.</p><p>\"It's musical hospital beds,\" she said.</p><p>In one week, the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations statewide has shot up 25% to a record 1,751. Of those, 367 need intensive care to stay alive. About 80% of the state's ICU beds are occupied, according to the state's pandemic response dashboard.</p><p>With diversions, the system is handling most of the demand, but that might not last if COVID-19 cases continue to increase.</p><p>\"We are perilously close to not even be able to collectively ... take care of everybody that we need to take care of in this state,\" said Dr. Penny Wheeler, chief executive of Allina Health, where 24% of its patients have COVID-19.</p><p>\"We have over 800 [workers] out at Allina,\" she said. \"There's no surge of other providers available.\"</p><p>CentraCare, announced Thursday that each of its hospitals would serve a dedicated function to take pressure off its flagship hospital in St. Cloud.</p><p>\"At St. Cloud Hospital, approximately 30 percent of our patients are positive with COVID-19. The additional resources needed to care for these patients is stretching this location,\" said Dr. George Morris, CentraCare incident command physician.</p><p>While the St. Cloud location will continue to care for COVID-19 patients with the greatest needs, the Sauk Centre hospital will primarily care for COVID-positive patients who do not require ventilators or high-volume oxygen.</p><p>CentraCare's Melrose and Long Prairie hospitals will shift to non-COVID care, while its Monticello hospital will expand COVID-19 capacity.</p><p>Bloomington-based HealthPartners said Thursday that 92% of its ICU beds were occupied, while 87% of its general medical/surgical beds were full. Patients with COVID-19 were using about 30.5% of all occupied beds, according to a HealthPartners spokesman, and about 48% of all ICU beds.</p><p>HealthPartners, which operates Regions Hospital in St. Paul and eight other hospitals, also imposed a no-visitor policy as other hospitals have done.</p><p>Most people who need hospital-level care have underlying health conditions, including hypertension, diabetes, obesity or congestive heart failure.</p><p>Many people who become infected with COVID-19 have mild symptoms or don't experience any symptoms, but they still can be infectious to others. About 198,400 of those who were sickened are considered to be past the infectious stage and no longer need to be isolated.</p><p>Cases are growing so fast in some counties that investigations into new COVID-19 infections have been suspended.</p><p>\"As we continue to witness record-setting increases, Olmsted County Public Health Services does not have the capacity to continue conducting case investigations and contact tracing for every individual who tests positive for COVID-19,\" the southeastern Minnesota county said in a statement earlier this week.</p><p>Itasca County, in northern Minnesota, made a similar announcement last week.</p><p>\"If you are in a group setting, just assume that someone has COVID,\" said Kelly Chandler, department manager for Itasca County Public Health, which is focusing its efforts on protecting high-risk settings such as schools, child care facilities and long-term care.</p><p>Minnesota Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said that her department is evaluating how it will handle contact tracing in order to put \"resources into where they have the biggest impact.\"</p><p>\"The time when contact tracing works the best is when you are really able to focus on hot spots,\" she said. \"It is really hard to even find hot spots in the middle of a raging forest fire.\"</p><p>Staff writer Christopher Snowbeck contributed to this report.</p><p>Glenn Howatt \u00b7 612-673-7192</p><p>TRACKING CORONAVIRUS</p><p>Minnesota cases, daily change*</p><p>249,906 -- Total cases</p><p>7,877 -- Nov. 19 new cases</p><p>Minnesota deaths, new daily</p><p>3,082 -- Total deaths</p><p>72 -- Nov. 19</p><p>Note: The Minnesota Department of Health did not update numbers on July 4.</p><p>*Chart data is a net count of daily total new cases minus previously-announced cases that were removed by MDH.</p><p>U.S. cases, new daily</p><p>11,613,875 -- Total cases</p><p>172,391 -- Nov. 18</p><p>U.S. deaths, new daily</p><p>250,409 -- Total deaths</p><p>1,923 -- Nov. 18</p><p>(See the page PDF or microfilm for the complete charts.)</p><p>Note: U.S. data lags a day behind Minnesota</p><p>Sources: New York Times, Minnesota Dept. of Health</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRIB-MERLIN60441573</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRIB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61BH-VPV1-JC8F-K2DR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8384</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-11-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1208\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Star Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN)</publicationName><edition>METRO EDITION</edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"11\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>November 20, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>DISEASE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>DEATH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>RECORD</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp;

Forecasters advise the smoke can be dangerous to older people, youngsters and those with health issues like asthma and heart conditions.                 </p><p>                   A Code Orange alert is in effect for the Atlanta area, issued at midweek by the Environmental Protection Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. The warning means ozone in the air is unhealthy for the elderly and young children who are sensitive to ozone and those with asthma, heart or lung disease.

In recent weeks, the smoke from those fires has spread through the Midwest and North Atlantic states, pushing ever southward and eastward.                 </p><p>                   \"There is smoke coming, but it doesn't look at thick as it is as far north,\" said Vaughn Smith, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Peachtree City. \"I see it on the satellite, but I don't think it's going to be much of an issue for Georgia residents.\"                 </p><p>                   Of greater health concern is the unrelenting heat. The NWS/Peachtree City advises on Twitter that the Atlanta area will swelter this weekend in the hottest temperatures so far this summer, with heat-index values predicted to exceed 105-degrees Fahrenheit.                 </p><p>                   Numerous health issues can be associated with exposure to air pollution, like that in wildfire smoke, said Jeremy Sarnat, associate professor of environmental health at the Emory University Rollins School of Public Health.                 </p><p>                   Breathing the smoke can acutely exacerbate health and lung problems in people who have cardio-respiratory diseases such as COPD, asthma and heart disease, he said.                 </p><p>                   As a result \"we see an increase in hospital admissions, emergency department visits on days when those pollutants are elevated and an increase in mortality rates,\" Sarnat said.                 </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ajc.com/peachtree/peachtree-road-race-2023-tips-for-running-in-extreme-heat/4ZNXWGLM27EDV5WZ2ALEXQRDYI/\">Cool tips for running in high temperatures</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cdc.gov/air/infographics/information-about-local-air-quality.htm\">How do I get information about air quality where I live?</url></p><p>                   Dr. Cecil Bennett, medical director for Newnan Family Medicine, said those at the two extremes of age - the very young and the elderly - and those with underlying health conditions are at greater risk if exposed for very long periods.                 </p><p>                   \"It's still early in the summer, so we're not seeing a large number of patients with acute heat injuries such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke,\" he said. Heat exhaustion is the inability of the body to regulate heat properly and signs include profuse sweating, extreme thirst, nausea and perhaps confusion.                 </p><p>                   That person should get to a cool location and slowly lower their body temperature by spraying or being sprayed with water, pouring water over their head or drinking water, he said.                 </p><p>                   More serious is heat stroke, a condition in which the body can no longer produce sweat. Symptoms include dry skin and a dramatically elevated heart rate, confusion and even loss of consciousness.                 </p><p>                   These are \"signs that 911 needs to be called immediately,\" Bennett said                 </p><p>                   He advised limiting activities in very high temperatures. \"If you have to do something, it should be done during the day.\" And, he added, those with underlying conditions should wear a mask outdoors.                 </p><p>                   For those who have jobs that require them to be outside for long periods of times, experts say they should take cool-down breaks and drink plenty of water.                 </p><p>                   Those with asthma should keep their inhaler close by, drink plenty of fluids and close their windows to keep out dirty outdoor air.                 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>hot weather, Construction workers takes a break in Atlanta's Krog District during high temperatures last summer.(Arvin Temkar / <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:arvin.temkar@ajc.com\">arvin.temkar@ajc.com</email>)</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLJOL-B5U5VGKMCZE57OGMB3WGM6MUC4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLJOL2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68K6-18M1-DYB2-P1J3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">474865</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"901\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Atlanta Journal Constitution Online</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"21036\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 29, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0EyOTJDQzRFNDdENDI4MEI4N0E4NTBDQzVGOTVDNDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000125</classCode><className>ASTHMA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001481</classCode><className>RESPIRATORY DISORDERS &amp;

Thirteen firefighters have been injured in Bordezac, the village where the fire started. Overall, 18 firefighters have been injured amid several forest fires that have burned for days in the region, according to France Info. Unfavorable weather conditions - drought, heat and strong winds - are complicating efforts to contain the blaze in the Gard region, but its fire service said prospects were \"more favorable\" today. Other smaller fires have been extinguished. The service said more than 1,500 acres have burned so far. Nearby villages have been evacuated and highways closed as more than 900 firefighters and two planes fought the flames. Laurent Joseph, a top official in the neighboring Bouches-du-Rhone region, told BFM TV that authorities expect to deal with the fire \"for several days.\" The fire threaten the C\u00c3\u00a9vennes, a mountainous region partially protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site that crosses a large section of southeast France. France's national meteorological service put several neighboring areas on red alert today for fire risks, and France's environment ministry warned citizens in the area to pay careful attention to fire risks.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-00000181ddf2dd6fa7ebfffb4c190000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6639-2HJ1-JBSK-R46N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"224\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"07\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>July 8, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOAM</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTER ALERTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp; NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0009XT1</classCode><className>METEOROLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>N924120QC</classCode><className>OCEANOGRAPHIC &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>ST00098X3</classCode><className>CUSTOMS &amp; CULTURAL HERITAGE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS0008X1Y</classCode><className>LANGUEDOC-ROUSSILLON, FRANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GS0008X36</classCode><className>PROVENCE-ALPES-COTE D'AZUR, FRANCE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>GC317</classCode><className>FRANCE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Detroit, a mostly Black city with a poverty rate of about 30%, had some of the worst air quality in the U.S. on Wednesday, prompting the Environmental Protection Agency to warn that \"everyone should stay indoors.\"</p><p>\"The more breaths you're taking, you're inhaling, literally, a fire, camp smoke, into your lungs,\" said Darren Riley, who was diagnosed with asthma in 2018, a few years after arriving in Detroit.</p><p>\"Many communities face this way too often,\" said Riley, who is Black. \"And while this wildfire smoke allows, unfortunately, many people to feel this burden, this is a burden that far too long communities have faced day in and day out.\"</p><p>The EPA's AirNow.gov site showed cities including Chicago, Detroit, Indianapolis and Cleveland, Ohio, had \"very unhealthy air\" as of Wednesday afternoon. A wider circle of unhealthy air spread into Pittsburgh, St. Louis and Louisville, Kentucky.</p><p>Earlier this month, smoke from the wildfires blanketed the U.S. East Coast for days.</p><p>Another round of drifting smoke from the wildfires was moving through western Pennsylvania and central New York and headed toward the Mid-Atlantic, said National Weather Service meteorologist Byran Jackson. In Canada, smoke will migrate across Quebec and Ontario over the next few days, Environment and Climate Change Canada meteorologist Steven Flisfeder said.</p><p>Detroit's southwest side is home to a number of sprawling refineries and manufacturing plants. It is one of the poorest parts of the city. According to a 2022 report by the American Lung Association, the city's long- and short-term particle pollution ranked among the worst in the nation.</p><p>\"Being close to those refineries \u2014 that's an environmental factor that's difficult to control,\" said Dr. Ruma Srivastava, a pediatric pulmonologist at Children's Hospital of Michigan in Detroit. \"It does increase their risk for asthma flareups. For them, it's even more important to follow the (air quality safety) recommendations.\"</p><p>Riley's own experiences prompted him to start JustAir, which provides air pollution monitoring.</p><p>\"Just because you're born in a certain ZIP code or you're born into a certain family with a certain skin color doesn't mean that you should have an unequal go at it,\" he said.</p><p>Elsewhere, Milwaukee County Emergency Medical Services saw a spike in calls for residents with respiratory complaints, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. Office of Emergency Management data show a disproportionate amount of calls for respiratory issues\u00a0\u2014 54.8%\u00a0\u2014 have been for Black people in Milwaukee, according to the newspaper. Milwaukee County's population is 27.1% Black.</p><p>In Chicago, where about 29% of the population is Black, Mayor Brandon Johnson urged young people, older adults and residents with health issues to spend more time indoors. He pledged \"swift action to ensure that vulnerable individuals have the resources they need to protect themselves and their families.\"</p><p>Minnesota issued a record 23rd air quality alert for the year through late Wednesday night, as smoky skies obscured the skylines of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Michigan, Wisconsin and Indiana were among other states issuing air quality alerts, and cities including Louisville also advised people to limit prolonged or intense outdoor activity.</p><p>\"This is particularly thick smoke,\" said Jackson, with the National Weather Service.</p><p>Across Canada, 490 fires are burning, with 255 of them considered to be out of control. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre reported Monday that 29,393 square miles of land including forests has burned across Canada since Jan. 1. That exceeds the previous record set in 1989 of 29,187 square miles, according to the National Forestry Database.</p><p>\"As long as the fires are burning and the smoke is in the atmosphere it is going to be a concern not just for Canadians but Americans as well,\" said Flisfeder, the Canadian meteorologist.</p><p>The small particles in wildfire smoke can irritate the eyes, nose and throat, and can affect the heart and lungs, making it harder to breathe. Health officials say it's important to limit outdoor activities to avoid breathing in the particles.</p><p>The warming planet will produce hotter and longer heat waves, making for bigger, smokier fires, said Joel Thornton, professor and chair of the department of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington.</p><p>Quentin Hernandez, a 24-year-old event planner from Detroit, was out skateboarding for about an hour Wednesday at a skate park near the Ambassador Bridge, which connects the city and Windsor, Ontario.</p><p>\"It just sits like this all day,\" said Hernandez, saying that it smelled like being at a barbecue. \"Literally, the smoke just sits in the air.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BISTRB-10833877</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BISTRB2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69GK-2PH1-F039-F1GM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"845\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Bismarck Tribune, a division of Lee Enterprises All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Bismarck Tribune</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 29, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC000DCR5</classCode><className>ENVISION HEALTHCARE HOLDINGS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS622110 GENERAL MEDICAL &amp;

We are likely to lose forests from some areas in the western U.S. due to these disturbances, but much of this depends on how quickly we tackle climate change.\"</p><p>The researchers modeled the risk of tree death from fire, climate stress (heat and/or drought) and insect damage for forests throughout the U.S., projecting how those risks might increase over the course of the 21st century.</p><p>By 2099, the models found that U.S. forest fire risks may increase by between four and 14 times, depending on different carbon emissions scenarios. The risks of climate stress-related tree death and insect mortality may roughly double over the same time.</p><p>But in those same models, human actions to tackle climate change mattered enormously, reducing the severity of climate change dramatically reduced the fire, drought and insect-driven forest die-off.</p><p>\"Climate change is going to supercharge these three big disturbances in the U.S.,\" Anderegg said.</p><p>\"We've seen devastating fire seasons with increasing severity in the past several years. Generally, we expect the western U.S. to be hit hardest by all three of these. And they're somewhat interconnected too. Really hot and dry years, driven by climate change, tend to drive lots of fires, climate-driven tree mortality and insect outbreaks. But we have an opportunity here too. Addressing climate change quickly can help keep our forests and landscapes healthy.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">This story was provided to Newsweek by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.zenger.news/\">Zenger News</url>.</emphasis></emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2047259/fires-palermo-italy.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Fires in PalermoItaly</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>vigilfuoco.tv/Zenger</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Firefighters staged a desperate stand against forest fires raging in Italy by soaking trees and grasslands to create a fire break.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWKCOM-1710983</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWKCOM2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65JB-NJ01-JBR6-91SV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472435</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-05-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"520\"/><timeReceived>3:08 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright \u00a9 2022 Newsweek Inc.

While the Golden State leads the nation in its efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions primarily tied to agriculture, fossil fuel extraction and landfills, new research published in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics shows the 2020 wildfire season emitted nearly 14 percent of the state's methane budget. The findings threaten California's ambitious goal of slashing air pollution and achieving carbon neutrality by 2045 , according to Francesca Hopkins, an environmental scientist and the study's co-author. Based on methods from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the state's air quality managers are tracking emissions only from human-caused sources, and wildfire is considered a natural source. </p><p>\"The problem is that the atmosphere doesn't care where the emissions are coming from, if it's coming from human activities or a natural source like a forest fire,\" Hopkins said. \"If we were to take this into account, we need to be even more ambitious with our reductions of anthropogenic sources to have the similar intended climate effect.\" Hopkins said the research focused on the 2020 wildfire season that was unprecedented in its severity. Carbon dioxide emissions in 20 fires that year were 10 times higher than the average annual emissions between 2000 and 2019. As wildfires burn hotter, faster and more frequently due to drought and higher temperatures, it will be important to consider the impacts of these events on air quality, the study's authors conclude. Wildfires are part of an ongoing emissions cycle, Hopkins said. In California especially, a warming climate caused in part by greenhouse gases such as methane and CO2 is exacerbating the frequency and severity of wildland fires. And as these fires burn, more air pollutants are emitted into the atmosphere. \"The only way we can arrest these cycles is by reducing human-driven emissions,\" she said. Pollutants from wildfires that scientists are monitoring include particulate matter, carbon monoxide and methane, all of which have public health impacts. Methane, especially, contributes to ground-level ozone formation and is 80 times more potent than CO2 in its contribution to global warming. Using a novel detection method allowed the team of researchers to measure emissions downwind from the Sequoia Lightning Fire Complex in the Sierra Nevada. The ground-based solar spectrometer, a portable tool, is able to calculate the amounts of different gases in smoke columns based on absorption bands from the sun. Most previous studies relied on aircraft to enter the region during a fire, which is not only expensive but also limits the data, Hopkins said. \"We already know that when fires burn, they have a very different combustion ratio depending on the conditions, whether it's smoldering or whether it's really flaming,\" she said. \"The snapshot measurements by aircraft only gives you part of the picture. With this technique, we're seeing the total column, an integrated plume that represents what the fire has been emitting for a longer period of time.\" Much of California has seen a reprieve from drought conditions this winter amid record-breaking snowpack (Climatewire , April 4). So far, forecasters with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and the National Interagency Fire Center's Predictive Services are predicting lower-than-normal fire potential in the state through July. Still, as temperatures climb and the state's snowpack melts, it's likely that conditions will be ripe for more wildfire. As of April 10, state and federal units have responded to 340 wildland fires spanning more than 10 acres this year. \"Having this extra methane source just complicates the issue,\" Hopkins said. \"To me, it's just all the more impetus for us to tackle methane as quickly as we can.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-000001878f6fd5beafa7ffff2f6c0001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:687M-TH81-JBSK-R2D8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"664\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"04\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>April 17, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The trick is not to have too many false alarms because the cameras are so sensitive.\"</p><p>Wildfires result in loss of life, property and crops, as well as billions in economic costs to prevent, mitigate and suppress the damage. Yet they are notoriously difficult to rapidly detect and accurately locate at the time of ignition, when counter measures are most effective.</p><p>Combining programmable high-definition cameras and image processing software, the computerised ForestWatch(R) system uses a mathematical algorithm to analyse imagery of the landscape, automatically detecting changes that may be the first whiffs of smoke. When the system identifies a smoke, it alerts the human operator at a control centre.</p><p>EVS has deployed 340 camera systems so far around the world, mainly in South Africa and North America, with trials underway in Australia, Chile, China, Indonesia, Greece and Spain. These have substantially reduced commercial forest wildfire losses.</p><p>Satellite burn-scar data demonstrates that in South African regions where ForestWatch(R) was deployed, approximately 120,000 hectares of forest have been saved between 2014-2021. This equates to a total commercial saving of approximately pound sterling1 billion in South Africa alone from 2014 to 2020.</p><p>This equates to a total commercial saving of approximately pound sterling1 billion and CO2 reduction of 27 million tonnes, valued at pound sterling1.2 billion, in South Africa alone in the period 2014 to 2020.</p><p>EVS USA has deployed 137 ForestWatch(R) systems in North America, including Alberta, Saskatchewan, California and Oregon. In North America, it is estimated that ForestWatch(R) systems have saved pound sterling1.6 billion in timber in timber and 38 million tonnes of CO2, valued at pound sterling1.9 billion in the period 2014 to 2020.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/news/saving-forests-using-a-fire-detection-system-based-on-lancaster-research\">https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/news/saving-forests-using-a-fire-detection-system-based-on-lancaster-research</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-8103632 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8103632</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67VN-NSS1-DYG2-R4WD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"559\"/><timeReceived>1:17 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"03\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>March 18, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

No fires have been found on the RRSNF. Additional firefighting resources including engines, water tenders and hand crews continue to be available for quick response and aggressive initial attack on fire starts throughout RRSNF or to assist neighboring fire agencies.</p><p>Several resources have been shared with other agencies to assist with initial attack:</p><p>* Two Type 1 helicopters provided assistance on fires on the Fremont-Winema National Forest. One remains assigned to the Crane Fire in Lake County.</p><p>* Type 2 Initial Attack Crew is assisting in the Sky Lakes Wilderness on the Fremont-Winema National Forest.</p><p>* An Air Attack platform provided relief on the Warm Springs Reservation.</p><p>* Siskiyou Rappellers were dispatched to the Willamette National Forest and returned.</p><p>This time of year fire agencies really rely on the conscientious efforts by residents and visitors. Fire danger truly is HIGH. The fuels in the forest are very receptive to a fire starting. The grass, leaves, duff and smaller trees can ignite easily with just a spark.</p><p>HIGH fire danger continues today, but the RRSNF begins EXTREME fire danger tomorrow. Watch for further information later today. Check fire restrictions each time before going out to recreate and follow the fire prevention restrictions to help limit possible fire starts. Report fires or any activity that could result in a fire starting.

Westwick urged residents in other areas to leave by noon Friday.</p><p>\"I want to be clear that the city is not in immediate danger and there's a safe window for residents to leave the city by road and by air,\" Shane Thompson, a government minister for the Territories, told a news conference. \"Without rain, it is possible it will reach the city outskirts by the weekend.\"</p><p>Evacuating such a large number of people is \"going to be tough,\" but people were cooperating and staying calm, Westwick said.</p><p>Canada has seen a record number of wildfires this year - contributing to choking smoke in parts of the U.S. - with more than 5,700 fires burning more than 53,000 square miles from one end of Canada to the other, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. As of Thursday, 1,053 wildfires were burning across the country, more than half of them out of control.</p><p>In the Northwest Territories alone, 268 wildfires have already burned more than 8,100 square miles.</p><p>Thursday's evacuation of Yellowknife was by far the largest so far this year, said Ken McMullen, president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs and fire chief in Red Deer, Alberta.</p><p>\"It's one of those events where you need to get people out sooner rather than later,\" because fire could block the only escape route before ever reaching the community.</p><p>Resident Angela Canning was packing up her camper with important documents, family keepsakes and basic necessities and leaving with her two dogs, while her husband stayed behind as an essential worker.</p><p>\"I'm really anxious and I'm scared. I'm emotional... I'm in shock,\" she told The Canadian Press. \"I don't know what I'm coming home to or if I'm coming home. There's just so much unknowns here.\"</p><p>At the Big River Service Station about 185 miles south of Yellowknife, the line of vehicles waiting for fuel was \"phenomenal,\" employee Linda Croft said. \"You can't see the end of it.\"</p><p>About 6,800 people in eight other communities in the territory have already been forced to evacuate their homes, including the small community of Enterprise, which was largely destroyed. Officials said everyone made it out alive.</p><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was convening an urgent meeting with ministers and senior officials Thursday to discuss the evacuation.</p><p>Authorities said the intensive care unit at a Yellowknife hospital would close within 24 hours as the Northwest Territories health authority starts to reduce its services. In-patient units from Stanton Territorial Hospital would be moved in the coming days, if required, and most long-term care patients were transferred to institutions to the south, the Health and Social Services Authority said on its website.</p><p>Officials said evacuations have so far been safe and orderly, and that evacuees from Yellowknife who can't find their own accommodations can get support in three centers in the province of Alberta. The closest of those centers is more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) by road from Yellowknife.</p><p>Officials in Calgary said they're preparing to take in thousands of evacuees, and are opening a reception center at the Calgary airport, where five evacuation flights were expected to arrive Thursday. A second center has been set up at a hotel for those who drive to the city, said Iain Bushell, the city's director of emergency management.</p><p>Only those who cannot leave by road should register for the evacuation flights, officials added. People who are immunocompromised or have conditions that put them at higher risk also were encouraged to sign up.</p><p>\"We're all tired of the word unprecedented, yet there is no other way to describe this situation in the Northwest Territories,\" Premier Caroline Cochrane posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. She urged residents to obey emergency management officials, traffic control devices and posted speed limits.</p><p>The evacuation order issued Wednesday night applies to the city of Yellowknife and the neighboring First Nations communities of Ndilo and Dettah.</p><p>Indigenous communities have been hit hard by the wildfires, which threaten important cultural activities such as hunting, fishing and gathering native plants.</p><p>Amy Cardinal Christianson, an Indigenous fire specialist with Parks Canada, has said the wildfires \"are so dangerous and so fast-moving\" that evacuations increasingly are necessary, which is a challenge in remote communities where there might be one road in, or no roads at all.</p><p>Officials in British Columbia, where about 370 fires were burning, also braced for more evacuations, with the weather forecast for the next few days predicting dry lightning that could spark new blazes and brisk winds that could change direction quickly.</p><p>Cliff Chapman, director of provincial operations at the province's Wildfire Service, urged anyone at risk to pack a \"grab-and-go\" bag and to respect any evacuation orders.</p><p>The U.S. has also seen devastating wildfires, including fires last week on the Hawaiian island of Maui that killed more than 100 people and destroyed a historic town.</p><p>Rural areas near California's border with Oregon were placed under evacuation orders Wednesday after gusty winds from a thunderstorm sent a lightning-sparked wildfire racing through national forest lands, authorities said.</p><p>Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

The training is an example of how DEM is building capacity for local wildfire response.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The destructive, almost simultaneous wildfires that occurred in West Greenwich and Exeter in April have heightened public awareness of wildfires. In 2022, which was marked by a severe drought, the state experienced more than 80 wildfires. These fires are expected to become more frequent as climate change continues to create warmer, drier conditions, leading to longer and more active fire seasons.</p><p>MEDIA AVAILABILITY</p><p>What: Observing municipal firefighters and DEM employees being trained in specialized techniques to fight wildfires including demonstrations on firing devices, fire line construction, water use, and mop-up.</p><p>When: Wednesday, June 7, 10 AM-3 PM</p><p>Where: The DEM George Washington Management Area 2185 Putnam Pike, Chepachet, RI 02814</p><p>The course includes in-class teaching and in-field training, which will offer the best action shots. The field is located behind the management area's office building.</p><p>Misc. This is an outdoor availability that is contingent on the weather. DEM will notify of any changes due to weather. Please RVSP via Mike Healey, 401-258-0787, or <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Michael.Healey@dem.ri.gov\">Michael.Healey@dem.ri.gov</email></p><p>\"DEM's Forest Fire Program works closely with Rhode Island fire departments to suppress wildfires,\" said Principal Forest Ranger and Training Officer Ben Arnold of the DEM Division of Agriculture and Forest Environment. \"We rely on municipal fire departments to fight wildfires and fire departments rely on us in the same way. This training will allow us to build the capacity needed to address the increasing wildfire activity we've seen in recent years. The program offers an opportunity to both DEM employees and Rhode Island firefighters who seek wildfire suppression training at the national standard.\"</p><p>Earlier this year, DEM announced a policy of increasing the use of prescribed fires in 2023. Arnold noted that training firefighters is one of the major goals of prescribed fires, so the training course aligns with DEM's forest management strategy. \"We strongly believe that more planned, prescribed fires mean fewer unplanned, extreme wildfires,\" Arnold said.</p><p>Description/explanation of terms used in wildland firefighter training:</p><p>o Firing devices: Wildland firefighters often use firing operations to control fires by \"backfiring\" or burning out to consume fuel between a control line and the main body of a fire. Drip torches, fusees, and other items are considered primary firing devices. A drip torch allows the burning fuel to drip onto the vegetation where the firefighter wants it to burn. Essentially, a fusee is a torch used to light fires. Fusees burn phosphorous contained within the body of the device.</p><p>o Fire line construction: A fire line is a break in fuel made by cutting, scraping, or digging. It can be done by mechanized equipment such as bulldozers one of which was used very effectively at the Exeter wildfire in April but in most wildfires, it is done using hand tools. In building a fire line, all fuels are removed, and the surface is scraped to mineral soil on a strip of a specified size depending on the fuel and slope. It needs to be wide enough to prevent smoldering, burning, or spotting by embers blowing or rolling across the line.</p><p>o Water use: Unlike a housefire on an urban or suburban street where firefighters can connect hose to fire hydrants and spray massive amounts of water until the fire is extinguished, water is very much at a premium at a wildfire and a wildland firefighter must know where and how to use each component of their water delivery system. The course will instruct on backpack pumps, hose, nozzles, simple and progressive hose lays, and appliances used for water application.</p><p>o Mop-up: For wildland firefighters, mopping up describes the hard, physical labor process of extinguishing or removing burning material near fire lines down to the mineral soil, felling fire-damaged trees, and cooling hot spots to make a fire line less likely to escape or to reduce residual smoke. This is followed up by \"cold-trailing\" with the back of one's hand along the ground near the fire line to make sure no heat remains.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125945032</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DF-1GB1-JCBF-S023-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"751\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 6, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

'We are looking for the place where we belong, where we feel seen, and where we feel heard, and where we can be ourselves, where we aren't judged for that. And I think that was something else that spoke to me.' <br/> 'Wolf Pack' has updated the monster metaphors Sarah Michelle Gellar loved on 'Buffy, the Vampire Slayer'<br/> Wolf Pack  is about a group of teenagers who meet during a forest fire that awakens their lupine tendencies. Gellar saw parallels between the ways  Wolf Pack  and  Buffy, the Vampire Slayerhandled childhood. <br/>When I read the script, and when I spoke with [creator] Jeff [Davis], and we spoke about the issues that he wanted to speak about, mainly anxiety and depression among children, specifically having a lot to do with their use of devices, and sort of the lack of connectivity that the youth has today. It is something that I think about all the time. It is so prominent. A big study came out yesterday linking the effects of depression and the brain synapses directly to this. I thought what a great allegory to use these horrors to speak about the horrors that we are facing now. <br/>The forest fire part isn't a metaphor.

This change allows forest users to resume having fires in the developed campgrounds that are still open, as well as to engage in recreational shooting on forest lands. Campfires at dispersed sites are still prohibited under Stage 1 fire restrictions.</p><p>Details on Current Fire Restrictions</p><p>Though fire danger is moderating in some higher elevation areas, much of the forest is still in high fire danger conditions. With no rain forecast for the coming weeks, fire danger may actually increase in some lower elevation areas.</p><p>\"Our fire restrictions follow a prevention plan, which uses fire danger ratings (indices) and historic fire data to inform timing and levels of fire restrictions based on actual conditions on the ground. The days may be cooler and shorter, but the fuel conditions and fire indices are still showing high fire danger and potential for large fires,\" says Forest Fire Staff Officer Kyle Cannon. \"Our crews have responded to multiple new starts over the last week, as well as reports of illegal campfires. Please help our firefighters out by knowing and following current fire restrictions.\"</p><p>Campfires are a highlight of camping for many, especially during fall hunting trips. There are a number of propane and gas campfire alternative now available. These devices are still allowed on the forest during fire restrictions, even at dispersed sites. Just be sure to use them in an area free of vegetation.</p><p>*The rest of the document can be viewed at:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/okawen/news-events/?cid=FSEPRD1066786\">https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/okawen/news-events/?cid=FSEPRD1066786</url> For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:contentservices@htlive.com\">contentservices@htlive.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USFDNW-PR4217575</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USFDNW2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66MM-0DW1-F12F-F023-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">282801</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-10-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"322\"/><timeReceived>8:58 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 HT Media Ltd.

All the labs have to test for different things,\" Sanguedolce said. \"So the fact that we have multiple types of deadly opioids out there is extremely concerning.\"</p><p>Tranq emerging in region</p><p>Fentanyl, which has already inundated the local opioid market, has contributed to a surge of drug overdoses in recent years, resulting in a record 205 fatalities in 2021, up from 179 in 2020, according to the Luzerne County Coroner's Office.</p><p>Last year saw a slight improvement, with 174 fatal overdoses recorded \u2014 but 77% of them were still fentanyl related, Coroner Jill Matthews said.</p><p>That rate is even higher than the national average \u2014 the Drug Enforcement Administration reports that of the 107,735 Americans who overdosed between August 2021 and August 2022, 66% involved synthetic opioids like fentanyl.</p><p>Locally, tranq is now also emerging as a danger for users \u2014 Matthews said that of the 98 confirmed fatal overdoses recorded so far this year, 21 cases have involved xylazine. By comparison, xylazine was present in 24 of the 174 overdoses last year, she said.</p><p>\"If 2023 continues to stay on pace I expect to surpass the 2022 total cases where xylazine is present,\" Matthews said. \"I would note that in these two years, it has always been present in conjunction with fentanyl (one case was para-fluorofentanyl). We have not had any cases where an overdose could be attributed to xylazine alone.\"</p><p>Matthews said her office has not yet documented any overdoses attributable to nitazenes, but she said the laboratory it uses, NMS Labs, only recently began testing for that class of drugs, including metonitazene, protonitazene, isotonitazene, N-pyrrolidino protonitazene, N-desethyl isotonitazene, and N-pyrrolidino etonitazene.</p><p>Similarly, Lackawanna County saw 91 fatal overdoses last year, 56 of which involved fentanyl, according to numbers provided by Coroner Timothy Rowland. Fentanyl also contributed to the deaths of 18 of the 22 people who have overdosed so far this year, the data show.</p><p>And while there were no cases of xylazine overdoses in Lackawanna County last year, there have already been two since August this year, according to the data.</p><p>Cases cropping up</p><p>The fentanyl-xylazine mixtures observed by the coroner's office are typical of what law enforcement is also seeing on the streets. While there have been a limited number of cases locally with the new opioids, they have begun cropping up.</p><p>Earlier this year, Plymouth resident Clayton Leroy Knorr, 42, was sentenced to serve up to 10 1/2  years in state prison on drug and witness retaliation charges after prosecutors alleged he tried to kill his ex-girlfriend by slipping her a \"hot shot\" containing heroin, fentanyl and xylazine.</p><p>Sanguedolce said newer drugs like fentanyl and xylazine have legitimate purposes but are being misused by addicts and dealers alike. Xylazine, for example, is a tranquilizer being ingested by people who weigh a fraction of the weight of the intended recipient.</p><p>\"The fact of the matter is heavy people are typically one quarter of the weight of a horse,\" Sanguedolce said. \"Fentanyl was basically designed for people that already have a pretty high resistance to heroin, so they're looking for something stronger than heroin. Whereas a person who has no experience with heroin that comes in contact with fentanyl, I would imagine it's like a person who doesn't drink suddenly trying a dozen shots of whisky \u2014 except this is far more deadly.\"</p><p>The growing threat recently prompted the DEA to issue a warning about a \"sharp increase\" in fentanyl \u2014 which is primarily trafficked into the U.S. by the Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels \u2014 being mixed with xylazine.</p><p>\"Xylazine is making the deadliest drug threat our country has ever faced, fentanyl, even deadlier,\" DEA Administrator Anne Milgram said in a statement. \"DEA has seized xylazine and fentanyl mixtures in 48 of 50 States. The DEA Laboratory System is reporting that in 2022 approximately 23% of fentanyl powder and 7% of fentanyl pills seized by the DEA contained xylazine.\"</p><p>To make matters worse, Narcan, which is typically used to reverse the effects of an opioid overdose, is ineffective against xylazine because it is not an opioid, according to the DEA.</p><p>In contrast nitazene, which is a synthetic opioid, was first identified in the Midwest in 2019 and has now spread to the South as well as the East Coast. The DEA warns the drug is now being mixed with heroin and/or fentanyl and sold as other drugs in an effort to create a more potent and cheaper product.</p><p>The drug, which appears yellow, brown, or off-white in powder form, has also been pressed into counterfeit pills and marketed as pharmaceutical medication such as oxycodone \u2014 with deadly results, according to the DEA.</p><p>\"Tragically, many of these overdose victims have no idea they are ingesting these dangerous and extremely potent drugs,\" the DEA warned in June 2022. \"These synthetic opioids currently can only be properly identified after a lab test, so people don't realize they're buying them until it's too late.\"</p><p>Fentanyl remains the biggest problem</p><p>Sanguedolce said that while fentanyl remains the primary threat to Northeast Pennsylvania, he expects the newer drugs to begin moving into the area in increasing quantities.</p><p>\"We're typically a few years behind what you see in the big cities,\" Sanguedeolce said. \"Then it will slowly make its way here and then we'll be inundated with it.\"</p><p>Lackawanna County District Attorney Mark Powell agreed that fentanyl remains the biggest problem for the region, but he said the trend of drugs being mixed to form new compounds \u2014 the \"poly-substance phase\" of the drug epidemic \u2014 is especially worrisome.</p><p>\"Recently, we saw tranq mixed with synthetic marijuana, which is particularly concerning because individuals could be using it without even realizing that they were exposed to xylazine,\" Powell said. \"From our perspective, it seems like every time you put out one forest fire another one begins. And so it's a constant persistent effort to continue the fight to reduce the supply and demand.\"</p><p>The prosecutors said the new drugs are attractive to dealers because their potency allows them to traffic smaller quantities while earning higher profits \u2014 fentanyl is substantially cheaper to produce than heroin.</p><p>\"The profit margin is just extraordinary,\" Sanguedolce said.</p><p>Similarly, the drugs appeal to hardcore drug addicts who are looking for more intense highs than they can get from more traditional opioids like heroin.</p><p>\"There's incentives on both ends, unfortunately,\" Powell said.</p><p>The strategy for combating an influx of the poison to the region is to offer treatment to those in need to reduce the demand for the drugs. Powell noted that the region already has a \"robust\" support system that can help users get clean.</p><p>Law enforcement is also focused on targeting traffickers and aggressively getting the dope off the streets.</p><p>\"Our target is basically to penalize people who are found with it to the maximum extent of the law in the hopes that that's a deterrent to trafficking into Luzerne County,\" Sanguedolce said. \"As you can see, that doesn't always work.\"</p><p>Contact the writer: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:jhalpin@citizensvoice.com\">jhalpin@citizensvoice.com</email>; 570-821-2058</p><p>___ (c)2023 The Citizens' Voice (Wilkes-Barre, Pa.)

And with good reason: a number of climate-related records were broken in July and August 2023.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The extremes reached are becoming the new normal, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), which points to human-induced climate change due to greenhouse gas emissions as the main driver.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1 July 2023, the hottest month on Earth \"ever recorded in human history\"</p><p>These are the stark findings of WMO and the European Commission's Copernicus Climate Change Service, with an average temperature of 16.95C in July. This is the highest level ever recorded in human history, according to the head of the UN. The extreme heat experienced by millions of people in July is simply \"the harsh reality of climate change and a foretaste of the future,\" warned Petteri Taalas, WMO Secretary-General.</p><p>2 Greece: a 17-day heatwave in July</p><p>An exceptionally long heatwave hit the country for more than two weeks at the end of July, according to the Athens Institute for Environmental Research (IERSD). With temperatures at times exceeding 45C, forest fires multiplied, leading to the biggest evacuation operation ever carried out in Greece due to the climate: 30,000 people on the island of Rhodes, starting on 22 July, then on the islands of Evia and Corfu in August.</p><p>Heatwaves in Europe are now a public health issue. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), they caused more than 60,000 deaths in Europe in 2022. This figure could rise to 120,000 deaths a year in the European region by 2050.</p><p>3 Record 31-day heatwave in Phoenix, USA</p><p>Over 43.3C for a month In July, the 1.6 million inhabitants of Phoenix, the capital of Arizona, endured an ordeal unprecedented since it experienced a drought in 1974. Asphalt on the roads heated to 66C and the temperature of human bodies outside rose to 41C, requiring many people to be hospitalised.</p><p>4 Oceans: 20.96C on 4 August, a world surface temperature record</p><p>Back in June, the EU's climate monitoring service Copernicus announced that the north Atlantic Ocean, and in particular the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean, were unusually warm.</p><p>\"The ocean is hotter than ever,\" announced the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). In Florida, the water reached 38C and in the Mediterranean, an absolute record of 28.7C in July.</p><p>5 Torrential rain in Beijing</p><p>744.8 millimetres (74.48 cm) of rain fell in Beijing on 7 August, the highest level since weather records began in 1883. According to Chinese authorities, the floods killed 33 people, including five rescue workers, and left 18 others missing. More than 59,000 homes collapsed and 150,000 others were damaged.</p><p>Asia, the world's largest continent, is warming faster than the global average almost twice as much between 1991 and 2022 as between 1961 and 1990, according to the latest WMO report on the state of the climate in Asia in 2022.</p><p>6 Morocco breaks the 50C barrier for the first time</p><p>Agadir's weather station recorded a temperature of 50.4C in Agadir on 11 August. This record is far from being an isolated one: Turkiye recorded a temperature of 49.5C for the first time on 15 August, and the mercury climbed to 52.2C in Xinjiang province on 16 July, a new record in China.</p><p>7 The town of Lahaina nearly wiped off the map in Hawaii</p><p>A forest fire aggravated by the weather claimed more than 110 lives in the American archipelago of Hawaii, and on 10 August almost wiped out the town of Lahaina, population 13,000, on the island of Maui. Once again, climatic conditions were to blame. A drought encouraged the fire, while Hurricane Dora, which did not make landfall in Hawaii, strengthened the winds which spread the flames onto the small port city.</p><p>8 Canada: a record number of \"mega-fires\" and surface areas burnt</p><p>The blazes, which have been active in Canada since April, caused peaks in atmospheric pollution and darkened the skies over Montreal and New York spectacularly at the beginning of June.</p><p>As of 17 August, 600 active fires were still out of control, and no fewer than 5,738 blazes had already burnt 13.7 million hectares since the start of the year: that's more than 1% of the country, an area larger than Portugal and roughly the size of Greece. Almost twice as much land has been burnt as the previous record, in 1989. Even the northern regions of the country, close to the Arctic Circle, have been affected: on 16 August, an evacuation order was issued to the 20,000 residents of Yellowknife, the capital of the Northwest Territories, in the face of an approaching fire.</p><p>Fires fuel the vicious circle of global warming: huge quantities of carbon are released into the atmosphere, while vegetation capable of absorbing carbon emissions is devastated.</p><p>9 The Freezing point at a record altitude of 5,298 metres in Switzerland</p><p>The altitude at which freezing occurs was registered at a record 5,298 metres on 21 August by Meteo Suisse, 115 metres higher than in 2022. This is much higher than Europe's highest peak, Mont Blanc, which stands at 4,808 metres.</p><p>Another blow for glaciers that have already strongly suffered this year, said Matthias Huss, head of the Swiss Glacier Monitoring Network and a member of the community in charge of WMOs Global Cryosphere Watch community.</p><p>10 41.8C in the middle of winter in Brazil</p><p>The northern hemisphere is not the only one to be affected by the heat: in August, Brazil saw a record high of 41.8C in Cuiaba, in the centre-west, in the middle of winter. The heatwave hit a large part of the country, driving thousands of Rio residents to the beaches.</p><p>The country also had its hottest July on record, with an average of 23C. The probable cause, according to climatologists: climate change and the El Nio phenomenon, characterised by abnormally high water temperatures in the eastern part of the South Pacific Ocean.</p><p>These 10 records are certainly not the only extreme weather events to have hit the world in July and August 2023. Cyprus was hit by wildfires, for example, and Slovenia experienced the \"worst flood situation recorded in the country in recent history\", according to authorities.</p><p>All these alarming events in the run up to the Climate Change Conference (COP 28), to be held in Dubai from 30 November to 12 December 2023, will fuel the debate on the measures to be taken and the possible solutions.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126106076</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:692N-1191-DYTH-G0JY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1078\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 31, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Multiple pile burn and understory burn projects will be conducted, as conditions permit, this fall, winter, and spring, on the Georgetown, Pacific, Placerville and Amador Ranger Districts.</p><p>\"Our prescribed fire program is one of the best ways we can improve forest health, reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire, and continue the great work that's been done as part of our wildfire recovery efforts,\" said Aaron Mayville, Acting Forest Supervisor. \"We are committed to safely getting this work done over the coming months when our weather windows allow.\"</p><p>Each operation follows a specialized burn plan, in which temperature, humidity, wind, vegetation moisture, and smoke dispersal conditions are considered on a daily basis before a prescribed fire is implemented.</p><p>By removing excess vegetation, prescribed fire reduces the severity of future wildfires which helps protect communities and makes the landscape more resilient. It also makes room for new growth, which provides forage for wildlife, recycles nutrients back into the soil, and helps reduce the spread of insects and disease in forests.</p><p>Smoke from prescribed fire operations is normal and may continue for several days after an ignition depending on the project size, conditions, and weather. Prescribed fire smoke is generally less intense and of much shorter duration than smoke produced by unwanted wildfires. Fire managers consider optimal conditions for dispersal and duration of smoke impacts when planning prescribed burns.</p><p>Prescribed fire updates for the Eldorado National Forest will be posted on Twitter @EldoradoNF. For more information about smoke, contact Assistant Forest Fire Management Officer Jecobie Waters at (530) 621-5223 or <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:jecobie.waters@usda.gov\">jecobie.waters@usda.gov</email> For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:contentservices@htlive.com\">contentservices@htlive.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USFDNW-PR4238511</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USFDNW2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66VK-GJW1-JDKC-R3SY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">282801</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"366\"/><timeReceived>11:03 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 HT Media Ltd.

You might remember sceptics questioning the idea that the Black Summer fires really were worse than conflagrations like the 1939 Black Friday fires in Victoria.</p><p>We can now confidently say that these fires were far from normal. Our new analysis of Australian forest fire trends just published in Nature Communications confirms for the first time the Black Summer fires are part of a clear trend of worsening fire weather and ever-larger forest areas burned by fires.</p><p>What did we find?</p><p>Our study found that the annual area burned by fire across Australia's forests has been increasing by about 48,000 ha per year over the last three decades. After five years, that would be roughly the size of the entire Australian Capital Territory (235,000 hectares).</p><p>We found three out of four extreme forest fire years since states started keeping records 90 years ago have occurred since 2002.</p><p>And we found that the fire season is growing, moving out of spring and summer into autumn and winter.</p><p>These trends are almost entirely due to Australia's increasingly severe fire weather and are consistent with predicted human-induced climate change.</p><p>Our study is based on satellite and ground-based estimates of burnt forest area, and trends of nine wildfire risk factors and indices that relate to characteristics of fuel loads, fire weather, extreme fire behaviour, and ignition.</p><p>We have focused here only on the most dangerous forest fires, not the fires affecting Australia's savanna across the tropical north.</p><p>Fire burns much more land than 25 years ago</p><p>Before the 1990s, Australia's forest fires were infrequent, though damaging. A given area would burn at an interval between 20 to over 100 years.</p><p>The exception were rare summers which would see severe and extensive fires, such as 1939. Overall, only a small fraction of the total forest area burned in any year.</p><p>This pattern of fire behaviour no longer exists.</p><p>Over the last 30 years, the areas affected by fire have grown enormously.</p><p>If we compare the satellite records from 19882001 to the period from 20022018, the annual average fire area has shot up by 350%.</p><p>If we include the 201920 Black Summer fires, that figure soars to 800% an enormous leap.</p><p>We are seeing fires growing the most in areas once less likely to be affected by fire, such as cool wet Tasmanian forests unaccustomed to large fires as well as the warmest forests in Queensland previously kept safe from fire by rainfall and a humid microclimate. This includes ancient Gondwanan rainforests not adapted for fire.</p><p>More extreme fire years and longer fire seasons</p><p>Before 2002, there was just one megafire year in the 90 years Australian states have been keeping records and that was 1939.</p><p>Since 2001, there have been three megafire years, defined as a year in which more than one million hectares burn.</p><p>Our fire seasons are also getting longer. Spring and summer used to be the time most forest fires would start. That's no longer guaranteed.</p><p>Since 2001 winter fires have soared five-fold compared to 19882001 and autumn fires three-fold.</p><p>Overall, fires in the cooler months of March to August are growing exponentially at 14% a year.</p><p>What's driving these changes?</p><p>Imagine a forest fire starts from a lightning strike in remote bushland. What are the factors which would make it grow, spread and intensify?</p><p>A fire will get larger and more dangerous if it has access to more fuel (dry grass, fallen limbs and bark), and if the fire starts when the weather is hotter, drier and windier. Topography also plays a role, with fire able to move much faster uphill.</p><p>To get a sense of the overall risk of forest fire, temperature, humidity, windspeed and soil moisture are combined into a single figure, the Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI).</p><p>As you might expect, this index has been steadily worsening over the past 40 years. The number of very high fire danger days in forest zones has been increasing by 1.6 days per decade.</p><p>So what does this mean for fire behaviour and spread?</p><p>In what we believe is a first, we have used 32 years of fire index data across Australia's forest zones and compared the number of very high or severe fire danger days with areas subsequently burnt by fire.</p><p>We found a clear link, with a 300 to 500% increase in burnt area for every extra day of severe fire danger, and a 21% increase in burnt area for every extra day of very high fire danger.</p><p>Could fuel loads or prescribed burning be to blame? No. We looked for trends in these factors, and found nothing to explain the rise in burnt areas.</p><p>The main driver for the growing areas burnt by fire is Australia's increasingly severe fire weather, accounting for 75% of the variation observed in the total annual area of forest fires. This is consistent with predictions from climate change scenarios that severe fire weather conditions will intensify due to increasing greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>Other fire weather risks are also growing. We're seeing more higher atmospheric conditions which can lead to the formation of fire-generated thunderstorms (known as pyrocumulonimbus clouds).</p><p>These thunderstorms emerging out of fire plumes can spread burning embers further and whip up more dangerous winds for unpredictable fire behaviour on the ground, as well as generate lightning in the fire plume that can ignite new fires far ahead of the fire front.</p><p>Dry lightning is the primary natural cause of fire ignitions. Here too, the trends are worsening in southeast Australia. We are now seeing 50% more dry lightning in forest areas in recent decades (20002016) compared to the previous two (19801999).</p><p>Under most climate change scenarios, fire weather is predicted to keep on worsening.</p><p>Can we predict our next megafire?</p><p>So could we have predicted how bad and how widespread the Black Summer fires would have been, if we had examined fire danger index forecasts in mid-2019?</p><p>In short, yes.</p><p>The huge amount of bush that burned is entirely consistent with the 34 days of very high forest fire danger across the forest zones that summer. That's in line with the long-range bushfire weather forecasts provided to fire agencies earlier in 2019.</p><p>This means that in future years, we will be able to broadly predict the area likely to burn each fire season by examining fire index forecasts.</p><p>We can also safely and sadly predict that more and more of Australia will burn in years to come, with increasing numbers of megafire years.</p><p>While many factors contribute to catastrophic fire events, our Black Summer was not an aberration.</p><p>Rather, it was the continuation of fire trends beginning more than two decades ago. It is now clear that human-induced climate change is creating ever more dangerous conditions for fires in Australia.</p><p>We need to be ready for more Black Summers and worse.</p><p>Garry Cook, Honorary Fellow, CSIRO; Andrew Dowdy, Principal Research Scientist, Australian Bureau of Meteorology; Juergen Knauer, Research fellow, CSIRO; Mick Meyer, Post Retirement Fellow, CSIRO; Pep Canadell, Chief research scientist, Climate Science Centre, CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere; and Executive Director, Global Carbon Project, CSIRO, and Peter Briggs, Scientific Programmer and Data Analyst, CSIRO</p><p>This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124869226</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6465-TYY1-DYTH-G4J1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1288\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 29, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009FY9</classCode><className>EXPERIMENTATION &amp; RESEARCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001477</classCode><className>RESEARCH REPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS006</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS003</classCode><className>SOUTH AUSTRALIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GS008</classCode><className>TASMANIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

There's no different nations under the shadow of the moon. We're just human beings and we emerged on this planet and we have this capacity to feel wonder and awe. And the eclipse reminds us it's always available to us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Next month, people should take a drive out to outside a city to see the Milky Way. That's always available to us. So I just have to say, before we go anywhere with the science, I just really needed to say how beautiful this has been. Your coverage has been great. And I've really - I'm getting all but clumped.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: Same. Yes, watching those couples passionately kiss, their first kiss as husband and wife. One woman saying that she felt her mom's presence. She had passed away recently and this evoked that feeling for her.</p><p>You're so right, Adam. We're going to ask you to stand by for a moment because we want to get to Chad Myers, who's tracking the cloud cover. As it starts to look like it's turning into nighttime here.</p><p>BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: It really is.</p><p>SANCHEZ: We're getting closer and closer to totality and you can see it getting darker behind us. Chad, quickly walk us through the forecast and what it looks like elsewhere.</p><p>CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: It looks really good unless you get to Upstate New York. I mean, from here where we are now in Arkansas all the way up across Evansville and then to Indianapolis. And I know you're only a few minutes away from totality. But what I want you to notice are the color changes that your eyes are going to see. The camera will not see those color changes, but your red cones will not see the reds anymore as we get darker and darker and darker.</p><p>So red things like my tie maroon will turn black and yet my blue shirt will stay blue because it's a different wavelength, a longer wavelength. So that is one of the cool things that we're going on right now. But something else that's going on, it's dark out there. This is a visible satellite of what the satellite is seeing in the cloud cover. No, the clouds didn't go away. They are still very much here, trust me.</p><p>But the satellite can't see them visibly anymore. We can only look at them temperature wise. And yes, we have storms firing as we thought. There's already a new tornado watch that was just issued for east of the path of totality. That's some good news. At least we're not over the people that are there. But certainly if you're traveling back home tonight, you want to keep an eye on the weather because this isn't really over down here yet. In fact, just getting started.</p><p>Even for Harry - Harry - looked like he was, like, doing the pig pen dance out there in Buffalo because there was clouds and mist and the maid of the mist everywhere. Maybe it's clearing up just a little bit coming in from the west, we'll see. There's a chance. The other chance here is down to the south, too. We are going to see, of course, the severe weather today. So we'll keep an eye on that.</p><p>KEILAR: Well, we have beautiful weather here in Indianapolis.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Yes, we do.</p><p>KEILAR: And it is just so - I think, actually we're listening to some music.</p><p>SANCHEZ: (Inaudible) music, yes.</p><p>KEILAR: I recognize it from, I believe, \"Interstellar.\" Honestly, I think it's from the movie \"Interstellar.\" I'm pretty sure. And it's feeling that way. It almost has the feeling of when there is smoke from a forest fire.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>KEILAR: It is very strange. And honestly, I think the pictures as I see them don't fully do it justice. But there is just this kind of like blue silvery screen effect that we are getting here. And it is amazing. As we are heading, you can see there on the right side of your screen, toward totality, just the crescent of the sun remaining, Boris.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Yes, there's only about three minutes before totality. And it looks like there's just a tiny sliver between what's left of the sun being covered by the moon. Something that Adam Frank said, the astronomy professor from Rochester, really stood out to me and that is the fact that this is a common experience, that it's not just certain people that get to experience based on their politics or based on their nationality, but it is a combined human experience.</p><p>And I, for one, I'm grateful that I get to be on this earth, in this majestic moment and watch this celestial dance as it plays out before us. It's really a reminder that in the grand scheme of things, we're so small and we're only here for a short blip of time. And we get to enjoy it as one family, literally under the sun and moon.</p><p>We want to bring in Kristin Fisher, who's actually with her family right now. Her dad has been trying to witness a total solar eclipse for some time. And look at that, what a wonderful picture.</p><p>How does it look from where you are, Kristin?</p><p>KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE AND DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT: Boris, I can't believe we're actually here, right? So much time and planning goes into this. For him, this has been something that he's been chasing since 1970, essentially. And now to be just minutes away, I mean, the crowd is - I can't even quite put it into words. I can't remember the last time I was gathered with 50,000 people all just staring up at the sky and marveling about what we're about to witness.</p><p>Huge cheers going up as we've got just a little corner of the sun peeking out.</p><p>[15:05:03]</p><p>Wow. It's now this eerie gray. There is this orchestral music playing that the Indianapolis Motor Speedway has put on, absolutely perfect for an eclipse. I've got my six-year-old daughter here, Clara (ph), my mom, who is also a former NASA astronaut - big cheers - and, of course, my dad. My eclipse-hunting father. Dad, we made it.</p><p>WILLIAM FREDERICK FISHER, FORMER NASA ASTRONAUT AND FATHER OF KRISTIN FISHER: We made it. It's beautiful. The wind picks up, it's cooler and the crowd's starting to get quiet, sort of a hushed reverence of what this spectacle of nature. I was going to howl, but I don't feel like howling. It's just fantastic to watch.</p><p>FISHER: I was actually going to say the same thing. If you want to howl, I'll howl with you, but I think the crowd's howling loud enough for us. Wow, it's starting to get really dark now.</p><p>W. FISHER: Look at this, yes.</p><p>FISHER: He can't help it. Had to get one of those big wolf howls in. We are so close. We are almost at totality. Everybody around me saying, oh my gosh. All right, Boris and Brianna, here we are just seconds away, back to you.</p><p>KEILAR: Wow. Wow.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Let's take a moment to experience this together. We are at totality in Indianapolis.</p><p>KEILAR: Oh, my gosh.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Holy shit.</p><p>KEILAR: Oh, my god. Wow. You can see those circles.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Wow.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Take a look.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, my god. KEILAR: You can see those Baily's beads that we were talking about. The little circles on the outside as the rays from the sun come through the valleys of the moon. That is the effect that they give off and it's amazing. The clarity here is stunning.</p><p>SANCHEZ: You hear children reacting, entire families together witnessing this incredible moment. It looks like dusk. You kind of see some faint light in the horizon. It's majestic and it's eerie. It's something you will see nowhere else, according to experts, in the universe.</p><p>KEILAR: You can feel the temperature has dipped. It's so strange. It has become night in just the course of a minute. And you feel that settling in.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Wow.</p><p>SANCHEZ: You're seeing that diamond ring effect now.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Look at that.</p><p>SANCHEZ: I'm not sure from where we are if it's a solar flare. Maybe we need a closer look at a camera.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's unbelievable.</p><p>SANCHEZ: You definitely see on the bottom right.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Look how dark it is.</p><p>SANCHEZ: There's something that's popping and it looks like it could be a solar flare. We were told to look out for those by experts. Of course, on our screen it looks tiny. In reality, it is enormous. It's miles and miles long, popping out of the sun.</p><p>KEILAR: There are solar flares that are visible, as we can see there. It's almost one that we've been seeing repeatedly, which just speaks to how long they last and what was so much excitement here has now turned into this hush, as people are just enjoying this moment.</p><p>SANCHEZ: This moment of almost stillness. You hear folks connecting with each other, absorbing this majestic moment.</p><p>[15:10:04]</p><p>Let's go back to Kristin Fisher, who's on the racetrack here at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.</p><p>Kristin, give us your vantage point.</p><p>FISHER: Hey, Boris. Well - I mean, they've just started playing classical music now. People wildly cheering. And there it is, the diamond ring that you hear so much about. Wow, our totality is over, but god, was it glorious. Dad, what did you think? W. FISHER: Amazing. I have no words. It was much more dramatic than I thought it would be. It happened much faster. And it's such an amazing experience.</p><p>FISHER: I'm bummed it's already over.</p><p>Mom, what did you think about it? First time seeing a total solar?</p><p>ANNA LEE FISHER, FORMER NASA ASTRONAUT AND MOTHER OF KRISTIN FISHER: I'm crying. It brings tears to your eyes.</p><p>FISHER: It really does.</p><p>A FISHER: Yes, beautiful.</p><p>FISHER: She's got tears in her eyes.</p><p>Clara, what did you think, your first total solar?</p><p>CLARA: Well, I thought it was very pretty. But I didn't see any nocturnal animals.</p><p>FISHER: No nocturnal animals, very upset about that, huh?</p><p>CLARA: Yes.</p><p>A FISHER: Too many people around for nocturnal animals here.</p><p>CLARA: Well, I got to go to bed. I'll leave mom.</p><p>FISHER: So, for folks that don't know, both my mom and dad were space shuttle astronauts. They went into space on the - in the 1980s. And for both of you, I have to ask, you've seen a sight that so few people have seen. You've been to space. How does a total solar eclipse compare to the view of the earth from space, dad?</p><p>W. FISHER: It's just as beautiful. It's just as beautiful. It's so striking. I've seen pictures of it, but it's different when you see the real thing.</p><p>FISHER: Well, you can - I just can't get over how you really can feel it. And wow, it's now definitely starting to become so much more daylight.</p><p>A. FISHER: And so fast. It just - I know you know it, but it's just mind-boggling. The earth and a solar eclipse, you can't compare them. They're both amazingly beautiful.</p><p>FISHER: Well, Boris and Brianna, it has been such a treat to get to witness this with 50,000 people, too, because you can really get a sense for just the power of the moment when you're surrounded by all these oohs and aahs and what everybody else is saying.</p><p>W. FISHER: It got dark.</p><p>A. FISHER: Yes. W. FISHER: It got dark so quickly. All of a sudden, it was black out there. It was great.</p><p>FISHER: Yeah. And my dad and I had always talked about watching a total solar eclipse in nature. But to be here at the Indy Motor Speedway, the largest event in the world, it's been pretty cool. Back to you guys.</p><p>KEILAR: Yes. Glad your mom was crying, actually, because I had comfort in the company, I will tell you. And this is all happening very quickly.</p><p>Let's go to Miguel Marquez, who is less than a minute in Cleveland before the totality happens there. Miguel, set the scene for us.</p><p>MIGUEL MARQUEZ, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: This is absolutely stunning. That light that you were describing, that gray light, that's where we are right now. It's gotten much, much cooler here. The crowd keeps sort of erupting into applause. We just have a tiny sliver of the sun right now.</p><p>I'm here with Kelly Korreck. Say hello.</p><p>KELLY KORRECK, NASA PROGRAM MANAGER: Hello.</p><p>MARQUEZ: You can keep your glasses on and watch.</p><p>KORRECK: Okay.</p><p>MARQUEZ: This is her - this will be your fourth eclipse, is that right?</p><p>KORRECK: Third eclipse.</p><p>MARQUEZ: Third eclipse.</p><p>KORRECK: Yes.</p><p>MARQUEZ: Third total eclipse at one annular. You are the lead astrophysicist for NASA. You were jumping up and down when you saw the diamond ring earlier. What is it like to see this?</p><p>KORRECK: It's amazing to see this happen again. It never gets old. No matter how many times you see it, it's just understanding that that's just the last bits of light that are coming through the moon's valleys towards us from the sun. It's so exciting because we know we're going to get a show right after that.</p><p>MARQUEZ: And I know you guys are studying this. We saw those bits, those pink bits coming off of the sun earlier. They look tiny, but those are thousands of kilometers long.</p><p>KORRECK: Exactly.</p><p>MARQUEZ: Oh, my God.</p><p>KORRECK: Yes, thousands - oh, my gosh.</p><p>MARQUEZ: What are we seeing here? Oh, my god, it's gorgeous.</p><p>KORRECK: Oh, we're going towards the end. It's the last bit of the diamond ring. We're going towards Baily's Beads.</p><p>MARQUEZ: Oh, my god.</p><p>KORRECK: It's just amazing. The clouds are actually making it beautiful. You see beautiful streamers coming out, the solar wind.</p><p>MARQUEZ: I have chills.</p><p>KORRECK: I know. I'm about to cry. And you see stars in the background. If you come over here, those stars are planets.</p><p>MARQUEZ: Oh, yes.</p><p>KORRECK: Back - that's how dark it is. That's the horizon. It's twilight.</p><p>MARQUEZ: So with my naked eye now, I can now take off the glasses.</p><p>KORRECK: Right, you can take off the glasses.</p><p>MARQUEZ: We can all take off the glasses.</p><p>KORRECK: Yep.</p><p>MARQUEZ: And I can see those - it looks like pink bits around.</p><p>KORRECK: Right, filaments. Just parts of ...</p><p>MARQUEZ: What exactly are those?</p><p>KORRECK: Those are really hot parts of the sun that are actually the basis of coronal mass ejections where billions of tons of material that can actually come off the sun and create space weather for us here on Earth.</p><p>[15:15:06]</p><p>Things that affect our satellites. They can affect our GPS. They can affect our power grid. So we really want to understand those and when the sun is going to do those things.</p><p>MARQUEZ: And what is it? I take it every eclipse you've been to, it has been a mass of people. What is it about people wanting to come together to share this experience?</p><p>KORRECK: Because this is the only place we know of in the universe that we happen to have this happen where our moon perfectly covers the disk of the sun and we're able to see its hot corona that's normally hidden from us. So I think this is just a universal experience in understanding how much we all belong and we're all one on this little planet going around a star. The pink just keeps coming out back down there.</p><p>MARQUEZ: I was just going to say the pink on that bottom left-hand side is just stunning.</p><p>KORRECK: Yes, it is. It's just this very bright visible piece that's coming off of the sun, that's protruding from the sun and it's just breathtaking.</p><p>MARQUEZ: And this is what you, your colleagues, sending all this gear up there. This is what you want to study. What will this tell you?</p><p>KORRECK: This will tell us more about all of that stuff that's coming off. All you see the streaks coming off. We want to know how that comes at us towards space weather and how we're going to be able to better do this for our home planet as well as we go on to Artemis and being on the moon and then eventually to Mars.</p><p>So this really - gives us a better sense of where we are in the solar system.</p><p>MARQUEZ: This is real science. They're studying animals, they're studying plants right now, but this is real science about how this affects life on Earth and our exploration of the heavens.</p><p>KORRECK: Definitely. This is why this is such a rich experience. It's just beautiful, breathtaking. There's so much to just feel. But then at the same time, this is also so much science that gives us so much insight to who we are as humans and where we are in the universe and all about science.</p><p>MARQUEZ: This is stunning. Jake (sp?), if you would just look at the sunset - there's a sunset, a 360-degree sort of sunset around us right now. It is absolutely stunning. Everybody looking at the sky. It is hard to imagine that this is our planet.</p><p>I mean, this is a shadow at the end of the day.</p><p>KORRECK: Right.</p><p>MARQUEZ: This is a shadow. And it seems to put us into perspective, in our place in this universe.</p><p>KORRECK: Exactly. It's so special. It's just - such a special experience just to celebrate it. And, again, planets showing and - ah, yes, and more of - just watching all the different structures that we'll see. And we'll have that data for years and years to come to study and to learn more about it from the solar eclipse and hopefully to last us until the one in 2044.</p><p>MARQUEZ: And the next one here in Cleveland, 2444, 420 years. My goodness, that's going to be a long - I'm going to be an old man by then.</p><p>KORRECK: Yes.</p><p>MARQUEZ: So we're going to see this thing Diamond Ring, I take it, in a second. We're going to see the end of this.</p><p>KORRECK: Yes. Yes, we're doing to - and we're going to take the glasses back on, yes. We'll see the end of this and it's always a little sad, but I think we'll figure out when the next one is and find it.</p><p>MARQUEZ: How do you feel?</p><p>KORRECK: I just - so amazing and so much like there's just a sense of belonging to a bigger thing in the universe. Yes. Oh, the diamond ring.</p><p>MARQUEZ: This is otherworldly. I'm going to send it back to you guys. It just finished up here. We have a massive diamond ring ...</p><p>SANCHEZ: Thanks.</p><p>MARQUEZ: ... above Cleveland right now. And whether you study this ...</p><p>SANCHEZ: Amazing. Thank you so much, Miguel. We want to get straight to Harry Enten, who is watching the total solar eclipse at Niagara Falls. Harry, 10 seconds from totality.</p><p>HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER: I mean, let me tell you, I feel like I'm in a dark comedy right now because the clouds are covering us. But the fact is, it is so dark and these dark - the darkness is taking over the sky. And more than that, as I'm looking at the folks, there are clouds getting in the way of what is a true event here.</p><p>Look at all these folks. They're all looking up at that sky, extremely excited. And I got to admit, the temperature has dropped about 10-, 15 degrees. It is freezing. But you know what? It is so cool to be here right now, despite the fact that the clouds are out. It's total darkness. I feel like I'm in a movie of some sort.</p><p>I - I'm a meteorology guy and this to me is just something I don't think I have ever seen. Honestly, it's one of the true signs (inaudible) that this is it, because we are so small right now. This is (inaudible) nothing in a crowd of (inaudible), that's all I can really say.</p><p>KEILAR: All right. We're going to - Harry, we're going to have you get back towards your signal because you're breaking up there in Niagara Falls. So get back towards your signal and then chime back in as we witness this totality in Niagara Falls. And what we're seeing is they have the cloud cover. But what it means is that because they don't have their horizon that they actually have more darkness.</p><p>[15:20:03]</p><p>SANCHEZ: Right.</p><p>KEILAR: And it gives a really amazing view and - plus, Niagara Falls is just beautiful. It's a really stunning scene there to have this nighttime in the middle of the day for a few minutes there. SANCHEZ: Yes. As Harry said, it's like something out of a film. And we are getting some of the best vantage points of the earthquake - or the earthquake - what am I saying? The solar eclipse.</p><p>KEILAR: Too much news lately.</p><p>SANCHEZ: It's the earthquake from last week that's still stuck in my head in the northeast. But we do have a beautiful view of the eclipse from Stowe, Vermont. Derek Van Dam has been there for us. This is the top of a mountainside, a snowy mountainside. We're going to head over there live in just a few minutes.</p><p>But we're going to stay with this because the view over Niagara Falls, even though you can't see the actual sun and moon from there, just the surroundings, as Harry was pointing out, are eerie.</p><p>KEILAR: Yes, it's - and Niagara Falls is just a beautiful place. He's there on the New York side of it. The backdrop is just phenomenal. So I think - and I will tell you, witnessing it here in Indianapolis to see the sun's corona, to see the atmosphere of the sun, it is pretty cool. I'm not going to lie. I'm sorry, Niagara Falls, you weren't seeing that. But just - Harry, I think it just being nighttime in the middle of the day is a phenomenon in itself.</p><p>ENTEN: That's exactly right. The fact is, although I can't see the moon covering the sun, the fact that we have - I mean, listen to this crowd. I mean, that is pure excitement. There's nothing better than this. I mean, come on. This is unbelievable.</p><p>We - in western New York are not going to allow a few clouds getting in the way of an event of a lifetime. That's the fact of the matter. We lose in football, but we come back the next season. We lose the sun because of the clouds, but that is not going to get in the way of us having a fantastic time.</p><p>I always thought that I was so into snow, and that was the biggest weather event that I could possibly have. And I was almost joking about those people who chased the solar eclipses. What are they doing? Now I understand what they're doing. Because - I mean, unbelievable. Unbelievable, that's the only word. Unreal.</p><p>Look at these folks. And then the sun slowly but surely is no longer shielded by the moon, and the light is coming back. But for those few moments, those few moments, we felt something truly miraculous.</p><p>And there it is. And now it's over. But for that brief moment in time, we felt something that very few of us will get a chance to ever see again. We haven't had an eclipse in Niagara Falls in 99 years. We're not going to have one - another one, for another about 120 years. And I'm just so grateful that my job allowed me to come out here and experience this, because there are very few people who are as lucky as I am to be able to witness an event such as this. I just don't even know what else to say.</p><p>You know I'm a man of many words, but in a moment like this, I can only help but be a man of very few words, guys. SANCHEZ: It is something amazing to experience, as we just did here in Indy. So, Harry, we totally relate to that sentiment. I don't think that Buffalo Bills construction worker could be so poetic. That was incredible, Harry.</p><p>And as you saw there, one of our producers pointed out, in the midst of Niagara Falls, we'd been talking to Ed Lavandera, who's watching closely the animals at the Dallas Zoo and how wild they were going. There was - there were birds that were going ...</p><p>KEILAR: Crazy in the mist.</p><p>SANCHEZ: ... in the mist, yeah.</p><p>KEILAR: It was so wild and clear - the animals have delivered, I will say. They have delivered during this eclipse and it's a good one. I think it's such a dramatic eclipse, and that's may be why they're responding to it. But we've seen everything today. We've seen a mass wedding. We just saw a conversion, I think, with Harry there.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Yes. Yes. Yes.</p><p>KEILAR: He was saying, I don't know about these people with solar eclipses and now he gets it.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Yes.</p><p>KEILAR: I have to say, I fully understand what he means.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Yeah, the full spectrum of joy and marveling at this beautiful moment.</p><p>[15:25:02]</p><p>We want to marvel at another beautiful moment with Derek Van Dam because the path of totality is now hitting Stowe, Vermont. The top of a mountain where Derek is, only about a minute, 20 away from totality there, Derek.</p><p>DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Oh, Boris, I got to take glasses to see. It feels like I'm still wearing sunglasses right now. Darkness has transcended on this spot, but we are still under the impacts of that direct sunlight from the sun, right now, every second, it is releasing enough energy from the sun that could power all of humanity for an entire year. So it is not time to take off your solar eclipse goggles just yet. That has to be in complete totality.</p><p>The crowd here is obviously peering up into the skies. They've got their cell phones out. You can see some hooting and hollering. We all hear it. I'm going to put my glasses back on and talk you through what I am seeing. And what we cannot wait for is that moment when the shadow of the moon races across the planet, across the valley to my right here at 1,500 miles an hour. That is going to be phenomenal.</p><p>Here it is. You can hear the incredible sounds here from the spectators, the umbraphiles, listen in. Moments before totality and I want to explain to you another rare occurrence that is happening right before our eyes. We've witnessed this. There is cirrus clouds, which are ice crystals in the sky, and you can see a circle that forms around the sun. The solar eclipse has a parhelic arc. There it is, scattering the light around the sun. I'm expecting that to completely disappear as we go under complete darkness and complete totality.</p><p>I'm seeing right now, this is incredible, the diamond ring effect. This is what we all wait for, that moment for the moon to cross in front of the sun. Listen. Yes. There it is. Yes. Listen to this crowd. Look at the stars that have popped up. Look for the planets. Venus will be to the west. There is a comet that is visible to the naked eye. This is just incredible to see.</p><p>Right now, we are in a solar maximum. It is an 11-year cycle. Look at the fellow umbraphiles. We are seeing a moment that is just transcending this actual experience. I mean, we are watching Baily's beads. That is around the corona, that is the sun's atmosphere that is interacting with the valleys and the mountains, the troughs and the peaks of the mountainous terrain.</p><p>What are you feeling right now?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're going to cry. We're going to cry.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible) moment of epic ...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Epic.</p><p>VAN DAM: I don't even know how to encapsulate this moment. You can see the darkness and everybody just pulling out their phones. Some people just taking in the experience. It is safe to look at this moment. But, Bob, my cameraman, if you could just tune in on this because what we're looking at right now is full totality in the Baily's beads before this 2 minutes and 38 seconds of full totality disappears. We're going to see yet on the other side another diamond ring effect. That is the first rays of sun. That is the exact moment when we need to put back on our glasses.</p><p>We are still under complete darkness. Check this out, the gondola here at the highest point in Vermont, one of the highest points in all of New England, under complete darkness. And once we start to see that first diamond ring effect on the other side of the sun, that's when we put back our glasses because that is going to start emitting that sun's rays and it is no longer safe to look at the total solar eclipse.</p><p>Listen to this crowd.</p><p>Right now, what we are witnessing is the autumn version of the stars, the planets and the constellations.</p><p>[15:30:03]</p><p>Right now, it is out of phase by 6 months.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2024040811CNV54</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BRX-VRV1-JCS1-61WT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4476\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"04\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>April 8, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Total Solar Eclipse</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Parhelic Arc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Umbraphiles</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Baily's Beads</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUQ4OUEwREY0NzU2NDIwQTlDQ0VDMjJDNTJERjA3QTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DT42</classCode><className>ASTRONOMY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008YVR</classCode><className>ASTRONOMY &amp;

This year, Yom HaZikaron, Memorial Day annually observed for the fallen, will overshadow Yom Ha'atzmaut or Independence Day.</p><p>Much like America's Greatest Generation, the men and women who scrappily fought for Israel's independence using crude weapons and WWII surplus gear are passing out of history. Few now remember a time when Israel did not exist and some have come to take it for granted. While Israeli Air Force jets won't be doing flyovers for the 76th, the leftist protesters, some backed by foreign interests, will still continue their rallies and riots that only serve to aid Hamas.</p><p>And yet Israel did declare a new kind of independence before its latest Yom Ha'atzmaut.</p><p>After nearly half a year of pressure campaigns to end the war, the Biden administration followed through by announcing an embargo on offensive weapons to Israel. It's not the first time. In 1947, the Truman administration had imposed an arms embargo on Israel. Truman, like the current Democrat in the White House, had played a familiar double game, offering diplomatic recognition to Israel and enthusiastic speeches to Jewish voters, even while privately promising Muslims the opposite and making sure that Israel would not have the weapons to defend itself.</p><p>When the Republican Party platform declared that it took 'pride in the fact that the Republican Party was the first to call for the establishment of a free and independent Jewish Commonwealth' and condemned the 'vacillation of the Democrat Administration', Truman shot back angrily claiming that he supported the Democratic platform and its call for 'the revision of the arms embargo to accord to the State of Israel the right of self-defense.' This was a lie.</p><p>Truman had supported the arms embargo from the beginning. Three months before the Democrat platform had been adopted, the administration had backed a UN resolution that included an arms embargo. Truman was saying one thing and doing another. Like Biden, Truman had been following political considerations. That was why diplomats had been warned to stay away from making any anti-Israel moves at the United Nations before Election Day.</p><p>Even under the arms embargo, Israel survived an invasion by five Muslim nations.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/russians-just-walked-ukraine-border-defense-funds-diverted-fake-companies-massive\">'The Russians Just Walked In': Ukraine Border Defense Funds Diverted to Fake Companies in Massive 'Betrayal'</url></p><p>Authored by Thomas Stevenson via Human Events (emphasis ours)</p><p>Head of the Mezha Anti-Corruption Center, Martyna Bohuslavets, has written a report in Pravda asking 'Where are the fortifications?'

Otherwise, the region will remain dry with seasonable temperatures. Breezy winds are likely again today east of the Cascades, particularly through the Columbia Gorge and Kittitas Valley. A disturbance along the northern California coast will introduce some moisture and instability to southern Oregon starting tomorrow, but with better chances for thunderstorms Wednesday afternoon for central and eastern Oregon maybe extending into Washington. An upper level trough will sweep across the region Wednesday night and Thursday, bringing stronger winds with cooler temperatures lasting into the weekend. Rain is likely with this system on the west side, along with potential for showers and thunderstorms to the east.</p><p>The forest adjective class is HIGH with Public Use Restriction 1 remaining in effect.

The northwest Galicia region posted a record temperature of 44 C (111 F) in the city of Ourense.</p><p>The extreme heat and lack of rain has caused many wildfires and worsened a drought in many areas. The European Forest Fire Information System says 2022 has been the worst year so far in terms of scorched territory and the number of fires for Spain. The agency says 240,000 hectares (585,00 acres) have been razed in more than 370 fires in Spain.</p><p>Neighbouring Portugal's weather service IPMA also said July was the hottest since national records began in 1931. The average temperature was 25.1 degrees Celsius (77.3 degrees Fahrenheit), it said.

Only air pollution wasn't quite at the danger point globally.<br/>Air pollution is dangerous at local and regional levels, while climate was beyond the harmful levels for humans in groups but not quite past the safety guideline for the planet as a system, the study from the Swedish group said.<br/>The study found \"hotspots\" of problem areas throughout Eastern Europe; South Asia; the Middle East; Southeast Asia; parts of Africa; much of Brazil, Mexico and China; and some of the U.S. West - much of it from climate change. About two-thirds of Earth don't meet the criteria for freshwater safety, scientists said as an example.<br/>\"We are in a danger zone for most of the Earth system boundaries,\" said study co-author Kristie Ebi, a professor of climate and public health at the University of Washington.<br/>'Quite sick right now'<br/>If planet Earth got an annual checkup, similar to a person's physical, \"our doctor would say that the Earth is really quite sick right now and it is sick in terms of many different areas or systems, and this sickness is also affecting the people living on Earth,\" Earth Commission co-chair Joyeeta Gupta, a professor of environment at the University of Amsterdam, said at a press conference.<br/>It's not a terminal diagnosis. The planet can recover if it changes, including its use of coal, oil and natural gas and the way it treats the land and water, the scientists said.<br/>But \"we are moving in the wrong direction on basically all of these,\" said study lead author Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.\u00a0\u00a0The following fields overflowed: REFERENCE = 06-01 A5-Earth Environmental Li_A05<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/></pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COLMBN-8229629</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COLMBN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68C7-7531-DY7P-P2TR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">145264</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"418\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Columbian Publishing Co.

According to news originating from Guiyang, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"The semiphysical method is presently the most widely used for predicting litter moisture content, but it produces some errors. These are mainly due to the simplification of the water loss process and not accounting for the fuelbed structure, which can have a serious impact on the accuracy of litter moisture content predictions and, consequently, on forest fire management.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Guizhou Provincial Science And Technology Projects; China National Natural Science Foundation. <br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Guizhou Education University: \"As such, in this study, we constructed fuelbeds with different degrees of compactness, and the moisture content is saturated at this time. The drying process is recorded every 10 min under different wind velocity, and the experiment is stopped when the moisture content is not changing. Taking the saturated fibers' moisture content (30%) as the threshold value, the drying process was artificially divided into two stages (from the initial moisture content to 30%, it is a process of free water drying, and from 30% to the equilibrium moisture content, this is the process of drying of bound water), which is called the distinguishing drying process. The whole drying process (from the initial to the equilibrium moisture content) is called the undistinguishing drying process. Drying coefficient and effect factors were calculated by distinguishing and not distinguishing the drying process, respectively. This established a prediction model based on compactness and wind velocity. The results show that the drying coefficients, k 2 and k , of the two litter types were significantly different: the k 2 of the white oak fuelbed was significantly lower than its k , with a maximum variation difference of 57.10%. The k 2 in the Masson pine fuelbed was significantly higher than its k , with a maximum variation difference of 72.76%. Wind velocity and compactness had significant effects on all the drying coefficients of the two litter types, but with changes in the effect factors. The changes in k 2 were weaker than those of the other drying coefficients. Compared with the model that did not distinguish the drying process, the MRE of the prediction models for white oak and Masson pine decreased by 27.39% and 2.35%, respectively. The prediction accuracy of the model of the drying coefficient obtained by distinguishing the drying loss process was higher than that of the model that did not distinguish the drying process.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"This study was an indoor simulation experiment that elucidated the drying mechanism of litter and established a prediction model for the drying coefficient based on effect factors. It is of great significance for further field verification and for improving the accuracy of moisture content predictions based on the semiphysical method and will significantly improve the accuracy of fire risk and fire behavior prediction.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Indoor Experiments on the Moisture Dynamic Response to Wind Velocity for Fuelbeds with Different Degrees of Compactness.

According to news reporting from Mashhad, Iran, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Central management of fire stations and traditional optimization strategies are vulnerable to response time, a single point of failure, workload balancing, and cost problems.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Australian Research Council. <br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Sadjad University of Technology: \"This is further intensified by the absence of modern communication systems and a comprehensive management framework for firefighting operations. These problems motivate the use of new technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with the capability to transport extinguishing materials and reach remote zones. Forest fire management in remote regions can also benefit from blockchain technology (BC) due to the facilitation of decentralization, tamper-proofing, immutability, and mission recording in distributed ledgers. This study proposed an integrated drone-based blockchain framework in which the network users or nodes include drones, drone controllers, firefighters, and managers. In this distributed network, all nodes can have access to data; therefore, the flow of data exchange is smooth and challenges on spatial distance are minimized.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The research concluded with a discussion on constraints and opportunities in integrating blockchain with other new technologies to manage forest fires in remote regions.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Drones and Blockchain Integration to Manage Forest Fires in Remote Regions.
