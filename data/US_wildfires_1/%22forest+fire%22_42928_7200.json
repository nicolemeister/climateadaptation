Well, other than not boring, you'd call it 'Outer Range,'[1] a new Prime Video show brought to you by the crazy creative mind of Brian Watkins, who serves as creator and executive producer. To articulate its premise, Watkins told TheWrap, 'What happens when a disenchanted world stumbles upon enchantment?' He adds, 'The sci-fi in the show is not extraterrestrial \u2014 it's terrestrial.' </p><p><br/>Starring Josh Brolin, Lili Taylor, Imogen Poots and a litany of other perfectly cast actors, 'Outer Range' premieres April 15 and centers on Royal Abbott (Brolin), a rancher fighting for his land and family, who discovers an inexplicable mystery at the edge of his Wyoming property - a giant, presumably bottomless hole. Is it heaven? Is it hell? Is it limbo? Is it the past? Is it the future? Is it another world? Watkins' answer: 'Yes to everything you just said.' <br/>Watkins hooks viewers in from its very first scene. Without giving anything away (you gotta see it for yourself), it's mysterious, dark in both tone and look, with the music and voiceover immediately selling that whatever this character on screen was doing at that moment, it was not going to end well for them. <br/>'Absolutely. It is, at its heart, a Western myth about real people grappling with the unknown,' Watkins said. 'There's a fable element to it that I think should evoke some sort of the same kinds of feelings you have when you're sitting around a campfire in the West. I always tell people the West is the kind of place where you can walk up to the edge of a tree line and feel like you're staring into another world \u2014 it's filled with equal parts wonder and danger.' <br/>From that idea came the story of a Wyoming rancher who stumbles upon this metaphysical void on his property and it sets in motion this chain of catastrophic events, 'and it invariably ends up revealing the voids within him and within his family,' Watkins said. 'I think at the end of the day, 'Outer Range' really is asking the question of what do we do when the unknown comes and meets us in our very own backyards or at our kitchen tables.' <br/>Literally. <br/>We'll let Watkins tell you more. <br/>'Outer Range' stars Lili Taylor (Cecilia Abbott), Josh Brolin (Royal Abbott) and Tom Pelphrey(Perry Abbott). (Photo: Prime Video) <br/>TheWrap: 'Outer Range' is a very layered, very complicated mystery that gets into your head, What was your pitch like? I mean, how did you describe it to the folks at Prime Video that made them go, 'Yeah, we gotta have this'? <br/>Brian Watkins: Funny enough, I knew it was something I couldn't pitch out, so I wrote the very first episode on spec. And I took that to Amazon and that's what they fell for. And they said, 'Oh my God, where does it go? Can we start a mini-room right away?' And that's what we did, actually. So, it was a very exciting organic process. But, you know, pitching an idea for a rancher that stumbles upon a metaphysical void isn't exactly- (laughs) you know, it draws more question marks than anything. But I'm so pleased and happy that they took such a big swing and really leaned into the originality of that and really supported the original take of that. <br/>When you wrote that first script, did you know where it was gonna go by the end of Episode 8? Or as you were writing or even during production did it evolve in a way that you hadn't planned? <br/>I did know where I was gonna go. I think we had some clear guideposts to get to an ending that we were really excited about. And as we broke story in the writer's room, of course, it kind of evolves through not just the writer's room, but then we had this pause from COVID and it evolves then, and then you have during the production making of it, it evolves then in tiny ways. But I think we always kept the same ending point. But the very first thing I wrote on the board in the writer's room from the very first day was this phrase that sort of carried us through all of that: Uphold the Wonder. And I think that was sort of a North Star for how to kind of ground ourselves in this, and to always be sort of leaning forward into that wonder, always looking at how these people are feeling and grappling with it. <br/>it has moments of feeling very David Lynch-like, and I mean that in the best possible way. It feels as if it's filled with symbolism, especially with the stuffed owls at the Tillerson household. <br/>Without giving too much away, yeah, I'll say, you know, the symbolism does serve as a sort of set of emotional Easter eggs. I'd say you want to look to the arcs of our characters. You can find in their symbols some sort of their path. But I love that you bring up the owls. To me- the instructions to my production designer for that piece was that we're looking to express a wall of murdered wisdom. <br/>Oh, that's beautiful. <br/>That, to me, is what the Tillerson family kind of represents. I hope it comes through, and those are all over the place. I think there's other elements of symbols, be it the crochet sign in Celia's office that says, 'Lord reveal yourself to us,' or even the placement of cold beer in the first episode. These are graphic symbols that are sort of like mini-sermons to us, and they exist out West in numerous ways as telltale signs towards what we're doing here. There's a famous billboard in the show that we created that was sort of born of the philosophy that had a lot to do with the genesis of the show. And so when you see that billboard in Episode 7, I hope it unlocks a sort of new way of thinking about the events that have happened. I don't wanna give too much away there because it is Episode 7, but when you see that billboard, that's very much our hope. <br/>And I think another place of intrigue is Billy Tillerson, who is this character that is a bit of a wild, unpredictable, yet kind and soft-spoken person, and he's constantly singing in our show. There's several places where, if you listen carefully or if you examine what he's singing or talking about and if you really get into the lyrics, you might find some shape of the story or some shape of what a character's about to do or is grappling with. <br/>And then there's that buffalo that keeps appearing, who feels important to the overall story. <br/>Without saying too much, I think you should absolutely keep an eye on the Buffalo. <br/>'Outer Range' star Imogen Poots (Autumn) (Photo: Prime Video) <br/>OK, that's fair enough. Autumn seems harmless enough. When she shows up at the ranch, she seems like a pleasant enough person and then we learn she's not. <br/>I think she really epitomizes that woman of the West that helps, that wants to live on the edge. And I think as such, she'll hold your hand while she tries to jump off the cliff. And I think that's what is really exciting about her is that she's so UN-unpredictable \u2014 one day she'll be bringing you a weed brownie and the next day she'll be wanting to start a forest fire (laugh). I grew up around a lot of Autumns and I think that energy is just addictive and it's really completely curious and compelling. <br/>And then there's that hole in the ground. It's the crop circle that ran amuck. <br/>There's an aspect to it that goes back to the mysteries of the show. In order for the inner voice within Royal to be expressed, I think he needed to find an external voice. And so, um, I think it's invariably linked to the character and, in that way, it's really about how the West shapes us. The West, I feel, is a place where exteriors shape interiors, where the land is a force that we invariably get changed by. And so, to me, that's where the exterior has really shaped and informed the interior of Royal. <br/>Did you envision 'Outer Range' as an ongoing series, an anthology, a limited series? <br/>I think I envisioned it as a series that could sort of plum the depths of Western mythology, no matter what form it took. By that, I mean, I think there's all sorts of narrative strands in the West that are so relevant to our day. You know, there's a line in the second episode from Wayne Tillerson where he says 'one frontier, begets another.' I think there's a real sort of territorial yet transient nature to the exploration of the West, which is to say that it's always re-exploring itself and redefining itself. That's why we talk about the show as a bit of a neo-Western. So whether it's through mysteries in the earth or a more metaphysical mystery or be them some spiritual strain that the West has tapped into before, I think it's just rife with story. That's where, for me, it was always just a thrill to reach into those places, where the West has not been explored in a long time. It's where I grew up. So that's sort of where the show came from as well. <br/>'Outer Range' star Josh Brolin (Royal Abbott) (Photo: Prime Video) <br/>Brian, why should our readers watch 'Outer Range'? I mean, besides it being really good. (laughs) <br/>Knowing how the world works, that is really affecting all of us. I think the last few years have completely upended our notions of ourselves, of our world. I think it really is a story that is tapping into the root of those angsty feelings about the unknown. How do we deal with this? What do you do when something is unknown or unknowable or inexplicable? I think it comes back to that question of what would happen if the disenchanted world stumbled upon enchantment. I really think that's the crux of the question that we're trying to ask. And so I hope that's the question that audiences ask as they watch it. <br/>'Outer Ranch' premieres April 15 on Prime Video, with two episodes airing every Friday. <br/>(This interview has been edited for length and clarity.) <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/tag/outer-range/\">https://www.thewrap.com/tag/outer-range/</url></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Fire officials said 33 buildings had been destroyed, including at least a dozen homes.</p><p>Temperatures reached more than 110 degrees and a pyrocumulus created erratic fire behavior, fire spokesman Tom Ewald said.</p><p>Thunderstorm and excessive heat were also a concern for firefighters battling a blaze that blackened almost 4 square miles in the foothills above the Los Angeles suburb of Azusa. The fire, believed to be started Thursday by a homeless man, is only 3% contained.</p><p>Many areas of the state saw triple-digit temperatures through the weekend and the combination of prolonged heat and smoke from wildfires sent ozone pollution to levels not seen in a decade in some areas. Air quality may reach unhealthy to very unhealthy levels in several regions of Southern California on Sunday and Monday afternoons, the South Coast Air Quality Management District said.</p><p>In Northern California, moisture from an offshore tropical storm fueled a thunderstorm that brought nonstop lightning strikes early Sunday, some of which ignited small fires and knocked out power across the San Francisco Bay Area.</p><p>Wind gusts reached 75 mph, according to the National Weather Service, which said another round of lightning may develop early Monday.</p><p>\u201cThis is probably the most widespread and violent summer thunderstorm event in memory for Bay Area, &amp; it\u2019s also one of the hottest nights in years,\u201d tweeted Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p><p>Unsettling weather triggered an unusual warning by the weather service of a fire-induced tornado at an out-of-control forest fire that broke out north of Lake Tahoe on Saturday afternoon.</p><p>A massive fire cloud known as a pyrocumulonimbus formed over the fire, which started east of the town of Loyalton, about 40 miles west of Reno, Nevada. When high winds collided with the fire and whipped it into the air, a spectacular tornado-shaped spiral of flames was formed.</p><p>The fire has burned at least 45 square miles and triggered evacuation orders for sparsely populated communities along State Route 395 by the California-Nevada border, said Tahoe National Forest spokesman Joe Flannery.</p><p>Firefighters aided by water-dropping helicopters and air tankers faced \u201cextreme fire behavior,\u201d he said, and worked through the night to extinguish spot fires and protect threatened structures.</p><p>At one point, the fast-moving fire jumped a highway and came dangerously close to a fire truck. A fire crew from Truckee tweeted a video of firefighters dragging hoses as they ran alongside a moving truck that was dodging the flames.</p><p>Ryan Peel said firefighters created some defensive space around his slot machine distribution warehouse in Chilcoot, but he was worried the erratic winds could still put his business in the line of fire.</p><p>\u201cYesterday was extremely emotional, as we were at the mercy of the wind and the unpredictability of the fire,\u201d Peel told The Associated Press. \u201cI was stressed and terrified at the idea of losing everything I\u2019ve spent my life working for.\u201d</p><p>With zero containment and strong winds in the forecast, he said, \u201cwe are not out of the woods yet.\u201d</p><p>Associated Press reporter Haleluya Hadero contributed to this report from Atlanta.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SLTRIB-httpswwwsltribcomnewsnationworld20200816lightningsparksnew</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SLTRIB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60M3-1S01-DYT5-M1WT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144579</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"677\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Salt Lake Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Salt Lake Tribune</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 17, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

This collaboration is also intended to expand opportunities for using digital technologies, including, specifically, artificial intelligence (AI), in the company's logistical operations and other activities in the region.</p><p>The Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug-Yugra is involved in an experiment initiated by the Government of the Russian Federation on trialling highly automated vehicles on public roads. Supported by local government, Gazprom Neft will continue its testing of unmanned vehicles on intra-oilfield roads.* The agreement also creates new opportunities for testing and using UAVs, which have, already, been used in monitoring company oil pipelines and production infrastructure in Yugra for many years.**</p><p>Gazprom Neft plans to undertake a series of trials involving driverless GAZelle and KAMAZ vehicles throughout 2020 and 2021. Driverless vehicles help optimise transportation processes and improve safety in cargo transportation. These vehicles, controlled by artificial intelligence (AI), could, in future, take on the majority of logistics operations at Yugra oilfields. Trials experience at Gazprom Neft facilities could also be used in the experiment to bring driverless vehicles onto public roads.</p><p>\"The Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug is a key region for the domestic oil industry. Not only is 40% of all Russia's oil produced here, but the innovative technological projects that are going to drive the future of our industry are also being developed here. Developing driverless (unmanned) technologies is one such project. Gazprom Neft is, already, proactively deploying UAVs in monitoring pipeline condition and status in this region, as well as for a range of other works. We also have the first successful results of pilot testing the use of driverless electric vehicles at our company's fields in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug. As part of this new agreement with the Okrug Government we will be continuing our investigations into the wider use of these technologies, and will also be developing other innovations, including in digital logistics solutions.\"</p><p>Alexander Dyukov CEO and Chairman of the Management Board, Gazprom Neft</p><p>\"This document sets out the mutual obligations on both parties, including trialling driverless freight vehicles on Gazprom Neft's service roads something that will enhance safety levels for participants on this experiment.\"</p><p>Natalya Komarova Governor of the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug</p><p>Notes for editors</p><p>* Supported by the Government of the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug-Yugra, Gazprom Neft subsidiaries Gazpromneft-Khantos and Gazpromneft-Snabzheniye successfully tested a driverless GAZelle Next Electro electric vehicle in the southern section of the Priobsokoye field in early 2020. The vehicle confirmed its effectiveness and safety in completing various transportation challenges on intra-oilfield roads, under winter conditions.</p><p>Testing of unmanned KAMAZ vehicles took place earlier this year at the Vostochno-Messoyakhskoye field (covering the Yamal Peninsula and Gydan Peninsula and under development by Gazprom NeftRosneft JV Messoyakhaneftegaz). Testing confirmed the potential for KAMAZ unmanned vehicles to be used in logistics operations under the extreme natural and climatic conditions of the Arctic.</p><p>** Gazpromneft-Khantos is using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV or \"drone\") to monitor oil pipelines and industrial infrastructure, with the drone being used to monitor trunk pipelines and oil-production facilities. This helps minimise environmental risks, as well as revealing potential fire sources during the forest-fire danger season, and controlling flood risks in spring. Cutting-edge technological equipment improves safety in operating company infrastructure, and significantly reduces emergency response times.</p><p>More than 60% (about 7,000 km) of the total length of Gazprom Neft's pipelines are, already, being fully or partially monitored using aircraft-type drones, fitted with photographic, video and thermal imaging cameras.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123899384</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60N4-RS01-JCBF-S46R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"767\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 17, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

By the time the Camp Fire[1] was contained, it turned out to be the deadliest and most destructive blaze[2] in California's history, killing 85 people and burning 153,336 acres. </p><p><br/>Now scientists like Joseph Stewart[3],[3] an ecologist and postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Davis, are researching how to repair and replant the region. Some forest fires make way for new tree growth and a stronger, more resilient ecosystem. But after an intense blaze such as the CampFire, the trees may be gone for good if the super-dry conditions lead to higher seedling mortality. <br/>'Even if there are seeds left, there's less chance that the forest is going to be able to come back on its own,' says Stewart. His research focuses on two questions: what to plant and where \u2014 particularly after mega-fires like the Camp Fire. The devastation yields an opportunity where he and other scientists can devise strategies to bring forests back and, at the same time make them more resistant to climate change. 'We've got a pretty challenging situation in terms of the amount of forest that is in degraded conditions right now,' Stewart says. 'But the flip side of that is, there's a lot of opportunity to learn from our efforts to repair and make our forests more resilient as we're engaging in those efforts.' <br/>The complexity of reforestation, or the act of restoring a razed or degraded forest back to a living landscape, goes beyond the basic work of just planting trees. Planting to replace what was lost can seem like the most obvious answer. After all, a single mature tree can store carbon, produce oxygen, filter water, provide shelter and food for people and wildlife, and stop soil erosion the list of benefits goes on. But it's not as simple as planting any tree, anywhere. This is the heart of responsible reforestation: right species, right place, right reason. The goal is to ensure a lasting, thriving ecosystem where native species support the wildlife \u2014 everything from fungi and insects to birds and mammals \u2014 that has evolved alongside them. Halting and reversing the destruction of forests means protecting and managing them for the long term. <br/>Forests in crisis <br/>Over the past three decades, 420 million hectares of the world's forests have vanished, according to estimates from the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). That area represents a little more than half the contiguous United States. These are losses the world can't afford. Trees are a critical buffer against climate change. Forests absorb an estimated 7.6 billion metric tonnes of carbon dioxide a year from the planet's atmosphere, or one and a half times the US annual total, according to a recent study by the World Resources Institute[4].[4] <br/>Trees are being destroyed by building development, wildfires, landslides, and other environmental factors[5], but agriculture drives almost 90% of deforestation, according to a recent FAO study[6]: Conversion to cropland accounts for more than half, livestock grazing almost 40%. <br/>Recognizing the crisis, leaders of 140 countries representing 91% of the world's forests agreed to 'halt and reverse forest loss[7] and land degradation by 2030' at the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow last year. <br/>'Nature-based solutions for forests and land \u2014 things like forest protection, improved forest management, and forest restoration \u2014 can help reverse all those trends that we're seeing around the world,' says Linda Walker, senior director of corporate engagement, forests, for World Wildlife Fund (WWF). <br/>A broad group that includes scientists, governments, nonprofits, and businesses is exploring what reforestation actually means when done right. <br/>Learning the right way to reforest <br/>Reforestation has gotten some big boosts in recent years, such as the World Economic Forum's 1t.org initiative, a plan to conserve, restore, and grow 1 trillion trees globally by 2030, and the Jane Goodall Institute, an organization founded by renowned scientist and conservationist Dr. Jane Goodall to protect and restore forests. WWF's Walker says that even though much of the world's forestland remains at risk, the opportunity to reverse course is promising. <br/>Several companies, including HP, are part of the 1t.org project, which emphasizes the word 'grow[8]' over 'plant,' its website notes, because 'simply putting a seedling in the ground is not sufficient\u2014that tree needs to be supported to maturity to reach its full potential. It also needs to be the right species, planted in the right conditions.' <br/>Reforestation means restoring a forest to where it once was, not creating a new forest where there never was one, which might mean destroying a different, but critical, ecosystem. The consequences for ignoring this fundamental premise can be costly in terms of both carbon and cash, and ongoing scientific research offers clues about what works and what doesn't. <br/>In South Africa, non-native Australian acacias planted in the 19th and 20th centuries ended up taking over natural grasslands and lowering the water table, and now the annual chore of clearing them costs millions of dollars[9]. Scientists from the Botanic Gardens Conservation International and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, cite the acacia example in a post introducing '10 Golden Rules for Restoring Forests,'[10] which lays out simple best practices, such as selecting the right area and planting species that can maximize biodiversity. <br/>Paying attention to these lessons will determine the success or failure of the many public and private reforestation efforts now underway around the world. <br/>'We can only effectively plant trees in locations where at some point in time they were cut down or destroyed,' notes Ansgar Kahmen, a botanist and professor of environmental science at the University of Basel who studies how reforestation changes in the face of a changing climate[11].[11] 'I think we're fooling ourselves if we think we can keep burning fossil fuels and planting a tree will compensate for it.' <br/>Complications of climate change <br/>The challenge of what to plant, and where, becomes trickier with climate change. Ongoing research is aimed at discovering which trees will thrive in a warming world. <br/>At a research site in northern Switzerland equipped with a crane that hoists researchers into the canopy, Kahmen and colleagues are simulating drought on a subset of trees by putting a roof over them, diminishing the amount of rain they get. The goal is to see not only how species respond, but which might be most adaptable. <br/>'There's a big debate in Europe at the moment: What are the appropriate trees that we should reforest with? And there is no consensus,' Kahmen says. 'It actually opens a big ecological discussion. What is a native tree in the future?' <br/>These kinds of questions are relevant far beyond Europe, as forests are being planted in different regions, with varying objectives, worldwide. Between 2000 and 2018, 46 million hectares of forest were planted, almost a quarter of which replaced naturally regenerating forests, according to a 2020 remote sensing survey[12] from the FAO. <br/>But merely restoring tree cover does not guarantee long-term success, particularly as saplings face conditions that might be different from those of their ancestors. 'Ecosystems do have some resilience, but we don't really know what this resilience is for different species that we work with, and how fast they can actually acclimate,' Kahmen says. <br/>Scientists like Kahmen and Stewart are developing the research and technology needed to inform planted trees' survival in the decades to come. Stewart has built computer-based tools that can help ecosystem managers identify, for example, which wildfire-scarred[13] areas are not likely to regenerate on their own and may need intervention, and which species are likely to thrive[14] as environmental and climate conditions evolve. <br/>'With the climate changing as fast as it has, tree populations often aren't adapted to the local conditions anymore,' Stewart says. For example, climate models predict that conifer forests like the one destroyed by the Camp Fire, made up of ponderosa pine and Douglas fir, will be replaced by mixed forests of oaks and pines, chaparral, or grassland. <br/>In such cases, seeds might come from slightly different locations than where they are being replanted. The Bureau of Land Management's reforestation plan for the Camp Fire includes a technique called assisted migration, where planted seeds have been harvested from areas that make them better suited for hotter and drier conditions than the trees that once stood. <br/>Finding, and funding, the right balance <br/>Even the best science on planting the right trees and enhancing forest resilience will be wasted if planting efforts do not consider the local communities and people. Plenty of well-meaning efforts have proceeded without a knowledge of local ecosystems or what communities want. A 2019 University of Vermont study found, for example, that a quarter of Detroit residents opted out of a city-sponsored tree-planting program because they didn't trust the city[15] to maintain the trees. <br/>And in the United Kingdom, government efforts to plant trees raised alarms in communities where vulnerable peatlands were affected. Other misguided projects have placed trees on native grasslands[16], harming an ecosystem that already stores carbon and water. <br/>'It's like two sides of a coin,' says Ben Wilinsky, director, partnerships and innovation, for the Arbor Day Foundation (ADF)[17], which just turned 50 years old and has projects and partners in more than 45 countries. 'One is, where is the ecological need greatest from a climate, community, and biodiversity standpoint? The other is, who's ready to [plant]?' <br/>The science, outreach, and preparation needed to reforest responsibly, not to mention the projects themselves, require significant funding. Since establishing its Sustainable Forests Cooperative in 2019, HP has forged forest-stewardship partnerships[18] with environmental organizations including ADF, WWF, and the Jane Goodall Institute. HP is WWF's largest partner to date, pledging $80 million[19] in 2021 to address the impact of printing with HP printers. The partnerships support HP's goal of zero deforestation for HP paper and paper-based packaging[20]. WWF also helped HP develop a groundbreaking methodology to account for not only HP-brand paper but any paper used for printing. HP aims to counteract deforestation for any paper in its products and print services by 2030. <br/>The scope of HP's reforestation efforts is broad geographically but also targeted regionally, from work in Brazil's Atlantic Forest[21] with WWF to planting more than 1 million trees in the United States with ADF, including in wildfire-devastated regions in California. <br/>On-the-ground partners <br/>partners Reforestation projects can avoid pitfalls through careful ecological study and community engagement. In Brazil, WWF works through a local organization, Copaba[22], to build relationships with landowners and others on the ground. A fifth-generation coffee farmer who rehabilitated degraded areas to connect patches of existing forest on her land told WWF[23], 'Living in a balance between coffee production and the environment provides a benefit not only for our family but for all the other people who will enjoy these resources.' The farmer also wants her three-year-old daughter to inherit land that will be prosperous over the long term. <br/>'There's a recognition that every single landowner might have a different interest in doing this restoration,' Walker says, mentioning objectives including soil erosion prevention, pest management, and ecotourism. 'Some landowners are not interested, and we respect that.' <br/>In many regions, forests fall because locals have an economic incentive to sell or use the timber or clear the land for agriculture. ADF's Wilinsky echoes Walker in pointing out that reforestation efforts depend on local support and a plan for future management to change that paradigm. <br/>'It's definitely more than just planting a tree,' he says. 'These are livelihood programs. 'If it pays, it stays' is a term that we hear a lot. How are these communities set up for long-term success?' Ensuring the survival of fresh saplings for decades to come goes hand in hand with protecting the forests we already have. That's because, for all our urgency to plant trees, forested land is a finite resource. We can't magically make more of it. 'In my 30 years of conservation work, this is one of the most exciting, but sobering, times,' says Walker. 'The urgency has never been greater, but also the interest has never been greater.' <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/media/5121/campfire_cause.pdf\">https://www.fire.ca.gov/media/5121/campfire_cause.pdf</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/media/t1rdhizr/top20_destruction.pdf\">https://www.fire.ca.gov/media/t1rdhizr/top20_destruction.pdf</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://stewartecology.org/about-me\">https://stewartecology.org/about-me</url>/ [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/forests-absorb-twice-much-carbon-they-emit-each-year\">https://www.wri.org/insights/forests-absorb-twice-much-carbon-they-emit-each-year</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/25042020/forest-trees-climate-change-deforestation/\">https://insideclimatenews.org/news/25042020/forest-trees-climate-change-deforestation/</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/cop26-agricultural-expansion-drives-almost-90-percent-of-global-deforestation/en\">https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/cop26-agricultural-expansion-drives-almost-90-percent-of-global-deforestation/en</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ukcop26.org/glasgow-leaders-declaration-on-forests-and-land-use\">https://ukcop26.org/glasgow-leaders-declaration-on-forests-and-land-use</url>/ [ 8]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.1t.org/faq#question-2\">https://www.1t.org/faq#question-2</url> [ 9]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ddi.12408\">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ddi.12408</url> [ 10]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bgci.org/news-events/scientists-lay-out-10-golden-rules-for-restoring-forests/\">https://www.bgci.org/news-events/scientists-lay-out-10-golden-rules-for-restoring-forests/</url> [ 11]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.unibas.ch/en/News-Events/News/Uni-Research/How-the-forest-copes-with-the-summer-heat.html\">https://www.unibas.ch/en/News-Events/News/Uni-Research/How-the-forest-copes-with-the-summer-heat.html</url> [ 12]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fao.org/forest-resources-assessment/remote-sensing/fra-2020-remote-sensing-survey/en/\">https://www.fao.org/forest-resources-assessment/remote-sensing/fra-2020-remote-sensing-survey/en/</url> [ 13]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ucdavis.edu/climate/news/identifying-where-reforest-after-wildfire\">https://www.ucdavis.edu/climate/news/identifying-where-reforest-after-wildfire</url> [ 14]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://stewartecology.org/ClimateAdaptedSeedTool\">https://stewartecology.org/ClimateAdaptedSeedTool</url>/ [ 15]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/01/190107142109.htm\">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/01/190107142109.htm</url> [ 16]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2021/05/bad-science-planting-frenzy-misses-the-grasslands-for-the-trees/\">https://news.mongabay.com/2021/05/bad-science-planting-frenzy-misses-the-grasslands-for-the-trees/</url> [ 17]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.arborday.org/partnerships/#whyADFSection\">https://www.arborday.org/partnerships/#whyADFSection</url> [ 18]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://garage.hp.com/us/en/news/hp-wwf-sustainability-partnership.html\">https://garage.hp.com/us/en/news/hp-wwf-sustainability-partnership.html</url> [ 19]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.worldwildlife.org/blogs/sustainability-works/posts/putting-forests-at-the-heart-of-climate-nature-and-business-resilience\">https://www.worldwildlife.org/blogs/sustainability-works/posts/putting-forests-at-the-heart-of-climate-nature-and-business-resilience</url> [ 20]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://press.hp.com/us/en/press-releases/2021/hp-inc-announces-ambitious-climate-action-goals.html#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20HP%20has%20achieved,Paper%20and%20Wood%20Policy%209\">https://press.hp.com/us/en/press-releases/2021/hp-inc-announces-ambitious-climate-action-goals.html#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20HP%20has%20achieved,Paper%20and%20Wood%20Policy%209</url>.

When a new police chief took office in 2016, he had all of the window tint taken off of every department vehicle in his first week. Suddenly, there was more interaction between the officers and the public.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sometimes \"transparency\" is easier to achieve than we realize.</p><p>Phillip T. Kehoe</p><p>Santa Fe</p><p>Pits aren't progress</p><p>On the 75th anniversary of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, tribute was paid to those who died in the bombing, but there was no mention of all the people downwind from the test sites who died from cancers and other illnesses caused by exposure to radiation.</p><p>Now, once again, residents of New Mexico are being told by Sens. Martin Heinrich and Tom Udall that Los Alamos National Laboratory should be the only plutonium pit factory. This would entail building at least 80 reserve pits per year by 2030.</p><p>We do not need plutonium pit production. This is not progress. This is money spent for destruction, while bridges and dams collapse, food and health services are being cut, and jobs are being lost because of the pandemic. The only road to true progress and environmental safety is to urge our senators to stop the plutonium pit program and to use the money allocated for the pit program to support rebuilding of infrastructure, developing renewable energy, and funding health and social justice care.</p><p>The Los Alamos Study Group has a campaign, the Call for Sanity, Not Nuclear Production. Please go to the group's website, lasg.org, to join this important campaign and send messages to our Santa Fe County and city leaders to change their priorities.</p><p>Nancy King</p><p>Santa Fe</p><p>How to help</p><p>Thank you for the moving story (\"Navajo elders: Alone, without food, in despair,\" Aug. 11) about the plight of Navajo elders during the pandemic. There is a way to help through the Adopt A Native Elder program. This exemplary nonprofit began in the 1980s and has a four-star rating with Charity Navigator. It has served the elders of the Navajo Nation by encouraging people like you and me to adopt an elder. Your donation provides for a twice-a-year food and medical supply delivery to some of the remotest parts of the Navajo Nation.</p><p>Providing a connection to the outside world is equally important, and donors are encouraged to become pen pals with their elder. For more information, visit the website at anelder.org.</p><p>Deborah Dennard</p><p>Santa Fe</p><p>Yes, it's an emergency</p><p>Bless the New Mexico Supreme Court for unanimously upholding the governor's emergency powers. Consider this: If an earthquake or forest fire struck, leaving the city lethally dangerous to move about in, the governor certainly would decree emergency measures, including no-go areas and a curfew. Curfew violations during a declared emergency often include serious punishment. In some cases, the curfew is militarily enforced, and shoot-to-kill orders may be part of enforcement.</p><p>It is a sad and telling irony that the people who scream and sue about having to wear a little mask are the very same ones who, if their party ordered it and the military executed it, would be all for shooting violators.</p><p>Kim Sorvig</p><p>Santa Fe</p><p>Extraordinary times</p><p>Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is mandating extreme measures that are harming New Mexicans. She has required masks anytime we're not in our homes (including during outdoor exercise), reclosed indoor dining at restaurants (even though the New Mexico Restaurant Association estimates this will result in the failure of 700 restaurants) and essentially banned funerals, weddings, celebrations and family gatherings for nearly five months by limiting larger gatherings.</p><p>Some New Mexico legislators are calling for an extraordinary session to limit the governor's emergency powers. This is not a partisan issue. In order for such a session to be called, 42 representatives and 26 senators must agree to meet. Currently, 17 state representatives and six state senators have pledged to join. Please contact your representative and senator to ask them to call for and attend an extraordinary session to limit the governor's emergency powers.</p><p>Sarah Smith</p><p>Las Cruces</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWMEX-15545546</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWMEX2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MG-9R11-JBSG-1009-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147872</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"691\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Santa Fe New Mexican All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Santa Fe New Mexican</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 18, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001880</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N922120QM</classCode><className>POLICE FORCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX002064</classCode><className>EPIDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST0008X7K</classCode><className>INDIGENOUS PEOPLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;

Chris Smith, R-New Jersey, issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Residents of the Whiting community in Manchester Township south of Joint-Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JB-MDL) will receive added protection from the threat of wildfires because of new federal funding, said Rep. Chris Smith (NJ-04).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Department of Defense will provide funding to six projects in New Jersey (see list below) that promote land conservation near military sites, including $380,000 for a firebreak project to be built near the Roosevelt City section of Whiting. The firebreak will simultaneously protect the military mission of JB-MDL.</p><p>\"This modest but important federal funding will go a long way toward protecting areas near our military bases that are susceptible to forest fires,\" Smith said. \"According to the NJ Forest Fire Service, more than 7,000 acres a year are consumed by an average of 1,500 wildfires in New Jersey, the most densely populated State in the union. The firebreak project will be in Manchester Township, home to nearly 44,000 people and many senior retirement communities,\" he said.</p><p>Manchester Township Mayor Ken Palmer said that he liked the idea of added fire protection for the Whiting section of the township.</p><p>\"We welcome any effort to provide firebreaks in the most wooded portion of our town,\" Palmer said. \"Certainly, any safety measure to assist in this area is appreciated and extremely useful.\"</p><p>Smith noted that the \"$380,000 slated toward building a five-mile long firebreak near JB-MDL will protect people and property to the west of Whiting.\"</p><p>\"This area in Whiting is part of the New Jersey Pine Barrens is vulnerable to forest fires in the dry seasons or droughts,\" Smith said. \"This project protects America's only Army-Navy-Air Force joint base--the second largest employer in New Jersey--and the missions it performs. More importantly, it also protects the residents of Whiting.

Firefighters already battling the blaze in steep, rugged terrain with scorching heat faced more hurdles when hundreds of lightning strikes and winds up to 15 mph (24 kph) pushed the flames uphill.</p><p>\u201cWe set up a containment line at the top of the hills so the fire doesn't spill over to the other side and cause it to spread, but it was obviously difficult given the erratic wind and some other conditions,\" said fire spokesman Jake Miller.</p><p>The Lake Fire was just 12% contained Sunday and has burned nearly 28 square miles (72 square kilometers) of brush and trees. Fire officials said 33 buildings had been destroyed, including at least a dozen homes.</p><p>Temperatures reached more than 110 degrees (43 Celsius) and a pyrocumulus created erratic fire behavior, fire spokesman Tom Ewald said.</p><p>Thunderstorm and excessive heat were also a concern for firefighters battling a blaze that blackened almost 4 square miles (10 square kilometers) in the foothills above the Los Angeles suburb of Azusa. The fire, believed to be started Thursday by a homeless man, is only 3% contained.</p><p>Many areas of the state saw triple-digit temperatures through the weekend and the combination of prolonged heat and smoke from wildfires sent ozone pollution to levels not seen in a decade in some areas. Air quality may reach unhealthy to very unhealthy levels in several regions of Southern California on Sunday and Monday afternoons, the South Coast Air Quality Management District said.</p><p>In Northern California, moisture from an offshore tropical storm fueled a thunderstorm that brought nonstop lightning strikes early Sunday, some of which ignited small fires and knocked out power across the San Francisco Bay Area.</p><p>Wind gusts reached 75 mph (121 kph), according to the National Weather Service, which said another round of lightning may develop early Monday.</p><p>\u201cThis is probably the most widespread and violent summer thunderstorm event in memory for Bay Area, &amp; it\u2019s also one of the hottest nights in years,\" tweeted Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p><p>Unsettling weather triggered an unusual warning by the weather service of a fire-induced tornado at an out-of-control forest fire that broke out north of Lake Tahoe on Saturday afternoon.</p><p>A massive fire cloud known as a pyrocumulonimbus formed over the fire, which started east of the town of Loyalton, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) west of Reno, Nevada. When high winds collided with the fire and whipped it into the air, a spectacular tornado-shaped spiral of flames was formed.</p><p>The fire has burned at least 45 square miles (117 square kilometers) and triggered evacuation orders for sparsely populated communities along State Route 395 by the California-Nevada border, said Tahoe National Forest spokesman Joe Flannery.</p><p>Firefighters aided by water-dropping helicopters and air tankers faced \u201cextreme fire behavior,\u201d he said, and worked through the night to extinguish spot fires and protect threatened structures.</p><p>At one point, the fast-moving fire jumped a highway and came dangerously close to a fire truck. A fire crew from Truckee tweeted a video of firefighters dragging hoses as they ran alongside a moving truck that was dodging the flames.</p><p>Ryan Peel said firefighters created some defensive space around his slot machine distribution warehouse in Chilcoot, but he was worried the erratic winds could still put his business in the line of fire.</p><p>\u201cYesterday was extremely emotional, as we were at the mercy of the wind and the unpredictability of the fire,\u201d Peel told The Associated Press. \u201cI was stressed and terrified at the idea of losing everything I\u2019ve spent my life working for.\u201d</p><p>With zero containment and strong winds in the forecast, he said, \u201cwe are not out of the woods yet.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press reporter Haleluya Hadero contributed to this report from Atlanta.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-3b4b774ca68c231cddddb521efa62a6020200817</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60M2-HM91-JC5B-G0SK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304481</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"698\"/><timeReceived>1:48 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

The Senate, with the participation of 17 Republicans, passes the second trillion-dollar package of 2021. Since the onset of the so-called pandemic, there have been three separate spending bills that have exceeded one trillion dollars. Trump passed the $2.3 trillion CARES ACT, and now Biden has added the $1.2 trillion 'infrastructure' deal to his already-$1.9 trillion America Rescue Plan Act. </p><p>This is three times more than in the history of wasteful government spending. Amazingly, before the ink was dry Joe Biden was already touting a $3.5 budget that later rolled through the Senate as well. Just for some perspective on the absolute recklessness of D.C. spending, Joe Biden has already passed nearly double the spending as Barack Obama in his first year as president. Just ten years ago, Obama spent $3.5 trillion for all federal expenditures[1]; now Biden has his own $3.5 trillion budget, two massive plans at $3.1 trillion, and whatever happens in the next five months still. Despite being labeled an infrastructure package, apparently, only 25% of it goes to actual infrastructure. The rest - hell, all of it - is merely government bloat and anti-white bloat[2] at that. This is a great time to ask: Why do I pay taxes anymore? If the Fed can simply dial up the printing press, then why don't they let me keep what I earn and print the difference? Obviously, printing is insane, but so is the idea of paying taxes that mean a lot to my household budget but increasingly provide no value to the government other than control over my financial independence. Taxation is not about funding basic programs anymore, it's just a lever of control and middle-class destruction. Shame on Republicans for going along with this contrivance. America might be getting ruined by Democrats, but establishment Republicans are not much better. The conservative movement is getting screwed by its (alleged) own. How hard is it to stand up to tyranny? Each of the 17 sellout Republican Senators[3] need to be primaried as soon as possible. Andrew Cuomo jumps in front of Joe Biden's bullet. For all of the unadulterated joy in seeing a despicable narcissist like Andrew Cuomo go down, we need to remember two things: Democrats neither care about women's rights nor allegations of sexual misconduct. Andrew Cuomo condemned 10,000 elderly patients to their deaths with his state's Covid policies. Not only did Cuomo write Covid policies that amounted to dropping lit matches onto dry tinder, but he openly admitted to covering up starting a massive forest fire of Covid spread in order to avoid an investigation by the Trump Department of Justice. (Conveniently, the Biden DoJ wasn't concerned about the murders and have since dropped the investigation). Cuomo going away for sexual harassment or whatever he allegedly did is nothing more than getting ahead of more information. Nothing is ever a coincidence in politics, and let's not pretend that Cuomo finally gave in. This was all orchestrated in advance to drown out the conversations surrounding the continued border chaos, Afghanistan mayhem, vaccine troubles, and everything else Biden has done since inauguration. The Dems have nothing to run on in 2022, so they will hope to salvage some female voters by pretending to care about Cuomo's victims. Until Tara Reade (or any of the Biden accusers, for that matter) gets a scintilla of the coverage as Cuomo's indiscretions have, then this is all political theater. We can only speculate as to how Andrew's downfall will loop in Fredo, but wouldn't it be great to watch him disappear as well? After faking Covid sickness, insulting a citizen biker who caught him breaking quarantine, evading his apartment's own Covid policies, allegedly mistreating women himself, and just for being a giant d-bag, I admit I would derive immense pleasure from witnessing his professional demise. With American troops removed, the Taliban pillages, rapes, tortures, and murders without impediment. This is perhaps the least regarded, but one of the most important, stories of the Biden administration. A lot of news gets buried by daily reports of him ruining America through disastrous immigration, medical, fiscal, and regulatory policies, but the stories out of Afghanistan are equally troubling and tragic. A few recent headlines: For the record, these headlines are being broadcast in left-wing outlets like NPR and the New York Times, not just on Tucker Carlson. In the fourth article on the list, the reporter says things are so horrific and awful that he couldn't repeat them during an on-air interview. I don't even want to imagine. The next time a feminist or left-wing lunatic makes a comment that Trump or Republicans hate women, there are two layers of responses. The easier of the two would be to name something worse Trump's done than Biden did to Tara Reade, which is already impossible. More powerfully, though, you could also bring up the Biden administration's apparent acceptance of the brutal rape and enslavement of young girls by Taliban monsters. Remember, you voted for this, Chad and Karen. Also, for anyone saying a civilian population doesn't need to be armed, think again. Do you think the fathers watching their sons mutilated and daughters gang-raped wish they had an AK-47 of their own right about now? Will it really take the raping of Democrat men's own daughters to change their tune? For the life of me, I have never understood why Obama and Biden felt like giving subhuman animals notice about their military withdrawal. If you were ISIS or the Taliban, wouldn't you just wait for the U.S. to leave and spend a few months making horrific plans? Is Biden glad that illiterate monsters like Mohamed Akbar, Durkha bin Mohammud, Ahmed Muhamed or whoever were able to put an X on the calendar indicating plans to rape five young girls on August 12th? When you really think about it, it makes perfect sense that Democrats don't care about what's happening in Afghanistan. There is no political gain to be had by maintaining a troop presence or assisting the people now. Politically, it's just like the Cuban refugee crisis; the fleeing Cubans would eventually vote or procreate future Republican voters. It is absolutely disgusting to know that both the Afghanis and Cubans would get more help from the current White House if they held the 'right' political viewpoints. As with every other Democrat policy or ideation, the situation in Afghanistan once more reflects the innate evil of leftists. It is no longer enough to say they are foolish or ignorant. No, every move is calculated; if it results in death, torture, rape, and ruined lives, so be it, just as long as power and wealth are accumulated for The Party. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_United_States_federal_budget\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_United_States_federal_budget</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://nypost.com/2021/08/11/bidens-infrastructure-bill-is-chock-full-of-anti-white-racism/\">https://nypost.com/2021/08/11/bidens-infrastructure-bill-is-chock-full-of-anti-white-racism/</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/28/politics/republicans-voted-for-infrastructure-package-debate/index.html\">https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/28/politics/republicans-voted-for-infrastructure-package-debate/index.html</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-CDNN123977162894276450925979100082</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CDNN-123977</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63CC-3BH1-JCMN-Y52N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484232</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1209\"/><timeReceived>12:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Conservative Daily News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 14, 2021 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Opinion</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Trending Commentary</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DRLV</classCode><className>ANDREW CUOMO SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DPX0</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION &amp;

Immediately, he called his wife, Marian Hejl, who was at their Lefthand Canyon home with their two young daughters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Alerted to the danger, Marian Hejl went to the deck, where she too saw the plume. As Eric Hejl drove home, Marian Hejl went back inside to prepare to evacuate her family. Marian Hejl's efforts would mark the first of two evacuations the family would endure this past weekend, as they sought safety first from the CalWood Fire, which began burning Saturday, and then the Lefthand Canyon Fire on Sunday.</p><p>Marian and Eric Hejl play with their children, 2-year-old Terri, right, and 9-month-old Penny, on a large stack of wood on the family property, created from the burned trees in the Four Mile Fire, while walking the property that they have been evacuated from twice in the last week due to wildfires in the area on Tuesday Oct. 20, 2020, in Boulder, Colo. (Timothy Hurst/Staff Photographer)</p><p>\"It was probably some of the most stressful days I've ever had to go through,\" Marian Hejl said.</p><p>While their home in Lefthand Canyon near Jamestown wasn't under an evacuation order yet early Saturday afternoon, Marian Hejl, who is a principal at a K-8 charter school in Loveland, said the family wasn't going\u00a0 to take any chances.</p><p>\"With the proximity of the fire, we knew it was only a matter of time,\" Hejl said. \"And on Saturday, the winds were insane. It was the worst possible conditions for a fire to start.\"</p><p>After loading up two cars with family heirlooms, pictures and their two daughters: Terri, 2 and Penny, 9 months, as well as their three dogs and two cats, Marian and Eric Hejl went to her parents' home in Sugarloaf.</p><p>Less than 24 hours later, they learned Sunday that another wildfire - the Lefthand Canyon Fire -was burning close by. The family has friends who are volunteer firefighters and told the Hejls to be prepared to leave. While there was no official evacuation order in place, Marian Hejl and her parents decided it was time to seek lower ground. They went to her grandparents' home in Erie.</p><p>Since then, the Heijl family and Marian Hejl's parents have been able to return to the Sugarloaf home, which she said is not in an evacuation zone.</p><p>The home where Eric and Marian Hejl live has been in her family for three generations. Her grandparents, who now live in Erie, bought the property in 1974. The Hejls have lived in the home for six years. With the Lefthand Canyon Fire and CalWood Fire both burning, the couple's home is smack between the two wildfires.</p><p>\"It was very, very hard to walk away and know that we would be at the mercy of the weather and the fire,\" Marian Hejl said.</p><p>After her parents' home was caught in the Fourmile Canyon Fire in 2010, Marian Hejl said as difficult as it was to leave their home behind, they knew they had to act fast and evacuate.</p><p>\"From (the Fourmile Canyon Fire) we learned you don't take any chances,\" she said. \"If there is a fire anywhere near you, you get ready and get all the irreplaceable items out of your house, because you never know which way a forest fire is going to go.\"</p><p>As they wait to learn the fate of their home, Marian Hejl said she is grateful that her family at least had time to make preparations and gather their belongings. Some of her neighbors, who were on vacation or working on Saturday, didn't get that chance, she said. Marian Hejl said she is continuing to watch the weather and social media for updates.</p><p>The National Weather Service forecasts wind ahead on Wednesday and Thursday for Boulder County. A red flag warning has been issued for noon Wednesday to Thursday morning for strong wind gusts that could get up to 40 miles per hour.</p><p>\"Right now we believe (our home) is still standing, but with what the winds are about to do, we are definitely very nervous,\" Hejl said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4791756</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6141-M131-JBSN-32KW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"652\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Colorado Daily: University of Colorado at Boulder</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 21, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Boulder</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>CO</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOAM</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTER ALERTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001325</classCode><className>PHOTOJOURNALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000800</classCode><className>GOLF</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp; TEENS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000523</classCode><className>DOGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001434</classCode><className>PUBLIC SCHOOLS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>N541920CC</classCode><className>PHOTOGRAPHY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000279</classCode><className>CHARTER SCHOOLS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001325</classCode><className>PHOTOJOURNALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001434</classCode><className>PUBLIC SCHOOLS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>N541920CC</classCode><className>PHOTOGRAPHY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000279</classCode><className>CHARTER SCHOOLS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GS121</classCode><className>COLORADO, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

As the coronavirus ravaged the U.S., the then-vice president praised the administration\u2019s response. And after a violent mob threatened his life during an attack on the U.S. Capitol, Pence rejected entreaties to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office.</p><p>But after years of being a subservient sidekick, Pence is beginning to distance himself from Trump as he takes increasingly overt steps toward a White House bid of his own.</p><p>Last month, Pence called out Trump by name, saying his former boss was \u201cwrong\u201d to insist that he had the power to unilaterally overturn the results of the 2020 election \u2014 a power vice presidents do not possess. In a separate speech before top Republican donors, Pence urged the GOP to move on from Trump's 2020 grievances and declared \u201cthere is no room in this party for apologists\" for Vladimir Putin after Trump praised the Russian leader's maneuvering as \u201cgenius\" before his brutal invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>The moves show how Pence, a former congressman and Indiana governor, is working to craft a political identity independent of his former boss. The strategy carries substantial risk in a party still dominated by Trump and his lie that the 2020 election was stolen. But if Pence successfully navigates this moment, it could offer a model for Republicans to benefit from their work with Trump without being tied to his most toxic behavior, which has consistently hurt the party with crucial suburban voters who often determine elections.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re in the role of vice president, there\u2019s certain opportunities that affords and certainly certain constraints,\u201d Marc Short, who served as Pence\u2019s chief of staff at the White House, said of Pence's recent moves. \u201cYou sort of assume a different identity for those four years because your job is to support the president and what he\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Chinese airliner crashes with 132 aboard in country's south</p><p>BEIJING (AP) \u2014 A China Eastern Boeing 737-800 with 132 people on board crashed in a remote mountainous area of southern China on Monday, officials said, setting off a forest fire visible from space in the country\u2019s worst air disaster in nearly a decade.</p><p>More than 12 hours after communication was lost with the plane, there was still no word of survivors.</p><p>The Civil Aviation Administration of China said in a statement that the crash occurred near the city of Wuzhou in the Guangxi region. The flight was traveling from Kunming in the southwestern province of Yunnan to the industrial center of Guangzhou along the east coast, it added.</p><p>China Eastern flight 5735 had been traveling 455 knots (523 mph, 842 kph) at around 30,000 feet when it entered a steep dive around 2:20 p.m. local time, according to data from flight-tracking website FlightRadar24.com. The plane stopped transmitting data 96 seconds later.</p><p>Local villagers were first to arrive at the forested area where the plane went down and sparked a blaze big enough to be seen on NASA satellite images. Hundreds of rescue workers were swiftly dispatched from Guangxi and neighboring Guangdong province.</p><p>___</p><p>Alaska Rep. Don Young to lie in state at US Capitol</p><p>WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Rep. Don Young, the longest-serving Republican in House history, will lie in state in the U.S. Capitol on March 29, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Monday.</p><p>Young's office announced the congressman's death in a statement Friday night. He was 88.</p><p>Young, who was first elected to the House in 1973, was known for his brusque style and for bringing federal investment to the state. He was elected in 2020 to serve his 25th term as Alaska\u2019s only member.</p><p>Pelosi's office said a formal ceremony will be held with the Young family, which will be open to invited guests. Following the memorial service, there will be viewing open to members of Congress. Lying in state is an honor traditionally bestowed upon American political and military leaders. Young will lie in state in National Statuary Hall.</p><p>Pelosi had said after Young's passing that he was an \u201cinstitution\" in Congress.</p><p>___</p><p>Ukrainian refugees speak of bombs, half-empty cities, hunger</p><p>MEDYKA, Poland (AP) \u2014 Yulia Bondarieva spent 10 days in a basement as Russian planes flew over and bombs were falling on the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. Having reached safety in Poland, Bondarieva's only wish now is for her twin sister in the besieged city of Mariupol to get out, too.</p><p>\u201cThey have been in the basement since Feb. 24, they have not been out at all,\u201d Bondarieva said. \u201cThey are running out of food and water.\u201d</p><p>Bondarieva managed to speak to her sister on the phone recently. The fear of what will happen to her in the encircled and bombed-out city that is going through some of the worst fighting in the war has been overwhelming.</p><p>\u201cShe does not know how to leave the city,\u201d the 24-year-old said after arriving in the Polish border town of Medyka.</p><p>Mariupol authorities have said only about 10% of the city\u2019s population of 430,000 has managed to flee over the past week. The Mariupol City Council has asserted that several thousand residents were taken into Russia against their will.</p><p>___</p><p>Stocks turn lower on Wall Street after best week since 2020</p><p>Stocks capped a day of choppy trading on Wall Street with a modestly lower finish Monday, giving back some of their recent gains after the major indexes notched their best week in more than a year.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 slipped less than 0.1% after giving up an early gain and bouncing around for much of the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6%, while the Nasdaq composite slid 0.4%.</p><p>The indecisive trading came a day after the market posted its best week since November 2020 and as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank was prepared to move more aggressively if need be to contain inflation.</p><p>Bond yields rose sharply following Powell's remarks.

Most of these houses have been deserted since February after artillery fire prompted fearful residents to abandon their homes and seek refuge in Paletwa town and as far away as Yangon.</p><p>The sources, however, were reluctant to assign blame for the village torching to Myanmar or Arakan soldiers, who seek greater autonomy for ethnic Rakhine people in Rakhine state, which abuts Paletwa township.</p><p>One local villager who requested anonymity of out of fear for his safety said some area residents tried to extinguish the flames, but they fled when unknown assailants fired guns at them.</p><p>\"It must have been caused by arson [because] no one lives in the village,\" the man told RFA, adding that his home was among those burned down.</p><p>\"Yesterday, some people went there and had to flee when assailants fired guns at them,\" he said. \"Now, no one dares to go to the site.\"</p><p>Chin state lawmaker Salai Myo Htike said the cause of the fire in the village is unknown.</p><p>\"It's hard to say how many out of about 100 houses were burned down, but I can confirm the fire\" he said. \"We cannot tell if it was caused by armed groups or a forest fire.\"</p><p>Chin state government spokesman Soe Htet was not available for comment.</p><p>Nearly 700 people lived in Meelatwa village, located on the east bank of Kaladan River across from Paletwa town.</p><p>Salai Tay Ya, director of the Chin Human Rights Organization, said that burning the abandoned village was violation of human rights.</p><p>\"This is a very horrible human rights violation, no matter who the arsonists are,\" he told RFA. \"The villagers had plans to resettle in their former homes. Now they have lost them all.\"</p><p>AA spokesman Khine Thukha blamed the arson on Myanmar troops who came down from nearby mountains, entered Meelatwa village, and burned the houses in the lower part of the community.</p><p>\"Some villagers went there to put out the fires, but the government troops fired warning shots to scare them away,\" he said. \"The houses had been burned to the ground.\"</p><p>RFA could not reach Myanmar military spokesman Brigadier General Zaw Min Tun for comment.</p><p>Letka village torching</p><p>The village burning follows the mid-may torching of at least 200 houses in abandoned Letka village in Rakhine's Mrauk-U township.</p><p>Letka residents fled their community in April 2019following clashes between Myanmar and Arakan forces and sought shelter in displacement camps</p><p>Zaw Min Tun recently told the media that the AA was responsible for the arson during a battle, though no evidence has surfaced to back up the allegation.</p><p>New York-based Human Rights Watch has called for an investigation to determine who was responsible for the May 16 fire.</p><p>The Myanmar military widely used arson as an attack tactic during the 2017 crackdown on Rohingya communities in northern Rakhine state, burning down entire communities.</p><p>The violence left thousands of Rohingya dead and forced a mass exodus of about 740,000 others across the border and into Bangladesh.</p><p>Reported by RFA's Myanmar Service.

Please note: opinion pieces authored by Boise State faculty do not necessarily reflect the views of the institution.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Western U.S. appears headed for another dangerous fire season, and a new study shows that even high mountain areas once considered too wet to burn are at increasing risk as the climate warms.</p><p>Nearly two-thirds of the U.S. West is in severe to exceptional drought right now, including large parts of the Rocky Mountains, Cascades and Sierra Nevada. The situation is so severe that the Colorado River basin is on the verge of its first official water shortage declaration, and forecasts suggest another hot, dry summer is on the way.</p><p>Warm and dry conditions like these are a recipe for wildfire disaster.</p><p>In a new study published May 24, 2021, in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, our team of fire and climate scientists and engineers found that forest fires are now reaching higher, normally wetter elevations. And they are burning there at rates unprecedented in recent fire history.</p><p>While some people focus on historical fire suppression and other forest management practices as reasons for the West's worsening fire problem, these high-elevation forests have had little human intervention. The results provide a clear indication that climate change is enabling these normally wet forests to burn.</p><p>As wildfires creep higher up mountains, another tenth of the West's forest area is now at risk, according to our study. That creates new hazards for mountain communities, with impacts on downstream water supplies and the plants and wildlife that call these forests home.</p><p>In the new study, we analyzed records of all fires larger than 1,000 acres (405 hectares) in the mountainous regions of the contiguous Western U.S. between 1984 and 2017.</p><p>The amount of land that burned increased across all elevations during that period, but the largest increase occurred above 8,200 feet (2,500 meters). To put that elevation into perspective, Denver - the mile-high city - sits at 5,280 feet, and Aspen, Colorado, is at 8,000 feet. These high-elevation areas are largely remote mountains and forests with some small communities and ski areas.</p><p>The area burning above 8,200 feet more than tripled in 2001-2017 compared with 1984-2000.</p><p>Our results show that climate warming has diminished the high-elevation flammability barrier - the point where forests historically were too wet to burn regularly because the snow normally lingered well into summer and started falling again early in the fall. Fires advanced about 826 feet (252 meters) uphill in the Western mountains over those three decades.</p><p>The Cameron Peak Fire in Colorado in 2020 was the state's largest fire in its history, burning over 208,000 acres (84,200 hectares) and is a prime example of a high-elevation forest fire. The fire burned in forests extending to 12,000 feet (3,650 meters) and reached the upper tree line of the Rocky Mountains.</p><p>We found that rising temperatures in the past 34 years have helped to extend the fire territory in the West to an additional 31,470 square miles (81,500 square kilometers) of high-elevation forests. That means a staggering 11% of all Western U.S. forests - an area similar in size to South Carolina - are susceptible to fire now that weren't three decades ago.</p><p>In lower-elevation forests, several factors contribute to fire activity, including the presence of more people in wildland areas and a history of fire suppression.</p><p>In the early 1900s, Congress commissioned the U.S. Forest Service to manage forest fires, which resulted in a focus on suppressing fires - a policy that continued through the 1970s. This caused flammable underbrush that would normally be cleared out by occasional natural blazes to accumulate. The increase in biomass in many lower elevation forests across the West has been associated with increases in high-severity fires and megafires. At the same time, climate warming has dried out forests in the Western U.S., making them more prone to large fires.</p><p>By focusing on high-elevation fires, in areas with little history of fire suppression, we can more clearly see the influence of climate change.</p><p>Most high-elevation forests haven't been subjected to much fire suppression, logging or other human activities, and because trees at these high elevations are in wetter forests, they historically have long return intervals between fires, typically a century or more. Yet they experienced the highest rate of increase in fire activity in the past 34 years. We found that the increase is strongly correlated with the observed warming.</p><p>High-elevation fires have implications for natural and human systems.</p><p>High mountains are natural water towers that normally provide a sustained source of water to millions of people in dry summer months in the Western U.S. The scars that wildfires leave behind - known as burn scars - affect how much snow can accumulate at high elevations. This can influence the timing, quality and quantity of water that reaches reservoirs and rivers downstream.</p><p>High-elevation fires also remove standing trees that act as anchor points that normally stabilize the snowpack, raising the risk of avalanches.</p><p>The loss of tree canopy also exposes mountain streams to the Sun, increasing water temperatures in the cold headwater streams. Increasing stream temperatures can harm fish and the larger wildlife and predators that rely on them.</p><p>Climate change is increasing fire risk in many regions across the globe, and studies show that this trend will continue as the planet warms. The increase in fires in the high mountains is another warning to the U.S. West and elsewhere of the risks ahead as the climate changes.</p><p>[Understand new developments in science, health and technology, each week.

We love it,\" said Joyce Lindsay, co-president of Washougal Arts and Culture Alliance, the nonprofit organization that hosts the fair. \"Washougal is small and there's a community there that you don't get in a larger city.\"</pre></p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\"><br/>Art for sale includes works by glass artists Charlene Hale, Shirley Bishop and Diane Moeglein; silver jewelry by Karen Roule; colorful stone, glass and mixed metal jewelry by Toni McCarthy; colored pencil artwork and coloring books from Tom West; sculpted animal jewelry by Eric Berlin; oil paintings and upcycled metal robots from Chrissie Forbes; and handmade wood boxes and other wood art from Beck Lipp.<br/>A panel of judges admitted 25 artists to the 2020 online show. As a way to acknowledge how challenging last year was for creators and sellers of art, the Washougal Arts and Culture Alliance simply invited all those artists back to this year's show.<br/>\"The crowd, the people - there's something about it, especially after last year, when we were so busy at home making our art,\" said artist Cyndee Starr, aka She Who Doodles. \"You just need that feedback, plus there's the camaraderie with the other vendors. You're in your element when you do an art fair.\"<br/>The prolific Starr sells her jewel-toned floral photographs at art fairs around the region. She also participated in the Washougal Studio Artists Tour in March. In 2017, the Washougal Arts and Culture Alliance selected her work to appear on one of the festival's promotional posters, sold every year at the festival.<br/>The 2021 poster, \"Love Grows Here,\" was created by Washougal artist Anni Furniss (though she won't have a booth at the festival this year). Proceeds from poster sales, along with the artists' booth rental fees, fund the alliance's mission to bring more public art to Washougal. The event also raises money by selling $5 raffle tickets for original works of art contributed by participating artists.<br/>Camas artist Spike Palmer, a newcomer to the festival, is donating a painting of chickens to the raffle. The tattoo artist-turned-oil painter works on both canvas and wood, creating evocative landscapes and pet portraits. He'll also be selling works from his new series, \"On the Cutting Board,\" which references his other passion: local organic food. Palmer is excited to be at the festival in person and is looking forward to \"just having people see the work,\" he said. \"Painting is a pretty solitary occupation, so it's nice to have a larger audience besides me and my dogs.\"<br/>Lindsay noted that food won't be sold at the event in order to encourage people to visit nearby establishments, like Washougal Coffee Company and 2 Rivers Bar and Grill.<br/>Though the festival was originally conceived as a fundraiser for Washougal's public art, it's grown into something that's more like a celebration of the talented art community in Washougal, Camas and the Columbia Gorge, Lindsay said. It's an event that unifies people around a cause that everyone can support.<br/>\"It's been wonderful to see Washougal open up and love what we've done,\" Lindsay said. \"I personally think art makes a community better. It's not political. You may like or not like a piece of art, but it's not a fight. It's a safe place for people to come together.\"<br/>Monika Spykerman: 360-735-4556; <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:monika.spykerman@columbian.com\">monika.spykerman@columbian.com</email>\u00a0\u00a0The following fields overflowed: REFERENCE = 08-12 B1 washougal art festival advance_B01<br/>IF YOU GO<br/>What: Washougal Art Festival<br/>When: 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday<br/>Where: Reflection Plaza, 1703 Main St., Washougal.

Since the first blaze was started on July 28, over 200 fires haveraged[3] through Turkey's southern coast, killing 8 and burning down at least 'three times[4] the areaaffected in an average year.' Amid ongoing criticism against the ruling government's response, one hashtag gained momentum amongst disgruntled citizens. Following President Erdogan's visit to one of the damaged areas, where he was seen tossing[5] packages of tea to fire survivors, the hashtag #HelpTurkey spread across Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, with over 2.7 million shares across the platforms. The cry for help was accompanied by a message: </p><p><br/> I am calling all the countries which can help us. We are perished and devastated with the total of 112 fires. The ones that we can't stop are still going so strong. We don't have enough fire fighting planes to stop it. We lost 8 people, so many animals and our forests. Please help us. We need planes urgently. We only have one world. <br/> The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) was caught off guard[6]by the blaze and hadn't stocked up on fire fighting equipment. It also refused to accept foreign help, until it became clear that without it, the fires wouldbe impossible[7] to stop given the absence of local fire-fighting planes. However, it's one thing for the government to accept help and another for citizens to beg for it. #HelpTurkey was the latter. <br/> As a result, shortly after the hashtag gained momentum, theAnkara Chief Public Prosecutor's Office opened an investigation[8] into the campaign and those who shared the messageaccusing them of spreading 'anxiety and fear.' <br/> Technical examination,revealedthat some individuals and groups are trying to create anxiety, fear and panic among thepublic andinsult the state and government of the Republic of Turkeyin an organized way through real or bot accounts. <br/> According to reporting[9] by Hurriyet Daily News, the prosecutor launched the probe against the persons who coordinated fake accounts and circulated the posts containing 'criminal elements,'on charges of 'insulting a public employee,' 'insulting the president,' insulting the government and the state,' 'creating concern, fear and panic among the public' and 'inciting hatred and enmity.' <br/> The announcement of the probe came shortly after the Radio and Television Supreme Council (RTK) \u2014 the chief government censor of media \u2014warned[10] local media platforms to reduce their negative coverage of the fires, or facefines[11]. The letter said, that 'ignoring' the fires that were 'successfully extinguished' and 'insistently broadcasting only burning areas is the type of broadcasting desired by those who expect an atmosphere of chaos.' <br/> Addressing journalists after Friday prayers, on August 6, President Erdogan, who was heavily criticized the campaignsaid[12], 'In response to this, there's only one thing we can say: Strong Turkey.A terror of lies is being spread from America, Europe, and certain other places.' <br/> The president repeated his position in a televised interview[13] with journalists on August 4 calling the Help Turkey campaign a lie and a product of jealousy. <br/> Responding to the probe, the opposition Republican People Party (CHP) Deputy Group Chair Ezgin zko claimedit was a witch hunt. <br/><br/>#HelpTurkey[14] etiketiyle yap\u0131lan t\u00fcm payla\u015f\u0131mlar\u0131n verisi, a\u011f analizleri elimizde mevcut.

If any of our innocent, patrioticcitizens get hurt in thiswitch hunt, CHP will be their advocate until the end <br/> To counter the trending #HelpTurkey the government responded[17] with its own hashtags #StrongTurkiye and #WeDontNeedHelp. <br/> However, neither reached the same popularity, though numerous officials tried to promote the hashtags, including theCommunications Director Fahrettin Altun:  <br/><br/>lkemizi etkisi alt\u0131na alan orman yang\u0131nlar\u0131yla devletimizin t\u00fcm imkanlar\u0131 seferber edilerek m\u00fccadelemiz devam etmektedir. <br/>35 ilimizde 129 yang\u0131n\u0131n 122'si kontrol alt\u0131na al\u0131nm\u0131\u015ft\u0131r. <br/>T\u00fcrkiyemiz g\u00fcl\u00fcd\u00fcr!#StrongT\u00fcrkiye[18] <br/> \u2014 Fahrettin Altun (@fahrettinaltun) August 1, 2021[19] <br/> We are using allthe resources at our disposal to take the widespread fires in our countryundercontrol, and our struggle is still continuing. Out of the 129 fires in 35 cities, 122 are undercontrol. Our Turkey is strong! <br/> This is not the first time Turkish citizens used Twitter hashtags as a way to express their discontent. During the Gezi Protests in 2013, the #occupygezi hashtag and similar Gezi-related hashtags were used[20] 2 million times in only 24 hours. Images of the police usingexcessiveforce andtear gas were included under the hashtags. <br/> What makes the recent hashtag war different is the way they emerged. <br/> According to social media analyses, all three hashtags were created byautomated[21]accounts that were later removed. The hashtags were then picked up by genuine users that helped the hashtags spread organically and gain traction. Speaking to Al-Monitor, Director of German Marshall Fund in Ankara, OzgurUnluhisarcikli, said:[22] <br/> [The] #HelpTurkey hashtag was likely initially intended to highlightthe government's perceived mismanagement. This is what the government is reacting to, but in a democracy, citizens have the right to make such rhetorical statements;it's freedom of speech. This is a fight between the government and the opposition on perception management. <br/> Written byDoga Celik[23], Arzu Geybullayeva[24] <br/> [ 1]: <url

Filed with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia as a response to Powell's motion to dismiss from late March[2], Dominion's attorneys are pushing back against claims made by the attorney that her repetition of false conspiracy theories amounted to protected speech[3] by an 'attorney-advocate' speaking out on behalf of her 'preferred candidate.' Recall: Dominion is suing Powell[4] (and several other people[5] and media outlets[6]) for late 2020 efforts to explain away former presidentDonald Trump's loss toJoe Biden by repeating baseless and 'error-filled' claims made by Powell and her attorney employees that dead Venezuelan president[7]Hugo Chavez had some connection to the vendor as well as competitor Smartmatic[8]-among various other attacks on the voting machine companies. Notably, the billion-dollar defamation lawsuit against Powell is not premised on her use of those conspiracy in court pleadings but, rather, during numerous television appearances with sympathetic media outlets. </p><p>'Attorneys do not have a license to lie,' Dominion's attorneys wrote in their 56-page response motion[9], seemingly referencing Powell's book[10]. 'Although statements made inside the courtroom are subject to certain privileges that are not appliable [sic] to the out-of-court statements at issue in this case, Powell asks this Court to manufacture a sweeping and unprecedented immunity for 'attorney advocates' who knowingly or recklessly spread defamatory falsehoods during televised disinformation campaigns involving advocacy for their 'preferred candidate'\u2014i.e., to create a propaganda exception to defamation liability. No such immunity has ever been recognized and settled law forecloses this argument.' The response motion goes on: [A] law license is not a license to lie, and courts routinely permit defamation actions to proceed against attorneys based on statements made outside the courtroom\u2014even when those statements relate to litigation. Dominion's defamation claims are not based on the statements Powell made in court, but on Powell's monthslong, sustained defamatory campaign that she peddled in D.C. and broadcast on television and over the internet. Such out-of-court statements are not privileged. Powell's attorneys claim that her media appearances are not actionable statements that can be subject to defamation laws under the nation's free speech regime. 'First Amendment protections are not limited to filing lawsuits; they extend to activities that precede or are concomitant with the litigation, such as soliciting clients, publicizing the possibility of legal redress, and gaining public support,' the motion to dismiss argues. In their Monday response, Dominion's attorneys dismissed this line of thought by saying that Powell was effectively asking for the creation of an exemption to longstanding defamation law and precedent. 'The law does not confer immunity from defamation liability simply because speech could be characterized as 'political' or as involving 'advocacy,'' the filing by attorneyMegan L. Meier reads. 'Indeed, courts across the country have repeatedly held that defamation claims based on political speech could proceed.' According to the filing, Powell's previous use of cases in service of her First Amendment argument had nothing to do with defamation law. [T]he question is not whether the First Amendment protects 'advocacy,' but whether people enjoy constitutional immunity to publish defamatory falsehoods,' Dominion argues. 'The answer, under settled precedent, is no. Powell's statements are actionable because, as the Supreme Court has explained, 'there is no constitutional value in false statements of fact.' Engaging in 'advocacy' does not change that.' Law&amp;#38;Crime reached out to Powell for comment on this story but no response was forthcoming at the time of publication.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) today published an op-ed in The Dallas Morning News detailing how the Biden-Harris administration's massive spending spree could result in an inflation crisis and destroy the wealth of hard-working Americans.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the op-ed, Sen.

He's raising taxes on everything.

Ted Cruz</p><p>June 8, 2021</p><p>In just the four months that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have been in office, we've experienced a border crisis, a gas crisis, and a war in the Middle East. Now, we're also on the verge of an inflation crisis.</p><p>Since 2012, our inflation rate has been around 2% or under. But in April, it was announced that our inflation rate had ticked up to 4.2%, and it may keep going up. This is a problem because when the inflation rate rises, which can happen when the federal government prints money to keep up with a massive spending increase, our dollars have less purchasing power and prices go up.</p><p>If you're looking to remodel your kitchen, buy a bigger house to fit your family, or take a road trip this summer, you should expect to pay more to do those things than you otherwise would have just last year or in 2019.</p><p>Everywhere we look, prices are rising.</p><p>Lumber prices have increased 340% in the past year, and Americans looking to buy homes should expect to pay over $35,000 more for a newly built house. Food and even the price of diapers are rising, squeezing Americans and especially lower and middle income households.</p><p>We have also seen gas prices rise as a key pipeline responsible for delivering fuel all over the Eastern Seaboard was attacked by Russian hackers and had to shut down operations for days.</p><p>If the gas crisis is a candle flame and lumber prices are a campfire, then growing inflation is a forest fire that has ignited, and may eventually burn through our entire economy.</p><p>I've described Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale 2.0. But when it comes to inflation, Biden might actually be worse than Carter. Faced with rising inflation, higher prices and voters' discontent, Carter gave a speech in 1978 proposing to \"hold down government spending, reduce the budget deficit and eliminate government waste\" to tackle inflation.</p><p>Biden, by contrast, doesn't talk about massive government spending, our $28 trillion national debt, and our growing deficit. In his joint address to Congress in late April, Biden never uttered the words \"debt,\" \"federal spending\" or \"reduce\" - except when it came to the amount of carbon dioxide in the air.</p><p>Biden has proposed a $6 trillion budget, and Congress already passed a $1.9 trillion bill Biden wanted ostensibly for COVID-19 relief. But only 9% of that bill went to actual COVID-19 relief, and the huge price tag on the bill is part of what's driving the inflation we're seeing today.</p><p>As the author Ronald Wright once said, each time history repeats itself, the price goes up. I sincerely hope no one tells Biden what comes after a trillion.</p><p>And how is Biden going to pay for all of this new spending? By raising taxes. He's been very transparent about that. Basically, if you're an American and you're working, your taxes are going up. He's going to raise corporate taxes, individual taxes, the death tax, the capital gains tax. He's raising taxes on everything. In fact, Biden wants to raise the American corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, which would put it higher than Communist China's 25% corporate tax rate.</p><p>Even Larry Summers, who served as secretary of the Treasury under President Bill Clinton and director of the National Economic Council under President Barack Obama, argued in a recent article about Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 bill that \"macroeconomic stimulus\" could \"set off inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation, with consequences for the value of the dollar and financial stability.\"</p><p>But here's the good news - after Jimmy Carter came Ronald Reagan. The American people were tired of inflation, constant crises and a president who didn't have the strength to fight back.</p><p>Politics has a natural pendulum sense to it - things tend to go too far, and then they go back in the other direction. The far left is driving the train right now, and we need to reduce federal government spending and make the case that free markets, low taxes and low regulations work. That's what we need to do to pull our country and our economy back from the damage we're about to see over the next couple of years with Biden and the Democrats in charge.</p><p>In the Senate, I'll be fighting to curb inflation and for policies that promote fiscal sanity. The strength of our economy depends on it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124509626</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62W6-8351-JCBF-S4YF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1006\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"06\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>June 8, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

We hope you had a wonderful Christmas.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're about to hit 230 interviews with \"Tucker Carlson Today\" all an hour- long over on FOX Nation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If you haven't been watching those, we don't judge you, but we wanted to show you what you've been missing. They are long, they go places we didn't expect, and every single one of them was with a genuinely interesting person who has got something to say and we wanted to give them more time to say it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As we've said, they are an hour-long with some of the most compelling people in America -- newsmakers, authors, lawmakers, people who are having thoughts we've never thought of before.</p><p>You may have seen a few minutes of them here and on previous shows, but tonight we're focusing on just a few people. Those would include the comedian, JP Sears, Mike Tyson, and a man who treats people as they are dying, end-of-life physician called Christopher Kerr.</p><p>But first, we want to take a look back at one of our favorite conversations with sadly someone who has passed, that would be the actress Kirstie Alley, who died this fall of cancer.</p><p>Last year she was on our set, and we had a remarkable conversation. Here's part of it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CARLSON: For our viewers who know you well, this is to remind them of why they like you so much. Here it is.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP OF \"LOOK WHO'S TALKING.\")</p><p>MOLLIE UBRIACCO, FICTIONAL CHARACTER: Saint Jerome's Hospital.</p><p>JAMES UBRIACCO, FICTIONAL CHARACTER: Oh, [bleep].</p><p>MOLLIE UBRIACCO: Hey, slow down. The first stage of labor could take hours.</p><p>JAMES UBRIACCO: Yes, so does Midtown traffic.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP OF \"CHEERS.\")</p><p>REBECCA HOWE, FICTIONAL CHARACTER: I am the wife of a plumber. We are going to have a bunch of little plumbers, and the horrible part of it is, he is too good for me.</p><p>Well, I know I was going to have to take care of the dog, but I didn't know it was going to be in a place that was huge and kind of like a mausoleum and it stuck way out in the middle of the moors.</p><p>SAM MALONE, FICTIONAL CHARACTER: There are no moors in Massachusetts.</p><p>REBECCA HOWE: I think they have them flown in or something.</p><p>Well, you mean that total woman BS? I find that completely repulsive.</p><p>SAM MALONE: Well, that explains all the men beating down your door, doesn't it?</p><p>(CLIP FROM EMMY/ACADEMY OF TELEVISION ARTS AND SCIENCES.)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And the Emmy goes to -- Kirstie Alley. \"Cheers.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, you did win, Kirstie Alley. You just said, \"I hope it is a clip where I won, not one of the ones where I lost. I wonder if I actually won.\"</p><p>KIRSTIE ALLEY, ACTRESS: No wonder I was like this, hmmm.</p><p>CARLSON: So I just can't -- I mean, I've just got to ask you the obvious question. So as someone who has been in this business for so long, and been so successful in it, and then you find yourself here talking to me, obviously a great reputational risk. How did you get here? How did you get to a place where you're saying things that you clearly believe, but that aren't popular?</p><p>ALLEY: Well, maybe I've done that my whole life just about different things that -- you know --</p><p>CARLSON: Well, that's the point.</p><p>ALLEY: Are you asking me politically that's not popular.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, kind of, yes.</p><p>ALLEY: Because people will say to me on Twitter, \"Oh, you're just doing that to show off?\" And I'm like, yes, that's not how it works in Hollywood, you know.</p><p>I have been -- I just don't have much on the whole subject of politics because most of my life I voted Democrat.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ALLEY: Some of my life, I didn't. You know, I didn't -- I have never seen such insane reactions in my life, except -- and I wasn't there. I wasn't alive when it was blackballing in 1947.</p><p>But this is the first time in Hollywood, because I've never had any problem with Hollywood. I love my job. I love everything. But this is -- it started about four years ago, I was doing a project, I won't say what it was and a couple of the producers came up --</p><p>CARLSON: This was only four years ago, so you haven't been like a political person?</p><p>ALLEY: No. Not even -- no, not really. You know, I was more an environmental person or an animals right person or a human rights person.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>ALLEY: But I wasn't very political.</p><p>I don't feel like it's my group anymore, and that's sad, because I feel like my group is tolerant for real. My group is pro-human rights, pro- religious rights, pro -- I feel like that is my group.</p><p>CARLSON: Pro-people.</p><p>ALLEY: Pro-people and not this -- not pretending like we're tolerant. You can't say you're a tolerant person if you only are tolerant with people you agree with.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course.</p><p>ALLEY: I think that's sort of the opposite.</p><p>So I feel like I sort of live in a strange environment.</p><p>I'm a resident of Florida now for different reasons not just that.</p><p>CARLSON: How long were you in Los Angeles?</p><p>ALLEY: I was in Los Angeles since 1979.</p><p>CARLSON: Wow.</p><p>ALLEY: Yes, and I'm not one of those people like, \"Oh, LA blah, blah, blah.\" I love Los Angeles.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, me too.</p><p>ALLEY: I love it. I love the vibe. You know, I've always lived sort of close to Paramount Studios and that is the first studio that I worked in when I did \"Star Trek.\" And that's where we shot \"Cheers.\" And the last show, I shot was \"Scream Queens,\" and we shot in Paramount Studios.</p><p>And every time I drive in there, I'm like, \"Oh, my God, I'm everything.\" I mean, that's what I'm really impressed with myself. I drive in --</p><p>CARLSON: That's a cool entrance.</p><p>ALLEY: Yes, and the guards there. \"Oh, hi, Kirstie.\" I'm like, \"Yes, hi.\" Because people will say to you, if you're real cocky, that's when I feel cocky, when I drive to those, if you've never seen the Paramount gates, they're huge.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, they are cool.</p><p>ALLEY: They are impressive. They are --</p><p>CARLSON: Old fashioned. Yes.</p><p>ALLEY: Yes, so when I drive in there, I'm everything, to myself even.</p><p>CARLSON: That's the best way to be.</p><p>ALLEY: But usually, I am not, but when I go in there, I go, \"You really are something that you get to work here.\" It's like Christmas.</p><p>There is a camaraderie, sorry, with your peers.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course.</p><p>ALLEY: They actually would call me out, then they would insult my work or something.</p><p>CARLSON: Directly to you?</p><p>ALLEY: Directly on here, like, you know, so and so was much funnier than you and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, like a personal attack. And like I said, I just feel like that should be --</p><p>CARLSON: These are people you knew personally?</p><p>ALLEY: A couple, but the one that were -- they were way bigger stars than I am that, you know, producer/director, way bigger stars than I am that -- then -- that called me up. And I was like, \"Why are you doing this? Who are you talking to? Who's your audience? Who are you talking to?\"</p><p>CARLSON: Right. Exactly.</p><p>ALLEY: Are you trying to get everyone to hate me? Apparently. And when I -- you know, when I see people's -- when I see their political tweets, you know, I think probably as a whole the Hollywood community, they're good people, and they do have strong political views.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ALLEY: They have strong, you know, human rights, and just, you know, civil rights, and they have strong views. And I do think that they can have an effect on the rest of the world in a good way. Not always, but in a good way.</p><p>So I understand people's views, and so when I would see people that I knew or people I've praised a lot like on Twitter, and gone, \"Oh, my God, I saw you in this movie, you were so brilliant,\" or this or that. They like all of that.</p><p>And they're over there talking about maybe this time the opposite. We're for this person, you know, we're Democrats, we're doing this. We're blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I would look at it and I go, \"Well, that makes sense. I get it.\" Okay, blah, blah. But it's not like oh, my God, now I'm going to torch you or I'm going to stop following you because you are too passionate about your --</p><p>CARLSON: You know, that seems insane. Do you know people in your world, your business, who have roughly the same views you do or dissident views who are afraid to say so?</p><p>ALLEY: I probably -- I would say that the majority of my friends and the majority of people that I know and it's just in Los Angeles are Democrats.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ALLEY: And they're going to vote across the board. They're not going to change ever. They're never going to go, \"Oh, I'm going this route.\" They're just not. That's the way they are.</p><p>So the majority of my friend because the majority of my friends in Los Angeles are probably actors, people I've worked with.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ALLEY: Directors, producers, and things like that. So I expect that.</p><p>CARLSON: So why didn't you do that? That's the easier thing to do.</p><p>ALLEY: I didn't do it, I guess, this time because I've seen things going so haywire. You know, I was raised, I was just talking to someone who works with you here and I am from Kansas, so I was raised pretty practical.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ALLEY: I guess you would call it.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ALLEY: Pretty, you know, just not morals shoved down my throat, but you know, just my dad says, you know, if you lie, you're going to have a horrible life. You know, you might get away with it, but you're going to have a horrible life. So at some point, make a decision to stop lying.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ALLEY: And I think well, God, he is so stupid. You know, like, who says things like that?</p><p>CARLSON: How old were you when you realized that was true?</p><p>ALLEY: For me, it was when he told me that because he said he was the biggest liar in the world until he was 13. He said, I would lie about everything. And then he goes, I realized I couldn't remember all my lies. I was having a horrible life. I was terrible.</p><p>And he goes, like, I just stopped lying and my life turned good. So I probably lied longer than him. I wasn't lying about everything, but I probably lied till I was -- I would tell lies until I was about 18, I'd say.</p><p>CARLSON: And then you gave it up.</p><p>ALLEY: I gave it up when he told me you know, I thought, \"I'll give it a try.\" My life's not going so good, so I'm just going to give it a try.</p><p>CARLSON: So you just decided you weren't going to lie about what you thought?</p><p>ALLEY: I wasn't going to lie about, well, like doing things, just normal things. Like if I go out and I say where were you? I'm over here. I'm lying. Right?</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>ALLEY: And I'm thinking, well doesn't everybody lie about this stuff? So, I thought well maybe I'll adopt this because he seems like a pretty happy guy, but I was raised with some really nice morals. I was also really lucky because I was raised -- I wasn't raised by people who were prejudiced.</p><p>So I didn't have that. I didn't have some of the prejudice that I would be accused of if I was voting for Trump, let's say.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>ALLEY: I don't even know where that comes from. But I wasn't raised like that. I've never been like that. It's -- so I guess now, when I started thinking, I just started watching certain things in the world, like I wanted simple things.</p><p>I'm not, you know, a rocket scientist. I was like, I want people to have jobs. I want people to have, you know -- I'd like gas to cost less money. I'd like people to have good schools and just really commonsense kind of things.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ALLEY: So when I would listen -- when I was listening to Trump say what he was going to do. I thought, well, you're saying you're going to do what I think we should do. He is not like Mr. drug, drug. Do you know what I mean?</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ALLEY: He is not Mr. Pharmaceutical, he's not -- and I have my own views on what's going on in our country and how many artists we've lost to fentanyl and other drugs, [bleep] sitting right in front of our faces.</p><p>So I felt like, I would like to give this guy a chance.</p><p>CARLSON: So his firmness on drugs, drugs kill people. They're obviously hurting the country. He said that out loud.</p><p>ALLEY: He said the pharmaceuticals -- you know, like, why is everybody doing drugs now? Why is everybody on pharmaceuticals?</p><p>CARLSON: It is such a great question.</p><p>ALLEY: Why? Why are we all suddenly mentally ill? Why -- we aren't. And if we -- it's not that I don't agree that everything -- and this is -- he may say this or he may not, I don't know, I don't to put words in his mouth. But it's not like -- it's not like depression doesn't exist. It doesn't --</p><p>It's not like postpartum doesn't exist. It's not like anxiety doesn't exist. It's what do you do about it?</p><p>CARLSON: That's right.</p><p>ALLEY: So in my universe, it's what do you do about it?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CARLSON: JP Sears is one of the funniest people on the internet. You may have seen him on YouTube. He's brave. He's really, really smart, and even better for a full hour. He joins us straight ahead.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JP SEARS, COMEDIAN: It feels so good to come away with the championship and I want to congratulate second place for being within nine minutes of me. And I want to thank my sponsors for always having my back -- Manscaping, Dollar Beard Club and Alpha Jockstraps.</p><p>Now that I'm the top female swimmer, what's next for me? Well, I don't feel like I'm 22 anymore, so I think children's sports is next.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: That was JP Sears, one of the funniest people on YouTube.</p><p>He became especially popular, really broke out after he dared to mock COVID law and we thought we want to meet this guy and talk to him. We spoke to JP Sears at length about how he makes these videos and what he thinks as he does it. Here is part of the conversation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CARLSON: So what's the process for creating one of these videos?</p><p>SEARS: The damn videos write themselves, Tucker. Like I just look at the headlines and like they're doing that now, okay.</p><p>One of the basis of comedy is exaggeration, and right now, reality, is the most exaggerated experience that I could ever imagine just what the people in charge are doing, what the media is doing. It's so absurd.</p><p>So the comedy in my opinion just writes itself and then all I do is feel like, all right, what am I emotionally charged about? Whether it's anger, happiness, joy, anything in between, and I just feel all right, I have an emotion about this particular issue. Let me follow that emotion and I'll start writing a script about it.</p><p>And also part of that process is looking for the lies, hypocrisy, corruption in the story under the story that's not being spoken about.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>SEARS: So, for me, the sort of satire helps slice open the reality of what seems to be to expose a greater truth of what's actually going on or at least possibilities that are actually going on.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, you have a very keen eye for irony, hypocrisy, and a sharply attuned ear to language. I thought your video on my body, my choice --</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEARS: Let's just say no, we're not talking about killing a baby inside your body. Well, are we talking about injecting a very profitable pharmaceutical product into your body? Yes, we are. Well then you should have no say in the matter because it's your body someone else's choice. So my body my choice is a false statement.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: But why is it my body my choice when it comes to abortion but not my body my choice when it comes to the vaccine?</p><p>SEARS: I don't think mind body my choice as it is played out in woke culture, I don't think it's based on a principle.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>SEARS: If it was based on principle then my body, my choice would mean something when it comes to all topics.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>SEARS: Abortion, vaccines, anything, but because it's not based on principle, it is based on propaganda, the reality of it shifts. Of course, your body your choice. Go have an abortion and we're going to celebrate you for making such an empowered choice. Oh, you don't want a vaccine? Well, that is the unvirtuous thing to do.</p><p>CARLSON: You can't have a job.</p><p>SEARS: You can't have a job. Get out of society. So it's so obvious, but I think anything that's not based on principle really deserves to be ridiculed because when it's -- when that topic is perpetuated, it doesn't seem to serve anything other than a propaganda narrative that feeds someone's agenda.</p><p>But if something is based on principle, it'll usually stand strong when it's held up against ridicules.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. Since you're getting a big audience at this point, does it affect your daily life? Like you show up at Trader Joe's, are people like \"I know you?\"</p><p>SEARS: Yes. Yes. You know, typical, I'll be stopped quite a bit in public. But you know, no matter how often I'm stopped, there is nothing but gratitude. I mean, kind people that want to share a moment of time to voice their appreciation and share a smile. It's like, that's such a blessing. And for me, that's, I interpret that as God affirming me, \"JP, you're on the right path. Here is a beautiful person meant to affirm you.\"</p><p>So I've gotten nothing but gratitude for it. But it's also a reality. If time is of the essence, then I might have to choose different movements.</p><p>CARLSON: Do you find yourself becoming more absorbed in your faith as you get older? Or has that always been a big feature of your life?</p><p>SEARS: My faith has changed. I used to be like, hey, Tucker, I'm a spiritual but I'm not religious.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>SEARS: Several things have changed. Like I'm now -- I'm all those things. Like the past two years, Christianity has become very appealing to me.</p><p>CARLSON: Were you not a Christian previously?</p><p>SEARS: I mean, by birth and baptized -- I was baptized Catholics, so -- but no, like, I would say, I wouldn't call myself a Christian previously, and now the Christian values, they make a lot of sense to me. And a couple of things have changed that. One, I understand now why communists disconnect people from God, and when I see --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, that's the first thing they do.</p><p>SEARS: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. Kill the priest, first thing.</p><p>SEARS: When I see that movement starting to happen in our country, like what the tyrants want to take away, it gets my attention, and it is like, oh, there must really be something there.</p><p>And then also the birth of my child, just watching him be born. It was the most religious, spiritual, God is present here, now life makes sense. This is God unfolding himself into human incarnation.</p><p>So watching my son be born, woke up something new inside of me.</p><p>So, and it's just weird. The more tyrannical the world gets, the more I see people, including myself, moving more and more into Christian values.</p><p>CARLSON: I see that everywhere. You really feel that happening?</p><p>SEARS: I do. There hasn't been some convention around like, hey, everybody, like you're new to Christianity or you're a former liberal, come, let's -- no, it's just like this natural migration of the human psyche that seems to be going towards Christian values.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CARLSON: Mike Tyson became world famous 40 years ago, moved to probably the greatest heavyweight boxing champion of all time.</p><p>But we sat down with Mike Tyson. We didn't talk that much about boxing. He turns out to be a genuinely deep and interesting person. He talked about his faith, about God, and what it is like to sleep for 14 years between two 400-pound Bengal tigers, which he did. That's ahead.</p><p>JACKIE IBANEZ, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Welcome to \"FOX News Live.\" I'm Jackie Ibanez in New York.</p><p>Eyes on the Supreme Court in the coming days as it considers the fate of Title 42. The Trump-era policy which bars migrants from seeking asylum in the US remains in limbo while the High Court weighs whether to let it continue or expire. The Biden administration is pushing for its expiration, but officials along our Southern border fear that it will trigger a chaotic wave of illegal crossings into the US. The Customs and Border Patrol reports nearly 600,000 migrants have already entered since October 1st.</p><p>Meanwhile, many Republican lawmakers reported to be furious at some of their colleagues for signing off on a $1.7 trillion spending bill. Opponents of the package argue it contains too much pork. The bill was quickly passed last week just before Congress went home for Christmas and is now headed to President Biden's desk.</p><p>I'm Jackie Ibanez. Now back to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Enjoy.</p><p>CARLSON: Welcome back to a Special Edition of TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.</p><p>Mike Tyson is the youngest man ever to win a heavyweight boxing title. We sat down with Mike Tyson for over an hour to talk about his life, his career, boxing, but then it moved in all kinds of other directions, so we're grateful that it did.</p><p>We talked about animals. He knows a lot about animals and has learned a lot from them, and about his faith in God. It turned out in the end to be one of the greatest conversations we've ever had.</p><p>Here's part of it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CARLSON: You still have tigers?</p><p>MIKE TYSON, FORMER PROFESSIONAL BOXER: No, I have little kids. If I didn't have kids, it is just me and her, we would.</p><p>CARLSON: So when your kids grow older, you're going to have tigers again.</p><p>TYSON: I'm not going to be -- I'm not going to be as strong as to handle them. You've got to tough with them sometimes.</p><p>CARLSON: Really?</p><p>TYSON: Yes. They understand -- listen, not the tigers as much good because they get offended, they get depressed when you reprimand them. But lions are like dogs. Hey seek him. Hey, get over here. Just like dogs.</p><p>Cheetahs, too. Cheetah are more like dogs because cheetahs bark, they don't growl like cats that purr, they bite, they bark. So most cats -- some cats are in the dog family.</p><p>CARLSON: Really? So a cheetah behaves like a dog.</p><p>TYSON: If a cheetah and the lions, tigers no so, but you can tell them what to do when they like attack somebody, they'll jump on you, they come out with you. Tigers they are not like -- they just want to hang out with you alone. They don't want to be friends with no one else.</p><p>CARLSON: Is it dangerous to have friends over when you've got tigers?</p><p>TYSON: I normally don't have -- I have them in the cage when my friends come over.</p><p>CARLSON: Do you -- so you're saying as you get older and you become less aggressive, the cats can smell that.</p><p>TYSON: Yes, they need -- now, listen, they have to be put in their place. The tiger knows he has to be put in his place and if you're not able to put him in his place, they are going to put you in your place.</p><p>CARLSON: So you've got to be the Cus D'Amato to his Mike Tyson?</p><p>TYSON: Absolutely, and it doesn't have to be brutal.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>TYSON: It doesn't have to be brutal. Listen, you can teach these cats, right? You could teach them, but very few like only half a percent could be trained. You can't tame them. You could train them, but you can't tame them, only half a percent.</p><p>CARLSON: What's the difference?</p><p>TYSON: Well if you train them, they'll do trick for you. You hang out with them. They do this and then you've got to put them away.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>TYSON: You know when you have them free, they just sleep in the bed with you.</p><p>CARLSON: You can do that.</p><p>TYSON: Yes. Right. But I don't have lions, but I had tigers in my bed and I had two of them in the bed, that's when they don't go well together. You stay in the bed, they want to get close to you, you've got two four-hundred pound cats fighting with you. Holy [bleep].</p><p>You're trying to roll to the floor. You roll on the floor and they are fighting on the bed because they want to get close to you. When one wants to get close to you, they start fighting.</p><p>CARLSON: How do you break up a tiger fight?</p><p>TYSON: I don't. You know, I mean, they just want to beat the hell of the other. The other one runs to me, the other tiger gets behind me, this guy comes to me. [Bleep].</p><p>CARLSON: Just like three in the morning in your bedroom?</p><p>TYSON: It's a fight [bleep].</p><p>CARLSON: I don't think I can handle that level of drama.</p><p>TYSON: I didn't think I could either, and that happened to me before. That used to happen since they were first born, they slept with me, hanging out with me and this never happened before. Never happened. I never thought about bringing them up to come upstairs to hang out.</p><p>But listen, if they have a fight, I get up -- the whole house, you have to leave. Yes, they fought, oh God. Holy.</p><p>I had to get the whole house flushed out, man.</p><p>CARLSON: Why?</p><p>TYSON: Because oh man, you think somebody threw a nuclear bomb on you or something. You can't breathe.</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, the musk.</p><p>TYSON: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Ooh, they're spraying that stuff everywhere.</p><p>TYSON: Listen. And if you're not careful, sometimes they do this to you and then they walk, pow, they hit you with piss. Holy [bleep]. They just sting you sometimes.</p><p>CARLSON: They do? Out of contempt or love? Or why did they do that?</p><p>TYSON: Sometimes you piss them off. Sometimes they are doing jokes on you and they piss on you. They just walk by, and they rub up to you, and they're face licking you and walk, pow. And it comes from the back. It comes out and then they go like, they kind of drop down and they come back. Pow. It hits you right on -- and the smell of the piss, holy. [Bleep].</p><p>CARLSON: It's really strong.</p><p>TYSON: I mean, listen, ammonia don't have nothing on that.</p><p>CARLSON: Really?</p><p>TYSON: Well, you can pass out and you've got to see it, man. And when they do it, listen, it comes out like spring, powerful. Boom. The tail goes up and bam. Boom it hits you. What the [bleep]. You die from the smell. The smell is worse than -- oh, man.</p><p>CARLSON: How long did you have big cats in your house?</p><p>TYSON: Fourteen years. Thirteen years, something like that. When people came in, I took them to their cage where they run around and stuff.</p><p>CARLSON: Did you ever worry you were going to get bitten?</p><p>TYSON: I should have been, but my ego told me I've got these big mother's under control. They didn't talk to me and try to jump on me. You have the idea, but you have to show them respect. You show them -- you don't show respect to these animals, you finished. You've got to kiss them, love them, stroke them.</p><p>I show love.</p><p>Fear is like fire, if you know how to control it, it keeps us all warm. It heats our food, and everything. But if you let it get out of control, they destroy you and everything around you.</p><p>CARLSON: That's such a smart point. How do you -- how do you keep it in its box where it's the nuclear reactor that fuels you, but it's not the forest fire that destroys.</p><p>TYSON: I don't know. It is program. I could be in a room with a bunch of really bad -- you know, you may consider bad, but very interesting people that I maybe shouldn't be able to leave that room. But it's just my projection of how I feel, and I project it with everyone else.</p><p>CARLSON: When you hear people say they don't believe in God or there is no God. What do you think of that?</p><p>TYSON: I just think most people that believe that, they are just not willing to open up their mind. They are stuck into what they believe and not willing to listen. They are not willing to listen because if they were, if one guy thinks Jesus didn't exist, He didn't do that -- they just don't have the belief, and without the belief, you're nothing.</p><p>I don't care how successful you are. Without the belief, you're nothing. Most of these guys that are atheists are miserable.</p><p>CARLSON: They're miserable.</p><p>TYSON: You know. You talk about God, somebody is going to get mean and mad. Really? Where is God, huh? Is he little man upstairs controlling all five billion of us? That's him. I don't know, but He sees all of us. He sees us, he sees the ants. You know, I'm not complaining, but God is here, he sees the ants, he sees the bugs. He can see the microscopic stuff that we can't see that's killing us, the pollution, He sees it all.</p><p>CARLSON: And that's obvious.</p><p>TYSON: And I feel -- and sometimes, I don't even like that sometimes they say, He. Who am I to think I know what God truly is.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>TYSON: Because I read about him in the Quran, or the Bible or something, I have to know, is he a male or female? That can be chauvinistic. The world is chauvinistic.</p><p>CARLSON: Does it bother you to get older?</p><p>TYSON: No. I'm looking forward to dying.</p><p>CARLSON: Why?</p><p>TYSON: I know that's going to be the next great moment in my life.</p><p>CARLSON: Really?</p><p>TYSON: Absolutely. You think dying is bad?</p><p>CARLSON: No, I don't actually.</p><p>TYSON: Oh, I thought you were one of those guys, \"Oh, God, were going to die.\" The expiration date.</p><p>Dying is just as beautiful as life. Life won't be beautiful, if death wasn't beautiful. Death won't be beautiful if life wasn't beautiful. It is the way that we conduct our business when we get there. Our conduct in hell and heaven.</p><p>You know, we're in hell and heaven now in here.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>TYSON: I mean, if we are sorry, we're going to pick. You know, I look at it like this. There's no such thing as the devil. The devil is not stronger than the Spirit of God. But God made him to see if we really -- if this guy is going to take us away from Him. I really believe everything God taught us in the Bible, Quran, whatever. So we've got to believe that, or are we going to hang out with this guy?</p><p>And that's why God created this guy to see if we are really loyal to Him and not this guy.</p><p>CARLSON: True.</p><p>TYSON: A woman or whatever.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>TYSON: You know, I think everything that was written by a woman was pretty much what was that thing again? When you don't know who wrote it.</p><p>CARLSON: Anonymous.</p><p>TYSON: Anonymous. Somebody told me, everything anonymous is written by a woman. No, really somebody told me.</p><p>CARLSON: You're impossible. When did you decide you weren't going to be afraid of death and look forward to it?</p><p>TYSON: Oh I did some -- I met some Shamans -- I did some plant and I did some animal medicine, the toad. I did a lot of stuff, and it prepares you for not being afraid of death. It gives you dignity because some people, they take God's blessing of death. And they look at it as being sad, and this is part of life, if you're not going to handle this, this is what God wants us to do. He made us to die. He made everything to die and made us to die with dignity.</p><p>CARLSON: And you're totally prepared to die with dignity.</p><p>TYSON: Well, listen, I don't know if I'm afraid of death, but I know I don't claim the life, that's what I do know.</p><p>CARLSON: Is this something that you've come to in your 50s? Did you always feel that way?</p><p>TYSON: Never no. I was like everyone else. Oh, God, I'm going to die, but I will do as much as I can, much this, much that, much that, but that's not -- that's not the reality of life.</p><p>We have to go. You have to make space for other people, other trees, the bugs, we have to step on the bugs for all of these years. We have to let them eat us now. That's just the way it is.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CARLSON: What's the one thing everybody lies about? Their weight, their taxes? No, their death. Everybody dies in the end. Everyone pretends they don't. So we sat down with someone who ministers to the dying and we learned a lot.</p><p>In just a moment, hospice physician Dr. Kerr sharing his observations about death, not what you'd expect. That's next.</p><p>CARLSON: Welcome back to a Special Edition of TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.</p><p>Everybody in the end dies. When you lie about that and pretend it's not true, and it is not really going to happen, you make people neurotic and crazy, which is where we are now. So we thought it'd be interesting to sit down with someone who sees death every day, a hospice physician and ask him what have you learned from this? Has it made you less or more afraid of death? What is it really like?</p><p>And we're glad we did because it was one of the more affirming conversations we've ever had. Christopher Kerr is the man. Here is part of the conversation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DR. CHRISTOPHER KERR, HOSPICE PHYSICIAN: Religious themes and concerns come up less frequently. I think that's an earlier thing people work through. And that's what's so fascinating --</p><p>CARLSON: Earlier meaning before they get to hospice?</p><p>KERR: Yes, and that's when they make peace with their God. That sort of thing.</p><p>At the very end, it doesn't tend to be that. People don't talk about God in theological terms, and I don't think you necessarily have to talk about God in those terms. You know, the argument is, to know God is to love. And our first and last classroom is really our family. So what people talk about, not surprisingly, is their relationships, that tends to be what they talk about.</p><p>And that's where this work is so fascinating. Because they're often put back together with the people in their lives, who loved the most. So that's what they're dreaming about.</p><p>CARLSON: Reference dreams. We have, and I'd like you to explain if you would.</p><p>KERR: Sure.</p><p>CARLSON: What exactly that looks like. But I just want to start this conversation with a clip about a minute long, and I think that this is effectively an interview you did with one of your patients called Ginni (ph).</p><p>KERR: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Who's dying and describes her dreams?</p><p>KERR: Sure.</p><p>CARLSON: Here she is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GINNI, PATIENT: Just laying in bed and people were walking very slowly by me. The right hand side I didn't know, but they were all very friendly and they touched my arm or my hand when they went by and -- but the other side were people that I knew. My mom and dad were there, my uncle. Everybody I knew that was dead was there and they passed and did the same thing.</p><p>I thought it was a good dream but boy I remember seeing every piece of their face and I mean, I know that was my mom and dad and uncle and my brother-in-laws.</p><p>I have seen my mother recently more.</p><p>KERR: And how do you feel when you see her?</p><p>GINNI: Oh, wonderful. I can't say that my mother and I got along all those years, but we made up for it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So that is a patient in her last days.</p><p>KERR: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Who is remarkably -- appears from that tape -- lucid, she doesn't come out of it at all? And what is she describing exactly?</p><p>KERR: So a couple of things that are really important to point out, these are university approved studies. So you have to have, the people can't be confused. We interviewed people every day until death and an inpatient, she was at home. And, you know, eighty, ninety percent of the people have at least one of these experience, overwhelmingly comforting.</p><p>And there are a couple of clear things that happened --</p><p>CARLSON: In their dreams?</p><p>KERR: You know, we use that term, but what we hear from our patients more often than not, is I don't normally dream and I certainly never remember or recall my dream or the dream is normally weird. These aren't weird. I've never had a patient come up and said, you know, I had this weird metaphorical experience.</p><p>These tend to be reality based in the sense that they're focused on the people who they loved, and who they typically lost. And when we track them, as they got closer to death, the event -- these events increased in frequency as they got nearer to the end. And predominantly were of those who they loved and they lost.</p><p>It's kind of this editing process. So if somebody withheld love or condition their loved, they're often left out. We've had people who had three husbands, they loved the second one, the second one appears, so they are very clearly focused.</p><p>And when we measured comfort on what the content was, seeing people who they loved and lost gave them the most comfort. What's really interesting is these experiences don't deny death. So they don't say everything is going to be okay. But what they do is affirm the life that was led, and in doing so they kind of reduced the fear of the death.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KERR: When we ask these patients to measure -- to scale the realism of this on a zero to 10 scale, ninety-nine percent say it's 10 out of 10. So it feels virtual. It actually is like a happening. They describe is as an event. They don't describe it in any other terms.</p><p>CARLSON: And they describe it in visual terms.</p><p>KERR: Oh, very visual.</p><p>CARLSON: These are not just ideas. These are things they have seen.</p><p>KERR: Yes. And what's really interesting, you showed for us to tape and all the tapes essentially are the same. Very little said -- is said between the dreamer and the person in the dream. But everything is understood.</p><p>I'm left with thinking there's a better story. The notion that those are never -- people are really gone because they're accessible to us, like when you're hearing her, Ginni, I mean, her mum's tangible to her, she feels the good parts of what she had with her.</p><p>CARLSON: And she doesn't seem -- I mean, what do I know? Just from the minute and five seconds we played, she did not seem like someone who has at all with a fever dream at all?</p><p>KERR: Oh, no, no. You can't be in our study. So we screen for confusion before we interview you, so these people are intact. A lot of them are living alone, you know, paying their bills. You know, they're not -- you have to be lucid and intact. Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Of the people whose side you've been by as they die, how many are really, really afraid?</p><p>KERR: On a percentage basis, very few -- single digit.</p><p>CARLSON: Really?</p><p>KERR: Yes, yes. It's more graceful now. I think part of our innate fight to live makes us so fearful of death.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KERR: And that's why we ran from the tiger, we don't stand in fire.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KERR: But when the inevitability comes, and you have to work through that, this issue of mortality and acceptance, you come to a different place. And that doesn't mean there's not sadness in the thought of loss, but there is more inherent comfort and grace within the process than you would imagine.</p><p>We can't see it from this vantage point. You know, we just can't and we shouldn't. You should fight like hell for everything you love --</p><p>CARLSON: But we certainly can't see it, right, the living can't see it.</p><p>KERR: Right. But you know, once you work through a bad diagnosis, and you get to that other side, and you have time to process and be loved and supported, you get to a different point.</p><p>There's teaching, you know, old people who are dying, teach children a lot about dying, you know, that they're still lovable, even though they don't look the same. That there's value in who they are.</p><p>The impartment of wisdom, all those sorts of things, things that need to be said to one another that substantiate a relationship and actually translate into bereavement.</p><p>So we've done studies on bereavement of folks who have had these experiences including her daughter, and they will tell you -- and it's measurable -- grief is different. They recall them different. They work through them different. There is a different connectivity.

WPI Researcher Awarded Grant to Assess Reliability of Burn Patterns as Forensic Tool National Institute of Justice Awards $519,893 to Improve Training, Guidelines for Wildfire Investigations March 22, 2021 Share Share Worcester Polytechnic Institute researcher Albert Simeoni has been awarded $519,893 from the National Institute of Justice to evaluate the reliability of burn pattern indicators used by investigators to determine the starting point of wildfires. Simeoni, professor and head of the Department of Fire Protection Engineering, will use a laboratory wind tunnel at WPI, field studies in a New Jersey forest, and data analysis to determine if scars on a landscape, ash deposits, and other indicators widely used by investigators reliably point to the place where a wildfire originates. AlbertSimeoni_2021__25.jpg Albert Simeoni \"Investigations are based on burn pattern indicators that have not been scientifically verified, and those investigations have consequences for the people who are impacted by fire, for government agencies, and for companies,\" said Simeoni, who is principal investigator of the three-year project. \"We want to be sure that investigations are done with the best tools available. We're not reinventing tools with this study, but we're looking at the reliability of the tools currently used.\" Wildfires burn millions of acres annually in the United States, causing extensive and costly damage to natural ecosystems, homes, and businesses. Simeoni, a former firefighter, has previously studied how wind impacts wildfires, and he has coordinated training for Greek firefighters combatting wildfires. Finding the origin of a wildfire can help explain how it started and who might be responsible. Investigators typically examine the shape of burnt grass, the angle of char left behind, craters formed into rocks, marks on buildings, and other physical signs of damage to trace a fire across a landscape and back to its origin point. Simeoni will study fire indicators in the field in collaboration with firefighters from the New Jersey Forest Fire Service, who manage controlled fires in the New Jersey pine barrens. Controlled fires, also known as prescribed burns, help manage vegetation. Simeoni also will conduct studies in a 20-foot wind tunnel at WPI, burning pine needles and other materials under varying conditions such as wind speed, fire intensity, and moisture. Finally, he will compare results from field and lab studies with the results of investigations conducted into fires that burned under similar conditions. Nicholas Skowronski, a research forester with the U.S. Forest Service, will be co-principal investigator of the project. The project is funded by the National Institute of Justice, which is the research arm of the U.S. Department of Justice. The project could, Simeoni said, validate existing forensic tools and help fire investigators work more efficiently and with fewer errors. He plans to make the study's results available to private and public fire investigators. \"Understanding where a wildfire starts can help determine how it started and who, if anyone, may be criminally or financially liable for damages,\" Simeoni said. \"As a researcher and scientist, I also know that understanding how fires start can help us determine how to prevent, manage, and stop them.\" WPI's Wind-Driven Wildfire Research Video of WPI's Wind-Driven Wildfire Research WPI Wind Tunnel Learning from the flame spread WPI's State of the Art wind tunnel gives researchers a critical tool in identifying the cause, spread and potential impact of wildfires.

Gradually, these communities replace one another until a \"climax community\"like a mature forestis reached, or until a disturbance, like a fire, occurs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ecological succession is a fundamental concept in ecology. The study of succession was pioneered at the University of Chicago by Henry Chandler Cowles, who was also one of the founders of ecology as a discipline, as he studied the plants of the Indiana Dunes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jump to a section:</p><p>What is ecological succession?</p><p>What are primary and secondary ecological succession?</p><p>What is a climax community?</p><p>What is an example of ecological succession?</p><p>Plant succession at the Indiana Dunes</p><p>How do we understand ecological succession today?</p><p>Henry Chandler Cowles, ecological succession and the University of Chicago</p><p>What is ecological succession?</p><p>Ecological succession is the process by which natural communities replace (or \"succeed\") one another over time. For example, when an old farm field in the midwestern U.S. is abandoned and left alone for many years, it gradually becomes a meadow, then a few bushes grow, and eventually, trees completely fill in the field, producing a forest.</p><p>Each plant community creates conditions that subsequently allow different plant communities to thrive. For example, early colonizers like grasses might add nutrients to the soil, whereas later ones like shrubs and trees might create cover and shade. Succession stops temporarily when a \"climax\" community forms; such communities remain in relative equilibrium until a disturbance restarts the succession process.</p><p>In this video from the National Park Service, Tim Watkins and Robert Boyd explore the Indiana Dunes, learning about its history as an important case study for the development of ecological succession theory.</p><p>Understanding how succession happens in a variety of ecosystemsand what kinds of disturbances and time spans lead to the formation of different plant and animal communitiesis important for scientists who want to understand ecosystem dynamics and effectively protect or restore natural communities.</p><p>For example, many natural communities in North America have adapted to periodic disturbances from wildfires: This can help maintain prairie or savanna communities that depend on open habitat and nutrient cycling that might occur as a result of fire.</p><p>What are primary and secondary ecological succession?</p><p>There are two major types of ecological succession: primary succession and secondary succession.</p><p>Primary succession happens when a new patch of land is created or exposed for the first time. This can happen, for example, when lava cools and creates new rocks, or when a glacier retreats and exposes rocks without any soil. During primary succession, organisms must start from scratch. First, lichens might attach themselves to rocks, and a few small plants able to live without much soil might appear. These are known as \"pioneer species.\"</p><p>Gradually, the decomposition of those plants contributes to soil formation, and more and larger plants begin to colonize the area. Eventually, enough soil forms and enough nutrients become available such that a climax community, like a forest, is formed. If the site is disturbed after this point, secondary succession occurs.</p><p>Secondary succession happens when a climax community or intermediate community is impacted by a disturbance. This restarts the cycle of succession, but not back to the beginningsoil and nutrients are still present.</p><p>For example, after a forest fire that kills all the mature trees on a particular landscape, grasses might grow, followed by shrubs and a variety of tree species, until eventually the community that existed before the fire is present again.</p><p>What is a climax community?</p><p>A climax community is the \"endpoint\" of succession within the context of a particular climate and geography. In the midwestern U.S., for example, such a community might be a hardwood forest with oaks and hickories as the dominant tree species.</p><p>A climax community will persist in a given location until a disturbance occurs. However, in many ecosystems, disturbance occurs frequently enough that a matrix of community types may be consistently present on the landscape.</p><p>For example, in an area prone to wildfires like the western U.S., mature forests may exist near grassy meadows with fewer, scattered trees. Consistent disturbance and variation in factors like water and nutrient availability over the course of decades thus allows many plant and animal communities to thrive within a particular climatic and geographic nichenot just those adapted to the absence of disturbance seen in climax communities.</p><p>What is an example of ecological succession?</p><p>Ecological succession can occur in many contexts and over many time spans.</p><p>In Hawaii and Iceland, primary succession occurs on lava flows where new land has formed; in Canada's Athabasca Dunes, it happens when new sand is deposited along a lakeshore; in the Andes, it occurs when glaciers retreat.</p><p>In many regions, secondary succession occurs where wildfires have destroyed conifer forests, or where former agricultural land is reverting to meadow or scrubland.</p><p>What these examples have in common is that the climax community is not the first one present on the landscape after succession begins: First, intermediate communities occupy the space, sometimes for many years, creating ideal conditions for the communities that follow.</p><p>Plant succession at the Indiana Dunes</p><p>The Indiana Dunes, 40 miles southeast of Chicago and today the site of both a state and a national park, served as the original field site for research on ecological succession in plant communities, and continue to serve as an ideal case study. (If you visit the dunes, you can walk along the Dune Succession Trail, which highlights the different stages of succession in a real-world context.)</p><p>In the 1890s, University of Chicago botanist Henry Chandler Cowles noticed that dunes which were further from Lake Michigan had different plants growing on them than dunes closer to the lake. The lakeside dunes had only beach grass, whereas those further from the shore had other plants like cottonwoods that could grow in sandy soil. Dunes still further back had pines, and finally behind them were mature oak forests that did not resemble the grassy dunes near the lake at all.</p><p>Through careful observation and comparisons, Cowles determined that the linear succession of these communities in space also represented a linear progression in time. The dunes farthest from the lake were the oldest and had been stable for longest, since sand shifts frequently in the wind without plants to hold it in place.</p><p>From this, he inferred that plant communities trended toward oak forests in northern Indiana over decades and centuries, and that each community created the soil and microclimate conditions required for its successor community to thrive: as grasses and cottonwoods stabilized dunes and added nutrients, they were replaced by later successional communities.</p><p>How do we understand ecological succession today?</p><p>Ecological succession is a foundational concept in ecology, which as a field examines the structure and dynamics of biological communities. Today, the concept of ecological succession continues to be studied from new angles as humans modify the global environment more than ever before. As new nuances have been added to the original theory, insights have emerged that are valuable to humans interested in managing natural resources.</p><p>For example, recent studies show that even in \"climax\" communities, changes in what resources are available may shift the balance of the species composition over time, even without a formal disturbance. Other work has examined the impact of biodiversity loss, invasive species, climate change and other anthropogenic factors in altering the way ecosystems respond to change.</p><p>As native species go extinct or become rare, new species enter ecosystems, and climate baselines shift, the communities that once dominated an ecosystem may be less likely to eventually return after a disturbance. However, studying succession can also provide valuable insights for ecologists and wildlife managers interested in restoring those natural systems: through careful management such as controlled burning or invasive species control, people can help ecological communities stay strong.</p><p>Henry Chandler Cowles, ecological succession and the University of Chicago</p><p>The University of Chicago played a key role in pioneering the scientific study of ecological succession and ecology as a discipline more broadly. Following his pivotal dissertation work in the Indiana Dunes as a UChicago doctoral student, Henry Chandler Cowles went on to become a professor, remaining at UChicago for more than three decades, until the early 1930s. He taught generations of students about the ecology of North America through course field trips across the continent from Maine to Alaska, California and Texas.</p><p>The tripsand Cowles' fieldworkare documented in the University's special collection of American Environmental Photographs, which show Cowles, students, and American landscapes from a century ago in great variety and detail.

It was one of the country's deadliest civilian disasters. The stampede began when large numbers of people thronged a narrow tunnellike passage during the event, according to witnesses and video footage. People began falling on top of each other near the end of the walkway, as they descended slippery metal stairs, witnesses said. </p><p>One of the injured, Avraham Leibe, told Israeli public broadcaster Kan that a crush of people trying to descend the mountain caused a \"general bedlam\" on a slippery metal slope followed by stairs. \"Nobody managed to halt,\" he said from a hospital bed. \"I saw one after the other fall.\" Video footage showed large numbers of people, most of them black-clad ultraorthodox men, squeezed in the tunnel. Initial reports and witnesses said police barricades had prevented people from exiting quickly. The stampede occurred during the celebrations of Lag BaOmer at Mount Meron, the first mass religious gathering to be held legally since Israel lifted nearly all restrictions related to the coronavirus pandemic. The country has seen cases plummet since launching one of the world's most successful vaccination campaigns late last year. Lag BaOmer draws tens of thousands of people, most of them ultraorthodox Jews, each year to honor Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai, a 2nd century sage and mystic who is believed to be buried there. Large crowds traditionally light bonfires, pray and dance as part of the celebrations. This year, media estimated the crowd at about 100,000 people. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who briefly visited Mount Meron around midday Friday, said it was \"one of the worst disasters that has befallen the state of Israel\" and offered condolences to the families. He said Sunday would be a day of national mourning. Netanyahu was jeered by dozens of ultraorthodox protesters, who blamed the government and police for the tragedy. Velvel Brevda, a rabbi who witnessed the stampede, accused police of putting up barriers that had prevented people from leaving through exits that were usually open in past years. \"Where should we leave from?\" he said. \"And the officers who were there couldn't care less.\" He said the government was responsible for the deaths of \"beautiful holy Jews that were killed here for no reason whatsoever, just to prove a point that they're in charge of this place instead of the Orthodox Jews being in charge.\" At least 45 people were killed, according to the Israeli Health Ministry, with four people remaining in critical condition. In the immediate aftermath of the stampede, rescue workers collected the bodies, wrapped them in white covers and laid them side by side on the ground at the site. Bodies were later taken to Israel's central forensic pathology institute for identification. Efforts were still under way to identify some of the victims and connect families with missing relatives. In the night from Thursday to Friday, cellphone coverage around Mount Meron had collapsed for hours and emergency hotlines were overwhelmed with phone calls. In the overwhelmingly ultraorthodox city of Bnei Brak, near Tel Aviv, officials were working with health care workers to connect the families of the missing. \"The picture is slowly becoming clearer,\" Kivi Hess, a municipal spokesman, told Channel 13 TV. In a race against time, a number of funerals were to be held before sundown Friday, the start of the Jewish Sabbath when burials do not take place. The country's figurehead president, Reuven Rivlin, lit 45 memorial candles to honor the dead. The death toll at Mount Meron exceeded the 44 people killed in a 2010 forest fire. That had previously been believed to be the deadliest civilian tragedy in the country's history. Zaki Heller, spokesman for the Magen David Adom rescue service, said 150 people had been hurt in the stampede. Heller told Israel Army Radio that \"no one had ever dreamed\" something like this could happen. \"In one moment, we went from a happy event to an immense tragedy,\" he said. The Justice Ministry said the police's internal investigations department was launching a probe into possible criminal misconduct by officers. The deadly stampede was also bound to have political reverberations at a time of great uncertainty following an inconclusive March election, the fourth in two years. Netanyahu has so far been unsuccessful in forming a governing coalition, and his time for doing so runs out early next week. His political rivals, including former allies bent on ending his 12-year rule, will then get a chance to try to cobble together an alliance from a patchwork of left-wing, centrist and hawkish parties. Netanyahu needs the continued support of ultraorthodox parties, his longtime allies, if he wants to keep faint hopes alive of staying in power. Israeli media reported Friday that earlier this month, Netanyahu assured ultraorthodox politicians in a meeting that the Lag BaOmer celebrations would take place with few limitations. The reports said this decision was supported by Cabinet ministers and police, despite objections by health officials who warned of a risk of renewed coronavirus infections. Last year, observances on Mount Meron were limited due to the pandemic. At the start of this year's celebrations, Public Security Minister Amir Ohana, police chief Yaakov Shabtai and other top officials visited the event and met with police, who had deployed 5,000 extra forces to maintain order. Condolences were sent by foreign leaders and diplomats, including the U.S. charge d'affaires. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wrote on Twitter that his \"thoughts are with the Israeli people and those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.\" The European Union conveyed \"deepest condolences to families and friends of the victims\" and wished a speedy recovery to the injured. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said his country stands by Israel after the \"terrifying news from Mount Meron.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Associated PressIsraeli security officials and rescuers carry bodies of victims who died Friday during a Lag Ba'Omer celebrations at Mt.

The landmark flight paves the way to this new aircraft becoming a game changer in the air and space market, plugging the gap between aircraft and satellite technology.</p><p>PHASA-35 has been designed, built and now flown in less than two years as part of a collaboration between ourselves and Prismatic Ltd, which we agreed to acquire last year. Designed to operate unmanned in the stratosphere, above the weather and conventional air traffic, PHASA-35 offers a persistent and affordable alternative to satellites combined with the flexibility of an aircraft, which could be used for a range of valuable applications including forest fire detection and maritime surveillance.</p><p>Sponsored by the UK's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) and Australian Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG), the successful flight trials took place at the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Woomera Test Range in South Australia.</p><p>The trials marked the first fully integrated flight test of the PHASA-35 system, delivering rapid proof of capability from design to flight in just 20 months. They are the culmination of efforts from a collaborative team of British experts from Prismatic in Hampshire - where two full-sized concept aircraft were built last year - working alongside our engineers in Lancashire, where the aircraft underwent further integration testing prior to flight trials.</p><p>Going the distance</p><p>As a High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) vehicle, PHASA-35 is powered by the Sun during the day and by batteries overnight. The long-life battery and highly efficient solar technology could allow the aircraft to maintain flight for up to a year operating in the stratosphere, the upper regions of the Earth's atmosphere.</p><p>PHASA-35 is designed to provide a persistent, stable platform for monitoring, surveillance, communications and security applications. When connected to other technologies and assets, it will provide both military and commercial customers with capabilities that are not currently available from existing air and space platforms. The Unmanned Air Vehicle also has the potential to be used in the delivery of communications networks including 5G, as well as provide other services, such as disaster relief and border protection, at a fraction of the cost of satellites.</p><p>Ian Muldowney, Engineering Director here at BAE Systems, said: \"This is an outstanding early result that demonstrates the pace that can be achieved when we bring the best of British capability together. To go from design to flight in less than two years shows that we can rise to the challenge the UK Government has set industry to deliver a Future Combat Air System within the next decade.\"</p><p>Our acquisition of Prismatic forms part of the Company's strategy to develop breakthrough technologies, making bolt-on acquisitions where they complement existing capabilities and provide an opportunity to accelerate technology development in key areas.</p><p>Further flight trials are scheduled for later this year, with the possibility that the aircraft could enter initial operations with customers within 12 months of the flight trials programme completion.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7023362 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7023362</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7H-MNR1-JC11-119S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"553\"/><timeReceived>6:33 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 18, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Officials say early spring is the most common time of the year for Pennsylvania wildfires; Saturday is the first day of spring.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While Thursday\u2019s rain might temporarily lessen the immediate threat posed by wildfires, our general awareness of that threat \u2014 especially this time of year \u2014 is not what it should be.</p><p>For one thing, there\u2019s the dangerous misperception that wildfires are only a California problem or a problem of the American West. News coverage of the deadly and devastating scope of those Western fires may help to drive that misperception home.</p><p>Mike Hall, one of Lancaster County\u2019s forest fire wardens, told LNP | LancasterOnline that the misperception can lead many to ignore local \u201cred flag\u201d warnings, such as the one that was issued Sunday by the National Weather Service.</p><p>Such warnings are issued when critical fire/weather conditions are either occurring or imminent due to a combination of strong winds, low relative humidity and dry fuels. Fires that develop during these times can quickly grow out of control. They can be serious.</p><p>\u201cBrush fires can kill you,\u201d Hall said. \u201cThey are not stationary.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s crucial that we take warnings seriously and act cautiously during fire season. Failure to do those things might have led to some of last weekend\u2019s fires. The Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources says 99% of all wildfires are caused by humans.</p><p>\u201cPeople make bad decisions,\u201d Rick Deppen, who manages a state wildfire program for a nine-county region, including Lancaster, told LNP | LancasterOnline.</p><p>One of the biggest precautionary measures we can take is a commonsense one.</p><p>\u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t be burning on windy days,\u201d Conestoga Fire Company Chief Larry Frankford Jr. said.</p><p>We learn from a young age not to be reckless with fire. So we shouldn\u2019t need reminders that when we have a combination of dry conditions and gusty winds, the last thing we should do is provide a literal spark.</p><p>Sparks, embers and flaming debris can jump several feet or be snatched up by the wind and cause disaster far from their original source.</p><p>Embers, especially, can remain dangerous for a long time. A Sunday barn fire in Conestoga Township was likely the result of embers from an outdoor trash pile that hadn\u2019t been burned for two weeks.</p><p>\u201cThe wind is what did it. The wind rekindled the embers,\u201d Frankford told LNP | LancasterOnline.</p><p>Carelessly discarded cigarettes also can lead to tragedy. That appears to have been the case in Lancaster Township on Sunday. As Sauro and Lohr noted in their news story, \u201cFirefighters were initially called to the area for a brush and grass fire outside of an apartment. But when firefighters arrived the brush fire appeared to be out, and smoke was instead coming from the roof of a building.\u201d</p><p>The most terrifying regional wildfire Sunday started in northern York County and burned about 150 acres in and near Michaux State Forest, according to the York Daily Record. Reignited embers from a recent campfire might have been the cause there, though an official investigation is underway.</p><p>If you\u2019ve had an outdoor fire recently and a \u201cred flag\u201d warning is issued, the National Weather Service offers this guidance: \u201cDrown fires with plenty of water and stir to make sure everything is cold to the touch. Dunk charcoal in water until cold. Do not throw live charcoal on the ground and leave it.\u201d</p><p>If you think these steps seem like a hassle, consider what a hassle (and possibly much worse) it would be to recover from an out-of-control fire.</p><p>Deppen is more succinct: \u201cJust be smart.\u201d</p><p>Being smart about all of this will be more crucial moving forward.</p><p>Climate change is shifting global weather patterns and causing many weather events to be more extreme. That can include droughts and wind \u2014 the ingredients of wildfires.</p><p>Crystal Kolden, a former firefighter who is now a college professor researching wildfires, wrote this in a Washington Post op-ed last year: \u201cThere is widespread agreement among fire scientists that climate change amplifies the effects of land management decisions, in California and elsewhere. ... These types of meteorological extremes are exactly what global climate models projected would happen, and we are seeing the effects on wildfires.\u201d</p><p>And, in 2018, the state Department of Conservation and Natural Resources noted in its Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Plan that \u201ccompared to the western U.S., fire has not been a major disturbance in Pennsylvania, but that is likely to change. There is already evidence of an extended fire season, with fires now happening year-round, not just in spring and fall. The demand for state resources to deal with emergency management ... is expected to increase.\u201d</p><p>So, while Lancaster County and south-central Pennsylvania might not be at risk for the types of horrific blazes we\u2019ve witnessed recently in California, the Pacific Northwest and Australia, the risk here is increasing.</p><p>We must be vigilant. Careless acts have the increasing potential to cost lives, destroy property, leave people homeless and put firefighters at greater risk.</p><p>We should stop believing \u201cit can\u2019t happen here.\u201d</p><p>Last weekend\u2019s many blazes were another reminder that it certainly can.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWERA-a4f36b70883e11eba1086f71493d4677</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWERA2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:627S-S4G1-JC8F-218D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">222875</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"935\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 LNP Media Group, Inc.

Researchers from the same institute have also found that b lack carbon from agricultural burning and forest fire has alerted over the years may influence melting of Gangotri Glacier. A team of Scientists from IIT Kanpur has found that aerosols like black carbon and dust, which makes the Indo-Gangetic Plain one of the most polluted regions of the world, have led to increased incidents of high rainfall events in the foothills of the Himalayan Region. In another work supported by DST, IISc researchers showed that a planetary wave from the North Atlantic is capable of derailing the Indian monsoon on which the Indian economy is heavily dependent.</p><p>Climate Centres of excellence strengthen models</p><p>Centres of excellence in Climate Change in four Indian Institute of Technologies Delhi, Bombay, Kharagpur and Madras, are working on improving climate projection models to make them more comprehensive and accurate.</p><p>The Centres of Excellence (CoEs) Centre for Climate Change, IIT Delhi, has contributed to significant improvements to the base model, moving towards development of the India Centric Climate Model (ICCM).</p><p>Connection between monsoon and irrigation practices has been established by DST Centre for Excellence in Climate Studies, IIT Bombay. They have underlined the need for representation of irrigation practices, farmers behavior, and vegetation- land and atmosphere interactions to improve model predictions and also develop agricultural vulnerability maps at the National level.</p><p>DST Centre for Excellence in Climate Change Impact on Coastal Infrastructure and the Adaptation strategies, IIT Madras is developing suitable climate change adaptation measures for coastal infrastructure and utilization of water resources. A technique is known as pseudo global warming method has been adapted and successfully used for prognostic understanding of how cyclones originating in the Bay of Bengal would behave in the near future (2025) and in far future (2075) under different RCP scenarios (a greenhouse gas concentration trajectory adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). It is predicted that cyclone damage potential will increase significantly in future. This strategic knowledge is essential for all the studies related to adaptation of coastal infrastructure, water resources management in coastal areas and preparedness of coastal communities to extreme events in the future.</p><p>Historical climate data for the Indian Ocean region has been used by Center of Excellence (CoE)- IIT Kharagpur to understand the temporal variability of wave height (SWH) over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) region for the period 1997-2015, which have been reputed international and national journals.</p><p>The temperature thresholds for survival of vectors of major Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) have been studied by the DST-ICMR Centre of Excellence for Climate Change and Vector-borne Diseases, National Institute of Malaria Research to set up a system for early warning of outbreaks for malaria and dengue. The impact of temperature on development and survival of vector of dengue (Aedesaegypti), Malaria (An. stephensi, An. culicifacies) on immature stages like eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults was studied. The most preferred breeding habitats of Japanese Encephalitis vectors were also identified in Gorakhpur.</p><p>High-risk areas have been identified by the DST-ICRISAT Center of Excellence on Climate Change Research for Plant Protection (CoE-CCRPP) for mapping the spatial and temporal distribution of diseases and insect-pests under changing climate scenarios and study hostinsect-pest/pathogens interactions in relation to simulated climate variables. This will help develop adaptation strategies to minimize crop losses and weather-based plant protection advisory tools for the timely management of diseases and insect pests.</p><p>State Climate Change Cells/Centres in the 12 Himalayan States are undertaking vulnerability assessment, training programmes, public awareness, and institutional capacity building in the area of Climate Change science, impacts, and adaptation. It led to the first-ever Pan-Himalayan vulnerability profile map covering the 12 IHR States developed under the common framework, which has been widely accepted by different stakeholders for climate adaptation planning in the IHR. It has also been extended to the rest of the Indian states using the Common Framework for rest of the Indian states, which identified eight eastern states to be the most vulnerable to climate change.</p><p>Scientists from the Indian Institute of Geomagnetism (IIG) have found that Information frozen in magnetic minerals can forecast climatic changes faster and more accurately</p><p>As part of the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), Department of Science and Technology has been entrusted with the responsibility of coordinating and implementing two national missions on climate change. These missions, the National Mission for Sustaining the Himalayan Ecosystem (NMSHE) and National Mission on Strategic Knowledge for Climate Change (NMSKCC), are being implemented through a cluster of programmes that are supporting climate change research as well as to strengthen capacity in the area and nurture future researchers in different parts of India.</p><p>Building the next generation of climate experts</p><p>In order to build capacity in the area, over 1000 scientists, experts, and 200 institutions in the country trained research students to carry on the legacy of the work. International collaborations have helped enhance this capacity and helped in the exchange of expertise in the subject.</p><p>The Government of India and the Government of Switzerland established an Indo-Swiss Joint Committee for Scientific and Technological Cooperation. The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), through its Indian Himalayan Climate Adaptation Programme (IHCAP) programme, has been working as a knowledge partner of DST in providing technical support for undertaking vulnerability and risk assessment, stakeholder training and public awareness programme to the 12 State CC Cells established under NMSHE. As part of this cooperation, a detailed district-wise vulnerability assessment has been carried out for all the 12 Himalayan States.</p><p>An Indo-US Fulbright- Kalam fellowship scheme was initiated during 2015-16. During 2016-17 to 2018-19, three batches of six fellows (3 each in Doctoral and postdoctoral students) were awarded the fellowships through Indo-US Fulbright-Kalam Fellowships in Climate Change for research in the subject in US universities.</p><p>The research studies and capacity building supported by the Department of Science and Technology has helped strengthen various aspects of climate change expertise in the country.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124501830</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62V6-W621-DYTH-G3VY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1209\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"06\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>June 4, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It can be intense. On a good elk hunt, by the third day I can barely walk. </p><p>I'm so sore, and I think that I'm in at least mediocre shape. We're also burning a lot of calories. Sure, sometimes we can eat a cold meal like a sandwich but I'm not eating a dry protein bar 3x's/day for 7-days straight. I want some hot meals and a hot cup of coffee. So there are certain times that you need a backpacking stove and the Camp Chef Stryker 200 is a great choice. Camp Chef Stryker 200 Camping Stove[2]Let's list a few times when you'll need a stove:  It is super wet and there's no dry wood. There is a fire ban in the backcountry. The area that you're in is super dry/windy and you're scared of starting a forest fire. You don't want to build a fire and make smoke thereby spooking your game. You're hunting in super deep snow and can't build a fire. You're getting pounded by rain/snow and want to cook a quick meal in your tent before crawling into your sleeping bag. You want to whip up a hot meal or hot cup of coffee out in the boat. Do I always carry a backpacking stove? No. But when I need one they sure are handy. If you've never used one, you'll be amazed at how fast they bring the little pot of water to a boiling level. You can whip up a lot of different kinds of food as long as you have some hot water available. Backpacking meals, coffee, hot chocolate oatmeal or instant dried potatoes. Also always carry a couple of dry packages of Lipton soup in case you have to rescue someone, warm-up someone after they fell in the river or finding someone half-frozen in the snow.  I mainly use mine for backpacking when fire bans are in effect or maybe on a real cold elk hunt. I'm sure in time you'll find you own applications such as a Bug-out bag, Rescue bag etc. So, what are the ins/outs of a Camp Chef Stryker 200 stove? Camp Chef claims that you can bring a  liter of water to a boil in 2-minutes. It can function on propane or butane, that's a big plus. Another big deal, like all backpacking stoves they're designed to be super compact and everything possible stores inside of another part. Carry a lightweight plastic bowl and coffee cup and you can whip out a hot meal and a piping hot cup of coffee anywhere in almost any kind of conditions. It doesn't add any weight or bulk but if you throw in a couple of motel coffee packs and a couple of Lipton dry soup mixes so you can warm up and gather your thoughts in an emergency.

Can ambitious interventions slow the pace of conflagration fed by extreme heat and drought? If so, what would they look like, how much would they cost and where would the money come from?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Go to the web site to view the video.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Video by Lindsay Filgas, Casey Mullins and Rob Jordan</p><p>As California heads toward another wildfire season, Stanford researchers discuss the causes and necessary interventions. They say multiple integrated and community-based approaches will be necessary to restore more natural fire regimes.</p><p>Below, Stanford University ecologist Chris Field and lawyer Michael Wara discuss a blueprint of roles and resources for protecting communities and restoring a lower intensity fire regime.</p><p>Field is the Perry L. McCarty Director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment and the Melvin and Joan Lane Professor for Interdisciplinary Environmental Studies. He studies climate change impacts, adaptation and vulnerability, with a focus on disaster risk reduction, especially from wildfires.</p><p>Wara is the director of the Climate and Energy Policy Program at Stanford, a senior research scholar at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment and a commissioner on California's Catastrophic Wildfire Cost and Recovery Commission. He has testified as a lead witness in California state legislative hearings on wildfire-related bills multiple times this past year, and recently authored \"A New Strategy for Addressing the Wildfire Epidemic in California,\" a white paper for policymakers that pinpoints needed interventions, such as the creation of a state office focused on fire preparedness and risk reduction and a massive investment in restoring natural forest fire regimes, and the means to achieve them.</p><p>Understanding devastating wildfires</p><p>With California's wildfire season already having devastating effects, Stanford faculty have been exploring ways of preventing fires and managing health risks.</p><p>What are the most important interventions needed and at what scale?</p><p>Field: Critical interventions fall into four major categories: upgrading buildings and defensible space around them, reducing vegetation that allows fire to climb into forest canopies, improving emergency planning and resources, and identifying homes or communities where risks are too high to manage. All of these intervention types are critical, and all need to be pursued at scale.</p><p>Wara: We need to start with a focus on people and communities: reduce the flammability of existing homes, invest in fuel breaks and similar natural fire-prevention infrastructure around communities, and restore a lower intensity fire regime in California wildlands. Restoring that regime will require dramatic increases in prescribed fire, cultural burning by native tribes and, in some cases, letting wildfires burn where necessary. All of this work needs to be done at a scale sufficient to actually change outcomes, which is why strategic planning and careful targeting of early interventions is so important.</p><p>Where might funding come from for these interventions? How much is needed?</p><p>Wara: We need the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management to be spending $5 billion to $6 billion per year for 10 years or more to really have hope of improving outcomes on federal lands in the West. But funding needs to come from all levels of government federal, state and local. Benefits will flow to locals, the state and the U.S. as a whole, and each of these actors has a unique and important role to play. Early movers in this space include local governments that are investing in fuels management and community protection as well as the state of California. The most critical actor that has really not stepped up to the challenge yet is the U.S. Forest Service. That agency's chief has acknowledged that hazardous fuel treatments need to double or quadruple in size, but the U.S. Department of Agriculture has consistently failed to ask for sufficient resources to scale the hazardous fuels management program. This needs to change urgently for California since the Forest Service owns more than half of the forested land in our state.</p><p>How can we return to a low-intensity fire regime where the risk of wildfires is significantly less than it is now?</p><p>Field: If we want healthy ecosystems with limited risk from devastating wildfire, we need a big uptick in the area annually treated to reduce fuels, probably to a level of about 2 million acres per year. Some of this treatment will be prescribed burns, and some will be mechanical fuel reduction.</p><p>What should/can the federal government's role be in this effort?</p><p>Wara: The federal government's role is absolutely crucial because it owns and manages more than half the forested land in California and even greater percentages in other western states. There is simply no way out of this problem that does not involve a major reorientation of the federal land management strategy away from timber harvest and ranching and toward public safety. Wildfires cost the state of California more than $148 billion in 2018, according to a study led by the University of California, Irvine. That same year, the total income from U.S. federal timber harvesting was a bit less than $250 million. But too often, getting the cut out, or at least some of it, is still the priority for forest units. That needs to change.</p><p>How can state and federal policymakers drum up public support for the necessary spending and changes? What are the most significant obstacles?</p><p>Wara: The most important change that needs to occur is growth in public understanding of the impacts of wildfire in places that are far from the forest. Federal and state wildfire policies do not just impact people that live in rural areas near forested lands. They impact all of us through toxic wildfire smoke emissions, through the cost of homeowners insurance and through the cost of electricity. And the list goes on. A resident of urban Los Angeles has as much interest in seeing better wildfire management as a resident of rural Placer County. We need to make these connections for all Californians as well as show how with greater investment, we can solve the problem and create lots of good and meaningful jobs in rural communities.</p><p>How would failure affect the average person's life and the state as a whole?</p><p>Wara: We depend on the most talented people in the world wanting to come and live in our state. Many of those people are concerned about their own and their family's health and safety at this point because of wildfire. If we don't get ahead of this problem, I worry that California will become a little bit like Beijing in terms of air quality a place that one might work for a few years but not a place to make a home and raise children. I also worry that failure to address the wildfire problem could fundamentally break our real estate market due to a lack of available homeowners insurance. That's a slowly developing crisis right now, but is primed to get worse, perhaps very quickly, unless major interventions to reduce risks occur.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124626124</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:639B-KDX1-JCBF-S0G7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1240\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 4, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Power was cut to 2000 homes.</p><p>The storm also continued to batter other parts of Europe. Fallen trees blocked roads and train tracks in southern Germany and Austria.</p><p>The Austrian city of Salzburg near the German border was hit by the storm Tuesday. Public broadcaster ORF reported that more than 400 firefighters worked for hours to remove downed trees from crushed cars and roads. They also had to remove a huge metal roof that was blown off a building. No one was injured, ORF reported.</p><p>German railroad operator Deutsche Bahn, which had shut down all long-distance trains on Monday, said most of its service resumed Tuesday with the exception of some trains in southern regions that were still being battered by gusty winds. Schools across Germany reopened.</p><p>Deaths due to the fierce storm were reported in Poland, Sweden, Britain, Slovenia, Germany and the Czech Republic. On Tuesday, Polish officials reported a third storm-related death in the country, saying a relative of two people killed Monday when the roof of the ski rental building collapsed also died.</p><p>In northern Bavaria, where a gust of over 160 kph (100 mph) was recorded, the storm produced a record amount of electricity being fed into the German grid from wind turbines, equivalent to almost 44 nuclear power plants.</p><p>The German Weather Service said strong winds would keep blasting much of the country on Tuesday but the brunt of the storm had moved to the southeast. In northeastern Germany, a new storm was expected to reach the Baltic coast. The German Weather Service also forecast heavy rains for most of the country as well as for France and Belgium.</p><p>In England and Scotland, the Met Office national weather agency still had 85 flood warnings in force as torrential rains caused numerous rivers to overflow their banks.</p><p>Further north, in Norway, water from the North Sea overflowed harbors and entered houses along the country's southern coast, causing damage but no victims. Local airline Wideroe canceled 21 departures because low pressure over northern Norway meant its small planes couldn't fly, the Norwegian news agency NTB reported. The low pressure was affecting the altitude gauges on the planes with no possibility to adjust for the low pressure.</p><p>In the Czech Republic, more than 40,000 households remained without electricity Tuesday morning, down from some 300,000 on Monday afternoon. Around 20 train routes were still blocked because of fallen trees on the track. Only one flight from Amsterdam was canceled Tuesday, Prague's international airport said.</p><p>___</p><p>John Leicester in Paris; Vanessa Gera in Warsaw, Poland; Karel Janicek in Prague; and Jan M.

Adjusting for inflation, this was on par with the amount of money spent by the federal government to fight World War II.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Despite the $6 trillion price tag (See figure 1), more than 1 million Americans have died from COVID-19, tens of millions of Americans were thrown into unemployment lines, hundreds of thousands of small businesses have gone bankrupt, our debt has climbed to more than $30 trillion, and inflation is raging.</p><p>We should be asking ourselves as a Nation whether, if we could turn back the clock to March of 2020, and we had simply protected the vulnerable population in our society and warned the other 80% of Americans of the high health risks associated with COVID-19, but NOT shut down society and not spent and borrowed $6 trillion, whether we could possibly have had a worse outcome. The price we pay as a society for the bad choices we made--especially shutting down our schools--will be paid for decades to come.</p><p>The Failure of Lockdowns</p><p>I salute this Committee for investigating what went wrong and how we can avoid this failed public policy response as we fight pandemics in the future.</p><p>It is now well established that economic lockdowns were a catastrophic mistake. We know from the evidence across countries and across states that the impact of mandatory lockdowns, stay-at-home orders, and other government-imposed mandates on health outcomes was small. The seminal research on this was done by the Johns Hopkins University economic/health research team which found that the death rate from COVID-19 was reduced by 0.2% due to lockdowns.</p><p>A group that I am involved with, the Committee to Unleash Prosperity, released in the Spring the seminal analysis of state responses to Covid. We examined three policy outcome metrics: 1) the mortality rate among states adjusted for co-morbidity factors, such as age and other health problems; 2) education outcomes (how many days of schooling children missed); 3) and the economic losses in terms of output in unemployment in each state.</p><p>Our results are highly relevant to this discussion of why the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan was such an economic and fiscal policy failure.</p><p>These results shown in Figure 2 indicate that the states which avoided lockdowns and kept their schools, stores, churches, and restaurants open had far superior economic outcomes to the states that locked down, with virtually no worse health outcomes than the states that locked down. For the most part, red states that did not lock down their economies as shown in Figure 3 have had substantially lower unemployment rates for the past two years than blue states that did close down their economies. There were a few blue states including Vermont, Hawaii, and Colorado, which performed well.</p><p>My favorite comparison is California and Florida. In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis kept the Sunshine State economy mostly open. In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom shut down businesses for many months. Florida's economy suffered only moderately. California's economy was hit with the policy version of a wrecking ball. And yet when adjusting for co-morbidities like average age, California and Florida had virtually identical death rates.</p><p>The states with the best policy responses and best policy outcomes considering education, economy, and health were Utah, Nebraska, Vermont, Florida, and Idaho.</p><p>The Negative Economic Impact of the American Rescue Plan</p><p>This brings me to an assessment of the highly negative economic and fiscal impacts of the 2021 American Rescue Plan. Here are my conclusions:</p><p>1) The $1.9 trillion of spending was entirely unnecessary. The economy was already in recovery that predated the passage of the Recovery Act by at least six months. In the third quarter of 2021, we had the largest increase in GDP on record (particularly assisted by the red states that reopened their economies in the late spring and summer of 2020). The further and overriding stimulus to the economy in 2021 was the vaccine created under President Trump's Operation Warp Speed. This program delivered the vaccine more than a year or two ahead of what almost all experts thought was possible. This saved hundreds of thousands of lives in the U.S. and millions of lives across the planet. It also facilitated even more businesses reopening.</p><p>2) There was already more than $1 trillion in the fiscal pipeline from previous COVID-19 relief bills--as even Democratic economists like Larry Summers, who served under Presidents Clinton and Obama, warned.</p><p>3) The $1.9 trillion of spending and borrowing has unleashed the cruelest tax of all on American families and businesses: the worst inflation rate in 40 years. Figure 4 shows that the match that lit the forest fire of 8% to 10% inflation was clearly the Recovery Act. It is worth noting that the inflation rate when President Trump left office was 1.4%--even as the recovery was well underway. Economic growth does not cause inflation. Inflation is caused by excessive money and policies that reduce the supply of goods and services.</p><p>Because we haven't seen inflation this high since the early 1980s, it is critical for the members of this Committee to understand how destructive a rising CPI can be to American families. In the late 1970s and early 1980s when inflation last hit double digits, real family incomes plummeted. The lowest-income families took the biggest loss in real incomes--which is why inflation is such a regressive tax that increases income inequality.</p><p>During the Trump presidency, before COVID-19, the median household income rose by $6,446. This was one of the largest three-year gains in income for middle-class families in American history. The combination of output gains due to deregulation, America first energy, and the Trump pro-growth tax cuts PLUS inflation of less than 2% facilitated these enormous gains in family incomes for all income groups and all races, as well as a highly prosperous period in terms of incomes and wealth creation. As a result, the poverty rate for all races hit their lowest levels on record.</p><p>Under President Biden, inflation has cost the average American roughly $1,550 a year in lost real income. It is my prediction based on the cascading inflation levels we have experienced over the last year, that virtually ALL of the income gains delivered under President Trump may be erased as a result of the surge in inflation by the end of President Biden's second year in office.</p><p>In other words, under President Trump real median income gains were more than $6,000. Under President Biden, real median income losses will be as much as $5,000 to $6,000 when adjusting average wages and salaries for the 8.6% inflation over the last year.</p><p>To put it very simply, Americans are getting poorer month after month because of the inflation unleashed by the American Rescue Plan.</p><p>Of course, this doesn't even include the highly negative effects of a possible recession later this year that many economists are now forecasting as a result of the high inflation levels that the Federal Reserve is now having to combat with higher interest rates. The American Rescue Plan generated negligible improvements to output and incomes, and those would be entirely negated by a recession.</p><p>4) One of the worst mistakes in the Recovery Act was the supplemental unemployment benefits. These supplemental benefits began with a deal between President Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to increase unemployment benefits by $600 a month. This was later reduced to $300 a month. Our studies at the Committee to Unleash Prosperity showed that with the supplemental UI, plus expanded food stamps, plus rental assistance, plus expanded Medicaid, and the evisceration of the Clinton-era work-for-welfare reforms, families with two unemployed parents and two kids could receive a tax-free income of $100,000 or more--WITH NEITHER PARENT WORKING A SINGLE HOUR. Our analysis also showed that states which canceled the early UI benefits early had much lower unemployment rates. Extended unemployment has deleterious effects on families. Paying people not to work is a REALLY BAD IDEA.</p><p>University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan and I published a paper last year showing that if we had reduced the payroll tax rather than increased unemployment benefits, we would have had 3 million more Americans working throughout 2020, 2021, and through the first half of 2022.</p><p>Worst of all was the rampant and uninvestigated/unpunished fraud in the UI benefits program run by the states. Investigations by the Inspector General at the Labor Department as reported in the Washington Post indicate that between $100 billion and $150 billion of erroneous payments were disbursed through the UI program, with many of the criminals being in Africa, Russia, and South America. The ARPA may have had a stimulus effect--but it wasn't in the United States. Other reports have found additional tens of billions of fraud, waste, and error in other programs such as food stamps, Medicaid, and rental assistance--again with no oversight or investigation.</p><p>The error rates for UI benefits under ARPA reached nearly 20%. In private programs, such as credit cards, insurance, and financial services, fraud rates are closer to 2% to 3%.</p><p>Congress has been a poor steward of the taxpayers' money when it comes to the ARPA benefits. There needs to be additional investigative work on one of the greatest criminal frauds in history and, in the future, any large disbursements of funds should come with a fraud unit to expose and prosecute fraud.</p><p>5) ARPA rewarded states for bad behavior and punished states for good behavior. This was a BLUE STATE BAILOUT BILL. The major purpose of the ARPA program was to provide more than $300 billion dollars to states and localities to help them pay their bills during COVID. But the red states--including Florida, Texas, Tennessee, South Carolina, Iowa, Idaho, Utah, and Nebraska--were NEVER in need of funds. Many of the governors in these states told</p><p>Congress they did not need the funding because they had already balanced their budgets and kept their workforces employed. The states that potentially needed federal aid because of their bad policy decisions were blue states: New Jersey, New York, California, Connecticut, Michigan, and Illinois. These were the states that foolishly slashed the wrists of their economies by locking down businesses, stores, restaurants, and hospitals. However, in hindsight, the finances of even those states were never as bleak as their governors claimed publicly.</p><p>Red-state governors recognized very early in the COVID-19 experience that lockdowns merely hurt local economies with almost no health benefits. As we have shown, they had much lower unemployment throughout the pandemic. Blue state governors were quick to shut down and kept their economies closed for many months and sometimes close to a year after the red states reopened.</p><p>But in Washington, no good deed ever goes unpunished. ARPA took money from red states and gave it to blue states because states with high unemployment rates got a higher share of the revenues. (The only way that the federal government can give money to California and New York is to take the money from residents of the other states. There is no free money in Washington, only redistribution of money.)</p><p>This wasn't just unfair to the red states that handled COVID-19 far more professionally than the blue states. It was an incentive program for blue states to keep their economies shut down. Even today, as shown in figure 5, red states have almost all gained the jobs back they lost from COVID-19, but with a few exceptions, it is still blue states without a full jobs recovery. It also enabled blue states to keep their economies closed for even longer periods of time and increased the economic misery of residents of these states.</p><p>In conclusion, I find it a bit strange that the title of this hearing is \"How the American Rescue Plan Saved the Economy and Saved Lives.\" Whether these interventions saved lives is for health professionals to debate.</p><p>But the Rescue Plan surely did not \"rescue\" the American economy; it set the table for the economic crisis the nation faces today with only two of 10 Americans rating the economy as good or great, and a complete collapse in consumer and small business confidence.</p><p>Inflation has, like a cancerous tumor, metastasized in our economy and is eating away at the paychecks and the savings of American families. The inflation rate was 1.5% the month before the Rescue Plan was passed and now rests at 8.6%. If this is an economic success story, I shudder to think what a failure would look like. The supporters of the Rescue Plan--including more than eight Nobel economists--were simply dead wrong when they predicted there would be no inflationary effect. They should, as Janet Yellen has done, apologize for their erroneous forecasts.</p><p>We have a strong labor market for sure. But paychecks are shrinking as are savings--as prices sprint ahead of wages.</p><p>Finally, had it not been for the correct strategic decision of red-state governors like Ron DeSantis of Florida, Bill Lee of Tennessee, Greg Abbott of Texas, and Kim Reynolds of Iowa--among others--to keep their economies up and running throughout Covid, the U.S. economy would have capsized. These red states carried the U.S. economy on their shoulders as blue states went into an economic fetal position.</p><p>What are the five takeaways?</p><p>First, there is no free lunch with massive government \"stimulus programs.\" ARPA's major stimulus effect was in stimulating more demand and more inflation that could take years to extinguish.</p><p>Second, paying people not to work is always and everywhere a misguided economic strategy.</p><p>Third, Operation Warp Speed was the program that saved lives and the economy. This was mostly a strategy that involved short-circuiting regulations and federal roadblocks that inhibit and delay innovation and life-saving medications and vaccines.</p><p>Fourth, federalism works, and although the Trump Administration made mistakes during the pandemic, Trump's masterstroke was in letting the 50 states take the lead in combating the health and economic effects of the virus. States became laboratories of democracy and we quickly learned from the governors and state officials what policies worked and which did not. Lockdowns were an expensive mistake from a health, economic, education and civil liberties perspective--and we must never let that happen again.</p><p>Fifth, once again we have learned that government spending is not a \"stimulus\" to the economy, but rather a stimulus to debt, inflation, and aggregate income losses. The best stimulus to the economy going forward would be a plan for dramatic reductions in government spending and debt. I would advise starting with an across-the-board reduction in the budget of nearly every agency by 10 to 15%.</p><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to testify before this panel today.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://budget.house.gov/sites/democrats.budget.house.gov/files/documents/Mr.%20Moore_Testimony%20before%20the%20House%20Budget%20Committee%20%28002%29.pdf\">https://budget.house.gov/sites/democrats.budget.house.gov/files/documents/Mr.%20Moore_Testimony%20before%20the%20House%20Budget%20Committee%20%28002%29.pdf</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CODUPB-COSHC614209D9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65PC-JBD1-DYVR-P2WG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2581\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"06\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>June 14, 2022</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Meade Army Base issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">During public health emergencies, the military medical community has a secret weapon to lead the charge against a disease outbreak - the Public Health Emergency Officer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">More than twenty Public Health Emergency Officers, or PHEOs, across Europe have been activated as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and serve as the link between the medical community and Army garrisons.</p><p>PHEOs provide medical expertise and guidance to garrison leadership, who implement these recommendations tailored to each location's needs in order to help sustain mission-critical operations and essential services, according to Lt. Col. Renee Howell, the Army Public Health Nursing Regional Consultant for Public Health Command Europe.</p><p>\"The role of a Public Health Emergency Officer has now become more prominent than ever,\" Howell said. \"The PHEO responsibility is assigned to medical professionals within the hospital or clinic as an additional duty. They are required to train frequently for worst-case scenarios through exercises that ensure their knowledge, skills, and expertise is readily available when needed.\"</p><p>Public Health Command Europe's Preventive Medicine Services Division provides oversight of the PHEO program, and ensures each PHEO is equipped with the skills and knowledge needed to help lead the fight against public health emergencies.</p><p>\"Public Health Command Europe synchronizes guidance from U.S. Army Europe and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\" said Howell. \"And we are also the subject matter experts for any questions coming from our PHEOs, so we can ensure leadership has the ability to translate their recommendations into a tangible reality.\"</p><p>Due to the rapidly evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, PHEOs have had to put their skills and training to the test.</p><p>Dr. Robert Weien, who has been a PHEO since 2017, is normally the Chief of Landstuhl Regional Medical Center's Occupational Medicine Department.</p><p>In his current role as the PHEO at U.S. Army Garrison Rheinland-Pfalz, he communicates with PHCE, the U.S. Air Force PHEO and Public Health personnel at Ramstein Air Base, as well as the German Public Health authorities (Gesundheitsamt) in the local state of Rheinland-Pfalz to ensure that the approach to the COVID-19 crisis remains coordinated.</p><p>Army units are well prepared to respond in civil emergencies, according to Weien.</p><p>There are robust mechanisms in place to assess capabilities and put together rapid and effective means to provide assistance to those in need, whether it is to a forest fire, hurricane, or other major incident.</p><p>Weien says that while a pandemic response is similar, there are unique differences. The tools and training needed to fight the disease, such as contact tracing and widespread surveillance testing, are not as familiar to the typical military operations planner.</p><p>\"The PHEO role is designed to fill that niche, and provide that expertise when and where it is needed,\" explained Weien. \"I am the subject matter expert on the garrison commander's staff regarding medical issues, and public health issues in particular. Much of the job involves educating staff and leaders about various aspects of public health and preventive medicine.\"</p><p>Having a PHEO on the leadership team is a valuable asset for the Garrison commander.</p><p>\"Our Public Health Team has been absolutely superb,\" said Col.

The tools and training needed to fight the disease, such as contact tracing and widespread surveillance testing, are not as familiar to the typical military operations planner.</p><p>\"The PHEO role is designed to fill that niche, and provide that expertise when and where it is needed,\" explained Weien. \"I am the subject matter expert on the garrison commander's staff regarding medical issues, and public health issues in particular. Much of the job involves educating staff and leaders about various aspects of public health and preventive medicine.\"</p><p>Having a PHEO on the leadership team is a valuable asset for the Garrison commander.\"Our Public Health Team has been absolutely superb,\" said Col. Jason Edwards, U.S. Army Garrison Rheinland-Pfalz Commander.</p><p>\"Having a dedicated PHEO working directly with our staff and integrated into our Emergency Operations Center has been invaluable to our response action. The joint integration of the host nation and U.S. Air Force has been seamless.\"For the latest information about COVID-19 follow \"Public Health Command Europe\" on Facebook.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7109747 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7109747</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YWF-BRH1-JC11-10JS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"638\"/><timeReceived>8:20 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 12, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The Stingray Nebula is a planetary nebula an expanse of material sloughed off from a star as it enters a new phase of old age and then heated by that same star into colorful displays that can last for up to a million years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The tiny Stingray Nebula unexpectedly appeared in the 1980s and was first imaged by scientists in the 1990s using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. It is by far the youngest planetary nebula in our sky. A team of astronomers recently analyzed a more recent image of the nebula, taken in 2016 by Hubble, and found something unexpected: As they report in a paper accepted to the Astrophysical Journal, the Stingray Nebula has faded significantly and changed shape over the course of just 20 years.</p><p>If dimming continues at current rates, in 20 or 30 years the Stingray Nebula will be barely perceptible, and was likely already fading when Hubble obtained the first clear images of it in 1996, according to lead author Bruce Balick, an emeritus professor of astronomy at UW.</p><p>\"This is an unprecedented departure from typical behavior for a planetary nebula,\" said Balick. \"Over time, we would expect it to imperceptibly brighten and expand, which could easily go unnoticed in a century or more. But here we're seeing the Stingray nebula fade significantly in an incredibly compressed time frame of just 20 years. Moreover, its brightest inner structure has contracted not expanded as the nebula fades.\"</p><p>Planetary nebulae form after most stars, including stars like our own sun, swell into red giants as they exhaust hydrogen fuel. At the end of the red giant phase, the star then expels large amounts of its outer material as it gradually over the course of a million years transforms into a small, compact white dwarf. The sloughed-off material expands outward for several thousand years while the star heats the material, which eventually becomes ionized and glows.</p><p>Balick and his co-authors, Martn Guerrero at the Institute of Astrophysics of Andalusia in Spain and Gerardo Ramos-Larios at the University of Guadalajara in Mexico, compared Hubble images of the Stingray Nebula taken in 1996 and 2016. Hen 3-1357 changed shape markedly over 20 years, losing the sharp, sloping edges that gave the Stingray Nebula its name. Its colors have faded overall and once-prominent blue expanses of gas near its center are largely gone.</p><p>\"In a planetary nebula, the star is really the center of all the activity,\" said Balick. \"The material around it is directly responsive to the energy from its parent star.\"</p><p>The team analyzed light spectra from Hen 3-1357 emitted by chemical elements in the nebula. Emission levels of hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen all dropped between 1996 and 2016, particularly oxygen, which dropped by a factor of 900. The resulting fade in color and the nebula's change in shape are likely connected to the cooling of its parent star from a peak of about 107,500 degrees Fahrenheit in 2002 to just under 90,000 degrees Fahrenheit in 2015 which means it is giving off less ultraviolet ionizing radiation that heats the expelled gas and makes it glow.</p><p>\"Like a doused forest fire, the smoke wanes more slowly than the flames that created it,\" said Balick. \"Even so, we were amazed when the Hubble images revealed how quickly the nebula was fading. It took a month of work to believe it.\"</p><p>Astronomers have yet to understand why SAO 244567 made the Stingray Nebula light up and then fade almost as quickly. One theory, posited by a team led by Nicole Reindl at the University of Potsdam, is that the star underwent a brief burst of fresh helium fusion around its core, which stirred up its outer layers and caused its surface to both shrink and heat.</p><p>If so, then as its outer layers settle back down, the star may return to a more typical transition from red giant to white dwarf. Only future observations of the star and its nebula can confirm this.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, the best tool to follow future changes in the Stingray Nebula, the Hubble Space Telescope, is near the end of its life as well,\" said Balick. \"We can hope, but the odds aren't good for Hubble's survival as its three remaining gyroscopes start to fail. It's a good race to the finish.\"</p><p>The Hubble Space Telescope is an international partnership between NASA and the European Space Agency, or ESA, and managed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. The Space Telescope Science Institute is responsible for Hubble science operations. The research was also funded by the European Union and the National Council of Science and Technology in Mexico.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124116006</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61FD-BJV1-DYTH-G0DJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"792\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"12\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>December 3, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0008YVR</classCode><className>ASTRONOMY &amp; SPACE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009FXR</classCode><className>ASTROPHYSICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DN68</classCode><className>SPACE PROGRAMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0008Z00</classCode><className>CHEMISTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0008X7S</classCode><className>OBSERVATORIES &amp; TELESCOPES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST0008YZS</classCode><className>PHYSICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>ST00092SE</classCode><className>HYDROGEN ENERGY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DN68</classCode><className>SPACE PROGRAMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>ST00092SE</classCode><className>HYDROGEN ENERGY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX518</classCode><className>SEATTLE, WA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS163</classCode><className>WASHINGTON, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>ST000A2MA</classCode><className>ANDALUSIA, SPAIN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC342</classCode><className>MEXICO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>GC325</classCode><className>SPAIN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

In some, it's below 30%. Even Philadelphia slightly lags its neighboring counties, with more than half of all city residents still without a shot, adding urgency to ongoing efforts combating hesitancy and to the development of vaccine incentives.</p><p>The slower pace of vaccination in rural counties likely won't threaten the state's prospects for mass immunity, experts said, but could lead to small COVID-19 outbreaks that would be otherwise preventable.</p><p>Despite the muted interest in north, central, and northwestern parts of the state, experts say overall signs are good as the state approaches a full reopening on Monday.</p><p>\"I'm actually optimistic that we will get to a good point in Pennsylvania, likely enough to prevent exponential spread from happening again,\" said Jeffrey Morris, a University of Pennsylvania biostatistician who has tracked data throughout the pandemic. \"I'm very, very encouraged with where we're going.\"</p><p>Scientists and doctors have identified 70% as an approximate threshold for reaching mass immunity, or having enough people protected from the virus that it's unable to spread widely or cause major outbreaks. The exact percentage needed is unknown, but experts said case rates are already dropping, thanks to vaccinations, and should improve by the end of June.</p><p>The number of people fully vaccinated statewide is expected to soar in the coming weeks as people get the second shot in their two-dose regimen. In Chester County, for instance, 37% of all residents are fully vaccinated and health officials anticipate that 66% will be by July 1, including 84% of the county's adults.</p><p>But other counties look unlikely to come close to 70%. Some pockets of the commonwealth lag far behind in vaccinations as demand remains low in rural areas. Bedford County, for instance, had the third-highest average rate of new cases this week - 19 per 100,000 people - and only 28% of its residents partially or fully vaccinated.</p><p>\"I would say very few of us were prepared for these numbers,\" said Michael Scalzone, chief quality officer of Guthrie Clinic in Bradford County, where 29% of residents have gotten at least one shot.</p><p>To the east, a spokesperson at the Lehigh Valley Health Network said a 70% vaccination rate \"looks like it will be difficult to achieve\" in the seven centraleastern counties it covers. And Fulton County, which has the lowest vaccination rate in the state, fell behind due to a low vaccine supply and lack of providers, a Fulton County Medical Center spokesperson said.</p><p>That may not affect the statewide or nationwide goals of suppressing the spread of the virus - \"You're not going to see too much huge outbreak and spread from the very rural areas,\" said David Damsker, the Bucks County health director - but it will likely still have consequences.</p><p>\"The idea is that you're not going to have a forest fire burning out of control. You may have some local brush fires,\" said Morris, the Penn researcher. He noted that widespread vaccination provides some protection to people in unvaccinated areas by decreasing the chances of spread and exposure.</p><p>But for individuals, the virus remains dangerous. Abby Rudolph, infectious disease and social epidemiologist and associate professor at Temple University, noted that outbreaks may not become \"catastrophic,\" but may still occur particularly among social groups that are largely unvaccinated, since people tend to associate with people who share their views.</p><p>Most Pennsylvanians who have recently gotten seriously ill or died of the coronavirus were not vaccinated, acting Health Secretary Alison Beam said Thursday, and of the five counties seeing substantial community spread this week, three were among the bottom 10 for the percentage of people with at least one vaccine dose.</p><p>That's even as case numbers drop historically across the state - Pennsylvania reported fewer than 1,000 new cases Thursday for the first time since Oct. 5.</p><p>\"Whenever you see someone who's on a ventilator and they weren't vaccinated, you think, hey. ... Just by getting those people vaccinated, they wouldn't be on a ventilator today, most likely,\" Damsker said, adding that most of the current coronavirus patients in Bucks County's hospitals had not been vaccinated.</p><p>Experts say the last several months have made it clear that the vaccine is effective and has helped drive down case counts in Pennsylvania, the U.S., and other countries, as well as in isolated communities such as nursing homes.</p><p>New Jersey, which has nearly 73% percent of adults with at least one shot and 48% of all residents fully vaccinated, according to CDC data, is among the 10 states that have reached Biden's goal. All are in the Northeast except New Mexico and Hawaii.</p><p>While Pennsylvania tied lifting its mask mandate to the percentage of vaccinated adults, the total number of vaccinated people is also a key metric. Of the state's entire population, 57% have been partially or fully vaccinated. That number is 49% in Delaware County, 60% in Montgomery County, and 51% in Bucks County, according to state data as of Tuesday.

In some, it's below 30%. Even Philadelphia slightly lags its neighboring counties, with more than half of all city residents still without a shot, adding urgency to ongoing efforts combating hesitancy and to the development of vaccine incentives.</p><p>The slower pace of vaccination in rural counties likely won't threaten the state's prospects for mass immunity, experts said, but could lead to small COVID-19 outbreaks that would be otherwise preventable.</p><p>Despite the muted interest in north, central, and northwestern parts of the state, experts say overall signs are good as the state approaches a full reopening on Monday.</p><p>\"I'm actually optimistic that we will get to a good point in Pennsylvania, likely enough to prevent exponential spread from happening again,\" said Jeffrey Morris, a University of Pennsylvania biostatistician who has tracked data throughout the pandemic. \"I'm very, very encouraged with where we're going.\"</p><p>Scientists and doctors have identified 70% as an approximate threshold for reaching mass immunity, or having enough people protected from the virus that it's unable to spread widely or cause major outbreaks. The exact percentage needed is unknown, but experts said case rates are already dropping, thanks to vaccinations, and should improve by the end of June.</p><p>The number of people fully vaccinated statewide is expected to soar in the coming weeks as people get the second shot in their two-dose regimen. In Chester County, for instance, 37% of all residents are fully vaccinated and health officials anticipate that 66% will be by July 1, including 84% of the county's adults.</p><p>But other counties look unlikely to come close to 70%. Some pockets of the commonwealth lag far behind in vaccinations as demand remains low in rural areas. Bedford County, for instance, had the third-highest average rate of new cases this week - 19 per 100,000 people - and only 28% of its residents partially or fully vaccinated.</p><p>\"I would say very few of us were prepared for these numbers,\" said Michael Scalzone, chief quality officer of Guthrie Clinic in Bradford County, where 29% of residents have gotten at least one shot.</p><p>To the east, a spokesperson at the Lehigh Valley Health Network said a70% vaccination rate \"looks like it will be difficult to achieve\" in the seven central-eastern counties it covers. And Fulton County, which has the lowest vaccination rate in the state, fell behind due to a low vaccine supply and lack of providers, a Fulton County Medical Center spokesperson said.</p><p>That may not affect the statewide or nationwide goals of suppressing the spread of the virus - \"You're not going to see too much huge outbreak and spread from the very rural areas,\" said David Damsker, the Bucks County health director - but it will likely still have consequences.</p><p>\"The idea is that you're not going to have a forest fire burning out of control. You may have some local brush fires,\" said Morris, the Penn researcher. He noted that widespread vaccination provides some protection to people in unvaccinated areas by decreasing the chances of spread and exposure.</p><p>But for individuals, the virus remains dangerous. Abby Rudolph, infectious disease and social epidemiologist and associate professor at Temple University, noted that outbreaks may not become \"catastrophic,\" but may still occur particularly among social groups that are largely unvaccinated, since people tend to associate with people who share their views.</p><p>Most Pennsylvanians who have recently gotten seriously ill or died of the coronavirus were not vaccinated, acting Health Secretary Alison Beam said Thursday, and of the five counties seeing substantial community spread this week, three were among the bottom 10 for the percentage of people with at least one vaccine dose.</p><p>That's even as case numbers drop historically across the state - Pennsylvania reported fewer than 1,000 new cases Thursday for the first time since Oct. 5.</p><p>\"Whenever you see someone who's on a ventilator and they weren't vaccinated, you think, hey. ... Just by getting those people vaccinated, they wouldn't be on a ventilator today, most likely,\" Damsker said, adding that most of the current coronavirus patients in Bucks County's hospitals had not been vaccinated.</p><p>Experts say the last several months have made it clear that the vaccine is effective and has helped drive down case counts in Pennsylvania, the U.S., and other countries, as well as in isolated communities such as nursing homes.</p><p>New Jersey, which has nearly 73% percent of adults with at least one shot and 48% of all residents fully vaccinated, according to CDC data, is among the 10 states that have reached Biden's goal. All are in the Northeast except New Mexico and Hawaii.</p><p>While Pennsylvania tied lifting its mask mandate to the percentage of vaccinated adults, the total number of vaccinated people is also a key metric. Of the state's entire population, 57% have been partially or fully vaccinated. That number is 49% in Delaware County, 60% in Montgomery County, and 51% in Bucks County, according to state data as of Tuesday. In Philadelphia, 45% of all residents have received at least one dose, according to city statistics.</p><p>\"Once we get from 50% to 60% fully vaccinated in the adult population [in Pennsylvania], Ithink we're going to see a further improvement in the cases,\" Morris said. \"That's a big number I'm really hoping we reach, and if we can get to 70%, then Ifeel really good at that point.\"</p><p>- Data journalist Chris A.

It signals a fire and the average person probably thinks that a bad thing but that's not necessarily so.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF) uses prescribed burns on many of its properties in order to enhance the health and quality of the woodlands habitat.</p><p>That was the case in February when LDWF staff did a prescribed burn on a 22-acre tract at Sandy Hollow Wildlife Management Area (WMA) in Tangipahoa Parish. The WMA is managed as an upland longleaf forest, with a special emphasis on bobwhite quail, a bird that forages and nests primarily on the ground.</p><p>By using prescribed burns among the longleaf pine stands in the WMA, LDWF is able to promote the growth of desired herbaceous and grassy cover, providing food and shelter for the quail as well as controlling the less desirable woody shrubs and hardwood trees that can quickly dominate these forested areas.</p><p>\"I know growing up I used to think fire was bad for the forest,'' said LDWF biologist manager Jillian Day, who oversees Sandy Hollow WMA. \"Now, as a professional, I've become more knowledgeable about how fire can be beneficial. For us, fire is one of the best and most cost efficient tools we have when it comes to habitat management. From my perspective, controlled fire is a good thing.''</p><p>Longleaf pine forests are fire dependent systems, and if left unchecked, can eventually develop into a mixed pine-hardwood forest. Fire is a process that sets back forest succession to promote a more diverse herbaceous ground cover. It does so by impeding the growth of invading hardwood trees that are not adapted to fire and encouraging growth and development of the woody and herbaceous vegetation that are fire-adapted, such as pines, grasses and many native wildflowers.</p><p>Prescribed burning is one of the best tools for improving wildlife habitat conditions for many species in grasslands and longleaf pine-dominated forests. Shrubs and herbaceous plants experience a flush of new growth following a fire. This new growth is more nutritious and palatable to grazing and browsing wildlife than the rough vegetation that occurred before the burn. This also allows land managers to keep areas in early successional habitat, which is beneficial for most wildlife, especially the bobwhite quail.</p><p>Many of the beneficial insects consumed by birds are more abundant following a fire. Properly applied fire promotes flowers, seeds and fruit production, increasing available food resources for wildlife.</p><p>\"Sandy Hollow is rather unique in this region,'' Day said. \"We manage specifically for bobwhite quail. Prescribed fire in that ecosystem is going to promote the habitat that this species requires. Sandy Hollow WMA was acquired by the LDWF to serve as a focal area for quail management, so habitat management that we do on this WMA is going to benefit that species. But, it also benefits other species like the gopher tortoise, which is currently listed as a threatened species by the US Fish and Wildlife Service.''</p><p>There is more that goes into a prescribed burn than just showing up one day and lighting a fire. LDWF personnel conducting prescribed burns have extensive certification and years of experience. Each burn must be planned out in advance and all conditions must be ideal for it to take place.</p><p>\"The winds play a major factor in whether a fire will move across the landscape in the prescribed manner and is extremely important for smoke management,'' Day said. \"With as many roads and surrounding infrastructure around the WMA, we have to be conscious of where the smoke goes, so smoke management is a big part of prescribed burning. We don't want to put smoke on schools, people's houses or on people with sensitive health issues. We are very cautious about burn days and which way the wind is carrying the smoke.\"</p><p>\"The next step is to ensure that the wind is going to allow a burn in the right direction as far as properties next to the WMA are concerned. We don't want to have the fire jump (a road or fire line), so our wind direction needs to be in the prescribed direction.''</p><p>The prescribed burns at Sandy Hollow are generally small. The units are usually 75 acres or smaller. The smaller units, along with the strategy employed, allows the burn to work slowly. That helps in getting rid of unwanted hardwoods and other undesirable plants.</p><p>\"The name 'prescribed burn' actually lends itself to what we're trying to accomplish,'' Day said. \"It's not an out-of-control burn. Our goal for most of our burn units is to do a slow backing fire. You want to get ahead of the wind and let that fire back slowly through the unit.\"</p><p>\"You accomplish better habitat management when it comes to controlling those woody species. Those species are not as well evolved to endure fire. That slow backing burn is going to give us a better desired outcome.''</p><p>For more information on Sandy Hollow WMA, go to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/page/sandy-hollow\">https://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/page/sandy-hollow</url>.</p><p>For photos, interviews and video from the prescribed burn, go to <url normalizedValue=\"https://ldwf.canto.com/v/SandyHollowRxBurn/allfiles?viewIndex=0\">https://ldwf.canto.com/v/SandyHollowRxBurn/allfiles?viewIndex=0</url>.

With a collective $70 billion in FRF remaining,[1] states can use these funds to build healthier, more equitable, climate-resilient communities. Sixteen states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico have allocated a combined $2.1 billion of their FRF toward environmental initiatives,[2] including cleanups of industrial pollution and preservation of natural habitats.</p><p>Climate change and other environmental challenges pose a serious risk to people's health and well-being, especially those with low incomes and communities of color. Some state and local governments are confronting these challenges head-on, using Fiscal Recovery Funds to invest in efforts to reduce carbon emissions and improve energy efficiency, stem pollution, clean up environmental hazards, and mitigate or reduce harm to habitats from a variety of sources. States are actively monitoring environmental needs and changes to preemptively mitigate the consequences of climate change, which can result in costly remediation and long-term health effects.[3] States also can protect and restore the natural environment by mitigating and reversing harm to habitats through solar or wind energy projects.</p><p>Additional environmental spending should be targeted to those who routinely experience disproportionate harm from environmental challenges and other crises, such as recessions and public health emergencies. Individuals and households with low incomes and Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) -- who have been hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic -- also have been the most impacted by climate change and industrial pollution.[4] Thus, targeting FRF to environmental investments can be part of an equitable, antiracist pandemic recovery.</p><p>State Investments Can Advance Environmental Justice</p><p>Environmental justice policies and practices aim to reduce or eliminate environmental harm under the guidance of communities that experience climate change's consequences firsthand. Communities with low incomes and Black and brown communities disproportionately face many of these impacts, such as community displacement, geographic deterioration, and agricultural disruption.[5] For example, individuals with low incomes are likelier to live in homes that are more vulnerable to natural disasters and experience property damage, homelessness, and physical and financial impacts.[6] States, localities, and families are often left to cover these aftermath expenses.[7]</p><p>Targeting environmental investments to people with low incomes and communities of color is critical to redressing past injustices and advancing racial equity. Harmful environmental policies and regulations are often rooted in systemic racism and other forms of oppression.[8] For example, policymakers and private industrial interests in Louisiana have since the mid-1800s concentrated petrochemical plants along the Mississippi River in predominantly Black communities, which increases the rate of cancer and respiratory illnesses, and high pollution levels prevent residents from selling their homes.[9] State investments in policies to improve environmental conditions can help build more equitable communities, advancing environmental justice nationwide.</p><p>Fiscal Recovery Funds Support Range of Environmental Initiatives</p><p>The Fiscal Recovery Funds present a historic opportunity for states and localities to fund transformative, long-term investments in the environment, with a focus on communities that have been most severely impacted by pollution, climate change, and natural disasters. The following are examples of climate-related investments states and localities are making.</p><p>Energy Efficiency</p><p>Energy efficiency investments are a cost-effective approach to fighting climate change and to helping households with low incomes afford energy bills. Households with low incomes typically pay about 13.9 percent of their income in energy costs, compared to 3 percent for other households, a 2020 study found.[10] Weatherization, electrification, and solar initiatives can reduce energy costs and pollution's harmful effects. For instance, electrification replaces fossil fuels such as propane, heating oil, and gasoline to provide cleaner air while helping homes to reduce their overall emissions and energy bills.</p><p>* D.C. invested $8.2 million in grant funding for senior care facilities, hospitals, K-12 schools, universities, and hospitals to conduct energy audits, and $11 million toward the D.C. Green Bank's[11] clean energy projects -- such as stormwater infrastructure, low-cost solar energy, and LED lighting for efficient energy use -- to help D.C. reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption.[12] The District also allocated $17 million for community solar projects, which allow people who live in apartments or have roofs that cannot support solar to invest in off-site solar panels and receive a credit on their monthly electricity bill for the energy they generate.</p><p>* Maine appropriated $50 million in funding to award grants to accelerate weatherization and home efficiency upgrades, particularly for residents with low incomes. Schools, municipalities, and community organizations can also secure these grants by providing matching funds to support energy efficiency measures.</p><p>* Maryland used $30 million for its Strategic Energy Investment Fund, which provides funding for energy efficiency, renewable energy, and alternative transportation projects. In 2019, the program[13] funded residential and commercial projects such as solar canopies (elevated structures that host solar panels and provide shade) and geothermal heating and cooling systems, using an underground system to convert and transfer heat between buildings and the ground.</p><p>* Massachusetts appropriated $3.3 million to pilot a geothermal technology program.[14] It also allocated over $16 million for the Greening Cities Program[15] to reduce households' heating and cooling energy use by increasing tree canopies.</p><p>Industrial Pollution and Fossil Fuels</p><p>Industrial operations degrade the environment -- including polluting the air, drinking water, and soil -- and emissions from burning fossil fuels are a persistent concern. A few states are addressing the harmful consequences of industrial waste and fossil fuels in their communities.</p><p>* Florida appropriated $50 million to clean up petroleum tanks.[16] At the beginning of 2018, there were an estimated 19,000 underground petroleum storage tanks that served no use and were potentially leaking into the state's drinking water.[17]</p><p>* New Mexico used $3.5 million to implement a program to identify oil and natural gas wells that energy extraction companies have abandoned and failed to plug. The state has 708 such wells, with an estimated $24 million cleanup cost, which, left unaddressed, would lead to contaminated water and methane air pollution.[18]</p><p>* Vermont invested $11 million in the Brownfields Program[19] to identify former industrial properties, manufacturing facilities, vacant land, office spaces, and gas stations that may be contaminated or have harmful pollutants. Brownfields' redevelopment reduces health and safety hazards while creating opportunities for quality housing, recreation space, and economic development.[20]</p><p>Preservation of Local Habitats</p><p>To develop resilient, healthy communities and help maintain local ecosystems and protect threatened native habits, some states and territories are increasing FRF spending to actively monitor environmental changes and create effective mitigation plans.</p><p>* Florida allocated $100 million to strengthen coastal mapping efforts in collaboration with coastal communities to develop resiliency against flooding, erosion, and habitat changes. Coastal mapping includes gathering seafloor data for mapping habitats, restoration projects, resource management, emergency response, and hazard studies.</p><p>* Hawaii appropriated $2.5 million to the agency charged with enforcing protections for historic sites, state parks, forest reserves, wildlife, marine life, and other natural resources.[21]</p><p>* Puerto Rico invested $10 million in environmental conservation initiatives, including protecting endangered species and ecosystems.</p><p>Research Studies to Assess Environmental Needs</p><p>A few states are using modest amounts of FRF to explore research for environmental needs. This can allow communities to assess environmental needs prior to undertaking larger environmental programs and policies. For example, some states are exploring and investing in offshore wind projects,[22] which have the potential to deliver large amounts of clean, renewable energy but also require strategic planning prior to developing the infrastructure.[23]</p><p>* Connecticut used $20,000 to study air quality in the town of Sherman, citing the impact of social, environmental, and economic conditions on health outcomes.</p><p>* New Hampshire appropriated $250,000 for a study to assess the potential impacts of developing[24] offshore wind projects in the Gulf of Maine.</p><p>* Texas allocated $300,000 to analyze the Coastal Texas Study[25] and assess the feasibility of constructing a coastal storm risk management and ecosystem restoration.</p><p>* * *</p><p>End Notes</p><p>[1] This report reflects data collected by CBPP on state uses of Fiscal Recovery Funds. It relies in part on extensive Fiscal Recovery Fund tracking conducted by the National Conference of State Legislatures.</p><p>[2] This total includes FRF weatherization investments, which CBPP also categorized under housing repairs, but excludes $9.8 billion in water and sewer infrastructure spending for all states, D.C., and the U.S. Territories.</p><p>[3] Hurricanes Ida and Sandy represent two examples of the danger and fiscal costs that severe storms, which are expected to become more common due to climate change, pose to communities. Hurricane Sandy caused an estimated $70 billion in damage.

The situation is so severe that the Colorado River basin is on the verge of its <url normalizedValue=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/correction-colorado-river-water-shortage-story-77170840\">first official water shortage declaration</url>, and forecasts suggest <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/another-dangerous-fire-season-is-looming-in-the-western-u-s-and-the-drought-stricken-region-is-headed-for-a-water-crisis-160848\">another hot, dry summer</url> is on the way.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Warm and dry conditions like these are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/118/22/e2009717118\">new study</url> published May 24, 2021, in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</emphasis>, our team of <url normalizedValue=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S1J4kAoAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">fire and</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tGGNDyUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">climate scientists</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=ZaW8ZbsAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">and engineers</url> found that forest fires are now reaching higher, normally wetter elevations. And they are burning there at rates unprecedented in recent fire history.</p><p>While some people focus on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2020/08/20/trump-blames-california-for-wildfires-tells-state-you-gotta-clean-your-floors-1311059\">historical fire suppression</url> and other forest management practices as reasons for the West's worsening fire problem, these high-elevation forests have had little human intervention. The results provide a clear indication that climate change is enabling these normally wet forests to burn.</p><p>As wildfires creep higher up mountains, another tenth of the West's forest area is now at risk, according to our study. That creates new hazards for mountain communities, with impacts on downstream water supplies and the plants and wildlife that call these forests home.</p><p>Forest fires advanced to higher elevations as the climate dried from 1984 to 2017.

To put that elevation into perspective, Denver-the mile-high city-sits at 5,280 feet, and Aspen, Colorado, is at 8,000 feet. These high-elevation areas are largely remote mountains and forests with some small communities and ski areas.</p><p>The area burning above 8,200 feet more than tripled in 2001 to 2017 compared with 1984 to 2000.</p><p>Our results show that climate warming has diminished the high-elevation flammability barrier-the point where forests historically were too wet to burn regularly because the snow normally lingered well into summer and started falling again early in the fall. Fires advanced about 826 feet (252 meters) uphill in the Western mountains over those three decades.</p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/6964/\">Cameron Peak Fire in Colorado</url> in 2020 was the state's largest fire in its history, burning over 208,000 acres (84,200 hectares) and is a prime example of a high-elevation forest fire. The fire burned in forests extending to 12,000 feet (3,650 meters) and reached the upper tree line of the Rocky Mountains.</p><p>We found that rising temperatures in the past 34 years have helped to extend the fire territory in the West to an additional 31,470 square miles (81,500 square kilometers) of high-elevation forests. That means a staggering 11% of all Western U.S. forests-an area similar in size to South Carolina-are susceptible to fire now that weren't three decades ago.</p><h>Can't blame fire suppression here</h><p>In lower-elevation forests, several factors contribute to fire activity, including the presence of more people in wildland areas and a history of fire suppression.</p><p>In the early 1900s, Congress commissioned the U.S. Forest Service to <url normalizedValue=\"https://foresthistory.org/research-explore/us-forest-service-history/policy-and-law/fire-u-s-forest-service/u-s-forest-service-fire-suppression/\">manage forest fires</url>, which resulted in a focus on suppressing fires-a policy that continued through the 1970s. This caused flammable underbrush that would normally be cleared out by occasional natural blazes to accumulate. The increase in biomass in many lower elevation forests across the West has been associated with increases in <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1890/ES13-00217.1\">high-severity fires and megafires</url>. At the same time, <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1607171113\">climate warming has dried out forests in the Western U.S.</url>, making them more prone to large fires.</p><p>On average, fires have spread 826 feet (252 meters) higher into the mountains in recent decades, exposing an additional 31,400 square miles (81,500 square kilometers) of forests to fire. [Image: Mojtaba Sadegh/courtesy of the authors]</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>By focusing on high-elevation fires, in areas with little history of fire suppression, we can more clearly see the influence of climate change.</p><p>Most high-elevation forests haven't been subjected to much fire suppression, logging, or other human activities, and because trees at these high elevations are in wetter forests, they historically have long <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/fire_regime_table/PNVG_fire_regime_table.html\">return intervals between fires</url>, typically a century or more. Yet they experienced the highest rate of increase in fire activity in the past 34 years. We found that the increase is strongly correlated with the observed warming.</p><h>High mountain fires create new problems</h><p>High-elevation fires have implications for natural and human systems.</p><p>High mountains are natural water towers that normally provide a sustained source of water to millions of people in dry summer months in the Western U.S. The scars that wildfires leave behind-known as burn scars-affect how much snow can accumulate at high elevations. This can influence the timing, <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/es500130g\">quality, and</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs/rmrs_gtr042_4.pdf\">quantity of water</url> that reaches reservoirs and rivers downstream.</p><p>High-elevation fires also remove standing trees that act as anchor points that normally stabilize the snowpack, <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2009.01.050\">raising the risk of avalanches</url>.</p><p>The loss of tree canopy also exposes mountain streams to the sun, <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1890/09-0822.1\">increasing water temperatures</url> in the cold headwater streams. Increasing stream temperatures can harm fish and the larger wildlife and predators that rely on them.</p><p>Climate change is increasing fire risk in many regions across the globe, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1003669107\">studies show that this trend will continue</url> as the planet warms. The increase in fires in the high mountains is another warning to the U.S. West and elsewhere of the risks ahead as the climate changes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Mojtaba Sadegh is an assistant professor of civil engineering at Boise State University; John Abatzoglou is an associate professor of engineering at University of California, Merced, and Mohammad Reza Alizadeh, is a PhD student in engineering at McGill University</emphasis>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">This article is republished from</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com\">The Conversation</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">under a Creative Commons license.

She was vulgar, antagonistic, and extremely anti-government.'</p><p>\"He goes on to say she refused to comply with the investigation until she learned that she would be arrested if she did not.</p><p>\"But the investigation of Tracy Stone-Manning did not end in 1989 with the subpoenas.</p><p>\"In December of 1992, after years of her covering up for the eco-terrorists, she was identified as the one who sent the threatening letter.</p><p>\"A woman connected to the group came forward and gave her name to investigators.</p><p>\"Mr. Merkley writes, 'as a result of Ms. Lilburn's testimony, the grand jury sent Tracy Stone-Manning a target letter, which meant she was going to be indicted on criminal charges for her active participation in planning these crimes.'</p><p>\"Her lawyer then negotiated an immunity deal.</p><p>\"She would testify against the individuals who spiked the trees.</p><p>\"She knew she could have been charged.</p><p>\"In an interview published in a 1993 article in The Missoulian - 'Stone-Manning said she could have been charged with conspiracy' if not for her immunity deal.</p><p>\"Remember, she told the Senate she had never been investigated.</p><p>\"She was subpoenaed for physical evidence.</p><p>\"She was investigated.</p><p>\"She didn't cooperate with investigators.</p><p>\"She complained to the press about being investigated.</p><p>\"And she covered up for the eco-terrorists for years until she was caught.</p><p>\"But that wasn't her only lie.</p><p>\"On our committee's questions for the record, I asked her: 'Did you have personal knowledge of, participate in, or in any way directly or indirectly support activities associated with the spiking of trees in any forest during your lifetime?'</p><p>\"She responded: 'no.'</p><p>\"Everyone knows that is a lie.</p><p>\"She sent the letter.</p><p>\"She knew who they were.</p><p>\"She supported their activities.

The situation is so severe that the Colorado River basin is on the verge of its <url normalizedValue=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/correction-colorado-river-water-shortage-story-77170840\">first official water shortage declaration</url>, and forecasts suggest <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/another-dangerous-fire-season-is-looming-in-the-western-u-s-and-the-drought-stricken-region-is-headed-for-a-water-crisis-160848\">another hot, dry summer</url> is on the way. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Warm and dry conditions like these are . </p><p>In a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/118/22/e2009717118\">new study</url> published May 24, 2021, our team of <url normalizedValue=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S1J4kAoAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">fire and</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tGGNDyUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">climate scientists</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=ZaW8ZbsAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">and engineers</url> found that forest fires are now reaching higher, normally wetter elevations. And they are burning there at rates unprecedented in recent fire history. </p><p>While some people focus on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2020/08/20/trump-blames-california-for-wildfires-tells-state-you-gotta-clean-your-floors-1311059\">historical fire suppression</url> and other forest management practices as reasons for the West's worsening fire problem, these high-elevation forests have had little human intervention. The results provide a clear indication that climate change is enabling these normally wet forests to burn. </p><p>As wildfires creep higher up mountains, another tenth of the West's forest area is now at risk, according to our study. That creates new hazards for mountain communities, with impacts on downstream water supplies and the plants and wildlife that call these forests home.</p><h>Rising fire risk in the high mountains</h><p>In the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/118/22/e2009717118\">new study</url>, we analyzed records of all fires larger than 1,000 acres (405 hectares) in the mountainous regions of the contiguous Western U.S. between 1984 and 2017.</p><p>The amount of land that burned increased across all elevations during that period, but the largest increase occurred above 8,200 feet (2,500 meters). To put that elevation into perspective, Denver - the mile-high city - sits at 5,280 feet, and Aspen, Colorado, is at 8,000 feet. These high-elevation areas are largely remote mountains and forests with some small communities and ski areas.</p><p>The area burning above 8,200 feet more than tripled in 2001-2017 compared with 1984-2000. </p><p>Our results show that climate warming has diminished the high-elevation flammability barrier - the point where forests historically were too wet to burn regularly because the snow normally lingered well into summer and started falling again early in the fall. Fires advanced about 826 feet (252 meters) uphill in the Western mountains over those three decades.</p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/6964/\">Cameron Peak Fire in Colorado</url> in 2020 was the state's largest fire in its history, burning over 208,000 acres (84,200 hectares) and is a prime example of a high-elevation forest fire. The fire burned in forests extending to 12,000 feet (3,650 meters) and reached the upper tree line of the Rocky Mountains.  </p><p>We found that rising temperatures in the past 34 years have helped to extend the fire territory in the West to an additional 31,470 square miles (81,500 square kilometers) of high-elevation forests. That means a staggering 11% of all Western U.S. forests - an area similar in size to South Carolina - are susceptible to fire now that weren't three decades ago. </p><h>Can't blame fire suppression here</h><p>In lower-elevation forests, several factors contribute to fire activity, including the presence of more people in wildland areas and a history of fire suppression. </p><p>In the early 1900s, Congress commissioned the U.S. Forest Service to <url normalizedValue=\"https://foresthistory.org/research-explore/us-forest-service-history/policy-and-law/fire-u-s-forest-service/u-s-forest-service-fire-suppression/\">manage forest fires</url>, which resulted in a focus on suppressing fires - a policy that continued through the 1970s. This caused flammable underbrush that would normally be cleared out by occasional natural blazes to accumulate. The increase in biomass in many lower elevation forests across the West has been associated with increases in <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1890/ES13-00217.1\">high-severity fires and megafires</url>. At the same time, <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1607171113\">climate warming has dried out forests in the Western U.S.</url>, making them more prone to large fires. </p><p>By focusing on high-elevation fires, in areas with little history of fire suppression, we can more clearly see the influence of climate change. </p><p>Most high-elevation forests haven't been subjected to much fire suppression, logging or other human activities, and because trees at these high elevations are in wetter forests, they historically have long <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/fire_regime_table/PNVG_fire_regime_table.html\">return intervals between fires</url>, typically a century or more. Yet they experienced the highest rate of increase in fire activity in the past 34 years. We found that the increase is strongly correlated with the observed warming.</p><h>High mountain fires create new problems</h><p>High-elevation fires have implications for natural and human systems. </p><p>High mountains are natural water towers that normally provide a sustained source of water to millions of people in dry summer months in the Western U.S. The scars that wildfires leave behind - known as burn scars - affect how much snow can accumulate at high elevations. This can influence the timing, <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/es500130g\">quality and</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs/rmrs_gtr042_4.pdf\">quantity of water</url> that reaches reservoirs and rivers downstream.</p><p>High-elevation fires also remove standing trees that act as anchor points that normally stabilize the snowpack, <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2009.01.050\">raising the risk of avalanches</url>.</p><p>The loss of tree canopy also exposes mountain streams to the Sun, <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1890/09-0822.1\">increasing water temperatures</url> in the cold headwater streams. Increasing stream temperatures can harm fish and the larger wildlife and predators that rely on them. </p><p>Climate change is increasing fire risk in many regions across the globe, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1003669107\">studies show that this trend will continue</url> as the planet warms. The increase in fires in the high mountains is another warning to the U.S. West and elsewhere of the risks ahead as the climate changes.</p><p>[<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Understand new developments in science, health and technology, each week.</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/us/newsletters/science-editors-picks-71/?utm_source=TCUS&amp;utm_medium=inline-link&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter-text&amp;utm_content=science-understand\">Subscribe to The Conversation's science newsletter</url>.]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mojtaba Sadegh receives funding from the US National Science Foundation and the Joint Fire Science Program.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Abatzoglou receives funding from the National Science Foundation and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mohammad Reza Alizadeh does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CONUSA-159699</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CONUSA2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62RW-JYP1-JB75-9267-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463575</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1030\"/><timeReceived>7:13 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Conversation - United States</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"6137\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 24, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

Good morning, everyone. I'm Poppy Harlow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JIM SCIUTTO, CNN NEWSROOM: And I'm Jim Sciutto.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Happening right now, President Trump is on his way to Arizona, which we should note is one of 25 states where coronavirus cases are surging today. He's going to host several events, and we are learning that masks will not be required at the president's events in Phoenix today, though Phoenix requires them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Before he left the White House, the president moments ago responded to a question about his comments on deliberately slowing testing in this country. You'll remember the White House has said he was joking. What did the president say?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REPORTER: Mr. President, at that rally, when you said you asked your people to slow down testing, were you just kidding, or do you have a plan to slow down testing?</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENT: I don't kid. Let me just tell you. Let me make it clear. We have got the greatest testing program anywhere in the world. We test better than anybody in the world. Our tests are the best in the world, and we have the most of them.</p><p>By having more tests, we find more cases. We did 25 plus, 25 million tests. Think of that, 25 million. If you look at other countries, they did 1 million, 2 million, 3 million, big countries. We did 25 million, way more by double, triple, quadruple any other country.</p><p>Here is what I say. Testing is a double-edged sword. In one way, it tells you have cases. In another way, you find out where the cases are and you do a good job. We are doing a great job. We have never been credited for it. We're doing the best testing job anywhere in the world.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) HARLOW: I don't kid. All right, well, straight from -- straight from his mouth, I guess he meant it. This as the nation's top medical experts will soon testify on Capitol Hill about the administration's coronavirus response. We're getting our first look at what they are going to say on testing and on vaccines.</p><p>Our teams are covering every angle. Let's begin this hour with our Rosa Flores in Miami, where they are still seeing a spike daily in cases.</p><p>ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You're absolutely right, Poppy. And now, multiple mayors here in Miami-Dade County requiring people in public to wear masks. This as Florida and 24 other states across the country are reporting an uptick, an upward trend in coronavirus cases, including the State of Arizona where President Donald Trump will be hosting a series of rallies today in Phoenix. Masks are required, but they will not be enforced.</p><p>The Department of Health there saying that they have seen more than 2,000 cases for five days in a row and the governor attributing that uptick in part to an increase in cases.</p><p>On now to Texas, in that state, they have seen cases and hospitalizations double in the past month, and Governor Greg Abbott saying he is ready to take tougher measures to stop the spread.</p><p>On here to Florida, Florida has seen more than 100,000 cases so far, and if as you look at this graph, think of this, it starts on May 4th, and you can see that it took a few weeks for that uptick to start, but now it's in full swing.</p><p>And, Jim and Poppy, like I was saying, now here in Miami-Dade, multiple mayors requiring everyone to wear a mask in public. Governor Ron DeSantis is not making that requirement statewide. Jim and Poppy?</p><p>SCIUTTO: Rosa Flores in Miami, wearing a mask as recommended, thanks very much.</p><p>We're getting a preview of what four of the nation's top health experts say -- will say in less than an hour when a House oversight hearing on the coronavirus response begins. Among them, Dr. Anthony Fauci. He is saying in his opening statement that rigorous clinical testing is under way right now on several possible vaccines for the virus, plus, we're learning about a revolutionary CDC test that can check not only for COVID-19 but also the seasonal flu. And that's key, of course, because when we get to the fall, there going to be both floating around.</p><p>HARLOW: For sure. Let's go to our Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen with more. Good morning, Elizabeth. If you could walk us through what we're going to hear today and perhaps an update on that dual test.</p><p>ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Good morning. Let's start with that dual test. This is the first we're hearing about it. If it works out, that would really be terrific, and here is why. Come flu season, people are going to go to the doctor, go to the emergency room with symptoms, headache, achiness, temperatures and doctors are going to go how can we tell if this is COVID or the flu because there's going to be a lot of flu running around once the winter hits.</p><p>[07:05:03]</p><p>One test that can do it all would be great because all those patients need to be tested for both. So one test would save time, would save money, would save lives. We're very interested to hear when this test will be ready to roll out.</p><p>And then there was also -- there were also -- we're expecting talk at the hearing on other types of testing, especially testing of vaccines. The hope is that we will have a vaccine out as soon as possible. Three phase three trials, that's the final before rolling out on to the market testing that gets done, are supposed to start in July, August and September, and the United States is investing lots and lots of money, hundreds of millions, billions of dollars into this testing.</p><p>And Dr. Fauci is expected to -- to emphasize rigorous -- we're doing rigorous testing, make sure it's safe, make sure it works. That's so important, Poppy and Jim, because when you have the name, Operation Warp Speed, that's the name of the effort to get this vaccine, that doesn't speak to safety. That doesn't speak to rigorous testing. It speaks to speed, and Americans aren't going to trust that, and so it's good that Dr. Fauci is emphasizing that this testing will be rigorous. Poppy, Jim?</p><p>HARLOW: For sure. Elizabeth, thank you.</p><p>Let's talk to Dr. Amy Compton Phillips. She's a CNN Medical Analyst and Chief Clinical Officer at Providence Health System. It's very nice to have you. Thank you for joining us.</p><p>Could we just begin on that, on that dual test and what that will mean just in terms of slowing the spread and just informing people in this country?</p><p>DR. AMY COMPTON-PHILLIPS, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: Well, testing itself doesn't inform the spread but testing and acting on it can absolutely slow the spread.</p><p>There's something we call influenza-like illness. And influenza-like illness is cough, fever, shortness of breath. And once flu season hits come to fall, we're going to have to distinguish what is traditional influenza and what is coronavirus.</p><p>Because influenza, you know, we ask people to stay home and recover but we don't really require them to go into quarantine and self- isolate. With COVID, because of the lack of antibodies in the population and the significantly higher risk than flu, we really want people to take that extra step to self-quarantine. And so it's really critical to distinguish and so a dual test can definitely help to do that. SCIUTTO: So, doctor, you heard the president make claims will testing and the White House denied them and the president basically making his arguments standing by them saying that, really, the reason we're seeing a rise in cases is because we're testing more.</p><p>Now, the facts are that the positive rate from those tests also rising, which means infections are rising. It's not just that you're testing more. Can you explain to folks at home why those are the facts of this?</p><p>COMPTON-PHILLIPS: Yes, absolutely. In this case, we absolutely have to fact-check the president because it is not the issue that because we're testing more, we're finding more cases. We're finding more cases because there's more cases to find.</p><p>The rate of infections are going up in the U.S., absolutely. The number of hospitalizations are now starting to go up, and as you know, hospitalizations lag behind people getting infected by about a week to two weeks because people get the infection first and then the infection gets bad and they go to the hospital.</p><p>So now, we're finding that front wave of rising infections, and we're going to continue to see in states where like Florida and Arizona, they are already seeing hospitalizations go up, and that peak is not going to happen for a couple of weeks.</p><p>So finding the tests early, in my mind, it's a lot like if you were going to go screening for cancer, the reason we do that is because when you find it early, it's much easier to treat. And the same thing holds true with COVID. If we find it early, we can stop the spread. But if you don't find it early, it explodes and gets out of control like a cancer that metastasizes, much harder to deal, and that's the situation we're in right now.</p><p>HARLOW: We had Michael Osterholm on last hour, who has really led the way in so many respects on calling what this was going to become months ago. And he said to us, I don't think there's going to be a second wave. This continues -- this is a forest fire. And I wonder if you agree with that.</p><p>Because I do -- I have a lot of friends saying, okay, now I'm going to get on a plane this summer and take my kids to see their grandparents because we can't do that in fall and winter when this all comes back in a second wave. I mean, if this is a forest fire, then now is not safe for them to do that either.</p><p>COMPTON-PHILLIPS: It is a forest fire. Compare what we've done in the U.S. to what happened in the E.U., because our peaks happened at about the same time. And, by the way, the E.U. has more people than the U.S., about 100 million more people.</p><p>And yet here in the U.S., our rate has stayed flat. In the E.U., it came down, right? So they actually have been able to control the first wave by using science, by using testing, by using contact tracing and isolation.</p><p>[10:10:02]</p><p>Ours has never come down. It's leveled off and stayed high. And so we've never controlled that forest fire that's burning across the country.</p><p>But what's interesting is that because it's local, there's hot spots, there might be a lot of infections in one town and virtually none in the other town, so people in places where the infections are less prominent are feeling safe. And because we don't have consistent messaging coming out from the government that's clear and cohesive, saying that masks stop the public, wear them in public, people are confused about what they need to do.</p><p>And so we need to be clear, cohesive and very consistent in saying that this is a forest fire and what you can do as an individual is wear that mask and stay six feet apart.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Just very quickly, is anybody getting it right? Do you look at any state, any community for having this dialed this up and down as necessary?</p><p>COMPTON-PHILLIPS: Well, I think we can really take a lesson from New York. The fact that they were able to get it under control after having this raging wildfire and in fact it's one of the reasons why the stats in the U.S. are as good as they are right now because New York was able to get theirs down and under control.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Dr. Amy Compton-Phillips, good to have you on to hear the facts. Please listen to the doctors, folks.</p><p>Still to come this hour, President Trump saying he does not kid when it comes to his comments on slowing down testing. That, of course, contradicts what all his advisers have been saying. We're going to be live at the White House, next.</p><p>HARLOW: Also, the NASCAR community rallies around its only top circuit black driver a day after a noose was found in his garage. The emotional scenes from yesterday's race and an update on that investigation are just ahead.</p><p>[10:15:00]</p><p>SCIUTTO: Right now, President Trump is en route to Arizona, where coronavirus cases have nearly doubled in just the last two weeks. The president will make a stop at the border wall before heading to Phoenix to host a real for student supporters, no masks required.</p><p>HARLOW: Right. John Harwood is at the White House with more. Good morning, John.</p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Poppy.</p><p>We saw the president as he was leaving look for things to feel good about after the bitter disappointment of the rally in Tulsa over the weekend. So the president in talking to reporters before getting on Marine One hailed the 200 miles of border wall that he's going to inspect, even though there was already a border barrier on 197 of those miles, just three miles of new border.</p><p>He was talking about the Fox News ratings for the rally he had in Tulsa even though the arena was only one-third full on Saturday night, which was a very disappointing thing for him. And he also talked about leaning into the culture war that he sees as his political comfort zone after police stopped protesters in Lafayette Park outside the White House last night from ripping down a statue of Andrew Jackson.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We are looking at long-term jail sentences for these vandals and these hoodlums and these anarchists and agitators, and call them whatever you want. Some people don't like that language, but that's what they are. They are bad people. They don't love our country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARWOOD: Vandals, hoodlums, anarchists, bad people who don't love our country, that is how he lumping the protests across the country against police abuses. And it's consistent with the president's pattern of dividing Americans for his political benefit.</p><p>The other thing he said was he completely debunked the explanation that his aides offered yesterday for his comments about testing. They had said he was kidding when he said that I want to slow down the testing because more testing means more cases. He told reporters a few minutes ago, I don't kid, and, in fact, more testing does show more cases, and he does not want to do that.</p><p>SCIUTTO: And a rising infection rate, we should note. That's a thing. The positivity rate is going up as they test more. John Harwood at the White House, thanks very much.</p><p>HARLOW: All right. Let's turn now to a brand-new ad that you may see soon targeting President Trump, this one on trade.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trump lost a trade war that he started. Farmers bankrupted, steel workers betrayed, and manufacturing in a recession. Donald Trump lost, and we can't afford four more years of losing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: With me now is former Democratic presidential candidate, former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg. Good morning, Mayor. Thanks for being here.</p><p>PETE BUTTIGIEG (D), FORMER 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Good morning. Nice to be back with you.</p><p>HARLOW: It's an interesting ad for sure, and this is really the first unified DNC Biden campaign concerted negative attack on the president's handling of trade in China. And I wonder why you think this moment, this is the best way to go after the president given that it was last May that, as you know, the former vice president said that China is not competition for the U.S., only to walk that back a month later?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Well, the DNC is stepping up to clarify the record because we know that this president will continue to try to fog up his failure to stand up for American workers and American farmers when it comes to dealing with China.</p><p>[10:20:03]</p><p>Look, the record and the facts are very clear. You've got a president who talks tough, went into a trade war without a strategy and then allowed American farmers and workers to pay the price. Our prices went up, it's consumers. In my part of the country, where there are a lot of soybean farmers, there was a lot of pain inflicted on farmers.</p><p>And the president basically painted this country into a corner, negotiated a deal that did little more than make up for some of the damage he created, and meanwhile sold out all of our values in the process. I think this moment where Donald Trump is talking about China all the time is exactly the right moment to remind everybody of his failure to stand for American workers and American values.</p><p>HARLOW: So then the question becomes what would a President Biden do, right? You've got China's handling of the coronavirus and lack of transparency to say the least and global implications of that, and then you also have China's promised agricultural purchases from states like yours, states like mine in Minnesota or across the Midwest that have not come close to what they promised to do. So would a President Biden walk away from this phase one trade deal?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: I think we could expect a President Biden to negotiate in a way that puts our farmers and workers first and that's consistent with our values. What you're not going to see is blundering into a trade war with no strategy.</p><p>What you're not going to see is a President Biden doing what President Trump did, which is praising the Chinese regime's, quote, transparency on the issue of coronavirus in order to try to get in good. It is amazing how easy it has been for China to manipulate the current president.</p><p>And someone with the experience that Joe Biden has with China specifically, with Xi Jinping in particular and with foreign policy more generally, means that we will have a president who actually knows what he's doing when he's fighting for us in trade deals and in international diplomacy.</p><p>HARLOW: I would like to get your take on another topic, and that is the vote to even begin debate that's going to happen tomorrow on the Republican proposed police bill or the Justice Act, because you're a guy who, when you were running for president, talked a lot about compromise and talked a lot about the middle. And at this point you've got some Senate Democrats signaling that they are prepared to block even debate. You've got the NAACP legal defense fund sending that letter saying that Democrats should not even debate this Republican proposal at this time. Do you think that Senate Democrats should vote to at least take up debate on it?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: I think that Senate Republicans need to do better so that we can actually get the ball rolling. As what happens as --</p><p>HARLOW: So at this point you would support not even debating what's out there? I ask because if there isn't a debate about it, nothing may happen this year.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: There's a lot of debate about it. The question is whether there's going to be action. And I think to get the ball rolling on action, there has to be an actual good-faith starting point from Senate Republicans. Another way of putting it is that if you're on the wrong side of the NAACP on the initial terms to get this debate going, we're going to have a lot of trouble getting anywhere.</p><p>Look, this is a moment where one advocate has put it we have to raise the ceiling on what's possible and raise the floor on what's acceptable. And that means that at least table stakes is meaningful reform that will deliver real police accountability and look to the broader questions of systemic racism in this country, because this also goes beyond police reform.</p><p>We had a number of successes and a number of humbling failures here in South Bend trying to deal with these issues. We need much more robust federal actions to try to support cities and departments trying to do the right thing.</p><p>HARLOW: Certainly. Of course, it was just about a year ago the fatal police shooting of Eric Logan. I know for you, and it's been something that you've thought a lot about especially in this moment.</p><p>If I could ask you about a different topic, you did a really interesting interview after the Supreme Court decision last week with my colleague, Jim Sciutto, and you talked about wanting to start a family with your husband.</p><p>Next year, next term, the Supreme Court is going to take up a case that involves 11 states where it is now currently legal to allow religious exemptions for organizations that would not allow same-sex couples to adopt or foster because of religious exemptions. And Indiana is not one of those 11 states.</p><p>But I'm just wondering personally, have the two of you faced discrimination in this process?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Well, you know, when you start thinking about a family, as we are, you turn to the landscape of agencies and organizations to help. And because we're a same-sex couple, our options are limited.</p><p>Look, this is about not just the situation of married couples like us, but about the values we have as a country. And the idea that the administration will try to proactively promote discrimination, proactively encourage laws to turn couples like us away, it doesn't just trouble me as a gay man, it troubles me as a Christian.</p><p>[10:25:12]</p><p>Because I know that there are so many kids out there who are deserving of love and who need a good home. And to make them worse off in a pattern of discrimination that isn't consistent with the laws or the values of this country, I think it's just not lining up with at least my personal understanding of where faith can guide us.</p><p>HARLOW: Mayor Buttigieg, I appreciate your time this morning. Thanks so much.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Same here. Thank you.</p><p>HARLOW: Jim?</p><p>SCIUTTO: Bubba Wallace is speaking out after someone put a noose in his garage at a NASCAR event. Now the FBI is getting involved. We're going to have more details coming up.</p><p>[10:30:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2020062303CNV11</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:606D-GKK1-JB20-G51T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3530\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 23, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Ron DeSantis</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Anthony Fauci</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Joe Biden</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Coronavirus</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Health and Medicine</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Senate</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Policies</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Florida</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Arizona</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>New York</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CDC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>LGBTQ</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Supreme Court</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>Family Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEI4M0U5Qzg3RTk0NDdBRUJGNDRGNkZEQkU3RDdFNDU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTA1NEVGNjU1QUFBNDAyMUIyMDM3MjQ5M0M4NTI1MjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDBDQzM0MkIyRjFDNEU2Rjk0QUQzNDY1ODczRUE0REQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001932</classCode><className>CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp;

THIESSEN @marcthiessen</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is, once again, playing politics with impeachment. On CBS News' <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">60 Minutes</emphasis> on Sunday, she warned that President Donald Trump has to be removed because he poses an imminent threat to the country. We have a \"deranged, unhinged, dangerous president of the United States, and we're only a number of days until we can be protected from him,\" said Pelosi.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Well, if Trump is that dangerous, why didn't she call the House back immediately to pass articles of impeachment, and then challenge the Senate to come back into session and hold a trial this week? Instead, she waited until Wednesday - a full week after the U.S. Capitol riot - to hold a House vote. House Majority Whip James Clyburn suggested this weekend that Pelosi could wait until well into the Biden presidency before sending impeachment articles to the Senate. \"Let's give President-elect [Joe] Biden the 100 days he needs to get his agenda off and running,\" Clyburn said. \"And maybe we will send the articles sometime after that.\"</p><p>Pelosi is politicizing what are very serious and weighty questions: Did the president of the United States engage in impeachable conduct? And is it prudent to impeach him when the Constitution will remove him from office in a matter of days?</p><p>On the first question, the answer is clearly yes. It is true that, as some legal scholars have pointed out, Trump would never be convicted of incitement in a criminal court. As former federal prosecutor Andy McCarthy, who successfully prosecuted \"blind sheikh\" Omar Abdel Rahman for incitement, told me, \"An incitement case is very difficult in criminal court. ... You have to intend that a violent crime take place.\" McCarthy points out, however, that the issue in impeachment is not criminal liability, but whether the president committed what Alexander Hamilton described as political offenses that call into question his fitness for office. And by that standard, McCarthy says, what Trump did was \"clearly an impeachable offense\" and \"a deep betrayal of his obligations as president ... to protect our elections, rather than undermine them, and to protect Congress.\"</p><p>For more than six weeks, Trump ginned up anger among his supporters, telling them they had reelected him in a landslide and that their victory was being stolen from them. He then brought a massive crowd to Washington on the day that Congress was meeting to confirm Biden's Electoral College victory, and urged them to march on the Capitol. He might not have intended for his supporters to storm the building, but he recklessly stoked a throng of people who did just that - and five deaths occurred.</p><p>Instead of immediately rushing to the cameras to call off his supporters, Trump sat back and watched them ransack the Capitol. An hour after they had overwhelmed police barricades, Trump poured gasoline on the fire, tweeting, \"Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country.\" (Indeed, Trump never even bothered to call to see whether the vice president was safe.) Only at 2:38 p.m. did Trump feebly tweet urging the already violent mob to \"Stay peaceful!\" It was not until 4:17 p.m. - nearly three hours into the assault - that Trump finally posted a video telling his supporters, \"You have to go home now.\" Even then, he spent more time claiming his \"landslide\" election was \"stolen\" than calling for calm.</p><p>And while Trump might not have intended to provoke violence, he intended to send a crowd to coerce Pence into committing an unconstitutional act by invalidating electoral votes cast for Biden. That is an abuse of power. Trump told the crowd that \"all Vice President Pence has to do is send it back to the states to recertify, and we become president.\" They swarmed into the Capitol chanting \"Hang Mike Pence\" when he refused. Trump played with matches and started a forest fire - that makes him culpable for the death and destruction that ensued, even if he didn't intend to set the fire.</p><p>The second question is more difficult. If Trump had nine months left in office, rather than nine days, there is no doubt that he should be removed from office. It is unclear, however, whether at this late date, an impeachment trial is in the country's best interests. It would divide the country, turn Trump into a martyr, and keep him front and center for months into Biden's term. There is also the risk that he might be acquitted because some Republicans might decide they cannot convict a president who has already left office, while others fear alienating constituents who just voted to give Trump a second term. Trump could then claim vindication.</p><p>The best thing might be to let him simply leave in ignominy. But Pelosi seems to care more about politics and retribution than what is best for the country.</p><p>Marc Thiessen writes a twice-weekly column for the Washington Post on foreign and domestic policy.
