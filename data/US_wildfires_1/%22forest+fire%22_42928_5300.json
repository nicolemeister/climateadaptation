The Prime Minister highlighted that the conference is being held when India is setting new goals for the next 25 years. Talking about the significance, the Prime Minister said that the holistic development of Ekta Nagar is a prime example of an environmental pilgrimage when it comes to forests, water conservation, tourism and our tribal brothers and sisters.</p><p>Giving examples of the International Solar Alliance, Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, and LiFE movement, the Prime Minister remarked that India is not just taking huge strides in the field of renewable energy, but also guiding other nations of the world. The Prime Minister said, \"Today's new India is moving ahead with new thinking, new approach.\" The Prime Minister further went on to add that India is a rapidly developing economy, and it is continuously strengthening its ecology as well. \"Our forest cover has increased and wetlands are also expanding rapidly\", he added.</p><p>The Prime Minister remarked that today the world is joining India because of its track record of fulfilling its commitments. \"Lions, tigers, elephants, one-horned rhinos and leopards have increased in numbers over the years. New excitement has returned from the homecoming of Cheetah in Madhya Pradesh a few days ago\", the Prime Minister added.</p><p>Drawing everyone's attention to the net zero target for the year 2070, the Prime Minister said that the focus of the country is on green growth and green jobs. He stressed the need to maintain equilibrium with nature. He also highlighted the role of the environment ministries of the states in achieving these goals. The Prime Minister said, \"I urge all environment ministers to promote a circular economy as much as possible in the states.\" Shri Modi supplemented his statement by mentioning that it will significantly strengthen the Solid Waste Management campaign and will free us from the clutches of single use plastic.</p><p>Continuing with the role of the environment ministries, the Prime Minister said that this role should not be seen in a restricted manner. He lamented the fact that for a long time the Environment Ministries got shaped more as a regulator. However, the Prime Minister said, \"I think that the role of the Environment Ministry is more as a promoter of the environment rather than as a regulator.\" He asked the states to own the measures like Vehicle Scrapping policy, and biofuel measures like ethanol blending and strengthen them on the ground. He asked for healthy competition as well as collaboration among the states to promote these measures.</p><p>Throwing light on the groundwater issues, the Prime Minister said that the states with abundant water are also facing water shortages nowadays. The Prime Minister remarked that the challenges and measures like chemical-free natural farming, Amrit Sarovar and water security, are not limited to the individual departments and the environment department will also have to consider these as an equally pressing challenge. \"It is critical to work with a participative and integrated approach by the environment ministries. When the vision of the environment ministries changes, I am sure, nature will also be benefitted.\"</p><p>While stressing that this work is not just limited to Information Department or the Education Department, the Prime Minister said that public awareness is another important aspect of protecting the environment. \"As you all are well aware that in the National Education Policy that has been implemented in the country, a lot of emphasis has been laid on experienced-based learning\", Shri Modi added. The Prime Minister remarked that this campaign should be led by the Ministry of Environment. This will create awareness about biodiversity among the children and will also plant the seeds of protecting the environment. \"Children who live in our coastal areas should also be taught how to protect the marine ecosystem. We have to make our children, and future generations sensitive toward the environment\", the Prime Minister added. The universities and laboratories of our states should give top priority to innovations related to environmental protection, following the mantra of Jai Anusandhan. The Prime Minister also underlined the adoption of technology in protecting the environment. \"Study and research on the conditions of forests in the forests are equally important\", Shri Modi added.</p><p>Focussing on the alarming rate of forest fires in the western world, the Prime Minister remarked that India's share in global emissions may be negligible due to wildfire, but we have to stay alert at all times. The Prime Minister emphasised that the forest fire fighting mechanism in every state should be technology driven and robust. Shri Modi also stressed the training of our forest guards, should be given special emphasis when it comes to forest fire fighting.</p><p>Pointing out the complications involved in getting environmental clearance, the Prime Minister said that the development of modern infrastructure and efforts to improve the standard of living of the countrymen is hindered. The Prime Minister gave the example of Sardar Sarovar Dam which was initiated in 1961 by Pandit Nehru. He pointed out that it took decades to complete its construction due to the conspiracies carried out in the name of the environment. The Prime Minister also identified the role of urban naxals in hindering the development of India by taking crores of rupees from different global organizations and foundations. The Prime Minister also pointed out the conspiracies of such people due to which the World Bank had refused to give a loan to increase the height of the dam. \"It took some time to thwart these conspiracies, but the people of Gujarat came out victorious. The dam was being described as a threat to the environment, and today the same dam has become synonymous with protecting the environment\", the Prime Minister added. The Prime Minister also urged everyone to stay alert from such groups of urban naxals in their respective states. The Prime Minister reiterated that more than 6000 proposals for environmental clearance and 6500 applications for forest clearance are lying with the states. \"Efforts should be made by the states to clear every proper proposal soon. You can guess that due to this pendency, projects worth thousands of crores of rupees will be stuck.\", he added. The Prime Minister also emphasised the need to bring about a change in the work environment so that the pendency goes down and clearance is expedited. The Prime Minister further added that in giving environmental clearance, we also take care of the rules and give priority to the development of the people of that area. \"It is a win-win situation for both the economy and ecology\", he said. \"It should be our endeavour that by raising the name of the environment unnecessarily, no obstacle should be allowed to be created in the quest of Ease of Living and Ease of Doing Business. We have to remember that the faster the environment clearance is available, the faster the development will also take place.\"</p><p>The Prime Minister gave the example of the Pragati Maidan Tunnel in Delhi that was dedicated to the nation a few weeks ago. \"Due to this tunnel, the trouble of the people of Delhi getting stuck in the jam has reduced. Pragati Maidan Tunnel will also help in saving more than 55 lakh litres of fuel every year\", he added. This will reduce carbon emissions by about 13 thousand tonnes every year which is equivalent to more than 6 lakh trees, according to experts. \"Be it flyovers, roads, expressways, or railway projects, their construction helps in reducing carbon emissions equally. At the time of clearance, we should not ignore this angle\" Shri Modi said.</p><p>The Prime Minister emphasised the use of the Parivesh Portal, a single-window mode for all types of clearances related to the environment while stressing its transparency and efficacy in reducing the rush for getting approvals. \"Where environment clearance used to take more than 600 days 8 years ago, it takes 75 days today\", the Prime Minister added.</p><p>The Prime Minister pointed out that the coordination in infrastructure projects has escalated while many projects have gained momentum since the implementation of PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan. The PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan is also a great tool for protecting the environment. He also stressed the need for disaster-resilient infrastructure. Shri Modi said that we have to make good use of every emerging sector of the economy while facing the challenges related to climate change. \"Both the central and the state government together have to move towards a green industrial economy\", the Prime Minister added.</p><p>In concluding his address the Prime Minister said that the Ministry of Environment is not just a regulatory body but also a great medium for economic empowerment of the people and creating new means of employment. \"You will find a lot to learn, see and do in Ekta Nagar. Sardar Sarovar Dam, which gives Amrit to crores of people of Gujarat, is present here itself,\" he added, \"Such a huge statue of Sardar Saheb inspires us to stick to the pledge of unity.\"</p><p>Pointing out the learning opportunities in Kevadiya, Ekta Nagar, the Prime Minister remarked that solutions to issues like the simultaneous development of ecology and economy, strengthening of the environment and creation of new employment opportunities, bio-diversity being a medium to increase eco-tourism, and how the wealth of the forest goes up with the wealth of our tribal brothers and sisters can be addressed here.</p><p>Chief Minister of Gujarat, Shri Bhupendra Patel and Union Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Bhupendra Yadav were those present on the occasion.</p><p>Background</p><p>Taking forward the spirit of cooperative federalism, Conference is being convened to create further synergy amongst the Central and State Governments in formulating better policies on issues such as Elimination of Plastic Pollution through a multi-pronged approach, State Action Plans to combat Climate Change with a focus on LiFE effectively- Lifestyle for Environment. It will also focus on increasing the forest cover with particular emphasis on restoration of degraded land and wildlife conservation.</p><p>The two day Conference being organised on the 23rd and 24th of September will have six thematic sessions with topics focusing on LiFE, Combating Climate Change (Updating State Action Plans on Climate Change for Mitigation of Emissions and Adaptation to Climate Impacts); PARIVESH (Single Window System for Integrated Green Clearances); Forestry Management; Prevention and Control of Pollution; Wildlife Management; Plastics and Waste Management.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125460007</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66FR-0GK1-DYTH-G55H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2083\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"09\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>September 23, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Traffic on the major north-south interstate, a key route for big rigs, was jammed due to lane closures.</p><p>Temperatures in the area hit 107 degrees (42 Celsius) on Wednesday.</p><p>Seven firefighters had to be taken to hospitals with heat injuries, said Los Angeles County Fire Department Deputy Chief Thomas Ewald.</p><p>All were released, Ewald said, adding that he expected more heat emergencies.</p><p>Temperatures in much of California were so high that Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency and the state power grid operator asked residents to voluntarily reduce use of electricity during critical afternoon and evening hours.</p><p>After strong work by ground crews and helicopters and airplanes dropping water and fire retardant on the Route Fire, authorities planned to lift evacuation orders for a mobile home park and other homes, Ewald said.</p><p>\u201cThe big thing today is all about boxing the fire in,\u201d he said.</p><p>In eastern San Diego County, the Border 32 Fire was 5% contained after swiftly growing to more than 6 square miles (15.5 square kilometers), the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said.</p><p>The fire burned at least four buildings, including a house, and prompted evacuations for some 400 homes in the Dulzura area near the U.S.-Mexico border.

The largest and deadliest blaze in California so far this year erupted in July in Siskyou County.

(AP) \u2014 California firefighters worked in extreme conditions Thursday as they battled wildfires in rural areas north of Los Angeles and east of San Diego amid a blistering heat wave that is predicted to last through Labor Day.</p><p>Progress was made in containing both blazes but authorities warned that the explosive fire behavior that occurred after they erupted Wednesday showed the potential for what could happen during the prolonged torrid conditions.</p><p>\u201cThe days ahead are going to be challenging,\u201d said Angeles National Forest Fire Chief Robert Garcia, one of the commanders of the battle against the Route Fire near the Interstate 5 community of Castaic in northwestern Los Angeles County.</p><p>The Route Fire was 12% contained after scorching more than 8 square miles (21 square kilometers) and destroying a house. Traffic on the major north-south interstate, a key route for big rigs, was jammed due to lane closures.</p><p>Temperatures in the area hit 107 degrees (42 Celsius) on Wednesday.</p><p>Seven firefighters had to be taken to hospitals with heat injuries, said Los Angeles County Fire Department Deputy Chief Thomas Ewald.</p><p>All were released, Ewald said, adding that he expected more heat emergencies.</p><p>Temperatures in much of California were so high that Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency and the state power grid operator asked residents to voluntarily reduce use of electricity during critical afternoon and evening hours.</p><p>After strong work by ground crews and helicopters and airplanes dropping water and fire retardant on the Route Fire, authorities planned to lift evacuation orders for a mobile home park and other homes, Ewald said.</p><p>\u201cThe big thing today is all about boxing the fire in,\u201d he said.</p><p>In eastern San Diego County, the Border 32 Fire was 5% contained after swiftly growing to more than 6 square miles (15.5 square kilometers), the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said.</p><p>The fire burned at least four buildings, including a house, and prompted evacuations for some 400 homes in the Dulzura area near the U.S.-Mexico border. State routes in the area were closed and a school district called off Thursday's classes.</p><p>There were \u201cmultiple close calls\u201d as residents rushed to flee, said Cal Fire Capt. Thomas Shoots.</p><p>\u201cWe had multiple 911 calls from folks unable to evacuate\u201d because their homes were surrounded by the fire, Shoots told the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/public-safety/story/2022-08-31/quick-moving-brush-fire-threatening-homes-in-barrett-junction-area-of-east-county\">San Diego Union-Tribune.</url></p><p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection closed the Tecate port of entry with Mexico hours early Wednesday night because of the fire and said it wouldn\u2019t reopen until conditions improved. Travelers could still use the 24-hour Otay Mesa crossing.</p><p>Wildfires have sprung up this summer throughout the Western states. The largest and deadliest blaze in California so far this year erupted in July in Siskyou County. It killed four people and destroyed much of the small community of Klamath River.</p><p>Scientists say climate change has made the West warmer and drier over the last three decades and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-e0cc9e3dbf45cae03566e88643e328bb20220901</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6691-5X61-DYMD-60G6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304479</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"513\"/><timeReceived>9:42 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

And there is little farmers can do beyond the steps they have already taken to try to keep the virus out.</p><p>Unlike past years, the virus that causes highly pathogenic avian influenza found a way to survive through the heat of last summer, leading to a rise in cases reported in the fall.</p><p>The outbreak is already more widespread than the last bird flu outbreak in 2015, but it hasn't proven as costly yet partly because the government and industry applied lessons learned eight years ago.</p><p>\"The past year has been devastating for the turkey industry as we experience, unequivocally, the worst HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) outbreak in the industry's history,\" National Turkey Federation spokeswoman Shelby Newman said.</p><p>In the current outbreak, 58.4 million birds have been slaughtered on more than 300 commercial farms in 47 states. That is because any time the virus is detected, the entire flock on that farm - which can number in the millions - must be killed to limit the spread of the disease. Only Hawaii, Louisiana and West Virginia have yet to report a case of bird flu. Iowa - the nation's biggest egg producer - leads the nation with nearly 16 million birds slaughtered.</p><p>In 2015, about 50 million chickens and turkeys were slaughtered on more than 200 farms in 15 states.</p><p>That previous outbreak remains the most expensive animal health disaster in U.S. history. The federal government spent nearly $1 billion to deal with infected birds, clean up barns and compensate farmers. It cost the industry roughly $3 billion as farmers incurred additional costs and lost money when they didn't have any birds on their farms.</p><p>This bills continue to pile up this year as cases spread, and that includes the cost to consumers.</p><p>Egg prices shot up to $4.82 a dozen in January from $1.93 a year earlier, according to the latest government figures. That spike prompted calls for a price-gouging investigation although the industry maintains that the combination of bird flu and significantly higher feed, fuel and labor costs is what's driving prices so high.</p><p>The price for a pound of chicken breast was $4.32 in January. That's down slightly from last fall when the price peaked at $4.75, but it is up significantly from the year before when chicken breasts were selling for $3.73 per pound.</p><p>The key problem with bird flu is that the highly contagious virus is spread easily by wild birds through their droppings and nasal discharges.</p><p>Despite the best efforts of farmers, it is hard to keep the virus out.</p><p>Farmers have gone to great lengths by requiring workers to shower and change clothes before entering barns, sanitizing trucks that enter a farm and investing in separate sets of tools for every barn. Some farms have even upgraded barn ventilation and installed laser systems to discourage wild birds from congregating.</p><p>\"We recommend all producers redouble their efforts to protect their birds through good biosecurity practices,\" said Lyndsay Cole, a spokeswoman for the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service that's leading the government's response.</p><p>Farmers began following those steps after the 2015 outbreak, and this outbreak has only reinforced the need to tighten biosecurity.</p><p>\"America's egg farmers continue to double-down on biosecurity protocols to protect our flocks and maintain a stable egg supply. We are grateful that there has been little to no farm-to-farm spread in this current outbreak,\" said Oscar Garrison, senior vice president of food safety and regulatory affairs at the United Egg Producers trade group.</p><p>Poultry and egg producers, partnering with the government, are parsing this outbreak for new lessons in keeping birds healthy.</p><p>\"That's really the key \u00e2 \" early detection. It's kind of like a forest fire - the earlier you detect it, the easier it is to contain and eradicate,\" National Chicken Council spokesman Tom Super said.</p><p>Officials say bird flu doesn't represent a significant threat to human health. Human cases are extremely rare and none of the infected birds are allowed into the nation's food supply. And properly cooking poultry to 165 degrees Fahrenheit will kill any viruses.</p><p>There has only been one human case of bird flu confirmed during this outbreak and that was a man who had been helping slaughter and remove infected birds from a Colorado farm. He recovered from the illness after a few days.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELHLD-5077179</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELHLD2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67KV-7WP1-JCDM-J0V6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">156396</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-02-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"832\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Woodward Communications, Inc.

Not this early in the year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The forest fire that <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/spain-forest-fires-a319e73fa686fd1aeda71417f13e2fef\">that broke out last Thursday</url> near the village of Villanueva de Viver surprised Rubio and fire experts by displaying an unusual ferocity for spring, when in previous years lower temperatures helped keep fires manageable. That doesn't bode well for a country that led Europe in burned land during a record-hot 2022.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cI was expecting a fire like the ones we normally see in March, which can consume 100, 200 hectares, not the more than 4,300 hectares (11,600 acres) that this one has burned,\u201d Rubio, 39, told The Associated Press hours before going back into the fray. \u201cWe are dealing with weather conditions appropriate for the summer and have a fire that is behaving like a summertime fire.\u201d</p><p>The Mediterranean region is warming faster than the global average due to <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/un-climate-change-report-ipcc-guterres-science-30d8451c0f3fb7b8a857e3ed4fd01172\">climate change</url> caused by the release of greenhouse gases. The effects, European and Spanish officials agree, are already being seen in the multiple heat waves and the <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/spain-drought-water-heatwaves-temperatures-forest-fires-33ade88ddeeb6a5b056e406e36f1cd89\">prolonged drought that Spain has endured</url> over several months.</p><p>Those conditions have turned Spain\u2019s vast expanses of woods into a tinderbox just waiting for the random lightning strike, spark from a tractor or saw, negligently cast cigarette, or act of arson to ignite the landscape.</p><p>Some 267,000 hectares (666,000 acres) burned last year in Spain, making 2022 its worst year of fire destruction since 1994, government statistics say. That was three times the national average for the past decade of 94,000 hectares (232,000 acres). According to the European Union\u2019s Copernicus satellite observation service, Spain accounted for 35% of all burned land in European wildfires in 2022.</p><p>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez warned of worse to come unless some <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/spain-drought-pray-for-rain-catalonia-d4b07bb5f39a1009da23bf9557774e5b\">desperately needed rain</url> comes to the rescue, on his visit to the country\u2019s first major fire of the year.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, over the last few years these fires are becoming normal. What is not so normal is that we see them in March,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said on Monday. \u201cThis has a lot to do with the climate emergency that the world is facing.\u201d</p><p>The fire has forced the evacuation of nearly 1,400 people from their homes in Villanueva de Viver and other small villages in the hilly, rural provinces of Castellon and Teruel. Like many parts of Spain's interior, the regions have shrinking, and aging populations.</p><p>Some 4,600 hectares of forest that authorities deem of \u201chigh ecological value\u201d have gone up in huge plumes of smoke. Five hundred firefighters, supported by 20 water-dumping aircraft, battle on to protect a nearby nature reserve.</p><p>To make things tougher for Rubio and his fellow firefighters, the area is full of tiny villages that are surrounded by trees, making them difficult to protect. A generation ago, the lands were tended to by the villagers. Now that younger generations have abandoned those agricultural jobs, which included collecting firewood, the land is overgrown with dense foliage that fuels fires when dry.</p><p>Rubio said that the area\u2019s vegetation, mainly made up of small pine trees typical of the Mediterranean, and brush, which is very dense, combined with abnormally high temperatures and well-under-average rainfall produced the perfect conditions for the fire. In this part of Castellon, only 20 millimeters (0.8 inches) of rain fell during the winter months, when the average is over 100 (4 inches).</p><p>France, too, saw surprisingly early forest fires this year, after having <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/wildfires-france-fires-heat-waves-b7c3ecaba66d9851ba0381e68d207784\">several major fires in 2022</url> like Spain. Amid a record-breaking stretch of winter drought across France, wildfires broke out in February near Avignon in the southeast, in the Pyrenees region in the southwest, and the Charente-Maritime region on the Atlantic coast.</p><p>The spokesperson for Spain\u2019s weather service, Rub\u00e9n del Campo, warned Wednesday that higher temperatures, reaching 5-10 degrees Celsius (9-18 degrees Fahrenheit) above average, were forecast for Castellon and the rest of eastern Spain in the coming days. He said the expected temperatures are \u201cnormally seen in mid-to-late May.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rising temperatures combined with westerly winds, which reach the Mediterranean hot and dry, cause the relative humidity to fall, and the risk of wildfires goes up dramatically,\u201d Del Campo said.</p><p>More fires flared up across northern Spain on Thursday. Over 1,100 hectares (2,718 acres) were scorched in the northwest province of Lugo, while authorities in the Asturias region reported over 97 different fires that forced at least 20 people to evacuate their homes.</p><p>Army firefighting units were deployed to all three areas to help extinction efforts.</p><p>The situation north of the fire in Spain\u2019s Catalonia, which borders with France, is also incredibly delicate, and authorities are bracing for the worst.</p><p>The region home to Barcelona is suffering its worst drought on record and temperatures beat yearly averages by a full 2.7 degrees Celsius (4.9 degrees Fahrenheit) last year. The director of Catalonia weather service, Sarai Sarroca, said Wednesday that their climate models hadn't expected such a huge surge in temperature until the year 2050.</p><p>Sarroca said that one cause of the drought is the collapse of strong, humid winds that usually blow over the Pyrenees Mountains and help produce snow and rain in the winter.</p><p>For Juli Pausas, a specialist in fire ecology who researches desertification for the Spanish National Research Council, this was all sadly predictable.</p><p>He said that with temperatures over 30 degrees Celsius (84 degrees Fahrenheit) during the Castellon fire and a lack of rainfall, \u201cwe now have 20th century vegetation in a 21st century climate.\"</p><p>\u201cWe are in climatic conditions that favor big fires,\u201d Pausas told the AP. \u201cWe have known for a long time that the climate is changing, and we have known that this would have consequences, including more wildfires, yet we haven't done enough to stop it.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Follow AP\u2019s climate and environment coverage at <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment\">https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-a0e59acdb49827c1d0e0478085f5be1c20230330</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67WR-MCT1-DYMD-6332-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1015\"/><timeReceived>9:49 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"03\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>March 30, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Not this early in the year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The forest fire that <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/spain-forest-fires-a319e73fa686fd1aeda71417f13e2fef\">that broke out last Thursday</url> near the village of Villanueva de Viver surprised Rubio and fire experts by displaying an unusual ferocity for spring, when in previous years lower temperatures helped keep fires manageable. That doesn't bode well for a country that led Europe in burned land during a record-hot 2022.</p><p>\u201cI was expecting a fire like the ones we normally see in March, which can consume 100, 200 hectares, not the more than 4,300 hectares (11,600 acres) that this one has burned,\u201d Rubio, 39, told The Associated Press hours before going back into the fray. \u201cWe are dealing with weather conditions appropriate for the summer and have a fire that is behaving like a summertime fire.\u201d</p><p>The Mediterranean region is warming faster than the global average due to <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/un-climate-change-report-ipcc-guterres-science-30d8451c0f3fb7b8a857e3ed4fd01172\">climate change</url> caused by the release of greenhouse gases. The effects, European and Spanish officials agree, are already being seen in the multiple heat waves and the <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/spain-drought-water-heatwaves-temperatures-forest-fires-33ade88ddeeb6a5b056e406e36f1cd89\">prolonged drought that Spain has endured</url> over several months.</p><p>Those conditions have turned Spain\u2019s vast expanses of woods into a tinderbox just waiting for the random lightning strike, spark from a tractor or saw, negligently cast cigarette, or act of arson to ignite the landscape.</p><p>Some 267,000 hectares (666,000 acres) burned last year in Spain, making 2022 its worst year of fire destruction since 1994, government statistics say. That was three times the national average for the past decade of 94,000 hectares (232,000 acres). According to the European Union\u2019s Copernicus satellite observation service, Spain accounted for 35% of all burned land in European wildfires in 2022.</p><p>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez warned of worse to come unless some <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/spain-drought-pray-for-rain-catalonia-d4b07bb5f39a1009da23bf9557774e5b\">desperately needed rain</url> comes to the rescue, on his visit to the country\u2019s first major fire of the year.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, over the last few years these fires are becoming normal. What is not so normal is that we see them in March,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said on Monday. \u201cThis has a lot to do with the climate emergency that the world is facing.\u201d</p><p>The fire has forced the evacuation of nearly 1,400 people from their homes in Villanueva de Viver and other small villages in the hilly, rural provinces of Castellon and Teruel. Like many parts of Spain's interior, the regions have shrinking, and aging populations.</p><p>Some 4,600 hectares of forest that authorities deem of \u201chigh ecological value\u201d have gone up in huge plumes of smoke. Five hundred firefighters, supported by 20 water-dumping aircraft, battle on to protect a nearby nature reserve.</p><p>To make things tougher for Rubio and his fellow firefighters, the area is full of tiny villages that are surrounded by trees, making them difficult to protect. A generation ago, the lands were tended to by the villagers. Now that younger generations have abandoned those agricultural jobs, which included collecting firewood, the land is overgrown with dense foliage that fuels fires when dry.</p><p>Rubio said that the area\u2019s vegetation, mainly made up of small pine trees typical of the Mediterranean, and brush, which is very dense, combined with abnormally high temperatures and well-under-average rainfall produced the perfect conditions for the fire. In this part of Castellon, only 20 millimeters (0.8 inches) of rain fell during the winter months, when the average is over 100 (4 inches).</p><p>France, too, saw surprisingly early forest fires this year, after having <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/wildfires-france-fires-heat-waves-b7c3ecaba66d9851ba0381e68d207784\">several major fires in 2022</url> like Spain. Amid a record-breaking stretch of winter drought across France, wildfires broke out in February near Avignon in the southeast, in the Pyrenees region in the southwest, and the Charente-Maritime region on the Atlantic coast.</p><p>The spokesperson for Spain\u2019s weather service, Rub\u00e9n del Campo, warned Wednesday that higher temperatures, reaching 5-10 degrees Celsius (9-18 degrees Fahrenheit) above average, were forecast for Castellon and the rest of eastern Spain in the coming days. He said the expected temperatures are \u201cnormally seen in mid-to-late May.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rising temperatures combined with westerly winds, which reach the Mediterranean hot and dry, cause the relative humidity to fall, and the risk of wildfires goes up dramatically,\u201d Del Campo said.</p><p>More fires flared up across northern Spain on Thursday. Over 1,100 hectares (2,718 acres) were scorched in the northwest province of Lugo, while authorities in the Asturias region reported over 97 different fires that forced at least 20 people to evacuate their homes.</p><p>Army firefighting units were deployed to all three areas to help extinction efforts.</p><p>The situation north of the fire in Spain\u2019s Catalonia, which borders with France, is also incredibly delicate, and authorities are bracing for the worst.</p><p>The region home to Barcelona is suffering its worst drought on record and temperatures beat yearly averages by a full 2.7 degrees Celsius (4.9 degrees Fahrenheit) last year. The director of Catalonia weather service, Sarai Sarroca, said Wednesday that their climate models hadn't expected such a huge surge in temperature until the year 2050.</p><p>Sarroca said that one cause of the drought is the collapse of strong, humid winds that usually blow over the Pyrenees Mountains and help produce snow and rain in the winter.</p><p>For Juli Pausas, a specialist in fire ecology who researches desertification for the Spanish National Research Council, this was all sadly predictable.</p><p>He said that with temperatures over 30 degrees Celsius (84 degrees Fahrenheit) during the Castellon fire and a lack of rainfall, \u201cwe now have 20th century vegetation in a 21st century climate.\"</p><p>\u201cWe are in climatic conditions that favor big fires,\u201d Pausas told the AP. \u201cWe have known for a long time that the climate is changing, and we have known that this would have consequences, including more wildfires, yet we haven't done enough to stop it.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Follow AP\u2019s climate and environment coverage at <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment\">https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-a0e59acdb49827c1d0e0478085f5be1c20230330</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67WR-MBN1-DYMD-632X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1016\"/><timeReceived>9:49 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"03\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>March 30, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Now the fruit is ripe and ripening as it turns from red to purple-red and to black-ish. A favorite of wildlife, the fruits are often harvested for jelly-making.</p><p>\u00b7 Fireweed is one of the first plants to grow after a forest fire, thus the common name. But fireweed doesn't need a wildfire, it can grow as a pioneer plant in any disturbed site, including roadsides, railroad grades, and even those in towns. It's common in the northern part of Minnesota and abundant in and around the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, where recent fires have raged. The rose-purple flowers open individually, starting in late July, up from the bottom of the spike, taking several weeks to reach the top. There is an old saying: \"When fireweed blooms to the top, summer is over.\"</p><p>\u00b7 Many of us have been enjoying sweet corn and garden-ripe tomatoes. Watermelons, muskmelons and other melons are ripe and ripening. Early season apples also are ripe. Denny Havlicek from Havlicek Orchard, located near New Prague, this week has been picking Mantet and Oriole varieties, and even some early ripening State Fair and SweeTango. I ate a nearly ripe Zestar apple from our backyard tree here near Lake Waconia.</p><p>\u00b7 Monarch and eastern tiger swallowtail butterflies find nectar on blazing-star and purple coneflower.</p><p>\u00b7 While on a picnic or out in a boat, the fly that gives us the painful bites about our ankles is the stable fly, not a house fly. House flies have lapping mouth parts and so can't bite, though they are the infamous germ carriers.</p><p>\u00b7 Soybean fields across the southern third of the state have flowers and new pods, and sweet corn is being harvested for commercial processing.</p><p>\u00b7 Black bears, in the north, are feasting on ripe wild red raspberries and blueberries. Along the North Shore of Lake Superior, juneberries, pin cherries, red raspberries and thimbleberries are ripe and offer us a taste of the wild.</p><p>\u00b7 Our granddaughter Anja Gilbert recently returned from a week trip in the BWCA out of Ely with fellow students from Watertown-Mayer High School and teachers. She caught many walleyes and reported that wild blueberry picking is good.</p><p>Jim Gilbert has taught and worked as a naturalist for more than 50 years.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRIB-MERLIN68284781</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRIB2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:663C-HS61-JC8F-K44G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8384</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"453\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Star Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN)</publicationName><edition>METRO EDITION</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 5, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>Canoes</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjZFNUYxOUY5M0I1NEE3NUE1RjY2RjhBNjdDNjU3NkY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUJGMzIwOUU1NUY0NDU3MzhFRjhFRkMxQzgxOEI3MEY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000814</classCode><className>BOATING &amp;

Winter is a winnowing time, back to basics. As Linda Churchill's letter (\"Slow to sacrifice,\" Letters to the Editor, Nov. 21) indicates, many of us have too much stuff. It's curious that many boomer peers have grown children who don't want their parents' stuff and, just like the childless ones of us, are faced with what to do with all their stuff when their time is up. I bet I'm not the only one who has an extra sleeping bag just taking up space in storage.St. Elizabeth's Shelters and Supportive Housing, and probably other outfits trying to help those sleeping outside in this cold, will accept sleeping bags to give out to those who need them. It's time to clear out our excess baggage and put it to good use. Also, we should pack the bags in contractor's bags so that they don't become wet &amp; useless, e.g.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Barbara Fix</p><p>Santa Fe</p><p>Stop new Cold War</p><p>I read with great interest The New Mexican's Christmas Eve editorial (\"Getting rid of plutonium pits - so many questions,\" Our View, Dec. 25). It is important for your readers to understand the plutonium pits stored at the Pantex Plant left over from the last Cold War are still useful for another 70 or so years. Los Alamos National Laboratory (an earthquake and forest fire-prone zone) is receiving approximately $9 billion to make many more plutonium pits for nuclear weapons of mass extinction.</p><p>This money is now fueling a new arms race and a new Cold War with Russia, China and North Korea, etc. It also is lining the pockets of the largest nuclear bomb dealers and corporations. This money should instead be spent for schools, hospitals, climate remediation and feeding and housing the global poor.

Why are we left, once again, at the mercy of pharmaceutical companies that care only for their bottom line and nothing for the suffering and death of American families? When we were being urged and even required to receive COVID-19 vaccines, it was difficult to find them. And the very agencies requiring them couldn't get their act together to set up distribution points and mandate increased production.</p><p>And when shelves that should have been loaded with infant formula were empty for weeks as babies literally starved to death, why was little action taken initially to identify and correct supply problems? The same goes for children's pain and fever medicines, despite predictions of unusually high cases of respiratory syncytial virus, and unavailability of Tamiflu and other antivirals for COVID-19 and influenza treatment when winter surges of both were expected. While CNN was urgently telling Americans to get their flu shots right away, I was making phone calls trying to find one closer than 100 miles away. I am 80 years old and chronically ill. I live in fear of the next medical emergency that results in a shortage of pharmaceuticals to prevent or treat it in spite of its having been predicted by the very people who fail to do anything but helplessly wring their hands over it.</p><p>Adele E.

According to news reporting from Halle Saale, Germany, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"A knowledge of the moisture in soils/soil litter allows for the estimation of irrigation needs or the risk of forest fire.\"</p><p><br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research GmbH-UFZ: \"A membrane-based humidity sensor (MHS) can measure the relative humidity ( R H ) as an average value in such heterogeneous substrates via its sensitive tubular silicone membrane. This R H corresponds to the moisture-dependent water potential of the substrate. For humid conditions in soil, however, the R H is already larger than 98% and hence is insensitively correlated with the water potential. For such conditions, a step-like response of the MHS was found, which occurs if the silicone membrane is wetted with water. This appears to correspond to oversaturated water vapor and must be attributed to a phase-dependent sorption mechanism of the membrane. This effect allows the expansion of the range of applications of the MHS in the detection of liquid water, such as in dew point detection.\"<br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Based on this, the dependency of the measurement signal on the mean water saturation in a substrate along the tubular membrane is demonstrated. A comparison of the measurement signal with an internal reference signal according to the MHS measurement principle makes it possible to distinguish this new, saturation-dependent measurement scale from the one used for R H measurement.\"<br/> For more information on this research see: A Phase-Dependent Effect That Enables Multi-Scale Moisture Measurements in Heterogeneous Substrates Using Tubular * * RH* * Sensors. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sensors</emphasis>, 2022,22(3887):3887.

In New York City, which the Swiss firm IQAir ranked Thursday morning as having the world's unhealthiest air, the distribution of wildfire smoke is \"fairly even,\" said Dr. Michaela Martinez, director of environmental health for We Act for Environmental Justice. But, she added, \"the preexisting vulnerabilities are strikingly different.\" In normal times, for example, Black and Latino neighborhoods in the city see far more emergency room visits for asthma attacks in children, Martinez said. And while more affluent New Yorkers may have self-enclosed air conditioning systems, residents in lower-income areas rely on window units that pull in dirty outdoor air from the outside. \"That's obviously a very big factor,\" Martinez said. </p><p>Dangerous smoke imported from Canada stretched across the East Coast again Thursday, leaving parts of Pennsylvania and Delaware with \"hazardous\" air quality ratings, and soot levels around 10 times what EPA considers safe - a daily exposure limit of 35 micrograms per cubic meter of air. The dirty air has brought a typically West Coast problem to a new sector of Americans, endangering vulnerable populations with days more to come at what is only the beginning of fire season. \"This morning, millions of Americans are experiencing the effects of smoke resulting from devastating wildfires burning in Canada, another stark reminder of the impacts of climate change,\" President Joe Biden said Thursday. East Coast residents who don't normally have to think about the dangers of wildfires had taken notice. A noticeable spike in public interest showed up in Apple's App store, where EPA's AirNow app was the sixth-most downloaded free app for iPhones by early Thursday afternoon. Wildfire smoke contains a mix of pollutants, but the biggest health threat comes from microscopic fine particles, which can penetrate deep into the lungs and are tied to an array of respiratory and cardiovascular ills. In a statement posted on its website , EPA said that most healthy adults and children will recover quickly from smoke exposure without long-lasting health effects. \"But people with chronic diseases, such as asthma, other lung disease, or cardiovascular disease are at greater risk of experiencing more severe health effects,\" the agency said. The smoke is expected to stay, at least for awhile. \"This pattern holds for a few more days,\" said Jon Nese, a meteorologist at Penn State University and host of the university's \"Weather World\" magazine show. Shifting winds Sunday, followed by rain Monday, should then give the region some relief, he said. The fires Wildfires have been burning in Canada since earlier this spring, beginning in Western provinces and more recently in Quebec, Novia Scotia and parts of Ontario. A total of 430 fires are currently active, 235 of which are out of control, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center. Canada is experiencing an unusually busy early fire season in both western and eastern provinces, with burned areas so far totaling 12 times what's typical by this date, officials said. About half of the fires were started by lighting, others though human activity, and dry conditions have encouraged their spread, the Canadian government said. With the U.S. experiencing a relatively light wildfire season so far, fire departments have sent help to Canadian provinces. That includes 14 fire suppression crews, an incident management team and 12 overhead personnel to large fires in Alberta, the National Interagency Fire Center said Thursday. More than 600 firefighters from the U.S. have deployed to Canada to assist, according to the White House. Biden and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau discussed the wildfires and smoke in a phone call Thursday, the White House said. For the eastern United States, a just-right mix of many wildfires relatively close by and a swirling storm off in the North Atlantic is sending a huge stream of smoke to major cities and beyond. Nese said the storm's counterclockwise circulation and sluggish movement to the east is keeping the pattern in place. \"That's a tough combo to get, but in this case a warm and dry May has allowed many wildfires, mostly started by lightning, to form in Quebec province, and a storm has kind of been stalled for a few days off the Northeast coast, so we've been in a persistent northerly wind. And there's been little rain here to cleanse the atmosphere,\" Nese said. With the impacts impossible to ignore in Washington, lawmakers at a previously scheduled hearing on wildfires seized on the situation to highlight what they see as shortcomings in forest management. Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, called the situation \"a sobering reminder that we must manage our forests to make them more resilient to catastrophic fires.\" He added, \"In recent years, our Western states have endured wildfires of unprecedented scale and destructiveness. These fires ravaged forests, destroyed communities and upended lives and livelihoods.\" Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) earlier this week used the Canadian wildfires to point out that he and others are still looking to streamline forest management projects in the United States, including by easing requirements that the Forest Service reinitiate consultation with the Fish and Wildlife Service on forest plans when new information surfaces about endangered species that might be affected. The danger The potentially more dire impacts on low-income communities of the wildfire pollution reflects the well-documented disparities that regularly put low-income communities at higher risk from air pollution. While wildfire smoke doesn't follow the same spatial patterns as urban pollution, \"there are factors which MAY lead to disproportionate impacts,\" Katelyn O'Dell, an atmospheric scientist at George Washington University, wrote in an email. Besides potentially lower access to air conditioning or air purifiers, people of color may have less flexibility to work from home or have to work outdoors, O'Dell said. In a 2021 paper published in GeoHealth , O'Dell and other researchers concluded that long-term smoke exposure leads to 6,300 premature deaths each year. On Thursday, Biden and Trudeau \"discussed continued cooperation to prevent wildfires and address the health impacts that such fires have on our communities. They agreed to stay in close touch on emerging needs,\" the White House said. While the conditions leading to the East's difficulties are rare - and temporary - the challenges of wildfire smoke are common in other areas, and are growing. The University of Oregon recently launched a wildfire smoke center to help communities prepare and respond, spurred by federal funding secured by Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.). \"It's going to be in the air. How do we keep it out of people's lungs?\" said the center's director, Cassandra Moseley, who was in Washington on Thursday. \"This is such a rapidly evolving space. We didn't plan for smoke effects until recently.\" Those plans include distributing air filters that protect against particulate matter associated with wildfire smoke and providing clear messaging about how to manage for smoke risks - a critical mission, she said, since prescribed fire is also an important and not always appreciated form of forest management. In Oregon, \"it's not like this every place, every year,\" Moseley said. But the smoke gives officials in the East a sense of what Western communities face regularly and will continue to, she said. In the Senate, Merkley continues to press legislation related to reducing wildfire smoke risks, his office said. Two bills, the \"Smoke Planning and Research Act,\" and the \"Wildfire Smoke Relief Act,\" received a hearing in 2022 but didn't advance any further. The senator \"continues to be concerned about the dangers of wildfire smoke - not only from fires affecting Oregon communities but also the impact on communities thousands of miles away - that pose a serious public health issue across the nation,\" said Maggie Sunstrum, a spokesperson for the senator.

The amount depends more on available fuels than fire weather, shows new research from Northern Arizona University and Michigan Technological University, along with other collaborating institutions, published this week in Nature Climate Change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a large retrospective study stretching across Canada and Alaska, the international team of researchers found that carbon stored belowground in soil organic matter was the most important predictor of how much carbon a fire releases, as opposed to drought conditions, temperature or rain.</p><p>The team analyzed field data collected from 417 burn sites in six ecoregions in Canada and Alaska between 2004 and 2015. Although the amount of carbon stored in soils was the biggest predictor, they found that soil moisture was also significant in predicting carbon release.</p><p>\"In these northern forests, soil, not trees, can account for up to 90% of carbon emissions, so we expected that these organic soils would be a significant driver,\" said lead author Xanthe Walker of the Center for Ecosystem Science and Society at Northern Arizona University. \"But we were surprised that fire weather and the time of year a fire starts proved to be poor indicators of carbon combustion. It's really about the fuels that are there when a fire starts.\"</p><p>That's a pivotal finding, since fire weather, as measured by a Fire Weather Index, is one of the main tools scientists and fire managers currently use to model carbon emissions in these boreal forests. This study suggests fuels should be a bigger component of those models.</p><p>\"Soils in high northern latitudes are unique because they contain a large amount of organic carbon,\" said Liza Jenkins, a research scientist at Michigan Tech Research Institute who uses remote sensing for temporal monitoring and landscape change in boreal forests. \"This study shows the importance of belowground carbon and soil moisture in determining carbon emissions from boreal wildfires. This is significant as climate change is altering moisture conditions, which has the potential to unlock belowground carbon through fire and significantly increase carbon emissions in the future.\"</p><p>The vegetation patterns the researchers uncovered were complex -- soil moisture, tree species composition and stand age at the time of fire all interacted to predict combustion amounts.</p><p>\"This study upends traditional thought that fire weather is a critical predictor of carbon combustion,\" Jenkins said. \"We hope this finding may help shift research and management focus from fire weather to fuel, and specifically belowground carbon pools.\"</p><p>The site-level resolution of the study allowed the researchers to capture such dynamism in carbon combustion patterns, and offers clues about the way they may shift in the future. Highly flammable black spruce was generally a predictor of carbon combustion, the researchers found, and the presence of this species increased with site moisture and stand age at the time of fire. But such interactions are likely to change with the climate. For example, as the climate warms and fire intervals shorten, black spruce stands are being replaced by deciduous trees and jack pine, which grow in shallower soils that release less carbon during fires.</p><p>Evan Kane, associate professor in Michigan Tech's College of Forest Resources and Environmental Science, synthesized pre- and post-fire data collected during fieldwork sessions following large wildfires in interior Alaska.</p><p>He noted that fire management practitioners have long regarded fuels as the base of two triangles of factors controlling both the presence of fire and fire behavior.

Several pieces of construction equipment were set ablaze.                 </p><p>                   Atlanta Police Chief Darin Scheirbaum played for council members security camera footage from the events at the construction site where, he said, a group of bad actors hid among the crowd at a concert that was a publicized, peaceful protest against the project. What came after was a direct attack on police officers, he said.                 </p><p>                   Scheirbaum applauded the officers for moving away from the attack and not escalating the violence. APD officers were then joined by other departments and began making arrests.                 </p><p>                   There were no injuries, according to the chief.                 </p><p>                   Various activist groups in opposition to the training center are taking part in a week of action which included a music festival over the weekend, on property next to the construction site.                 </p><p>                   Sunday afternoon, Scheirbaum said, officers noticed individuals changing into black clothes and some wielding shields and moved quickly to the training center site. About 100 individuals approached officers stationed at the site, videos show.                 </p><p>                   Further footage shows the group starting fires, throwing fireworks at officers and hitting construction equipment with Molotov cocktails. One individual can be seen throwing a flammable accelerant on a burning piece of equipment.                 </p><p>                   Scheirbaum noted that the video captured protesters in black then changing back into regular clothes in the woods to return to the music festival.                 </p><p>                   \"It is clear today that we saw a repeat of what we've seen in the past, where events that are shown to be peaceful and being publicized as being peaceful, are being used by individuals as cover to launch illegal and criminal attacks,\" he said.                 </p><p>                   Only two of the 23 protesters arrested were from Georgia, according to police.                 </p><p>                   Atlanta Fire &amp; Rescue Department Chief Rod Smith said that fires set by protesters could have caused a forest fire and jeopardized power lines that transmit electricity to buildings in downtown Atlanta, including Grady Hospital.                 </p><p>                   \"The simple threat of just spot fires has the potential to cause a lot of harm, a lot of danger, to the citizens that we ensure we will protect on a day-to-day basis,\" Smith said.                 </p><p>                   The public safety officials presented in the chamber after council members had already sat through hours of public comment - most of which was emotional pleas for the council to do what they can to stop the project.                 </p><p>                   Councilwoman Mary Norwood pressed the department heads and officials from the mayor's office on why they waited to give their presentation until after public commenters had left.                 </p><p>                   \"We had an entire chamber filled with people who had a different narrative,\" she said. \"...so my question to the administration...is why do we do this when no one is left?\"                 </p><p>                   Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-news/atlanta-mayor-regrets-leaving-room-for-training-center-disinformation/WNBTTL5E2NCWNKI64MUOYIZOAA/\">has previously voiced</url> that he felt like the narrative around the planned public safety training center \"got way out of hand\" and is flooded with misinformation.                 </p><p>                   Bryan Thomas, director of communications for the mayor's office, said that the decision to present after public comment was to respect the order of meeting proceedings and asked council members for their help.                 </p><p>                   \"Since this project began we have been battling misinformation,\" Thomas said.                 </p><p>                   The clash between police and protestors was the most recent in a string of violent conflicts at the proposed 90-acre police and firefighter training facility.                 </p><p>                   The project gained national attention after a Georgia State Patrol trooper in January fatally shot protestor Manual Teran at the site. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation said Teran shot first and wounded a trooper as the state tried to clear the property.                 </p><p>                   Since, an undisclosed number of Atlanta police officers have been redirected to help guard the site with other agencies, which has raised eyebrows of council members who say that Atlanta public safety will suffer at the expense of the training center.                 </p><p>                   \"I am curious as to why we have APD officers over a site we have no legal jurisdiction over?\" Councilperson Liliana Bakhtiari asked. \"It seems to me that this is a problem.\"                 </p><p>                   Ahead of the City Council meeting on Monday, a coalition of faith leaders gathered on the steps of City Hall to rally against construction of the police training facility. They called for a halt to the project, for all charges to be dropped against protestors and for an independent investigation into Teran's death.                 </p><p>                   \"We are opening our mouths and crying with a loud voice to say that we don't want 'cop city.' I live in East Atlanta, I don't want 'cop city,'\" said Rev. Keyanna Jones. \"I have five Black children, I don't want 'cop city.'\"                 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Police Training Site Protest, Damaged equipment sits at the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center in DeKalb County, Ga., Monday, March 6, 2023.

Implementing the decisions and plans made by the CPC Central Committee on promoting the full revitalization of northeast China, Heilongjiang should build on its strengths and make up for its deficiencies, so as to turn its strengths in resources, ecology, scientific research, industries and geographical location into new development impetus. It is also imperative for the province to build and strengthen its role as a significant national commodity grain production base, heavy equipment production and manufacturing base, key energy and raw material supplier, a vital barrier of ecological security in northern China, and a pivotal gateway for China's northward opening up. While actively performing its duties in ensuring the security of national defense, food, ecology, energy and industries, Heilongjiang must strive to break new ground for high-quality development during the course of comprehensive and all-round revitalization.</p><p>From Sept. 6 to 8, accompanied by Xu Qin, secretary of the CPC Committee of Heilongjiang Province and Liang Huiling, governor of the province, Xi visited the Dahinggan Mountains, the city of Harbin and other places, inspecting sites including a forest farm, villages and a university and meeting with residents in flood-hit areas under post-disaster recovery and reconstruction.</p><p>On the afternoon of Sept. 6, Xi arrived in the city of Mohe in the Dahinggan Mountains to inspect the natural forest of a forest farm. He examined the growth of the natural forest, observed a display of crops growing under trees, and learned about the local efforts to deepen the reform of forest asset management, integrate industries and ecosystems, and intensify forest fire prevention and suppression. Xi noted that equal emphasis must be placed on afforestation and forest protection, and it is urgent to make preparations in advance to preempt possible risks in order to make sure that the achievements made in decades, centuries and millennia will not be ruined overnight.</p><p>Subsequently, Xi rode to the northernmost village Beijicun, or North Pole Village, a riverside border village, where he was briefed how tourism with local characteristics was developed and how the locals turned their ecological advantages into development impetus. Xi noted that forests are a great treasure trove that combines reservoirs, grain depots, bank vaults and carbon pools. He stressed the awareness that larger green coverage and forests mean stronger strengths and more wealth, calling for measures to enable people to increase their income through \"under-forest economy\" on the basis of ecological conservation. At the homestay courtyard of Shi Ruijuan, a local villager, Xi learned about the development of rural industries with unique local features to revitalize border areas, enrich residents and promote rural revitalization. Xi said he was happy to see the development of Beijicun and the good life of its villagers. He noted the importance of tourism sector in achieving high-quality development, stressing the protection of the Dahinggan Mountains, which boast unique tourism resources. He urged policy support from local CPC committees and governments to ensure the development of both \"under-forest economy\" and tourist industry, in a bid to generate more income for local people from the local snow and ice resources.</p><p>When Xi left the small courtyard, local people warmly greeted him on both sides of the road. He kindly told everyone that the prospects for Beijicun are promising. He expressed the hope that officials and local people will work together to build a better countryside, protect the ecology well, live a better life, and work together towards a better future through the Chinese path to modernization.</p><p>Concerned with the post-flood reconstruction and living conditions of those affected, Xi on the morning of Sept. 7 came to Longwangmiao Village in Shangzhi City of Harbin, which bore the brunt of the recent flooding, where he checked the damage to rice crops and the reconstruction of damaged buildings. Villager Yang Chungui's house was soaked in water during the flood, with indoor facilities damaged and walls cracking. Walking into Yang's home, Xi was relieved seeing that the house repair was about to be completed and production and life were well arranged. Xi pointed out that he has been concerned about the affected people. Shangzhi City was seriously affected this time, he said, noting that seeing that the recovery and reconstruction were fast and smooth, and the villagers had a livelihood and production guarantee, he felt relieved. Winter in northeast China comes early and lasts longer than in other parts of the country, so it is necessary to ensure the affected people have a warm and safe home through the winter, which requires local Party committees and governments to make plans in time and take proactive actions, take into more detailed and comprehensive consideration all matters concerning people's production and life, such as food, drinking, living, transportation, employment, education, medical care and epidemic prevention, and leave no room for mistakes and accidents, he said. It is imperative to speed up the repair of damaged houses, accelerate post-disaster reconstruction, minimize agricultural losses caused by disasters, and ensure the security of the affected people, he added.</p><p>Seeing the general secretary coming, local villagers and construction workers gathered around to greet him. He kindly told everyone that the Party and the government are very concerned about residents in the disaster-hit areas, and have always stood hand in hand with the people through thick and thin, hoping that the villagers will work together under the leadership of Party organizations to overcome difficulties and strive to build a better home.</p><p>On the morning of Sept. 7, Xi came to Harbin Engineering University to learn about the university's development and its contributions to China's national defense science and technology, and to observe its teaching and research achievements. Xi urged Harbin Engineering University to carry forward the fine traditions of its predecessor People's Liberation Army Military Institute of Engineering, and meet the requirements for building a great modern socialist country and a strong military by doing a good job in work related to education, science and technology and talent, so as to make new contributions to building China into a leading country in education, science and technology and talent. Xi said that there will be more hope for achieving the Second Centenary Goal as long as the young generation works hard for national rejuvenation. He called on young students to aspire to serve the country by developing science and technology, work hard with dedication and achieve even more in science and technology, so as to dedicate their youth to the building of a strong country and national rejuvenation. Upon the arrival of Teachers' Day in a few days, Xi extended festive greetings to all the faculty members of the university and wished teachers across the country a happy festival.</p><p>Xi was briefed by the CPC Committee of Heilongjiang Province and the provincial government on their work on the morning of Sept. 8 and recognized their efforts in various respects.</p><p>Xi noted that it is imperative to lead the overall industrial revitalization by sci-tech innovation. Based on the existing industrial foundation, solid steps should be taken to promote the high-quality development of advanced manufacturing, and efforts should be accelerated to advance the upgrading of traditional manufacturing. The role of sci-tech innovation as a driving force should be given full play to improve the primary, secondary and tertiary industries in an all-round way, and constant efforts should be made to optimize the economic structure and adjust the industrial structure. Resources for sci-tech innovation should be integrated to guide the development of strategic emerging industries and future industries, so as to form new productive forces. The core competitiveness of state-owned enterprises should be strengthened, while the sound development of the private sector should be guided, and a series of industrial clusters should be created to further strengthen and expand the real economy. Enterprises should be where most sci-tech advances are applied to improve the rate of such application. Proactive efforts are required of the province to align its development with the national industrial and supply chains, and do a good job in developing its competitive industries and its niche areas in certain industries so that its economy will better integrate with the unified national market and play a bigger role in fostering interplay between domestic and international economic flows. The province is urged to adhere to green development by strengthening the innovation in green development technologies so as to establish a green, low-carbon, circular economy.</p><p>Xi stressed that Heilongjiang should serve as the ballast of national food security. It is necessary for the province to develop modern large-scale agriculture, accelerate the development of large agricultural bases, big corporations and industries, and take the lead in achieving modernization in agricultural equipment, science and technology, operation and management, widely applying information technology and realizing the sustainable use of resources. It is vital to strengthen the application of digital and biological technologies. Priority should be given to turning the black soil into high-standard farmland, and at the same time, work must be done to protect such soil. Greater importance must be attached to the development of science and technology in agriculture so as to advance the development of high-tech agriculture, green agriculture and quality and brand-based agriculture in a coordinated manner. It is important to promote the project of upgrading modern seed industry and wide application of the advanced and applicable science and technology as well as high-end agricultural equipment in a bid to develop the circular economy in agriculture. Agricultural operation models should be innovated while scale operation and commercial agricultural services should be developed. Food and fodder industrial clusters should be created to improve the overall efficacy of grain production. Work should be done to accelerate the revitalization of rural areas so as to provide modern living and working conditions for rural residents.</p><p>Xi called for great efforts to develop cultural tourism with distinctive features in the province. It is essential to consider ice and snow economy as a new growth point so as to promote the development of the whole industrial chain involving winter sports and culture, snow-and-ice equipment and tourism. Efforts should also be made to protect the ecological landscape such as forests, rivers, lakes, wetlands and snow and ice. It is essential to improve the infrastructure and develop tourism along the border areas so as to bring prosperity to people in these areas and maintain stability there. The province is urged to develop cultural undertakings and industries, promote cultural-ethical progress in both urban and rural areas, and advance public cultural services, so as to foster new customs and present new images.</p><p>Xi stressed the importance of developing a new gateway for northward opening up. It is imperative to better coordinate trade, investment, channels and platforms, and take bold steps in such areas as market access, flows of factors, and institutional opening up, so as to create a new paradigm for opening up on all fronts. Construction of key land routes, river and sea lanes, and energy pipelines should be accelerated to optimize transportation networks open to Northeast Asia. The province is urged to develop free trade zones and comprehensive bonded zones to better integrate with the Belt and Road Initiative and play an active part in regional cooperation. It is imperative to prevent and defuse risks in key areas, and make those in charge of workplace safety accountable to prevent the occurrence of severe and major accidents.</p><p>As the first round of the education campaign has ended, Xi noted, work must be done to make rectifications and formulate regulations, so as to turn what have proved effective in the program into long-term methods. It is necessary to develop long-term mechanisms to promote theoretical study, fact-finding missions, high-quality development, close contact with the people, and prevent pointless formalities and bureaucratism, and build on the outcomes of the theoretical study program. Since the second round of the education campaign has commenced, those in charge in all localities should plan and arrange the program in a reasonable and coordinated way, and provide targeted guidance to ensure solid outcomes.</p><p>Cai Qi, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and director of the General Office of the CPC Central Committee, accompanied Xi on the inspection.</p><p>Li Ganjie, He Lifeng, and leading officials of the relevant central Party and government departments were on the inspection tour. Officials in charge of the fourth guiding group of the CPC Central Committee for the education campaign attended the meeting.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126123769</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6950-NY11-DYTH-G006-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2302\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>September 10, 2023 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The samples are analyzed at the Techni-Lab laboratory (Actlabs), located in Ste-Germaine-Boul\u00e9, Quebec, Canada. Samples of 3 to 5 kg are crushed by the laboratory up to 90% passing a mesh of 10 mesh (2.00 mm) then 500 g of sample is pulverized up to 90% passing a mesh of 200 mesh (0.07mm). The 50 g pulps are analyzed by fire assay and are read by atomic absorption. Samples with results \u2265 1.0 g/t and &lt; 10.0 g/t are re-assayed by fire assay and read by atomic absorption. Results greater than or equal to 10.0 g/t Au are analyzed by fire assay with gravimetric reading.

EMAP supports impacted communities through agency response via the wildland fire and the emergency management service agreements with the Province of Alberta, resource coordination, organizational structure and evacuee supports. Once the response phase is over, the Program will provide recovery support for repairs to on-reserve community infrastructure to restore to pre-event conditions, mitigation measures to infrastructure to minimize future impacts and personal losses.</p><p>* Public Health Agency of Canada's National Emergency Strategic Stockpile is engaged and has already shipped requested supplies and is standing by to provide more if required.</p><p>* Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada is working with the province of Alberta and telecommunications service providers to keep people connected.</p><p>* Parks Canada is sending an 18-member Incident Command Team to support the Province of Alberta. These wildland fire management specialists are trained to manage complex fires and other incidents. This deployment is being coordinated through the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.</p><p>The Government Operations Centre is working to coordinate the federal response to the wildfire situation in Alberta and across the country. Officials are working closely with federal and provincial partners to coordinate this assistance.</p><p>Quotes</p><p>\"The Government of Canada will always be there to help in times of need. As the extreme wildfires in Alberta continue, we are committed to helping keep residents across the province safe. I would like to thank the emergency management officials from all orders of government and first responders, particularly the firefighting personnel on the ground and in the air, for their tireless efforts.\"</p><p>- The Honourable Bill Blair, President of the King's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Emergency Preparedness</p><p>\"Our Canadian Armed Forces have always answered the call of service to help their fellow Canadians in times of need. Whether during forest fires, floods, or other crises, our people in uniform have shown outstanding dedication to supporting their fellow citizens. I thank all personnel involved in this effort for their leadership and contributions to Canada.\"</p><p>- The Honourable Anita Anand, Minister of National Defence</p><p>\"Wildfires in northern and central Alberta have had a devastating impact on Indigenous communities. The Government of Canada is committed to supporting First Nations in dealing with the immediate emergency situation. We are working closely with Chiefs, Councils and the Government of Alberta to ensure affected Nations have the resources they need to address this ongoing emergency and provide the necessary supports to their communities. I want to thank everyone who is working tirelessly to ensure Albertans including First Nations are safe during this immensely difficult and stressful time\"</p><p>- The Honourable Patty Hajdu, Minister of Indigenous Services</p><p>\"Albertans, including many who live in Indigenous communities, have faced devastation and evacuation due to the ongoing forest fires devastating northern and central Alberta. With this request for federal assistance, we will be able to work even more closely with our provincial counterparts to send them the resources and help they need to fight the wildfires and keep Albertans safe. To the firefighters and first responders in Alberta who are helping to save lives in this difficult time, you have my deepest thanks.\"</p><p>- The Honourable Randy Boissonnault, Minister of Tourism and Associate Minister of Finance</p><p>\"Parks Canada's wildfire management specialists have a long history of stepping up to assist in emergency situations to help keep communities safe across Canada. Eighteen of these highly trained specialists are being seconded to assist in managing the wildfires occurring in Alberta. Team members will be travelling from national parks across the country - a true national effort for Albertans in time of need.\"</p><p>- The Honourable Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change and Minister responsible for Parks Canada</p><p>Quick facts</p><p>* The Province of Alberta declared a province-wide state of emergency on May 6, 2023.</p><p>* The Government Operations Centre is responsible for coordinating the Government of Canada's response to emergency events.</p><p>* In Canada, emergencies are managed first at the municipal level and if they need assistance, they request it from their province or territory. If the emergency escalates further, provinces or territories can request assistance from the federal government.</p><p>* A Request for Federal Assistance is initiated when an emergency event overwhelms or threatens to overwhelm the resources of a province or territory and additional federal resources are needed to effectively support the impacted region.</p><p>* Should a province or territory make an official Request for Federal Assistance, there is a well-established process in place for managing the request, through the Government Operations Centre, and includes provincial/territorial and interdepartmental consultation and coordination.Should a province or territory make an official Request for Federal Assistance, there is a well-established process in place for managing the request, through the Government Operations Centre, and includes provincial/territorial and interdepartmental consultation and coordination.</p><p>* If provincial and territorial authorities require assistance, they may ask the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) for help. When the CAF responds to natural disasters in Canada, it is known as Operation LENTUS.</p><p>* CAF assistance complements and enhances provincial and local resources with unique capabilities, including military personnel and equipment. The primary objective is to help provincial and local authorities stabilize the situation and to reassure Canadian residents in the affected areas.</p><p>* The number of CAF members deployed across the region will vary based on tasks that are identified by the provinces.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/public-safety-canada/news/2023/05/government-of-canada-to-provide-assistance-to-alberta-in-response-to-ongoing-wildfire-situation.html\">https://www.canada.ca/en/public-safety-canada/news/2023/05/government-of-canada-to-provide-assistance-to-alberta-in-response-to-ongoing-wildfire-situation.html</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>T40-MgEditor-8154648 T40-MgEditor</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8154648</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:686Y-RYG1-DYG2-R1KM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1406\"/><timeReceived>10:47 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"05\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>May 12, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

However, its application in horticulture has received less research attention.Field and greenhouse studies were carried out to determine if sludge from a case study industry can replace the typical cellulosic additive utilized in hydroseeding, and the ideal application rate of a sludge-soil-seed mixture. The treatments were 0 - 100% sludge and soil by mass with a consistent mass of embedded seeds of Kentucky Bluegrass (Poa pratensis), Creeping Red Fescue (Festuca rubra), Perennial (Lolium perenne) and Annual Ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum). Seeding with a top layer of soil and 5 to 75% sludge gave the best outcome using a cellulosic additive after 3 weeks of growth. Mixtures containing 5- 25% sludge resulted in the quickest seed germination rate. The cellulosic additive has the capacity to retain a higher volume of water but requires 15 times more material by volume. An increase in sludge increased water retention by 20%. Overall, the cellulosic additive in hydroseeding applications can be replaced by sludge without plant detriment. However, further testing is needed to determine long-term effects.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3694743/v1\">https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3694743/v1</url></p><p>The Industry</p><p>Forest products and applications</p><p>The U.S. and Western Europe have long been the major markets for Canadian forest products. In recent years, however, Canada has been transforming its export markets by building on the strength of the sector's traditional high quality wood fibre products. Today, for example, China and other Asian countries have become increasingly significant new markets for these products. This has helped offset the declines seen in traditional markets over recent years.</p><p>Natural Resources Canada, through its Expanding Market Opportunities Program, is helping the country's producers diversify and expand into emerging markets in Asia and Europe as well as into non-traditional markets in North America</p><p>Key exports</p><p>Canada's forest products exports contribute $17.1 billion in net trade. Approximately 47% of total forest product export value is from the following three key products, each of which faces a different set of challenges and opportunities in today's global markets.</p><p>Northern bleached softwood kraft pulp (NBSK)</p><p>Canada has the largest share of the global NBSK market. That share represents almost one-third of world production and three-quarters of total NBSK capacity in North America.</p><p>This is a healthy position to have within the pulp market, as NBSK is an increasingly important pulp grade for paper and tissue production. However, the value of the Canadian dollar has a major impact on performance, given the global nature of this market.</p><p>Newsprint</p><p>World production of newsprint is approximately 32 million tonnes, and Canada is the single largest producer. It has a current production capacity of about 4 million tonnes, or 12% of the world total. However, demand for newsprint in North America has fallen by 65% since 2000. This collapse is the result of major structural changes in the marketplace, with electronic media having drastically reduced the demand for print advertising.</p><p>At the same time, the rising dollar has shifted Canadian mills from being the lowest cost producers in North America to being among the highest cost producers. Demand is not expected to recover to its previous high levels, but instead will likely stabilize over time at lower levels.</p><p>Softwood lumber</p><p>Canada is one of the world's largest producers and exporters of softwood lumber. Softwood lumber accounts for 20% of the value of Canada's forest product exports.</p><p>The largest export market for Canada is the U.S., where softwood lumber is used to build houses. When the U.S. housing bubble burst in 2006, demand for softwood lumber plummeted. High housing inventories, foreclosures and unemployment will continue to depress U.S. housing starts, and softwood lumber demand may not return to the normal levels of the past until 2015.</p><p>Source: Government of Canada</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/our-natural-resources/forests-forestry/forest-industry-trade/softwood-lumber/19601\">https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/our-natural-resources/forests-forestry/forest-industry-trade/softwood-lumber/19601</url></p><p>Leading Companies</p><p>Alberta-Pacific Forest Industries Inc.</p><p>People  - Alberta-Pacific is comprised of over 400 team members who are committed to helping the company and each other achieve success.

After taking account of adjusting items, largely comprised of asset impairments in the previous quarter, the Company's adjusted operating income for the current quarter of $740.8 million was $524.5 million higher than adjusted operating income of $216.3 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily reflecting a significant increase in lumber segment earnings, and to a much lesser extent, improved pulp and paper segment results.</p><p>Commenting on the Company's first quarter results, Canfor's President and Chief Executive Officer, Don Kayne, said,</p><p>\"We are very pleased to see the sustained strength in global lumber markets continuing into 2022 and while our pulp business continued to face challenges, we also saw improved results in the quarter. A solid operating performance across all of our lumber operating regions allowed us to capitalize on these favourable market fundamentals and execute on our diversification strategy with the recent acquisition of Millar Western. Despite these factors, the global supply chain crisis continues to negatively impact our operations and has resulted in curtailed and reduced lumber and pulp operating schedules. We will continue to assess the effects of this crisis and will make adjustments to our operating schedules as conditions evolve. We greatly appreciate our employees' ongoing resilience in managing through the supply chain challenges.\"</p><p>In the lumber segment, adjusted earnings increased $509.7 million quarter-over-quarter principally reflecting an extensive uplift in Western Spruce/Pine/Fir (\"SPF\") and Southern Yellow Pine (\"SYP\") US-dollar benchmark pricing in the current period, with the average North American Random Lengths Western SPF 2x4 #2&amp;Btr price up US$563 per Mfbm, or 79%, and the average SYP East 2x6 #2 up US$564 per Mfbm, or 105%. The near record-high benchmark lumber pricing in the current quarter was combined with higher production and shipment volumes for the Company's North American lumber operations, albeit moderated in part by the ongoing global supply chain challenges, especially in Western Canada. Current quarter results also reflected strong earnings for the Company's European operations principally attributable to moderately higher European lumber unit sales realizations and, to a lesser extent, lower unit manufacturing costs, offset in part by a 5% stronger Canadian dollar (versus the Swedish Krona (\"SEK\")).</p><p>North American market conditions remained very strong through much of the first quarter of 2022, primarily led by continued strength in new home construction activity. Significant demand against a backdrop of tight supply, largely stemming from supply chain disruptions, resulted in the aforementioned increase in North American benchmark lumber prices in the current quarter. Towards the end of the current quarter, however, elevated material costs, tied to the raised benchmark lumber prices, combined with growing concerns around housing affordability and higher interest rates, dampened consumer spending in the \"do-it-yourself\" sector.</p><p>Offshore lumber demand in Asia weakened somewhat in the first quarter of 2022, particularly in China. In addition, lumber inventories in the region were higher than seasonal norms due to delays in the prior quarter on inbound shipments.</p><p>After a modest decline in the prior quarter, Western Europe and Scandinavian lumber demand strengthened throughout the first quarter of 2022 supported by increased activity in the repair and remodeling sector and relatively stable residential construction activity.</p><p>Results in the pulp and paper segment principally reflected supply-driven increases in Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft (\"NBSK\") pulp US-dollar prices that were significantly moderated by the ongoing impacts of global supply chain challenges and transportation disruptions in British Columbia (\"BC\") on Canfor Pulp Products Inc.'s (\"CPPI\") operations and shipments. As a result, CPPI's NBSK pulp and Bleached Chemi-Thermo Mechanical Pulp (\"BCTMP\") unit sales realizations were broadly in line with the previous quarter. In addition, current quarter results included the impact of capital-related downtime at CPPI's Northwood NBSK pulp mill (\"Northwood\") related to the rebuild of the lower furnace of recovery boiler number one (\"RB1\"). The lower furnace replacement was completed mid-April, with a total capital cost of approximately $30.0 million and total reduction in NBSK pulp production of 90,000 tonnes (10,000 tonnes in the fourth quarter of 2021, 70,000 tonnes in the current quarter and a further 10,000 tonnes in April 2022).</p><p>Looking ahead, global lumber market fundamentals are anticipated to remain strong through the second quarter of 2022. New home construction in North America is projected to show continued strength in the near term, supported by lean home inventory, an aging housing stock and high levels of homeowner equity. As the year progresses, however, new home construction activity is estimated to face increased headwinds due to high inflation, rising interest rates and decreasing housing affordability. Demand in the repair and remodeling sector is anticipated to soften somewhat, principally reflecting inflationary cost pressures and competing uses for discretionary spending. Offshore lumber demand in Asia is forecast to experience some downward pressure in the second quarter of 2022 before improving through the balance of the year as inventories in the region move back into balance. The outlook for European markets remains positive moving into the second quarter but is anticipated to face increasing challenges associated with rising inflation and Russia's recent invasion of the Ukraine which has disrupted regional supply networks.</p><p>Results in the second quarter will reflect reduced operating schedules across the Company's Western Canadian lumber operations as a result of the cumulative effects of the supply chain crisis that has been ongoing for several months. The Company will continue to closely monitor the supply chain situation and will adjust future lumber operating schedules, as appropriate, through the balance of the second quarter and into latter half of 2022.</p><p>In addition, the permanent reduction of 150 million board feet of production capacity at the Company's Plateau sawmill in BC is anticipated to take effect at the end of the second quarter of 2022. The resizing will align the facility with the reduction in available, sustainable timber supply in the region following the Mountain Pine Beetle infestation and other constraints on the timber harvesting land base.</p><p>For the pulp and paper segment, results in the second quarter of 2022 are anticipated to reflect in part, the near record-high US-dollar pulp list pricing seen in the first quarter of 2022. However, the intermittent and limited rail service experienced in BC in the first quarter of 2022 is projected to continue well into the second quarter, putting sustained pressure on CPPI's operations and shipments through the coming months, including, as previously announced, the extension of a transportation-related curtailment at CPPI's Taylor BCTMP mill (\"Taylor\") by at least a further six-weeks, with a projected 25,000 tonnes of reduced BCTMP production. CPPI will continue to closely monitor the ongoing supply chain challenges and will adjust future operating plans accordingly, through the balance of the second quarter and 2022.</p><p>In addition, CPPI's results in the second quarter of 2022 will reflect the impact of the RB1 capital-related outage at Northwood into mid-April (approximately 10,000 tonnes), as well as a scheduled maintenance outage at Northwood in the latter part of the second quarter, with a projected 25,000 tonnes of reduced NBSK pulp production. With the RB1 rebuild now complete, a key focus of CPPI's kraft pulp mills for the balance of 2022 will be on improving operational reliability and closely managing manufacturing and fibre costs.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.canfor.com/docs/default-source/news-2022/2022_q1_cfp_press_release_tsx.pdf?sfvrsn=8255e091_2\">https://www.canfor.com/docs/default-source/news-2022/2022_q1_cfp_press_release_tsx.pdf?sfvrsn=8255e091_2</url></p><p>Conifex (TSX: CFF)</p><p>Established in 2008, Conifex Timber Inc. is a growth oriented publicly traded Canadian company operating in British Columbia's northern interior, with a focus is on forestry, sawmilling, and power generation.</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    We manufacture structural grade SPF dimension lumber and produce clean, renewable energy from our sawmill   </p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>residuals.</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    We practice safety and sustainability in everything we do.   </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    Our strong fibre basket supports lumber production increases and our bioeconomy footprint.   </p></bodyText></listItem></list><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://conifex.com/about\">http://conifex.com/about</url>/</p><p>Conifex Announces First Quarter 2022 Results</p><p>10/5/2022</p><p>Conifex Timber Inc. (\"Conifex\", \"we\" or \"us\") (TSX: CFF) today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2022. EBITDA* from continuing operations was $20.1 million for the quarter compared to EBITDA of $9.7 million in the first quarter of 2021. Net income was $11.4 million or $0.28 per share for the year versus $4.5 million or $0.10 per share in the year-earlier quarter. The results reflect higher lumber prices, partially offset by reduced shipments reflecting ongoing transportation challenges.</p><p>Summary of First Quarter 2022 Results</p><p>Consolidated Net Earnings</p><p>During the first quarter of 2022, we generated net income from continuing operations of $11.4 million or $0.28 per share compared to a net loss of $2.5 million or $0.06 per share in the previous quarter and net income of $4.5 million or $0.10 per share in the first quarter of 2021.</p><p>Lumber Operations</p><p>North American lumber market prices rose steadily in the first quarter of 2022. Canadian dollar-denominated benchmark Western Spruce/Pine/Fir (\"WSPF\") prices, which averaged $1,631 in the first quarter of 2022, increased by 75% or $700 from the previous quarter and by 31% or $387 from the first quarter of 2021  1  . The market price increase was fueled by steady demand from repair and remodelling activities, strong new home construction activity in the US and continuing industry supply chain challenges driven by rail and truck service disruptions. US housing starts on a seasonally adjusted annual basis remained steady, averaging 1,683,000 in the first quarter of 2022, up 2% from the previous quarter and up 5% from the first quarter of 2021  2  .</p><p>Our lumber production in the first quarter of 2022 totalled approximately 47.1 million board feet, representing operating rates of approximately 78% of annualized capacity. In the previous quarter, 44.0 million board feet of lumber was produced. Lumber production in the first quarter of this year increased as COVID-19 shift reductions and severe winter weather that affected operations in the prior quarter and continued through the first half of this quarter gradually eased towards the end of the quarter.</p><p>Shipments of Conifex produced lumber totaled 42.5 million board feet in the first quarter of 2022, representing a decrease of 5% from the 44.7 million board feet shipped in the previous quarter and an increase of 12% from the 37.8 million board feet of lumber shipped in the first quarter of 2021. Shipments of Conifex produced lumber in the first quarter of 2022 was challenged by ongoing railcar and truck supply constraints. Railcar supply continued to persist at lower levels than before the November 2021 heavy rains and floods in the Province of British Columbia.</p><p>Our wholesale lumber program shipped 4.9 million board feet in the first quarter of 2022, representing a decrease of 20% from the 6.1 million board feet shipped in the fourth quarter of 2021 and an increase of 600% from the 0.7 million board feet shipped in the first quarter of 2021.</p><p>Revenues from lumber products were $61.0 million in the first quarter of 2022 representing an increase of 24% from the previous quarter and 51% from the first quarter of 2021. Compared to the previous quarter, higher mill net realizations on stronger lumber market prices offset the lower shipment volumes. The revenue increase in the current quarter over the same period in the prior year was largely the result of both higher benchmark lumber prices and increased lumber shipments.</p><p>Cost of goods sold in the first quarter of 2022 decreased by 22% from the previous quarter and increased by 41% from the first quarter of 2021. The decrease in cost of goods sold from the prior quarter is largely related to a reduction in overall costs on lower Conifex produced lumber and wholesale lumber program shipments. Unit manufacturing costs increased in comparison to the previous quarter and the first quarter of 2021 due to increased fixed costs as a result of the severe winter weather experienced in the first half of the quarter.</p><p>We expensed countervailing (\"CV\") and anti-dumping (\"AD\") duty deposits of $5.0 million in the first quarter of 2022, $2.5 million in the previous quarter and $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2021. The duty deposits were based on a combined rate of 8.99% until December 1, 2021 and 17.91% thereafter. The export taxes during the first quarter of 2022 were significantly higher than the previous quarter and the first quarter of 2021 largely due to the increased cash deposit rate in effect on lumber shipment volumes made to the US market.</p><p>Bioenergy Operations</p><p>Our Mackenzie power plant sold 53.9 gigawatt hours of electricity under our Electricity Purchase Agreement (\"EPA\") with BC Hydro and Power Authority (\"BC Hydro\") in the first quarter of 2022 representing approximately 99% of targeted operating rates. Our Mackenzie power plant sold 54.9 and 25.0 gigawatt hours of electricity in the previous quarter and first quarter of 2021, respectively.</p><p>Our EPA with BC Hydro, similar to other electricity purchase agreements, provides BC Hydro with the option to \"turn down\" electricity purchased from us during periods of low demand by issuing a \"dispatch order\". In April 2022, BC Hydro issued a dispatch order for 61 days, from May 5 to July 4, 2022. In 2021, our power plant was dispatched for 61 days, from May 1 to June 30, 2021. We continue to be paid revenues under the EPA based upon a reduced rate and on volumes that are generally reflective of contracted amounts. During any dispatch period, we continue to produce electricity to fulfill volume commitments under our Load Displacement Agreement (\"LDA\") with BC Hydro.</p><p>Electricity production contributed revenues of $8.0 million in the first quarter of 2022, unchanged from the previous quarter and an increase of 116% from the first quarter of 2021. In comparison to the comparable quarter of 2021, revenues were higher as a result of 49 days of unplanned downtime during the first quarter of 2021 arising from a disruption caused by damage to the plant's generator, which has since been replaced.</p><p>An insurance claim was submitted for physical damage to our equipment and for loss of revenues from the interruption of operations from December 2020 to February 2021. We expect to be fully reimbursed for capital expenditures related to the replacement of our generator, subject to deductible amounts, and for lost income for the period covered under our business interruption policy, being the period between the expiry of the waiting period and the recommencement of the power plant. We recognized $3.5 million as other income on our statement of net income and comprehensive income in 2021 to reflect the estimated settlement for lost income under our business interruption policy. Final settlement of the physical damage and business interruption claim is anticipated to be completed in the first half of 2022.</p><p>Selling, General and Administrative Costs</p><p>Selling, general and administrative (\"SG&amp;A\") costs were $3.3 million in the first quarter of 2022, $2.4 million in the previous quarter and $2.2 million in the first quarter of 2021. The higher SG&amp;A costs are primarily attributable to increased selling costs on wholesale lumber shipments and higher overall compensation costs, including equity-based compensation.</p><p>Finance Costs and Accretion</p><p>Finance costs and accretion totaled $1.1 million in the first quarter of 2022, $1.2 million in the previous quarter and $1.1 million in the first quarter of 2021. Finance costs and accretion relate primarily to our term loan supporting our bioenergy operations (the \"Power Term Loan\").</p><p>Gain or Loss on Derivative Financial Instruments</p><p>We enter into lumber future contracts at times to manage our commodity lumber price exposures. Gains or losses on lumber derivative instruments are recognized as they are settled or as they are marked to market for each reporting period.</p><p>There were no outstanding futures contracts in place as at March 31, 2022.</p><p>Foreign Exchange Translation Gain or Loss</p><p>The foreign exchange translation gain or loss recorded for each period on our statement of net income results from the revaluation of US dollar-denominated cash and working capital balances to reflect the change in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the value of the US dollar. US dollar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated using the period end rate.</p><p>The US dollar averaged US$0.790 for each Canadian dollar during the first quarter of 2022, a level which represented a weakening of the Canadian dollar over the previous quarter  3  .</p><p>The foreign exchange translation impacts arising from the variability in exchange rates at each measurement period on cash and working capital balances resulted in a foreign exchange translation loss of $0.2 million in the first quarter of 2022, compared to a foreign exchange translation gain of $0.1 million in the previous quarter and a loss of $0.3 million in the first quarter of 2021.</p><p>Income Tax</p><p>Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities on our balance sheet and the amounts used for income tax purposes. We recorded deferred income tax expense of $4.3 million in the first quarter of 2022 and deferred income tax recovery of $0.8 million in the previous quarter and deferred tax expense of $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2021. As at March 31, 2022, we have recognized a deferred income tax liability of $3.7 million.</p><p>Financial Position and Liquidity</p><p>Overall debt was $64.4 million at March 31, 2022 compared to $59.4 million at December 31, 2021, with the change mainly driven by the $6.5 million drawn against our secured revolving credit facility with Wells Fargo Finance Corporation Canada (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\") in the quarter to bolster operating working capital. The increase in debt was partially offset by net lease repayments of $0.3 million and Power Term Loan payments of $1.2 million. Our Power Term Loan, which is largely non-recourse to our lumber operations, represents substantially all of our outstanding long-term debt. At March 31, 2022, we had $56.0 million outstanding on our Power Term Loan, while our remaining long-term debt, consisting of leases, was $1.9 million.</p><p>At March 31, 2022, we had total liquidity of $23.3 million, compared to $16.4 million at December 31, 2021 and $16.4 million at March 31, 2021. Liquidity at March 31, 2022 was comprised of unrestricted cash of $14.8 million and unused availability of $8.5 million under the Revolving Credit Facility.</p><p>Like other Canadian lumber producers, we were required to begin depositing cash on account of softwood lumber duties imposed by the United States government in April 2017. Cumulative duties of US$23.3 million paid by us, net of sales of the right to refunds, since the inception of the current trade dispute remain held in trust by the US pending the administrative reviews and conclusion of all appeals of US decisions. We expect future cash flow will continue to be adversely impacted by the CV and AD duty deposits to the extent additional costs on US destined shipments are not mitigated by higher lumber prices.</p><p>Outlook</p><p>We expect lumber prices to remain elevated through 2022, despite recent lumber market price volatility in the past month, supported by steady demand from US housing starts as home demand continues to outpace supply despite recent mortgage rate hikes. At our Mackenzie sawmill, we expect to see an increase in lumber production over the first quarter of 2022, with the expectation of achieving annualized operating rates in excess of 90% for the remainder of the year. Our Mackenzie power plant is forecasted to operate at full capacity and continue to generate a steady and diversified source of cash flow, subject to the \"turn down\" notice received from BC Hydro for the latter half of the second quarter of 2022.</p><p>We anticipate a quarter-over-quarter increase in lumber shipments in the second quarter of 2022, as we unwind lumber inventory accumulated, as transportation challenges related to rail and truck supply shortages improve. While we are unable to estimate when full transportation service will resume, we continue to utilize alternative transportation routes and methods to facilitate shipments to our customers. While we expect more moderate mill net realizations, the anticipated increase in the volume of lumber shipments indicate that the second quarter operating results are expected to be at least comparable to the results achieved in the first quarter of 2022. Since lumber prices have firmed and held steady in recent weeks, we could realize stronger results for the second quarter than anticipated.</p><p>Our liquidity and financial position are forecasted to continue to remain strong throughout 2022. We continue to prioritize funding quick payback sawmill upgrades and exploring potential allocations of capital to enhance shareholder value as we believe that the market price of our common shares does not reflect the underlying value of our business and future prospects. We believe that our strong liquidity position will allow us to manage market volatility, if any that may arise in the remainder of 2022.</p><p>Revenue Diversification Opportunity</p><p>Over the past two years, our management and board of directors have been exploring opportunities to utilize the unique attributes of our power generation asset base to strengthen Conifex. Given the Mackenzie site's location in a relatively cool climate, the availability of affordable and renewable power from BC Hydro, our large property relative to the size of our power generation facility and our highly flexible and technical work force at the power generation facility, we concluded that our site was ideally suited to host a data center or other high-performance computing (\"HPC\") operations, such as digital asset mining. The electrical expertise of our existing power plant engineers and employee base, combined with familiarity of continuous operations are important components to providing hosting services for HPC operators.</p><p>In November 2021, we announced our intention to host 3 megawatts of digital asset mining capacity on a trial basis. In partnership with the TsayKeh Dene First Nations, we commenced hosting an initial 1.5 megawatts of capacity in December 2021 and an additional 1.5 megawatts of capacity in early March 2022. Through the trial, we have gained valuable experience operating an HPC data center. The results from the 3 megawatt trial have been encouraging and we continue to monitor and evaluate this opportunity.</p><p>As we review the results of our trial program, we are continuing to develop plans to host additional data center operation capacity at our Mackenzie site. We expect the capital outlays for this phase of HPC operations will be relatively modest as we plan to redeploy the legacy power infrastructure at our site. We have identified partners with relevant industry experience who may utilize our Mackenzie hosting services for digital asset mining. The potential exists to build out our hosting business in phases and utilize cash flow generated from the initial phases to fund the development of additional hosting capacity. There is no assurance that we will establish any data center operation in the time contemplated by our management or at all.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://conifex.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Conifex-NR.First-Quarter-2022-Results-1.pdf\">https://conifex.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Conifex-NR.First-Quarter-2022-Results-1.pdf</url></p><p>Fortress Global Enterprises Inc. (TSX: FGE)</p><p>Fortress Global Enterprises is focused on the expanding global market for innovative high value biomass-based products. The Canadian forest industry is in a period of transformation and Fortress intends to be a leader in developing new products from sustainable biomass. Fortress operates the Fortress Specialty Cellulose Mill in ThursoQuebec, which has a production capacity of 173,500 ADMT/yr of dissolving pulp utilized as a feedstock for the growing viscose/rayon industry in Asia, and operates a cogeneration plant where it produces green energy from waste products. Fortress recently announced plans to extract C5 and C6 sugars from hemicellulose to produce xylitol and other biochemicals. In January, 2018 Fortress Paper announced it had changed its name to \"Fortress Global Enterprises Inc.\" in order to better reflect its existing business and future prospects. The company's core strengths involve identifying and capitalizing on investment opportunities and divestitures. In relation to these core strengths, the company may pursue opportunities outside of the company's existing business segments that would diversify the asset base or monetize existing assets. Background Fortress Global Enterprises Inc. began its story 12 years ago in Vancouver Canada as Fortress Paper Ltd, incorporated in May 2006. Fortress purchased two paper assets from Mercer International, the Dresden mill, a wallpaper manufacturer in Germany and Landqart Mill, a supplier of security paper products based in Switzerland. Fortress completed a $46 million initial public offering and was listed on the TSX in July 2007. Fortress subsequently began a strategic and capital improvement process to transform the formerly underutilized Mills to market leaders. Dresden mill's production was shifted to a higher percentage of non-woven wall paper base where it evolved to become a world leader in the segment with ~60% market share in 2012. Landqart mill's banknote production was upgraded from 2,500 t/yr. to over 10,000t/yr. and the innovative banknote substrate Durasafe\u00ae was launched in 2012. In 2010 Fortress purchased a shuttered NBHK mill in Quebec from Fraser Papers and announced plans to enter the specialty cellulose and clean energy market with the conversion of the mill from commodity paper pulp to dissolving pulp. The conversion included the construction of a 24 MWH cogeneration plant and an agreement for green energy sales to Hydro Quebec. Fortress Specialty Cellulose mill (FSC) commenced production of dissolving pulp in 2011 followed by the completion of the cogeneration plant in 2013. With the focus now on the dissolving pulp business, Fortress divested of its wall paper business in 2013, Fortress Optical Features in 2014, followed by its security papers business in 2017. Fortress Specialty Cellulose recently completed construction and commissioning of the 5th digester project which was first announced in November 2016. The fifth digester will incrementally increase dissolving pulp production by 8,500 ADMT in 2018 and 17,000 ADMT in 2019 which will result in a material improvement of the mills cost structure. As a strategic supplement to the fifth digester project, Fortress intends to install a new accumulator at the FSC mill with the aim of extracting hemicellulose for use in the development of high value-added by-products feedstock for use in the growing biomaterials, bioproducts industry. In Feb 2018, Fortress acquired S2G BiochemicalsInc, a global leading chemical conversion company and intents to commission the construction of a demonstration plant to produce xylitol at its FSC Mill, utilizing C5 sugars extracted from hemicellulose.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fortressge.com\">https://www.fortressge.com</url>/</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fortressge.com/about\">https://www.fortressge.com/about</url>/</p><p>FORTRESS GLOBAL ENTERPRISES REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2019 RESULTS.</p><p>8/11/2019</p><p>Third Quarter 2019 Consolidated Results.</p><p>Fortress Global Enterprises Inc. (\"Fortress Global Enterprises\" or the \"Company\") (TSX:FGE) (OTCQX:FTPLF) reported 2019 third quarter operating EBITDA loss of $7.2 million compared to operating EBITDA loss of $9.5 million in the previous quarter and operating EBITDA of $7.5 million in the prior year comparative period. The Dissolving Pulp Segment incurred operating EBITDA loss of $6.4 million. Development costs incurred in the Bioproducts Segment were $0.3 million which was offset by $0.1 million of grants and funding. Corporate costs were $0.6 million in the third quarter of 2019.</p><p>Third Quarter 2019 Segment Results and Outlook.</p><p>As a result of a lower realized sales price resulting from a softened demand for dissolving pulp, an inventory write-down and significantly reduced sales volumes due to unusually low demand for dissolving pulp, operating results in the third quarter of 2019 were well below management expectations. Despite the significant headwinds in the dissolving pulp market, the Fortress Specialty Cellulose (\"FSC\") mill realized one of its better operational quarters from a dissolving pulp production and power generation perspective.</p><p>As a result of a thorough evaluation of the operating economics at the FSC mill and the prevailing market conditions, the Company determined to take market downtime on October 8, 2019. This market curtailment strategy will enable the Company to focus its efforts on executing on the previously announced strategic initiative, which includes the consideration of various strategic and financing alternatives potentially available to the Company including a recapitalization, restructuring and/or business combination transaction (the \"Strategic Initiative\"), as well as planning the optimized restart of the mill when dissolving pulp prices normalize. The Company has also proactively allocated resources to enable it to restart the FSC mill on an expedited basis in order to take advantage of any significant rebound in dissolving pulp pricing. Based on historic trends, the Company continues to believe in the future pricing recovery and prospects for dissolving pulp as the market adjusts to currently volatile conditions.</p><p>A total of 42,074 air dried metric tonnes (\"ADMT\") of dissolving pulp was produced in the third quarter of 2019 and the FSC mill sold 16,517 ADMT of dissolving pulp in the same period, compared to sales of 33,585 ADMT and 38,433 ADMT of dissolving pulp in the previous quarter and prior year comparative period, respectively.</p><p>In accordance with the Company's accounting policy, each asset or cash generating unit is evaluated at each reporting date to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment. Management's impairment evaluation resulted in the identification of an impairment loss of $31.7 million and $76.6 million at the FSC mill operations, during the three and nine months periods ended September 30, 2019.</p><p>Going Concern.</p><p>The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for certain classes of property, plant and equipment. The financial statements have also been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.</p><p>Subsequent to the quarter ended September 30, 2019, the Company determined after conducting an impairment analysis that it was not in compliance with one of its financial covenants as at September 30, 2019. Accordingly, $119.9 million was recorded in current liabilities for the period ended September 30, 2019. However, a waiver from compliance with the applicable covenant through to the period ended December 31, 2019 was subsequently obtained from the lender which reclassifies the $119.9 million as long term debt after receipt of the waiver. In addition, approvals for compliance with the terms and conditions from the lender of the $31.7 million secured loan have not been formally finalized in writing as at September 30, 2019. Accordingly, $31.7 million was recorded in current debt for the period ended September 30, 2019.</p><p>Cash flows from operations, primarily based on operating results, have historically been the Company's primary source of liquidity and capital resources. Management anticipates that, based upon current dissolving pulp market prices, the market downtime being taken by the FSC mill, and the working capital as at September 30, 2019, the forecasted cash flows will not be sufficient to meet the Company's obligations, commitments and budgeted expenditures through September 30, 2020. As a result, there is significant uncertainty whether the Company will continue as a going concern and, therefore, whether it will realize the stated value of its assets and settle its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business and at the amounts stated in the financial statements. No adjustments have been made to the financial statements relating to the recoverability and classification of the asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the consolidated entity not continue as a going concern.</p><p>These adjustments could be material.</p><p>The Company has implemented measures to mitigate against the impact of the decline in dissolving pulp prices. On September 3, 2019, the Company announced that its subsidiaries entered into had entered into a financing agreement with their secured lenders or their affiliates providing for a senior secured credit facility in the amount of up to $15.0 million (the \"Facility\"). The Facility provided the Company with supplemental liquidity to initially allow for uninterrupted operations in order to execute on its Strategic Initiative. To-date, the borrowers have drawn down an aggregate of $7.0 million under the Facility.</p><p>Management of the Company continues its active discussions with its financial partners, including its senior lenders, to secure the long-term financial viability of the Company's business. While management is continuing to execute on its Strategic Initiative, no assurance can be provided that it will be successful, or that the amounts realized for its assets will be equal to the amounts reflected in the interim consolidated financial statements. There is also no assurance that the Company will not be required, or will not determine, that it is in its best interests to file for any form of creditor protection proceeding imminently or in the near future whether or not in connection with any transaction.</p><p>The Company's ability to continue future operations and fund its planned activities is dependent on the Company's ability to seek out proposals from existing and potential new stakeholders and to execute the Strategic Initiative.</p><p>Corporate and Cash.</p><p>Corporate expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2019 were $0.6 million, compared to $0.9 million in the previous quarter. Cash and restricted cash at September 30, 2019 was $4.1 million compared to $8.8 million at June 30, 2019.</p><p>For a summary of significant developments please refer to the Management's Discussion and Analysis for the three and nine month period ended September 30, 2019 (available on SEDAR at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url>).</p><p>Selected Financial Information.</p><p>The selected financial information presented herein is qualified in its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as at and for the three and nine month period ended September 30, 2019 and the related notes thereto and Management's Discussion and Analysis, which are available on SEDAR.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fortressge.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Fortress-Global-Enterprises-Reports-Third-Quarter-2019-Results.pdf\">https://www.fortressge.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Fortress-Global-Enterprises-Reports-Third-Quarter-2019-Results.pdf</url></p><p>Howe Sound Pulp and Paper Corporation</p><p>Howe Sound Pulp and Paper is one of the finest, most efficient paper and kraft pulp producers in the world.

(NYSE: RFP) (TSX: RFP) today reported net income for the quarter ended March 31 of $210 million, or $2.68 per diluted share, compared to net income of $87 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, in the same period in 2021. Sales were $945 million in the quarter, an increase of $72 million from the year-ago period. Excluding special items, the company reported net income of $177 million, or $2.26 per diluted share, compared to net income of $119 million, or $1.45 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2021.</p><p>\"We further strengthened the balance sheet with significant cash generation and improved the competitiveness of our business with two tuck-in acquisitions,\" said Remi G. Lalonde, president and chief executive officer. \"Our earnings and cash position reflect favorable pricing momentum in all of our segments, but the transportation network improvements were slower than expected, which led to lower sales volume and higher inventory levels. With our strong balance sheet and liquidity well over $1 billion, we benefit from enhanced flexibility to generate long-term value for shareholders and to drive sustainable economic activity in the communities where we operate.\"</p><p>Mr. Lalonde added: \"I am also pleased to confirm we surpassed our 30% absolute greenhouse gas emissions (scope 1 and 2) reduction target, cutting them by 34% compared to 2015 levels.\"</p><p>Non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjustments for special items and adjusted EBITDA, are explained and reconciled below.</p><p>Quarterly Operating Income Variance Against Prior Period</p><p>Consolidated</p><p>The company reported operating income of $235 million in the quarter, compared to an operating loss of $101 million in the fourth quarter. The improvement reflects higher selling prices in all segments ($206 million) and the net favorable impact of the indefinite idling of pulp and paper operations at the Calhoun (Tennessee) mill ($7 million). This was partially offset by lower shipments as a result of logistics constraints ($29 million), as well as higher fiber ($25 million) and freight expenses ($8 million). The company recorded lower selling, general and administrative expenses ($7 million), mainly due to lower share-based compensation expenses in the quarter. The prior quarter results were unfavorably affected by charges related to the indefinite idling of pulp and paper operations at the Calhoun mill ($171 million).</p><p>Segment Operating Income Variance</p><p>Wood Products</p><p>The wood products segment generated operating income of $219 million in the quarter, a $137 million improvement from the previous quarter. The average transaction price rose to $1,022 per thousand board feet, an increase of $410 per thousand board feet, or 67%, from the previous quarter. Production increased by nearly 50 million board feet in the quarter, including improved productivity and the new I-joist capacity, but shipments were 86 million board feet lower as a result of limited rail car and truck availability. This pushed finished goods inventory up by 97 million board feet, to 223 million board feet. The operating cost per unit (or, the \"delivered cost\") rose by $77 per thousand board feet, or 17%, mainly reflecting higher log costs due to stumpage fees and harvesting expenses. EBITDA in the segment improved by $138 million, to $230 million.</p><p>Market Pulp</p><p>The market pulp segment recorded operating income of $22 million in the first quarter, $3 million higher than in the prior quarter. The average transaction price increased by $9 per metric ton, or 1%, and the delivered cost fell by $8 per metric ton. Shipments were 28,000 metric tons lower, due to the capacity curtailment at the Calhoun mill and logistics constraints, which resulted in an increase in finished goods inventory of 23,000 metric tons. EBITDA in the segment improved by $1 million, to $26 million.</p><p>Tissue</p><p>The tissue segment incurred an operating loss of $9 million in the quarter, compared to an operating loss of $6 million in the fourth quarter. The average transaction price increased by $47 per short ton, or 2%, due to better product mix, and shipments rose by 1,000 short tons. The delivered cost increased by $141 per short ton, or 7%, mostly due to higher pulp prices, including the loss of pulp integration with the pulp capacity curtailment at the Calhoun mill. Finished goods inventory was unchanged at 6,000 short tons. EBITDA in the segment fell by $3 million, to negative $4 million.</p><p>Paper</p><p>The paper segment recorded operating income of $25 million in the quarter, an improvement of $29 million over the previous quarter. The average transaction price rose by $37 per metric ton, or 5%, due to favorable market conditions in all grades. Shipments slipped by 22,000 metric tons with the capacity curtailment at the Calhoun mill. The delivered cost decreased by $47 per metric ton, or 6%, due to lower overall operating costs following the curtailment in Calhoun, partly offset by higher freight costs. Finished goods inventory remained elevated at 85,000 metric tons, as a result of limited rail car and truck availability. Quarter-over-quarter segment EBITDA improved by $22 million, to $34 million.</p><p>Consolidated Quarterly Operating Income Variance Against Year-Ago Period</p><p>The operating income in the first quarter was $58 million higher than in the first quarter of 2021. The improvement reflects higher selling prices in all segments ($163 million) and the net favorable impact of the indefinite idling of pulp and paper operations at the Calhoun mill ($13 million), partly offset by lower shipments as a result of logistics constraints ($33 million).</p><p>The variance also reflects an increase in manufacturing costs ($85 million) due to higher fiber costs ($45 million), mainly due to stumpage and harvesting expenses, as well as higher power, chemical and maintenance expenses ($34 million). Freight costs increased by $16 million due to continued logistics constraints, higher shipping rates and fuel costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $9 million on lower share-based compensation expenses.</p><p>Corporate, Cash and Liquidity</p><p>The company generated $147 million of cash from operating activities in the quarter and built $67 million of inventory, mainly as a result of logistics constraints and the seasonal build-up of logs ahead of the spring break-up. It invested $13 million, net, in fixed assets.</p><p>In the quarter, the company expanded its presence in the growing and attractive wood products segment by acquiring the 50% equity interests it did not already own in Resolute-LP Engineered Wood Larouche Inc. and Resolute-LP Engineered Wood St-Prime Limited Partnership located in Quebec. Consideration for the transaction was $50 million in cash, net of cash acquired and working capital adjustments.</p><p>The company's liquidity at quarter-end was $1.1 billion, and the leverage ratio fell to 0.1x on a net debt to last-twelve-months adjusted EBITDA basis.</p><p>On April 6, Moody's announced a credit rating upgrade to Ba3 from B1 with a stable outlook, as a result of the company's improved financial performance and leverage.</p><p>By quarter-end, the company recorded cumulative softwood lumber duty deposits of $440 million on the balance sheet, including $43 million paid in the quarter.</p><p>Outlook</p><p>\"The underlying fundamentals for building materials remain positive, but we are mindful of inflationary pressure and rising interest rates, which could affect pricing and margins. With our network of high-quality pulp and paper assets and structural advantages, such as fiber integration and embedded power generation, we are well-positioned to grow margins in a rising price environment. We continue to work hard to adapt to challenges in the transportation network, and we expect to gradually normalize inventory levels in the second half of the year,\" added Mr. Lalonde.</p><p>Earnings Conference Call</p><p>The company will hold a conference call to discuss the financial results at 9:00 a.m. (ET) today.

These near-term constraints to North American supply were offset by continued strong demand for our products.\"</p><p>\"While we continue to monitor rising mortgage rates and the potential risk to demand for new home construction and our wood building products, fundamentals for housing and repair and remodelling activity appear favourable. I expect our team will continue to be agile and creative as we navigate our supply challenges and the evolving requirements of our customers.\"</p><p>Results Summary</p><p>First quarter sales were $3.110 billion, compared to $2.038 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. First quarter earnings were $1,090 million, or $10.25 per diluted share, compared to $334 million, or $3.13 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2021. First quarter Adjusted EBITDA1 was $1,592 million compared to $615 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.</p><p>Liquidity and Capital Allocation</p><p>Cash and short-term investments increased to $1.816 billion at March 31, 2022 from $1.568 billion at December 31, 2021.</p><p>Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $93 million.</p><p>We paid $21 million of dividends in the first quarter and announced an increase to our quarterly dividend for the dividend to be paid in the second quarter, raising it to $0.25 per share from $0.20 per share.</p><p>In the first quarter of 2022, we repurchased approximately 2.574 million shares under our Normal Course Issuer Bids (\"NCIB\") for aggregate consideration of $233 million. As of April 28, 2022, approximately 3.994 million shares have been repurchased under the current NCIB, leaving approximately 6.200 million shares available to purchase at our discretion until the expiry of the NCIB.</p><p>On April 26, 2022, we commenced a substantial issuer bid (\"SIB\") pursuant to which the Company has offered to purchase from shareholders for cancellation up to $1.25 billion of its outstanding common shares. The SIB will proceed by way of a \"modified Dutch auction\" procedure with a tender price range from $80.00 to $95.00 per share. The SIB will expire on June 2, 2022, unless extended or withdrawn.</p><p>Outlook</p><p>Markets</p><p>The most significant uses for our North America lumber, OSB and wood panel products are residential construction, repair and remodelling and industrial applications. Historically low mortgage rates, low volumes of homes available for resale and increased acceptance and practice of remote working appear to be positively influencing the demand for new home construction in North America. However, interest rates have been trending higher in early 2022 and should they continue to do so, housing affordability may be impacted, which could reduce demand for new home construction and our wood building products. An aging housing stock and repair and renovation spending is expected to continue to support lumber, plywood and OSB demand. Over the medium to long term, growing market penetration of mass timber in industrial and commercial applications is also expected to support demand growth for wood building products.</p><p>The demand for our European products is expected to remain robust as demand for OSB as an alternative to plywood in Europe continues to grow. An aging European housing stock is also expected to support repair and renovation spending, supporting growing demand for our wood building products. Recent geopolitical developments in Ukraine have caused inflationary price pressures in regional energy markets, which are expected to raise the cost of production within our European operations.</p><p>Operations</p><p>Given the extent of the transportation challenges experienced in Western Canada thus far in 2022, which have been more acute and of longer duration than anticipated, we are reducing our SPF lumber shipment expectations for 2022. We now anticipate SPF shipments to be approximately 2.8 to 3.0 billion board feet, down from our original outlook of 3.0 to 3.2 billion board feet. We reiterate expectations for our 2022 SYP shipments to be approximately 3.0 to 3.2 billion board feet.</p><p>In our NA EWP segment, while transportation and logistics constraints in western Canada and Ontario have been more challenging than previously anticipated, we still expect OSB shipments in 2022 to be approximately 6.1 to 6.4 billion square feet (3/8-inch basis). However, we now expect input costs for the NA EWP business to increase more significantly than originally anticipated, due to higher energy costs and Canadian pulp log costs that are linked to the price of OSB.</p><p>In our Europe EWP segment we reiterate expectations for OSB shipments to be approximately 1.1 to 1.3 billion square feet (3/8-inch basis) in 2022. However, input costs for the Europe EWP business are now expected to increase more significantly, due primarily to higher energy costs.</p><p>Inflationary cost pressures and availability constraints for labour, transportation, raw materials such as resin and chemicals, and energy are expected to remain elevated for the balance of 2022.</p><p>Based on our current outlook, assuming no deterioration in market conditions during the year and that there is no additional lengthening of lead times for projects underway or planned, we continue to anticipate that we will incur capital expenditures of approximately $500 to $600 million in 2022.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westfraser.com/sites/default/files/Q1%202022%20News%20Release.pdf\">https://www.westfraser.com/sites/default/files/Q1%202022%20News%20Release.pdf</url></p><p>Weyerhaeuser Company Limited.

Distribution commodity product margins are expected to be significantly lower.</p><p>UNALLOCATED</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_10\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"768\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"104\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>2021</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>2022</p></entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>(millions)</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>Q4</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>Q1</p></entry><entry colname=\"col4\"><p>Change</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Net charge to pretax earnings</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>$(57)</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>$(117)</p></entry><entry colname=\"col4\"><p>$(60)</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Pretax benefit for special items</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>$(15)</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>$\u2014</p></entry><entry colname=\"col4\"><p>$15</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Net charge to pretax earnings before special items</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>$(72)</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>$(117)</p></entry><entry colname=\"col4\"><p>$(45)</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Adjusted EBITDA</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>$(68)</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>$(99)</p></entry><entry colname=\"col4\"><p>$(31)</p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><p>Q1 2022 Performance - First quarter results include a $59 million noncash charge for the elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO due to elevated levels of high-value inventory.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.weyerhaeuser.com/2022-04-29-Weyerhaeuser-reports-first-quarter-results\">https://investor.weyerhaeuser.com/2022-04-29-Weyerhaeuser-reports-first-quarter-results</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ACQIST-41725</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ACQIST2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B9S-F5C1-DYYM-R032-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">475918</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"16629\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Acquisdata Inc.

According to news originating from Sudbury, Canada, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Critical to effective fire management is the protection and preparedness of highly trained wildland firefighters who routinely face extreme physical and psychological demands. To date, there is limited scientific evidence of psychosocial education intervention effectiveness in this context.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Ontario Ministry of Labour's Research Opportunities Program, Ontario Ministry of Northern Development, Mines, Natural Resources and Forestry's Aviation, Forest Fire and Emergency Services branch. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Laurentian University, \"The objective of the current study is to utilise a cluster randomised control trial study design to evaluate fitness training and psychosocial education intervention programs across a wildland fire season. Wildland firefighters (n = 230) were randomly assigned by their work location to one of four experimental conditions. Pre- and post-season assessments of primary (e.g. psychosocial risk factors, physical fitness and psychological capital) and secondary (e.g. work engagement, job stress and incidence of injury) outcomes facilitated comprehensive evaluation. The psychosocial education intervention program was effective at buffering participant appraisals of 12 of 13 psychosocial risk factors, namely: organisational culture, civility, psychological demands, balance, psychological support, leadership expectations, growth and development, influence, workload management, engagement, protection and safety. Participants in the psychosocial education intervention also reported lower stress relating to organisational support compared with those who not receiving the intervention program.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Wildland firefighters receiving either or both intervention programs reported a significantly lower incidence rate of injury (9.9%) compared with the organisation's 5-year average (16.0%).\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Effectiveness of Fitness Training and Psychosocial Education Intervention Programs In Wildland Firefighting: a Cluster Randomised Control Trial.

Every branch and every leaf, every inch of trunk and every tendril of unseen root contains carbon pulled from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. And as long as it stays stored away inside that forest, it's not contributing to the rising concentrations of carbon dioxide that cause climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> It's only natural that we might want to use forests' <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.futurity.org/climate-change-ecology-2757422-2/\">carbon-storage</url>  superpower as a potential climate solution in addition to reducing human greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p> But climate change itself might compromise how permanently forests are able to store carbon and keep it out of the air, research finds. The new study considered how different regions and tree species will respond to climate change. The authors found a wide range of estimates for the amount of carbon that forests in different regions might gain or lose as the climate warms.</p><p> \" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.futurity.org/biosphere-drought-2804382-2/\">Forest health</url>  and carbon-storage potential is evolving rapidly due to climate change,\" says coauthor Anna Trugman, an assistant professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara. \"The balance of increasing productivity from higher <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.futurity.org/co2-earth-trees-2864362/\">CO 2 levels</url>  and accelerating losses from disturbances will determine the fate of forests as a carbon sink.\"</p><p> The study appears in <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-023-01166-7\">Nature Geoscience</url> . The authors also created an interactive <url normalizedValue=\"https://farmer.biology.utah.edu/carbon/\">tool</url>  showing aboveground, live carbon storage potential in forests across the contiguous United States by the end of the century.</p><p> \"This tells us there's a really urgent need to update these carbon offsets protocols and policies with the best available science of climate risks to US forests,\" says University of Utah's William Anderegg, the study's senior author.</p><p> Forest carbon in multiple models</p><p> The researchers hoped to forecast changes in the amount of aboveground carbon storage in forests of different regions in the US. Aboveground carbon refers to any living parts of a tree that are above ground, including wood and leaves or needles.</p><p> Scientists can look at the future of forests under climate change in a few different ways. They can consider historical and future projections of the climate, or examine datasets from long-term forest plots. They can also use machine learning to identify which climate niches different tree species most prefer. Or they can use complex models that include interactions between the ecosystem and the atmosphere.</p><p> Anderegg and colleagues, including first author Chao Wu, chose all of the above. \"Each different method has inherent advantages and limitations,\" says Wu, a postdoctoral scholar at University of Utah. \"No model is perfect.\"</p><p> \"By bringing in many different approaches and different model types and comparing them,\" Anderegg says, \"we can get a sense of what the different models are telling us and how we [can] learn to improve the models. And we might have much more confidence if all of the models and all of the approaches tell us the same story in a given region.\"</p><p> The researchers found that, although the models' forecasts differed in some ways, they show some consistency in predictions of how different regions' carbon storage might change in the future. The Great Lakes and Northeastern US, for example, as well as parts of the Southeastern US and the northern Rockies, consistently showed carbon gains in future projections.</p><p> But the models also revealed significant risks of losing carbon from forests through the triple threat of fire, climate stress, and insect damage. Without these stresses, forests might be able to pack away 9.4 petagrams of carbon nationwide by the end of the 21st century. A petagram is equal to a quadrillion grams\u2014about 25 times the mass of all humans on Earth. However, with these risks, the models projected a net gain in forests of between 3 and 5 petagrams.</p><p> The researchers also applied their analysis to 139 current projects aiming to offset carbon emissions by increasing the carbon stored in forests. \"For carbon offsets to be effective,\" Anderegg says, \"they have to store carbon for a pretty long amount of time\u2014multiple decades to centuries. So if fire's burning them down or insects are wiping out different areas, it could vastly undermine their effectiveness as climate change solutions.\"</p><p> Depending on the model method and the climate scenario, the researchers found that large numbers of carbon offset forest projects, particularly in the Southeastern US and on the West Coast, are projected to lose carbon by the end of the century.</p><p> Remaining mysteries</p><p> The results highlight that different climate and ecological models have different strengths and weaknesses. Considering them together reveals the areas of research needed to improve climate projections.</p><p> Tree demographic models, for example, include simulations of forest dynamics as old trees die and new trees grow. \"But these current models didn't consider the disturbance-vegetation feedback,\" Wu says, referring to the different types of vegetation besides trees that appear following a disturbance like a forest fire and how they might influence the odds of another disturbance. \"Also they didn't consider CO 2 fertilization,\" or the potential for rising carbon dioxide levels to actually improve plant growth.</p><p> The authors identify three research questions that could help elucidate the situation. First is the extent to which plants and trees might benefit from rising CO 2 concentrations, as the compound is vital for photosynthesis. Second is a need for better data on climate-driven tree mortality from fire, climate stress, and insects to inform their understanding of these threats. Last, scientists need a better account of how biomes will shift. For example, some forests may be able to grow back after a disturbance, but others may transition to grasslands and be lost entirely. \"These are some of the biggest unknowns that the field is really racing to tackle,\" Anderegg says.</p><p> In the meantime, while science works to understand how climate change affects forests, society can help by slowing the pace of climate change. \"Working to tackle climate change as quickly as possible and move to a lower carbon future massively decreases the risks that forests are likely to face in the 21st century,\" Anderegg says, \"and increases the potential benefits that we might get from forests.\"</p><p> Source: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2023/020889/forest-futures\">UC Santa Barbara</url></p><p> The post <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.futurity.org/forest-carbon-climate-change-2902052-2/\">Climate threatens carbon forest offset projects</url>  appeared first on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.futurity.org\">Futurity</url> .</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.futurity.org/forest-carbon-climate-change-2902052-2/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=forest-carbon-climate-change-2902052-2\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXFT-FTRT114198168113553558525876100161</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTRT-114198</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6804-PJM1-JCMN-Y3P5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484245</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1104\"/><timeReceived>2:05 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

Forest fuels are soaking it in, and conditions are improving.</p><p>Residents in the 67 counties no longer under the states burn ban should still burn responsibly, check for local burning restrictions, and make sure you have a valid permit, Troxler said.

Find areas of agreement, we are told, and once again learn to work together. This may take courage and perhaps even sacrificing personal gain for a greater good.As the committee investigating Jan. 6, 2021, winds down, I feel America owes a major debt of gratitude to Rep. Liz Cheney, who demonstrated that this can be done for the benefit of all. While a majority of us may strongly oppose many of her political views, she sacrificed her immediate political career to accept the role of vice chairwoman of the committee.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rather than adopt the shameless head-in-the-sand posture of most of her Republican compatriots, she bravely adhered to the oath she had taken and vociferously recommended to the Justice Department that former President Donald Trump should be held accountable for the alleged crimes he has committed. At a time when it is hard to take inspiration from anyone in public service, Cheney deserves our respect and admiration.</p><p>Paul Lazarus</p><p>Santa Fe</p><p>All on board</p><p>A recent editorial (\"Congress should endorse N.M.'s education amendment,\" Our View, Dec. 19) clarified an earlier article (\"N.M.'s Congress people call on Republicans to support bill to aid state's education plan,\" Dec. 18) that said U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich and U.S. Reps. Teresa Leger Fern\u00e1ndez and Melanie Stansbury were trying to persuade GOP Rep. Yvette Herrell and other Republicans to stop standing in the way of federal legislation to allow a recently approved state constitutional amendment take effect.</p><p>The amendment, approved by 70 percent of New Mexico voters, would boost funding for public and early childhood education. The wording of the article suggested to many that Sen. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n, whose name was not mentioned at all, also did not support its inclusion. In fact, Luj\u00e1n as well as Leger Fern\u00e1ndez were original co-sponsors of the bill.</p><p>Karyl Ann Armbruster</p><p>Los Alamos</p><p>True but why?</p><p>This is not important in the grand scheme, but what exactly is the purpose of the New Mexico True ad campaign? The state is spending millions of dollars advertising New Mexico to ... New Mexicans. Do New Mexicans need to be convinced to like the state they are living in? Presumably if they didn't like it here, they would move away.</p><p>Is this a serious danger? Is someone in the Governor's Office losing sleep over this? Or are they trying to convince us that things are really great, when they aren't? I'm just curious.</p><p>Marc Bonem</p><p>Santa Fe</p><p>MIA</p><p>A week before Christmas and two clerks at the main Santa Fe Post Office. Talk about poor management!</p><p>Ross Bishop</p><p>Santa Fe</p><p>Exhausting</p><p>The U.S. Forest Service ignites the largest forest fire in this state's history. It ends the rural lifestyle for hundreds of residents. One of the officials responsible for the catastrophe is promoted and leaves for a job in Washington, D.C. Now taxpayers have to pay for the bureaucracy's mistake. Also this year, Smokey Bear is forced into retirement. Our love of the land can be exhausted by the government.</p><p>Ray Lopez</p><p>Santa Fe</p><p>Running wild</p><p>Moose skip?</p><p>Richard Wilson</p><p>Santa Fe</p><p>Generosity of strangers</p><p>I made a friend early this week when I stopped by a Starbucks in need of something cold to drink. A woman in line ahead of me turned around, announced she was going to pay for my order and then helped me navigate the menu. I rarely go to Starbucks, I was sick and I am nearly 85. Thanks so much to Adrienne, wherever you may be, and happy holidays!</p><p>Vivian Jones</p><p>Santa Fe</p><p>Not the pits</p><p>Regarding James Barron's article (\"Lobo fans resuscitate the Pit for one day,\" Dec. 20). How many seats are occupied in The Pit is not important as long as I am there supporting the team because I am a Lobo for life. Many of us are! My belief is that the Pit is the happiest place in New Mexico. When you walk into this magical place, the energy is inescapable. Everyone is smiling, laughing and there are no bad moods.

Firefighters battled the blaze across 30 acres of mountainous terrain for more than a week. Photo courtesy of Lars Lund. <br/><br/> About 10 fire departments and dozens of firefighters battled a forest fire in Killington that spread through 30 acres of mountainous terrain and lasted for a week, finally dying down over the weekend. </p><p><br/><br/>Meanwhile, officials say abnormally dry conditions are increasing fire risks. <br/><br/>Firefighters crossed the Ottauquechee River and confronted steep terrain to control the blaze, which was sparked by a fire started without a permit on private property. <br/><br/>Lars Lund, a state forest fire supervisor who's based in Rutland and helped fight the fire, said departments are still monitoring the area. He said at least six departments were on the scene every day that the fire was being actively suppressed. On Friday, firefighters traveled almost an hour from Poultney. <br/><br/>'Very challenging terrain,' Lund said. 'It was consistently steep. The fire had a really strong uphill run, and it burned through most of the surface fuels and consumed them.' <br/><br/>Wildfires are often caused by backyard burns and unattended campfires. Officials say they're seeing more incidences of fire for a longer period than usual this spring, likely a result of the prolonged dry period. <br/><br/>A report[1] by the Eastern Area Coordination Center, which serves federal and state wildfire agencies, said Vermont's fire season started early this spring, as snow melted quickly and debris became exposed and dry. <br/><br/>'In Vermont, almost all wildfire response is handled by local fire departments, most of which are volunteer,' said the report, published in early spring. <br/><br/>Resources, it said, including volunteer, state and federal, 'do not appear to be spread thin; however, that may change if the drought continues to worsen.' <br/><br/> Portable water tanks were crucial weapons for the firefighters battling a weeklong blaze in Killington. Photo courtesy of Lars Lund <br/><br/>Last week, just south of the Vermont border, near Williamstown, Massachusetts, a separate blaze[2] swept through more than 940 acres of forest, the largest wildfire in Massachusetts in two decades. <br/><br/>Lund said he compared notes with the fire supervisor in Massachusetts, who said larger fuels, such as logs, were sustaining the burn. The situation in Killington, which took place within the same week, was similar, but on a smaller scale. <br/><br/>'That was a little bit unusual, because those larger fuels were burning, and also ground fuels,' he said. <br/><br/>There are three types of wildfires, said Kathy Decker, the state's forest protection program manager. Ground fires ignite soil and debris beneath the forest floor. Surface fires catch debris on the ground, and canopy fires ignite the crowns of trees. <br/><br/>In the Northeast, surface fires are most common in the spring as snow melts and uncovers debris leftover from the fall, which serves as fuel. Then, as trees leaf out and green plants on the forest floor reemerge, reports of wildfires typically decrease, and the season fades until fall. <br/><br/>Ground fires typically take place in autumn, when debris has collected and dried over the summer. <br/><br/>'As the greening up happens, the incidence usually goes down,' Decker said. 'I think what we're seeing is really dry conditions, and the wind conditions also, which push and move fire quicker.' <br/><br/>The blaze in Killington was both a surface fire and a ground fire, Lund said. Firefighters believed the blaze had been extinguished last week, but it popped up again on Wednesday from underground. <br/><br/>'It would burn in the ground fuels, and then the wind would pick up, and it would start burning through surface fuels,' Lund said. 'That's why the Killington fire has been kind of stop-and-go. We thought we had it, and it flared back up again.' <br/><br/>In spring, the wildfire season typically begins in southwestern Vermont, Lund said. This year, the first fire was reported on March 3 in Pownal, in the state's southwestern corner. <br/><br/>State officials recently told VTDigger[3] that this March was the second driest in 21 years. The dry conditions date back to last summer[4], when Killington had several other wildfires, including a ground fire that smoldered for several days[5] on Deer's Leap, not far from last week's blaze. <br/><br/>Both Lund and Decker encouraged landowners and campers to be conscientious about burning this year. Burns require a permit, which can be obtained from local fire wardens[6], who can help assess conditions[7]. Fire wardens won't issue permits on dry, windy days, for example, and may perform site inspections to ensure burns are taking place in appropriate locations. <br/><br/>'Plan your burn,' Lund said. 'Can you drag a hose to your pile? Do you have equipment on site that can suppress the fire? Is there a barrier around your burn site? Is it too close to your house, or under any service lines or electrical lines?' <br/><br/>Burns should be attended at all times, he said. <br/><br/>While summer should lower the incidences of fire, Decker said, it's impossible to predict how the upcoming season will look. <br/><br/>'We're not out of the woods. It really depends on the amount of precipitation we get,' Decker said. 'Erratic weather patterns also can fuel the fire.' <br/><br/> Smoke rises over the mountain from a Killington wildfire that lasted an entire week.

News: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ibtimes.com\">http://www.ibtimes.com</url> Delivered by Newstex)  <br/> Four people were reported dead Thursday and more than 180 injured as thousands of firefighters battled huge blazes spreading across the Mediterranean resort regions of Turkey's southern coast. </p><p><br/>Officials also launched an investigation into suspicions the fires that broke out Wednesday in four locations to the east of the tourist hotspot Antalya were the result of arson. <br/>Turkey's disaster and emergencies office said three people were killed -- including an 82-year-old who lived alone. <br/>The NTV channel later said a 25-year-old man died in Marmaris while trying to bring aid. <br/><br/>The fires first emerged across a sparsely populated region about 75 kilometres (45 miles) east of Antalya -- a resort especially popular with Russian and other eastern European tourists. <br/> Dark smoke drifts over a hotel complex during a massive forest fire which engulfed a Mediterranean resort region on Turkey's southern coast near the town of Manavgat, on July 29, 2021 Photo: AFP / Ilyas AKENGIN  <br/>But they were creeping closer Thursday to sandy beaches dotted with hotels and resorts. <br/>Images on social media and Turkish TV showed residents jumping out of their cars and running for their lives through smoke-filled streets lit up by orange flames. <br/> The heavy clouds of smoke turned the sky dark orange over a beachfront hotel complex in the town of Manavgat. <br/>At least 183 people were hospitalised. <br/>Agriculture Minister Bekir Pakdemirli said a hotel was also being evacuated near the tourist city of Bodrum -- some 300 kilometres west of Antalya -- as new fires broke out across the southern coast. <br/> Heavy clouds of smoke

raging with temperatures approaching 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) and wind gusts of 50 kilometres (30 miles) an hour. <br/>But Antalya mayor Muhittin Bocek said he suspected foul play because the fires started in four locations at once. <br/>\"This suggests an arson attack, but we do not have clear information about that at this stage,\" Bocek said. <br/>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said an investigation had already been launched. <br/>The Russian embassy said Moscow had sent three giant firefighting aircraft to dump fire retardant on the burning forests to contain the flames. <br/>Greece's foreign minister Nikos Dendias told his Turkish counterpart that Greece, whose ties with its neighbour are tense, was \"ready to help if needed,\" the Turkish ministry said. <br/>Azerbaijan also offered help. <br/>More than 4,000 Turkish firefighters had been dispatched across the region to help contain the damage and search for people needing help. <br/>They rescued 10 people on Thursday who were stranded on a boat in a lake that was surrounded by burning forest. <br/>\"All of the state's means have been mobilised,\" Environment Minister Murat Kurum said. \"All our teams are in the field.\" <br/></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Every branch and every leaf, every inch of trunk and every tendril of unseen root contains carbon pulled from the atmosphere through photosynthesis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And as long as it stays stored away inside that forest, it's not contributing to the rising concentrations of carbon dioxide that cause climate change. So it's only natural that we might want to use forests' carbon-storage superpower as a potential climate solution in addition to reducing human greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But climate change itself might compromise how permanently forests are able to store carbon and keep it out of the air, according to a new paper by researchers at University of Utah and UC Santa Barbara. The study considered how different regions and tree species will respond to climate change. The authors found a wide range of estimates for the amount of carbon that forests in different regions might gain or lose as the climate warms. Importantly, the researchers found that regions most at risk of losing forest carbon through fire, climate stress or insect damage are precisely those regions where many forest carbon offset projects have been set up.</p><p>\"Forest health and carbon-storage potential is evolving rapidly due to climate change,\" said co-author Anna Trugman, an assistant professor at UC Santa Barbara. \"The balance of increasing productivity from higher CO2 levels and accelerating losses from disturbances will determine the fate of forests as a carbon sink.\"</p><p>The study appears in Nature Geoscience. The authors also created an interactive tool showing aboveground, live carbon storage potential in forests across the contiguous United States by the end of the century.</p><p>\"This tells us there's a really urgent need to update these carbon offsets protocols and policies with the best available science of climate risks to U.S. forests,\" said University of Utah's William Anderegg, the study's senior author.</p><p>A multi-perspective modeling approach</p><p>The researchers hoped to forecast changes in the amount of aboveground carbon storage in forests of different regions in the U.S. Aboveground carbon refers to any living parts of a tree that are above ground, including wood and leaves or needles.</p><p>Scientists can look at the future of forests under climate change in a few different ways. They can consider historical and future projections of the climate, or examine datasets from long-term forest plots. They can also use machine learning to identify which climate niches different tree species most prefer. Or they can use complex models that include interactions between the ecosystem and the atmosphere.</p><p>Anderegg and colleagues, including first author Chao Wu, chose all of the above. \"Each different method has inherent advantages and limitations,\" said Wu, a postdoctoral scholar at University of Utah. \"No model is perfect.\"</p><p>\"By bringing in many different approaches and different model types and comparing them,\" Anderegg said, \"we can get a sense of what the different models are telling us and how we [can] learn to improve the models. And we might have much more confidence if all of the models and all of the approaches tell us the same story in a given region.\"</p><p>The researchers found that, although the models' forecasts differed in some ways, they showed some consistency in predictions of how different regions' carbon storage might change in the future. The Great Lakes and Northeastern U.S., for example, as well as parts of the Southeastern U.S. and the northern Rockies, consistently showed carbon gains in future projections.</p><p>But the models also revealed significant risks of losing carbon from forests through the triple threat of fire, climate stress and insect damage. Without these stresses, forests might be able to pack away 9.4 petagrams of carbon nationwide by the end of the 21st century. A petagram is equal to a quadrillion grams \u2014 about 25 times the mass of all humans on Earth. However, with these risks, the models projected a net gain in forests of between 3 and 5 petagrams.</p><p>The researchers also applied their analysis to 139 current projects aiming to offset carbon emissions by increasing the carbon stored in forests. \"For carbon offsets to be effective,\" Anderegg said, \"they have to store carbon for a pretty long amount of time \u2014 multiple decades to centuries. So if fire's burning them down or insects are wiping out different areas, it could vastly undermine their effectiveness as climate change solutions.\"</p><p>Depending on the model method and the climate scenario, the researchers found that large numbers of carbon offset forest projects, particularly in the Southeastern U.S. and on the West Coast, are projected to lose carbon by the end of the century.</p><p>What we still need to know</p><p>The results highlight that different climate and ecological models have different strengths and weaknesses, and considering them together reveals the areas of research needed to improve climate projections.</p><p>Tree demographic models, for example, include simulations of forest dynamics as old trees die and new trees grow. \"But these current models didn't consider the disturbance-vegetation feedback,\" Wu said, referring to the different types of vegetation besides trees that appear following a disturbance like a forest fire and how they might influence the odds of another disturbance. \"Also they didn't consider CO2 fertilization,\" or the potential for rising carbon dioxide levels to actually improve plant growth.</p><p>The authors identified three research questions that could help elucidate the situation. First is the extent to which plants and trees might benefit from rising CO2 concentrations, as the compound is vital for photosynthesis. Second is a need for better data on climate-driven tree mortality from fire, climate stress and insects to inform their understanding of these threats. Last, scientists need a better account of how biomes will shift. For example, some forests may be able to grow back after a disturbance, but others may transition to grasslands and be lost entirely. \"These are some of the biggest unknowns that the field is really racing to tackle,\" Anderegg said.</p><p>In the meantime, while science works to understand how climate change affects forests, society can help by slowing the pace of climate change. \"Working to tackle climate change as quickly as possible and move to a lower carbon future massively decreases the risks that forests are likely to face in the 21st century,\" Anderegg said, \"and increases the potential benefits that we might get from forests.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUSRVW-117236809</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUSRVW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67YG-F871-JDJN-63PY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417294</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1092\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Buzz Future LLC Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Eurasia Review</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35455\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"04\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>April 7, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

According to news reporting from Seoul, South Korea, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Small check dams are widely used in the Republic of Korea to mitigate and prevent sediment-driven damages by mountain torrents.\" </p><p><br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from National Institute of Forest Science: \"This study aimed to quantify the combined effects of debris-flow impact forces and earth pressures from dam sedimentations on the structural stability of a dam by incorporating the change in the longitudinal profile of the channel bed owing to sediment deposition. A debris-flow simulation model (Hyper Kanako) was used to reproduce the debris-flow behavior from the 2011 Mt. Umyeon landslide (Seoul, The Republic of Korea). Finite element analysis was conducted to analyze the structural stability of the check dam under various debris discharge and sedimentation scenarios. The magnitudes of impact forces that were exerted on the check dam ranged from 81.76 kPa under a non-deposition scenario to 123.04 kPa under a 100% deposition scenario. The resultant tensile and compressive stresses were found to be up to 0.80 and 0.35 MPa, respectively, which were lower than the maximum allowable strengths of the dam, securing sufficient strength for the dam stability.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Overall, the proposed approach can be applied to obtain a better understanding of the resultant internal stresses experienced during debris flow and sediment deposition, thereby providing valuable information for the structural analysis and safety assessment of check dams.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Influence of Debris-Flow Impact on the Structural Stability of Check Dams. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Frontiers in Earth Science</emphasis>, 2022,10.

They concluded that this was either due to a fireball of epic magnitude, or by the heat from droplets of melted rock falling back through the atmosphere in the immediate aftermath of impact.</p><p>Professor Ben Kneller from the University of Aberdeen's School of Geosciences is among the co-authors of this international study, which included scientists from the Autonomous University of Mexico, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, University of Leeds and University of Manchester. The study was supported by Shell Brazil under the Brazilian Government's Science without Borders programme, and published in the journal Scientific Reports.</p><p>Professor Kneller said: \"What triggered these forest wildfires and their extent and timing have been debated for quite a while.</p><p>\"Until now it has not been clear whether the fires were caused as a direct result of the impact or subsequently, as vegetation killed by the post-impact darkness caused by the debris thrown up into the atmosphere was set ablaze by things such as lightning strikes.</p><p>\"By assembling this international team we were able to apply a unique combination of chemical, isotopic, palaeontological, palaeobotanical, chemical and spectroscopic techniques, along with geological mapping, firstly to confirm that the rocks we analysed date precisely from the impact.</p><p>\"We then analysed fossilised bark still attached to the tree trunks to determine the extent of the burning, finding that the bark was already charred as the trees were washed away by the impact-related tsunami. This shows that the fires must have begun within minutes, at most, of impact.</p><p>\"Ultimately our research confirms how and when these devastating fires were begun and paints a vivid and quite terrifying picture of what happened in the immediate aftermath of the meteorite strike.\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>JOURNAL: Scientific Reports <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362327370_Timing_and_causes_of_forest_fire_at_the_K-Pg_boundary\">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362327370_Timing_and_causes_of_forest_fire_at_the_K-Pg_boundary</url></p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abdn.ac.uk/news/16284/\">https://www.abdn.ac.uk/news/16284/</url></p><p>Contact: Robert Turbyne, +44 (0)1224 272014, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:robert.turbyne@abdn.ac.uk\">robert.turbyne@abdn.ac.uk</email></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7938342 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7938342</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66BG-S401-JC11-14FS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"559\"/><timeReceived>9:20 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"09\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>September 8, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This year's theme was \"Leading During Crisis: Culture, Conflict, Collaboration,\" and attracted students from across the country. The conference focused on the challenges of adapting to personal and organizational crises with courage and integrity as an individual and as a leader.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nearly 200 participants, with students from many colleges, universities, and military academies from across the nation including Christopher Newport University, East Tennessee State University, Hampden-Sydney College, Liberty University, Mary Baldwin University, Norwich University, Texas A&amp;M University, The Citadel, U.S. Coast Guard Academy, U.S. Military Academy, University of North Georgia, Virginia Tech, as well as many VMI cadets, gathered to hear inspirational speakers, participate in collaborative activities, and to network. Central to the conference's programming were small group discussions and speakers focusing on crisis leader self-assessment, behavioral adaptability, crisis preparation, communication planning and execution, and building effective teams.</p><p>Maj. Gen. Cedric T. Wins '85, VMI superintendent, welcomed attendees on Monday morning and challenged them to learn how leaders and their followers can build strong teams that anticipate and prepare for the complexity of crises of any kind, whether man-made, natural, or even slowly evolving ones. \"Over the next two days, you will learn about yourselves, and how to examine crisis leadership through culture, preparedness, and response,\" Wins said.</p><p>The speaker kicking off the conference was the H.B. Johnson Jr., Class of 1926 Distinguished Speaker, Eric McNulty, associate director of the National Preparedness Leadership Initiative at Harvard University. McNulty is an expert in leadership, crisis management, and negotiation, and co-author of numerous books, including \"You're It: Crisis, Change, and How to Lead When it Matters Most\" and author of \"Three Critical Shifts in Thinking for the Evolving Leader\" and \"Your Critical First 10 Days as a Leader.\"</p><p>McNulty opened by declaring the world is currently in interesting times - which is a curse. \"We have a war in Europe, the Middle East is on fire, the U.S. has set yet another record for billion dollar-plus disasters resulting from natural hazards, and we've got political polarization.\" He stated that throughout history there are periods of relative calm, instability, and prosperity, and he believes the world is moving toward a time of more disruption. He counseled the students in the audience, that whether they serve in the military or work in the civilian world, they will face a much greater set of disruptions, and as such must master the dimensions of meta leadership.</p><p>Meta leadership as McNulty defined it, is being able to look at the big picture, and take in the broader view. He stated there are three dimensions of meta leadership: the person, the situation, and connectivity. In explaining the first dimension he said, \"We are all different and lead differently, so you need to understand who you are as a leader, be comfortable with yourself, and know your strengths and weaknesses.\" He described great leaders as having character, integrity, and being trustworthy. They listen well and care for others, and invest in the mission and the success of others. He shared a graphic of what he called the \"Double Helix of Self\" with his polished side of self on one side of the helix, where he listed his accomplishments and achievements, and on the other side he listed parts of his life that were disappointments and heartbreaks. \"When you lead, embrace both sides of your helix. That's where your strength comes from, it's who you are, and gives you empathy. Pretending you have no vulnerabilities, makes you more vulnerable,\" he shared.</p><p>In explaining the second dimension of meta leadership -- the situation -- McNulty introduced a diagram called the \"Pop-Doc Loop,\" a continuous process model that flows through six cognitive properties: perceive (seek verifiable evidence, get input from others), orient (look for patterns, discern order from chaos), predict (understand possible future challenges, forecast possible outcomes), decide (make decisions, act), operationalize (What's needed to carry out the decision? What role will partners play?), communicate (provide routine updates, work to understand consequences) and back again to perceive. He explained that the model assumes leaders are not perfect, and it is designed to allow for updates, corrections, and improvements.</p><p>Connectivity, the third dimension of meta leadership, is about bringing people together in unity of purpose and actions. \"Leading is all about trust-based relationships. Keep your emotions and ego under control. Train your people to do their jobs well, and to work together,\" he advised.</p><p>McNulty closed by reminding his listeners of what's not at stake in dealing with stressful crises. \"When I go home at the end of the day, my dog is always there wagging his tail to greet me. He doesn't care if I had a great day or a lousy day, he is just happy to see me. Your family and friends will always be there to love and support you. That is what is truly important.\"</p><p>VMI alumnus Kevin Black '99, veteran U.S. Army officer, executive coach, and strategic advisor, spoke on \"Behavioral Adaptability.\" He opened by asking his audience, \"What is the primary driver for a crisis?\" After a few responses, Black boldly declared, \"It's humans. Think about COVID. The reaction to COVID was worse than COVID itself. Why is the reaction to a crisis always worse than the crisis? Because of human complexity and personality.\"</p><p>To illustrate his point, Black displayed a picture of a multi-layer cake, and listed examples of layers of a human personality. \"Perception, culture, environment, ego, life experiences, religion, philosophy, worldview, psychology, all these factors affect how a person reacts to chaos.\" He continued by noting there are two fundamental orientations to leadership: mission-oriented leaders who are focused on the goal and want to win at all costs, and people-oriented leaders, who are focused on engaging with people and gaining trust through relationships. Every leader has a behavioral profile that leans one way or the other, often changing in a seesaw fashion, depending on the situation.</p><p>Black concluded by stating that everyone is unique and comes to their leadership roles with their own perspectives. \"If we were all tasked with writing a book about sharks, no two books would be the same. Remember that as a leader. The people you lead will all be different, and as a leader, you must be mindful of that with your leadership style.\"</p><p>Jan Rader, retired fire chief for the city of Huntington, West Virginia, and first woman to reach the rank of chief for a career department in the state of West Virginia was the Caroline Dawn Wortham '12 Leadership Speaker. Rader came to national prominence after the release of the short documentary \"Heroin(e)\" by Netflix in September 2017. Then in April of 2018, she was chosen as one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world. She currently serves as director of the Mayor's Council of Public Health and Drug Control Policy in Huntington.</p><p>Rader shared Huntington's history of dealing with the evolving illegal drug trade throughout her career: The pill mill epidemic when a population of their people had become addicted to pain pills; the heroine problem and addicts reusing dirty needles; then the deadly trade of fentanyl and methamphetamines. \"When I started with our fire department we would ride out on emergency calls, do our tasks, put out fires, then all of a sudden we're being called out for overdoses. We wondered what was going on. We didn't understand the big picture that life was changing on our streets,\" she shared. It was at that point she knew she wanted to affect change in drug trafficking in Huntington.</p><p>When Mayor Steve Williams was first elected in 2013, he accompanied the police on many drug raids and witnessed overdoses firsthand. As a result, the city started a program called \"River to Jail.\" \"If a dealer came across the Ohio River into Huntington to sell drugs, they were going to go to jail. Within three months there were 226 arrests, but within two weeks you couldn't tell any arrests have been made. That's how many people were waiting in the wings for their opportunity to sell drugs,\" recalled Rader. It was at that point they changed their strategy and started to work on the demand side of drug trafficking in addition to the supply side, and the mayor began an Office of Drug Control Policy.</p><p>Knowing that Rader was also a nurse, the mayor asked her to become a member of the new agency in addition to her fire chief duties. \"It was me and two others. We traveled 45 minutes from Huntington to visit a Harm Reduction Program. We observed how people were responding to getting clean syringes, wraparound services, referrals to treatment, and help with life in general to make themselves better. Clearly the program was a success. We decided we had to do this for our people, and that was the beginning of the path we went down,\" she reported.</p><p>The office began to keep real time data on tracking overdoses, as well as educating people in the community. \"We met with small groups, no more than 10, and we started with the faith community who welcomed us with open arms. We discovered that faith leaders were struggling with helping members of their congregation, and they wanted help from us. We built a program called 'Faith Community United' to help educate faith leaders on how they could help their members,\" Rader said. The comprehensive program saw positive results with the number of overdoses and deaths due to overdose gradually decreasing each year.</p><p>Another problem Rader encountered was compassion fatigue among the first responders. \"A fire department goes through a lot of wear and tear on their equipment which costs a lot of money, but you can't measure the cost associated with the wear and tear on your people. By looking at our basic data, we calculated that the average firefighter in Huntington in 2017 saw five deaths a month. So we started a wellness program called Compass that is for first responders and run by first responders. They decide what they want, and what they need. I consider it a huge success,\" she stated.</p><p>Rader ended by telling her audience that communication is key. \"You must have good communication skills, listen to your people, and validate what they are experiencing. You must be flexible, and not afraid to fail. Because I've learned a lot more from my failures than I ever did from my successes. Be compassionate, it changes the way you lead when you open your heart and see how everybody else lives.\"</p><p>Two alumni speakers, Bob Foresman '83 and Miguel Monteverde '66 shared practical advice and personal anecdotes in smaller breakout sessions. Foresman has had a career in emergency management and preparedness, and Monteverde had a long career, both in the military and as a civilian, in media relations and crisis communications.</p><p>VMI adjunct professor Dr. Stephen Lowe presented an in-depth case study workshop on the Mann Gulch forest fire in 1949. The interactive session had attendees apply the knowledge gained from earlier speakers to analyze the preparedness, leadership, followership, and communication aspects of the tragedy, in which 12 U.S. Forest Service smokejumpers died. He was joined by former Hotshot smokejumper and current Lexington resident, Christian Duncan.</p><p>The keynote speaker of the event was retired U.S. Navy Cmdr. Kirk Lippold, commanding officer of the USS Cole when it came under terrorist attack by al Qaeda in the port of Aden, Yemen, Oct. 12, 2000, and author of \"Front Burner: Al Qaeda's Attack on the USS Cole.\"</p><p>Lippold relayed his story of what is considered to be one of the most brazen acts of terrorism by al Qaeda prior to 9/11. The large audience was comprised mostly of students who were born well after the ominous event. Lippold's rapid-fire recitation kept listeners hanging on to his every word, and his attention to detail allowed them to visualize themselves on the deck of the ship on that fateful day.</p><p>When Lippold originally took command of USS Cole, he had one year to get the ship ready for deployment. He made sure his crew were all painstakingly well-trained for their specific jobs, so they could respond automatically under a crisis. \"They weren't happy about the intense training I put them through at the time, but two months later when we got hit, they had the competence to know if someone was missing from their station, and the confidence to step up into those now vacant positions. They were able to do what was necessary to save our ship and save our shipmates,\" Lippold stated proudly.</p><p>USS Cole was first deployed to the coast of the former Republic of Yugoslavia to provide support for fourteen days, then on to the Middle East. Because they had been held back for two weeks, in order to reach their destination in time, they had to race across the Mediterranean and down the Red Sea at double the normal speed and burned a lot of gas. They pulled into the port city of Aden, Yemen, for a routine fueling stop. Lippold relayed what happened as his ship was taking on fuel, \"As I'm sitting at my desk at 11:18 in the morning, there was a thunderous explosion. You could feel all 505 feet and 8,400 tons of guided missile destroyer suddenly and violently thrust up and to the right. The ship seemed to hang for a split second before it slipped back down into the water, and rocked from side to side. Power failed, lights went out, ceiling tiles popped out, and a table that had coffee and water on it flipped over. I came up on the balls of my feet and grabbed the underside of my desk in the brace position as everything popped up and slammed back down.\"</p><p>A small bomb-laden boat, had pulled alongside and detonated explosives ripping a 40-foot-wide hole in the ship, killing 17 and injuring 39 crew members.</p><p>Not knowing if the ship would be boarded or if there would be a follow-up attack, Lippold grabbed his personal weapon, loaded it, and left his cabin to survey the damage. \"I took that deep breath and said 'Well this might be your destiny. If you see someone that doesn't belong, duck first and don't leave any round in the chamber,'\" he recalled. Thankfully the terrorists died in the attack, and Lippold did not have to use his weapon.</p><p>He discovered that the uninjured members of his crew had taken it upon themselves to set up a triage center for the injured, provide damage control of the ship, and conduct security watches to make sure no other attacks would occur.</p><p>Lippold's priority was to save the ship. He paused his narrative to advise the audience on making decisions during a crisis. \"You start making decisions based on the best information you have at that moment. As time moves forward and you get better information, and you need to change the decision - change it! Even if it means you have to do a 180-degree change. That's one of the things that has to constantly happen during a crisis. Don't get locked-in and feel you've got to stick with the previous decision.\"</p><p>Lippold contacted the Yemeni Port Authority by radio and asked them for three things to which they readily agreed: freeze all harbor rules, notify local hospitals, and maintain open communication with them. The Yemenis said they would send boats out to get the wounded off and take them to the hospitals, Lippold agreed but warned them, \"You must not come any closer than 100 meters to my port side or I will shoot you.\" The Yemenis said they understood and when the boats started coming out, Lippold observed a very unique phenomenon, \"I don't care where you are in the world, when you tell someone something like that, there is no problem with the English language. Most boats made a huge 300-meter arc around the stern of the ship. We had to get used to boats coming out to us that didn't represent a threat. By the same token the Yemenis had to get used to a very angry, very agitated crew that had broken out every weapon that were locked, loaded, and safeties off: Machine guns, grenade launchers, shotguns, pistols, wrenches, hammers, screwdrivers,\" he quipped. Then very seriously said, \"Whatever it was going to take to defend the ship, we were ready to do it.\"</p><p>At the end of 17 days, the crew had saved their ship, their shipmates, and got the USS Cole underway out of the harbor, and toward the coast, where it would be loaded unto the heavy lift vessel, Blue Marlin. \"As we got towed out by the tug, what did that really signify for us? It was that ability to bounce back. It's that resiliency to get through a major event like this not only to survive, but excel at it. I turned to my executive officer at that moment and told him to play the first song on the PA system, the 'Star Spangled Banner.' I wanted our national anthem echoing across the harbor to send a signal to the Yemeni people that despite what had happened to us, we were leaving with our heads held high. I turned to my executive officer again and said, 'play the second song.' It was the 'Star Spangled Banner' again, but this time it was Jimi Hendrix's rendition.\"</p><p>The USS Cole was repaired in Pascagoula, Mississippi, over a period of two years, and returned to the fleet. It remains an important warship among the surface forces in the Atlantic.</p><p>Next year's Leadership Conference will be held on Oct. 28 - Oct. 29, 2024, with an announcement of the theme and title coming in the spring.

According to news reporting originating from Nanjing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Since remote sensing images of post-fire vegetation are characterized by high resolution, multiple interferences, and high similarities between the background and the target area, it is difficult for existing methods to detect and segment the burned area in these images with sufficient speed and accuracy. In this article, we apply salient object detection (SOD) to burned area segmentation (BAS), the first time this has been done, and propose an efficient burned area segmentation network (BASNet) to improve the performance of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) high-resolution image segmentation.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Project of Construction of UAV Patrol Monitoring System For Forest Fire Prevention in Chongli District of Zhangjiakou, National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), Science and Technology Department of Liaoning Province, State Key Laboratory of Robotics, China. <br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from the College of Information Sciences and Technology, \"BASNet comprises positioning module and refinement module. The positioning module efficiently extracts high-level semantic features and general contextual information via global average pooling layer and convolutional block (CB) to determine the coarse location of the salient region. The refinement module adopts the CB attention module to effectively discriminate the spatial location of objects. In addition, to effectively combine edge information with spatial location information in the lower layer of the network and the high-level semantic information in the deeper layer, we design the residual fusion module to perform feature fusion by level to obtain the prediction results of the network. Extensive experiments on two UAV datasets collected from Chongli in China and Andong in South Korea, demonstrate that our proposed BASNet significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art SOD methods quantitatively and qualitatively.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"BASNet also achieves a promising prediction speed for processing high-resolution UAV images, thus providing wide-ranging applicability in post-disaster monitoring and management.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Basnet: Burned Area Segmentation Network for Real-time Detection of Damage Maps In Remote Sensing Images.

Scientists say fires will begin raging in unpredictable places as the climate warms.</p><p>The findings were published in the journal <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tplants.2022.08.005\">Trends in Plant Science</url></emphasis>.</p><p>Rainforests are wet by definition, which makes them resistant to flames, but when they are destroyed by cyclones, and dry out, fire can begin to spread. For fires to start, fuel needs to burn; the micro-climate must be dry enough and there must be a source of ignition. Cyclones can affect all of these.</p><p>The intense storms originate in the South Pacific and Indian Oceans, and like hurricanes, they unleash gale-force winds and heavy rains.</p><p>With speeds of up to 124 miles per hour, they can do huge damage and cause forest fires. When fast winds blow, they bring down a huge number of trees, leaves, branches, and logs that make great fuel for a fire.</p><p>The wind brings more light into the undergrowth, which can promote the growth of grasses and bushes that also make good fuel.</p><p>All these things damage forest canopies that provide shade from the sun and lock the forest in moisture. When the canopy is opened, it makes the undergrowth drier.</p><p>Cyclones also indirectly increase the risk of human ignition by turning forests into promising places to farm. This is particularly likely where people depend on slash-and-burn farming or forest resources for their livelihoods.</p><p>After cyclones, damaged forests can be burned to make ash beds for planting new crops, as well as for easier access to forest resources.</p><p>Lead study author Thomas Ibanez, a plant ecologist from the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development, said: \"Of course, fire cannot directly affect the likelihood of cyclones, because the cyclones originate from oceans, but they can affect the response of the ecosystem to cyclones. If you have a fire, it can make the trees weaker to resist cyclone winds, or it can kill trees and promote the regrowth of trees that are less resistant to cyclones.\"</p><p>In some areas which have historically had many fires and cyclones, these events are a natural way of maintaining the land.</p><p>Ibanez continued: \"In cyclone-prone regions, there are also ecosystems that are adapted to frequent cyclones and fires, and interactions between these disturbances actually maintain original and species-rich ecosystems. In these ecosystems, human activities that reduce fire, such as land use change and fire suppression, can threaten the stability of the ecosystem and cause biodiversity loss.\"</p><p>As climate change raises the risk of catastrophic weather events and temperatures continue to rise, the storms are expected to reach places they have not in the past.</p><p>\"We would like to better understand how this phenomenon varies by location. We could then predict, which places would be more likely to be affected by these changes.\"</p><p>\"An important component of global change is that ecosystems do not face just one disturbance, but a mix of several disturbances, and the interaction between new disturbances can result in unexpected effects,\" said Ibanez.</p><p>Produced in association with SWNS Talker.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This story was provided to Newsweek by<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.zenger.news/\">Zenger News</url>.</emphasis></emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2135111/forest-fire.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Forest fire</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Philippe Lopez/AFP via Getty Images</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>An employee of the National Forestry Office (ONF) stands in front of piled logs from burnt trees in a forest hit by recent wildfires, near La Teste-de-Buch, southwestern France on September 27, 2022.

Nov. 6, 2023 -The 14th annual Leadership and Ethics Conference at Virginia Military Institute was held Oct. 30-31 in Marshall Hall. This year's theme was \"Leading During Crisis: Culture, Conflict, Collaboration,\" and attracted students from across the country. The conference focused on the challenges of adapting to personal and organizational crises with courage and integrity as an individual and as a leader.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nearly 200 participants, with students from many colleges, universities, and military academies from across the nation including Christopher Newport University, East Tennessee State University, Hampden-Sydney College, Liberty University, Mary Baldwin University, Norwich University, Texas A&amp;M University, The Citadel, U.S. Coast Guard Academy, U.S. Military Academy, University of North Georgia, Virginia Tech, as well as many VMI cadets, gathered to hear inspirational speakers, participate in collaborative activities, and to network. Central to the conference's programming were small group discussions and speakers focusing on crisis leader self-assessment, behavioral adaptability, crisis preparation, communication planning and execution, and building effective teams.</p><p>Maj. Gen. Cedric T. Wins '85, VMI superintendent, welcomed attendees on Monday morning and challenged them to learn how leaders and their followers can build strong teams that anticipate and prepare for the complexity of crises of any kind, whether man-made, natural, or even slowly evolving ones. \"Over the next two days, you will learn about yourselves, and how to examine crisis leadership through culture, preparedness, and response,\" Wins said.</p><p>The speaker kicking off the conference was the H.B. Johnson Jr., Class of 1926 Distinguished Speaker, Eric McNulty, associate director of the National Preparedness Leadership Initiative at Harvard University. McNulty is an expert in leadership, crisis management, and negotiation, and co-author of numerous books, including \"You're It: Crisis, Change, and How to Lead When it Matters Most\" and author of \"Three Critical Shifts in Thinking for the Evolving Leader\" and \"Your Critical First 10 Days as a Leader.\"</p><p>McNulty opened by declaring the world is currently in interesting times - which is a curse. \"We have a war in Europe, the Middle East is on fire, the U.S. has set yet another record for billion dollar-plus disasters resulting from natural hazards, and we've got political polarization.\" He stated that throughout history there are periods of relative calm, instability, and prosperity, and he believes the world is moving toward a time of more disruption. He counseled the students in the audience, that whether they serve in the military or work in the civilian world, they will face a much greater set of disruptions, and as such must master the dimensions of meta leadership.</p><p>Meta leadership as McNulty defined it, is being able to look at the big picture, and take in the broader view. He stated there are three dimensions of meta leadership: the person, the situation, and connectivity. In explaining the first dimension he said, \"We are all different and lead differently, so you need to understand who you are as a leader, be comfortable with yourself, and know your strengths and weaknesses.\" He described great leaders as having character, integrity, and being trustworthy. They listen well and care for others, and invest in the mission and the success of others. He shared a graphic of what he called the \"Double Helix of Self\" with his polished side of self on one side of the helix, where he listed his accomplishments and achievements, and on the other side he listed parts of his life that were disappointments and heartbreaks. \"When you lead, embrace both sides of your helix. That's where your strength comes from, it's who you are, and gives you empathy. Pretending you have no vulnerabilities, makes you more vulnerable,\" he shared.</p><p>In explaining the second dimension of meta leadership - the situation - McNulty introduced a diagram called the \"Pop-Doc Loop,\" a continuous process model that flows through six cognitive properties: perceive (seek verifiable evidence, get input from others), orient (look for patterns, discern order from chaos), predict (understand possible future challenges, forecast possible outcomes), decide (make decisions, act), operationalize (What's needed to carry out the decision? What role will partners play?), communicate (provide routine updates, work to understand consequences) and back again to perceive. He explained that the model assumes leaders are not perfect, and it is designed to allow for updates, corrections, and improvements.</p><p>Connectivity, the third dimension of meta leadership, is about bringing people together in unity of purpose and actions. \"Leading is all about trust-based relationships. Keep your emotions and ego under control. Train your people to do their jobs well, and to work together,\" he advised.</p><p>McNulty closed by reminding his listeners of what's not at stake in dealing with stressful crises. \"When I go home at the end of the day, my dog is always there wagging his tail to greet me. He doesn't care if I had a great day or a lousy day, he is just happy to see me. Your family and friends will always be there to love and support you. That is what is truly important.\"</p><p>VMI alumnus Kevin Black '99, veteran U.S. Army officer, executive coach, and strategic advisor, spoke on \"Behavioral Adaptability.\" He opened by asking his audience, \"What is the primary driver for a crisis?\" After a few responses, Black boldly declared, \"It's humans. Think about COVID. The reaction to COVID was worse than COVID itself. Why is the reaction to a crisis always worse than the crisis? Because of human complexity and personality.\"</p><p>To illustrate his point, Black displayed a picture of a multi-layer cake, and listed examples of layers of a human personality. \"Perception, culture, environment, ego, life experiences, religion, philosophy, worldview, psychology, all these factors affect how a person reacts to chaos.\" He continued by noting there are two fundamental orientations to leadership: mission-oriented leaders who are focused on the goal and want to win at all costs, and people-oriented leaders, who are focused on engaging with people and gaining trust through relationships. Every leader has a behavioral profile that leans one way or the other, often changing in a seesaw fashion, depending on the situation.</p><p>Black concluded by stating that everyone is unique and comes to their leadership roles with their own perspectives. \"If we were all tasked with writing a book about sharks, no two books would be the same. Remember that as a leader. The people you lead will all be different, and as a leader, you must be mindful of that with your leadership style.\"</p><p>Jan Rader, retired fire chief for the city of Huntington, West Virginia, and first woman to reach the rank of chief for a career department in the state of West Virginia was the Caroline Dawn Wortham '12 Leadership Speaker. Rader came to national prominence after the release of the short documentary \"Heroin(e)\" by Netflix in September 2017. Then in April of 2018, she was chosen as one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world. She currently serves as director of the Mayor's Council of Public Health and Drug Control Policy in Huntington.</p><p>Rader shared Huntington's history of dealing with the evolving illegal drug trade throughout her career: The pill mill epidemic when a population of their people had become addicted to pain pills; the heroine problem and addicts reusing dirty needles; then the deadly trade of fentanyl and methamphetamines. \"When I started with our fire department we would ride out on emergency calls, do our tasks, put out fires, then all of a sudden we're being called out for overdoses. We wondered what was going on. We didn't understand the big picture that life was changing on our streets,\" she shared. It was at that point she knew she wanted to affect change in drug trafficking in Huntington.</p><p>When Mayor Steve Williams was first elected in 2013, he accompanied the police on many drug raids and witnessed overdoses firsthand. As a result, the city started a program called \"River to Jail.\" \"If a dealer came across the Ohio River into Huntington to sell drugs, they were going to go to jail. Within three months there were 226 arrests, but within two weeks you couldn't tell any arrests have been made. That's how many people were waiting in the wings for their opportunity to sell drugs,\" recalled Rader. It was at that point they changed their strategy and started to work on the demand side of drug trafficking in addition to the supply side, and the mayor began an Office of Drug Control Policy.</p><p>Knowing that Rader was also a nurse, the mayor asked her to become a member of the new agency in addition to her fire chief duties. \"It was me and two others. We traveled 45 minutes from Huntington to visit a Harm Reduction Program. We observed how people were responding to getting clean syringes, wraparound services, referrals to treatment, and help with life in general to make themselves better. Clearly the program was a success. We decided we had to do this for our people, and that was the beginning of the path we went down,\" she reported.</p><p>The office began to keep real time data on tracking overdoses, as well as educating people in the community. \"We met with small groups, no more than 10, and we started with the faith community who welcomed us with open arms. We discovered that faith leaders were struggling with helping members of their congregation, and they wanted help from us. We built a program called 'Faith Community United' to help educate faith leaders on how they could help their members,\" Rader said. The comprehensive program saw positive results with the number of overdoses and deaths due to overdose gradually decreasing each year.</p><p>Another problem Rader encountered was compassion fatigue among the first responders. \"A fire department goes through a lot of wear and tear on their equipment which costs a lot of money, but you can't measure the cost associated with the wear and tear on your people. By looking at our basic data, we calculated that the average firefighter in Huntington in 2017 saw five deaths a month. So we started a wellness program called Compass that is for first responders and run by first responders. They decide what they want, and what they need. I consider it a huge success,\" she stated.</p><p>Rader ended by telling her audience that communication is key. \"You must have good communication skills, listen to your people, and validate what they are experiencing. You must be flexible, and not afraid to fail. Because I've learned a lot more from my failures than I ever did from my successes. Be compassionate, it changes the way you lead when you open your heart and see how everybody else lives.\"</p><p>Two alumni speakers, Bob Foresman '83 and Miguel Monteverde '66 shared practical advice and personal anecdotes in smaller breakout sessions. Foresman has had a career in emergency management and preparedness, and Monteverde had a long career, both in the military and as a civilian, in media relations and crisis communications.</p><p>VMI adjunct professor Dr. Stephen Lowe presented an in-depth case study workshop on the Mann Gulch forest fire in 1949. The interactive session had attendees apply the knowledge gained from earlier speakers to analyze the preparedness, leadership, followership, and communication aspects of the tragedy, in which 12 U.S. Forest Service smokejumpers died. He was joined by former Hotshot smokejumper and current Lexington resident, Christian Duncan.</p><p>The keynote speaker of the event was retired U.S. Navy Cmdr. Kirk Lippold, commanding officer of the USS Cole when it came under terrorist attack by al Qaeda in the port of Aden, Yemen, Oct. 12, 2000, and author of \"Front Burner: Al Qaeda's Attack on the USS Cole.\"</p><p>Lippold relayed his story of what is considered to be one of the most brazen acts of terrorism by al Qaeda prior to 9/11. The large audience was comprised mostly of students who were born well after the ominous event. Lippold's rapid-fire recitation kept listeners hanging on to his every word, and his attention to detail allowed them to visualize themselves on the deck of the ship on that fateful day.</p><p>When Lippold originally took command of USS Cole, he had one year to get the ship ready for deployment. He made sure his crew were all painstakingly well-trained for their specific jobs, so they could respond automatically under a crisis. \"They weren't happy about the intense training I put them through at the time, but two months later when we got hit, they had the competence to know if someone was missing from their station, and the confidence to step up into those now vacant positions. They were able to do what was necessary to save our ship and save our shipmates,\" Lippold stated proudly.</p><p>USS Cole was first deployed to the coast of the former Republic of Yugoslavia to provide support for fourteen days, then on to the Middle East. Because they had been held back for two weeks, in order to reach their destination in time, they had to race across the Mediterranean and down the Red Sea at double the normal speed and burned a lot of gas. They pulled into the port city of Aden, Yemen, for a routine fueling stop. Lippold relayed what happened as his ship was taking on fuel, \"As I'm sitting at my desk at 11:18 in the morning, there was a thunderous explosion. You could feel all 505 feet and 8,400 tons of guided missile destroyer suddenly and violently thrust up and to the right. The ship seemed to hang for a split second before it slipped back down into the water, and rocked from side to side. Power failed, lights went out, ceiling tiles popped out, and a table that had coffee and water on it flipped over. I came up on the balls of my feet and grabbed the underside of my desk in the brace position as everything popped up and slammed back down.\"</p><p>A small bomb-laden boat, had pulled alongside and detonated explosives ripping a 40-foot-wide hole in the ship, killing 17 and injuring 39 crew members.</p><p>Not knowing if the ship would be boarded or if there would be a follow-up attack, Lippold grabbed his personal weapon, loaded it, and left his cabin to survey the damage. \"I took that deep breath and said 'Well this might be your destiny. If you see someone that doesn't belong, duck first and don't leave any round in the chamber,'\" he recalled. Thankfully the terrorists died in the attack, and Lippold did not have to use his weapon.</p><p>He discovered that the uninjured members of his crew had taken it upon themselves to set up a triage center for the injured, provide damage control of the ship, and conduct security watches to make sure no other attacks would occur.</p><p>Lippold's priority was to save the ship. He paused his narrative to advise the audience on making decisions during a crisis. \"You start making decisions based on the best information you have at that moment. As time moves forward and you get better information, and you need to change the decision - change it! Even if it means you have to do a 180-degree change. That's one of the things that has to constantly happen during a crisis. Don't get locked-in and feel you've got to stick with the previous decision.\"</p><p>Lippold contacted the Yemeni Port Authority by radio and asked them for three things to which they readily agreed: freeze all harbor rules, notify local hospitals, and maintain open communication with them. The Yemenis said they would send boats out to get the wounded off and take them to the hospitals, Lippold agreed but warned them, \"You must not come any closer than 100 meters to my port side or I will shoot you.\" The Yemenis said they understood and when the boats started coming out, Lippold observed a very unique phenomenon, \"I don't care where you are in the world, when you tell someone something like that, there is no problem with the English language. Most boats made a huge 300-meter arc around the stern of the ship. We had to get used to boats coming out to us that didn't represent a threat. By the same token the Yemenis had to get used to a very angry, very agitated crew that had broken out every weapon that were locked, loaded, and safeties off: Machine guns, grenade launchers, shotguns, pistols, wrenches, hammers, screwdrivers,\" he quipped. Then very seriously said, \"Whatever it was going to take to defend the ship, we were ready to do it.\"</p><p>At the end of 17 days, the crew had saved their ship, their shipmates, and got the USS Cole underway out of the harbor, and toward the coast, where it would be loaded unto the heavy lift vessel, Blue Marlin. \"As we got towed out by the tug, what did that really signify for us? It was that ability to bounce back. It's that resiliency to get through a major event like this not only to survive, but excel at it. I turned to my executive officer at that moment and told him to play the first song on the PA system, the 'Star Spangled Banner.' I wanted our national anthem echoing across the harbor to send a signal to the Yemeni people that despite what had happened to us, we were leaving with our heads held high. I turned to my executive officer again and said, 'play the second song.' It was the 'Star Spangled Banner' again, but this time it was Jimi Hendrix's rendition.\"</p><p>The USS Cole was repaired in Pascagoula, Mississippi, over a period of two years, and returned to the fleet. It remains an important warship among the surface forces in the Atlantic.</p><p>Next year's Leadership Conference will be held on Oct. 28 - Oct. 29, 2024, with an announcement of the theme and title coming in the spring.

After years of denying that poor forest management was responsible for the annual escalation in wildfires[2] across his state, he's decided to try something new. He's taking advice from Donald Trump. </p><p><br/><br/>Advice Donald Trump could have picked up from an army of observers, including GraniteGrok[3]. <br/> So, what is this wildfire preventing wisdom? It's about as old as the idea of being proactive about preventing wildfires in the first place if I had to guess. It is also a common-sense forest management technique that works equally well for sluggish corporations, the bureaucracy, and every level of an elected government. <br/> Related: US Forest Fire Data Tampering - They Disappeared 57-Years of Inconvenient Truth[4]. <br/> Clean out the deadwood[5]. <br/>California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) on Thursday announced a deal with state legislature leadership to draw down $536 million to kick off projects to prepare for the upcoming wildfire season. The new plan is in budget legislation Newsom said will be considered by lawmakers as early as Monday and signed by Tuesday. The funds will be used to increase efforts to thin forests, build fuel breaks around vulnerable communities and invest in infrastructure hardening to protect structures. <br/><br/> And just so we're clear as Vodka, maskless at the French Laundry during a lockdown[6], Gavin is still blaming Climate Change. He's just decided that since that's the real problem, and it's causing more wildfires, while we wait to get everyone behind the wheel of one of those even less environmentally friendly and impractical EV's[7], that he'll drop a dime to clear away some downed trees and brush. <br/> You know, just in case that might save a few constituent homes or businesses in the run-up to his recall election.

Actor and prominent Republicanhater[1] Alec Baldwin proved it with his recent rant against cancel culture.On May 14, the Trump-hating[2] actor tweeted[3] out \"Cancel culture is like a forest fire in constant need of fuel. </p><p>Functioning objectively. No prejudice. No code. Just destroy. The deserving and the undeserving alike.' Cancel culture is like a forest fire in constant need of fuel. Functioning objectively. No prejudice. No code. Just destroy. The deserving and the undeserving alike.\u2014 AlecBaldwin (@AlecBaldwln____) May 14, 2021[4]The day before he also tweeted[5] a kind of precursor to this statement reading 'There appears to be a zero tolerance policy for bad behavior everywhere except where it matters most: the US Congress.' That tweet falls more in line with his standard hatred of conservative politicians[6], but it does highlight how hypocritical and pointless 'cancelling' people tends to be.Of  course, Alec Baldwin has called out cancel culture before, specifically the kind[7] that could have threatened New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. Back in March, he posted a 14-minute rant against cancel culture, before finally deleting it and uploading a shorter, calmer retort.Baldwin himself has been on the verge of being cancelled for years with his awful behavior towards anyone ranging from reporters to airline crew members. However, he still remains shockingly relevant[8], even as his own wife came under controversy[9] about her Spanish heritage.Perhaps he's trying to get a head start before the mob finally comes for him. After all, it's only inevitable.

Spencer Cox and President and Founder of the American Conservation Coalition Benji Backer were panelists for the Climate Innovation in a Red State Forum to discuss environmental action topics such as bipartisanship, active management and power plant permitting.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Hinckley Institute of Politics hosted the forum.</p><p>The American Conservation Coalition is a non-profit organization that mobilizes young people to take environmental action through principles like capitalism, localism and innovation. Its website says everyone should feel empowered to discuss conservation, clean energy, sportsmen's rights, agriculture and climate, through the lens of conservative ideals such as market-based competition and limited government.\u00a0</p><p>Backer said Republicans have not had a seat at the table when it comes to environmental action. \"We're trying to mobilize the younger generation of center and right of center people to show that it's okay to engage on this, that it's actually beneficial to engage on it,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p>Backer added that conservatives love the environment, but the rhetoric in recent years hasn't been good. \"I think it's up to young people to say, 'look, these environmental issues, these climate issues, they are much more important than [a] political party.'\"\u00a0</p><p>Climate change is a contentious issue between Republicans and Democrats. However, Cox believes mineral extraction is key to forging the future of renewable energy sources and political bipartisanship. \"This is an area where the right and left can come together: mineral extraction,\" he said during the forum. \"If\u00a0 you want electric vehicles, battery-powered, whatever, we need these minerals and right now you can only get them from China.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"Liberal governors know we need this stuff, the Republican governors are excited to help them get this stuff,\" he added. \"If you are on the left, I hope you will see the wisdom and the goodness in having people on the right engaged in this issue even if you don't agree with 100% of what they're trying to do, or the solutions. I think it's really necessary.\"\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\"We want the days of climate denial on the right to be over. We want the days of climate conversation and climate dialogue and climate debate to begin,\" Backer said. \"It can't just be in D.C., it has to be outside of D.C., in real America, and Utah is really important for that.\"</p><p>Forest Treatment, Wildfires, Active Management\u00a0</p><p>Western states face devastating wildfires and forest fires each year, affecting air quality and watersheds.\u00a0</p><p>Cox said Utah has engaged in small-scale tree thinning projects and forest treating to help prevent wildfires. He said pine trees, pinyon trees and juniper trees use a lot of water, so getting rid of them can help preserve the forests.</p><p>He added the difference between treated forests versus untreated forests is substantial when it comes to wildfire devastation. \"When the fires do come in those [untreated] areas, some adjacent areas, they burn much hotter and are much more devastating,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Backer said forest management is important when trying to reduce emissions. He said, \"what we do with electric vehicles and solar panels, and transmission and other renewables, it will not matter if we don't get the forest fire situation figured out.\"\u00a0</p><p>Salt Lake City Councilwoman Dea Theodore cited that a large portion of the 7.6 billion trees within Utah forests are largely overgrown and unhealthy. Tree thinning is a process of cutting down unhealthy trees to preserve forest health. \"The thinning of overgrowth in the Great Salt Lake Basin would restore over 1.5 million acre-feet of water per year to the Great Salt Lake; enough to have the Lake on its way to restored water levels over the next 5 years,\" she said in a letter to the governor and legislative leadership in January.\u00a0</p><p>NEPA and Power Plant Permits</p><p>The National Environmental Policy Act works to make decisions on permitting applications for the construction of power plants, and federal land actions along with the construction of highways and other publicly operated facilities.\u00a0</p><p>Cox said while he was at the White House a few weeks ago, he and President Biden discussed permitting reforms. \"He's very frustrated because the laws that have been set up to protect the environment are now making it impossible to do the things that we know are going to help,\" he added.\u00a0</p><p>The permitting process is widely viewed by both Republican and Democratic politicians and environmental organizations as too drawn out and delaying the construction of renewable energy power plants.</p><p>\"It can take us 10 to 12 years to get the permits we need going through the NEPA process now,\" Cox said. \"We need shot clocks on decisions that need to be made that can just be punted - it can take years just to get those decisions that will then be litigated.\"</p><p>Backer added that regulations enforced by NEPA hamper development of solar and other renewable energy projects. \"They're all just sitting there in a queue, like a Spotify queue, but you're not pressing play and the government is not pressing play, and we're not getting anywhere,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p>The ACC, which Backer founded, will be holding its second summit in Salt Lake City, June 15-17. Backer says Salt Lake City is a prime location for conservatives to meet about environmentalism with the additional asset of being in a red state.</p><p>\"Republicans' narrative on this has been hard to grapple with over the last couple of years or decades,\" he said. \"But that's literally why ACC exists is to rebuild that bridge that used to be there in the environment.\"</p><p>@vanessachrony</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5486206</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67NJ-25S1-JBSN-30M0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"930\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Utah Chronicle: University of Utah</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"02\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>February 28, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Salt Lake City</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>UT</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkQ4RkY4MDdCOUQ4NEQ3QUFDQkQ0NEFDNDE0MjNDQ0I7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDAzNzc2QzlDN0ZENDAwNTg5MTkzNUJFMjc1QUEwQjg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp;

Their poor forest management is on your shoulders as well. </p><p>Sound familiar?Related: If a Leftist Yells 'Forest Fire!' In a Crowded Social Media Group Show Them This[2] Democrat California, where police protection is now a luxury alongside housing, and electricity, was already 'on fire.' Its massive tracts of untended woodlands are always waiting to burn. And every year, we get the same story. It gets dry, someone gets careless, and millions of acres choked with dead wood lights up like a Christmas tree. That's your fault and you should be made to pay. I know, how could people, even Democrats in New Hampshire - which is about 90% forested - during a drought, not be a feature of Nancy Pelosi's talking points on Climate Change? Forced to evacuate their homes, leaving behind their 20,000 dollar twin fridges to run from our angry earth-mother. Why are Granite Stater's not suffering from out-of-control climate-induced wild-fires? The simplest answer to the New Hampshire question is that Democrats have not often run the state nor for very long. Were we to succumb to the Northeastern trend and allow our state to become a perpetual LZ for Long-term left-wing leadership, we too could be on television every night\u2014wide shots of smoke-filled skies with glowing nighttime horizons. Another sad tale told by idiots about left-wing idiots who made it all possible. Because none of this has anything to do with earth mothers or even middle-class families driving cars big enough to carry them home to three and four-bedroom Colonials (with central air), it has to do with Democrats. It's not systemic racism, nor is it global warming climate change. It's Democrats. They are either doing it on purpose or systemically incompetent. In either case, they destroy everything they touch. Yes, you can help prevent forest fires, rolling blackouts, rioting-cities, and even systemic racism, but to do that, you have to stop electing democrats. Connect the dots.

According to news originating from Henan, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"The application of wireless sensor network (WSN) technology promotes the modernization of forestry.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Henan Province Teaching Reform Project. <br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Henan University of Urban Construction: \"WSN application technology in forest areas is an important research topic for the sustainable development of forestry in China and is also a research hotspot for forestry ecological monitoring at present. The application of wireless sensor networks in forest areas, first of all, solves the problem of limited energy supply and low-latency data transmission in the forest environment. Due to the large area of the forest environment and uneven tree density, dynamic changes in forest height, easy to block the signal, and other characteristics, the forest environment is prone to node energy depletion fast, the network life cycle is short, and data transmission delays large dilemma. Second, the application of wireless sensor networks is usually centered on maximum data acquisition, but the contradiction between high data acquisition rate and limited energy supply is inevitable, so it is necessary to construct a maximum data acquisition rate model with limited energy supply as a constraint to guarantee the optimal acquisition conditions for wireless sensor networks. In this paper, from the application of wireless sensor network technology in forest environment, the research on the application of wireless sensor network in forestry is carried out around the analysis of energy self-collection permanent function of sensor nodes, sensor node transmission routing strategy, data collection, fusion, and fuzzy inference decision-making fire danger warning process, so as to provide a solution to the overall problem of forest fire warning based on rechargeable wireless sensor network. In this paper, we analyze the dynamic replenishment of energy in rechargeable wireless sensor networks and propose an energy-based transmission control protocol that effectively improves data transmission efficiency.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"In the rechargeable wireless sensor network, the network E2E (end-to-end) average delay time is calculated based on the number of nodes on the data transmission link. The research idea of this paper starts from the application technology of wireless sensor network in the forest environment, and the design of the energy self-collection permanent function of sensor nodes, sensor node transmission routing strategy, data collection, fusion, and fuzzy inference decision fire danger warning process are realized vertically.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Construction of Landscape Ecological Planning Evaluation Model Based on Sensor Network.

Harriet Hageman:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For the second year in a row, Wyoming is being shut out from U.S. Department of Agriculture programs that offer wildfire protection services.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was recently announced Wyoming is not being included in the USDA and U.S. Forest Service's 10-year strategy to combat wildfires across the American West in 2023. Wyoming is the only Western state that has been left out of the strategy since its inception.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wyoming has also been left off a recently formed Congressionally mandated wildfire commission. It was the second year in a row for both snubs.</p><p>The 10-year strategy unveiled in 2022 involves increasing resources to reduce wildfire risks in areas known as \"firesheds,\" large, forested landscapes with a high likelihood for ignition that puts nearby homes, communities and wildlife habitat at risk. According to the USDA, the 10-year strategy treats up to 20 million acres of national forests and grasslands and up to 30 million acres on other federal, state, tribal, private and family lands. In total, USDA is investing $930 million across 45 million acres, but not a penny has been devoted to Wyoming yet.</p><p>Luke Hawkins is the board chairman for Albany County Fire District 1. His department was part of the 426 firefighters who responded to the 2020 Mullen 'megafire' 38 miles outside Laramie, which devastated more than 175,000 acres in the Medicine Bow-Routt national forests.</p><p>\"It is disappointing to learn we have been left out of the 10-year plans,\" Hawkins told Cowboy State Daily on Friday. \"Such fires as the Mullen Megafire that have occurred within our fire district areas have long and lasting financial impacts on our limited resources. We ask for considerations as we continue to strive to serve our communities on uphill battles of sustainable resources.\"</p><p>The USDA did not respond to Cowboy State Daily's request for comment.</p><p>In a Wednesday letter, WyomingU.S. Sens. John Barrasso, Cynthia Lummis and Rep. Harriet Hageman blasted USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack and U.S. Forest Service Chief Randy Moore.</p><p>\"While we strongly and unequivocally support efforts to increase the proactive management of national forests, we are deeply concerned with the continued exclusion of our great state of Wyoming from this strategy,\" the letter reads. \"We therefore urge the USDA and Forest Service to better defend Wyoming's forests and rangelands by including them in the 10-year strategy, as well as broader agency efforts to combat wildfires.\"</p><p>Hawkins said he appreciates the letter and said an investment through the 10-year strategy, in some regions totaling as much as $273 million in 2023, would impact the Albany County community.</p><p>U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis, U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman, U.S. Sen. John Barrasso</p><p>Behind The Snub</p><p>Gaby Hurt, a spokesperson for Barrasso, said the senator has never received an answer as to why Wyoming has been left out of these programs. Wyoming is often at odds with President Joe Biden's administration and supported his 2020 opponent, former President Donald Trump, with a larger margin of the vote than any other state.</p><p>The USDA and Forest Service have announced significant investments in 21 areas connected to firesheds.</p><p>The Forest Service has identified a small quantity of Wyoming lands to be a high-risk fireshed, in the Bridger-Teton National Forest outside Jackson and a small section of the Black Hills National Forest in Northeast Wyoming. The delegation does not agree with this determination.</p><p>\"Like the rest of the West, Wyoming is incredibly vulnerable to catastrophic wildfire,\" the delegation writes.</p><p>Bill Mayer, deputy fire management officer for Teton Interagency Fire, said he could double his staff and still have more than enough fire mitigation work to do in Grand Teton National Park. His biggest challenge is not finding employees, but finding affordable housing for them to live in, an ever-growing problem in Jackson and Teton County.</p><p>\"We can't hire employees because there's no housing for them,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, the trees grow faster than the housing.\"</p><p>A forest fire blazes out of control less than 2 miles from West Yellowstone in Yellowstone National Park in 1988. (AP File Photo/Tannen Maury)</p><p>Past Burns</p><p>Over the past five years, Wyoming experienced numerous destructive burns, including four wildfires severe enough to receive emergency assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</p><p>There were also thousands of acres that burned in the rangelands of Carbon County as a result of the Mullen Megafire.</p><p>In 2018, thousands of acres burned in the Bridger-Teton and Medicine Bow national forests in the Roosevelt and Badger Creek fires.</p><p>There was also a particularly destructive fire near the Northwestern Wyoming border in Montana in 2021.</p><p>In general, 4 million acres of Wyoming land are considered at a \"high\" or \"very high\" risk for catastrophic wildfire, according to recent Forest Service estimates. Drought conditions over the last few decades have wreaked havoc on many Wyoming communities bordering forests and wilderness areas, with major wildfires occurring at a much more frequent rate than historical norms.</p><p>Forest Service data suggests that a\" of all national forest lands in America are at severe risk for devastating wildfires.</p><p>\"These fires wreaked havoc on our forests and our communities,\" the delegation writes. \"Lives and livelihoods were upended; precious natural resources and critical infrastructure went up in smoke.\"</p><p>Wyoming is also the only Western state to lack representation on the Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management Commission. The commission makes federal policy recommendations and strategies to improve wildfire prevention, management, and suppression.

No casualties have been reported so far from the blaze, which has consumed a total of 1,260 hectares so far. <br/>A local man was under investigation for accidentally starting the fire when a metal part of his trailer touched the road, sending off sparks that ignited the dried vegetation. <br/>To limit such risks in eastern France, police said on Saturday they were banning entry to all but residents in most forests in the Bas-Rhin region near the German border. <br/>Meanwhile in the southwestern Gironde region around Bordeaux, a huge fire that had flared on Tuesday was under control after rain fell overnight, a senior official said. <br/>\"The night was favourable to us, since as you know, we had rain and very little wind.... The fire is now contained,\" Ronan Leaustic, deputy prefect of Arcachon commune, told reporters on Sunday. <br/>He added that 8,000 residents forced to evacuate could now return home. <br/>There was further relief after a fire in the eastern department of Jura that destroyed over 1,000 hecatres was brought under control. <br/>Arnaud Mendousse, of Gironde fire and rescue, said earlier there had been between 10 and 30 mm of rain in the region but on \"terrain that is extremely dry\". <br/>\"We know that this offers a respite but does not signify an end to the fight. We know that if it does not rain in the next 48 to 72 hours the risk will increase considerably.\" <br/>He said the humidity level has gone up and the temperature was relatively low at around 25 degrees Celsius, (77 degrees Fahrenheit) but warned: \"The fire is not completely out and the soil remains extremely hot.\" <br/>Meteo France was forecasting lower temperatures and rain and thunderstorms for most of the country on Sunday. <br/>In the northwest, in the legendary Broceliande forest in region of Brittany -- where King Arthur roamed and where wildfires are normally rare -- a fire was contained after rain fell overnight, but remained under watch after devastating 400 hectares, officials said.  <br/>EU members including Germany, Poland, Austria and Romania have sent reinforcement to France to help battle blazes and several water-bombing planes from the European Union fleet have also joined firefighting efforts. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767166049223594125976100118</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6656-D831-JCMN-Y3M1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484255</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"511\"/><timeReceived>3:50 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 14, 2022 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>World</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Or perhaps hundreds of them, heaped as high as your head and strewn about the forest like Viking funeral pyres awaiting a flame. </p><p><br/>These slash piles are an increasingly common sight in the American West, as land managers work to thin out unnaturally dense sections of forests \u2014 the result of a commitment to fire suppression that has inadvertently increased the risk of devastating megafires. <br/>'We have an epidemic of trees in Colorado,' said Stefan Reinold, a forester with Boulder County's Parks and Open Space department. In the Rocky Mountain forests that he manages, a century of stamping out wildfires as soon as they arose failed to account for the role fire plays in maintaining healthy forest ecosystems. Today, the resulting abundance of densely packed pines and firs fuels huge blazes.  <br/>In response, the federal government has committed nearly$5 billion[1]in the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to thinning forests on about50 million Western acres[2]over the next 10 years. Although this can be accomplished with prescribed burns, the risk of controlled fires getting out of hand has foresters embracing another solution: selectively sawing trees, then stripping the limbs from their trunks and collecting the debris. <br/>Overgrown stands of lodgepole pine are a risk for megafires. Thinning the stands simulates the effects of a natural fire but also generates a large amount of biomass, called 'slash,' which can also fuel forest fires.  <br/>The challenge now is what to do with all those piles of sticks, which create fire hazards of their own. Some environmental scientists believe they have an answer: mushrooms. Fungus has an uncommon knack for transformation. Give it garbage, plastic, even corpses, and it will convert them all into something else \u2014 for instance, nutrient-rich soil. <br/>Down where the Rocky Mountains meet the plains, in pockets of forest west of Denver, mycologists likeZach Hedstrom[3]are harnessing this unique trait to transform fire fuel into a valuable asset for local agriculture. <br/>For Hedstrom, the idea sprung from an experiment on a local organic vegetable farm. He and the farm owner had introduced a native oyster mushroom to wood chips from a tree that fell in a windstorm. 'That experiment showed us that the native fungi were helping to accelerate the decomposition really substantially,' he said. Working with local governments, environmental coalitions, and farmers, he is now honing the method. <br/>Inside Boulder Mushroom's laboratory, a refrigerator houses an array of agar plates containing diverse mycelium cultures.  <br/>As part of its regional strategy, the U.S. Forest Service plans to thin more than 47 square miles \u2014 an area larger than Disney World \u2014 along Colorado's Front Range.Hundreds of thousands[4]of slash piles already lay in wait here until conditions are right for burning. Ideally, this means snow on the ground, moisture in the air, and little wind. It can be a hard recipe to come by. <br/>When slash piles are set alight, they burn longer and hotter than most wildfires over a concentrated area. This leaves behind blistered soil where native vegetation strugglesfor decades[5]to take root. As an alternative, foresters have tried chipping trees on-site and broadcasting the mulch across the forest floor, where it degrades at a snail's pace in the arid climate. Boulder County also carts some of its slash to biomass heating systems at two public buildings. 'We're removing a ton of wood out of forests for fire mitigation,' Hedstrom said. 'This is not a super sustainable way of managing it.' <br/>He hopes to show that fungi can do it better. <br/>Jeffrey Ravage is a forester with theCoalition for the Upper South Platte[6], which manages protection and restoration of a more-than-million-acre watershed in the mountains southwest of Denver. He describes the action of saprophytes, a type of fungi that feeds off dead organic matter, as 'cold fire.' <br/>'We can do in five years what nature could take 50 years to a century to do: create organic soil.' Jeffrey Ravage <br/>Like a flame, saprophytic fungi break organic material into carbon compounds. Mycelium, the often unseen, root-like structure of the fungi, secretes digestive enzymes that release nutrients from the substrate it consumes. Whereas a flame destroys nearly all organic nitrogen, mycelium can fortify nitrogen where it's needed in the forest floor. <br/>'We do hundreds to thousands of acres of fire mitigation a year,' Ravage said. <br/>Standard thinning costs somewhere around $3,000 per acre, about a third of which is spent hauling out or burning the slash. Using mycelium could drastically reduce that cost. With the right kind of fungi, Ravage said, 'we can do in five years what nature could take 50 years to a century to do: create organic soil.' <br/> Subscribe to FERN's Newsletter  <br/>Though the method is new, it's not untried. At theBalcones Canyonlands Preserve,[7]north of Austin, Texas, biologist Lisa O'Donnelldeploys[8]mycelium to combat invasive glossy privet that spills over from surrounding urban sprawl. After the intrusive trees are cut and piled, volunteers inoculate \u2014 or seed \u2014 them with native turkey tail fungi, which take about three years to transform hard logs into crumbly sponges. <br/>Eventually, the woody material breaks down into a rich and water-retentive loam that O'Donnell uses to rebuild the Balcones' deteriorated soils. 'You don't have to burn it or haul it out. You're using that biomass, keeping it in place and recycling it,' she said. 'You're turning a negative into a positive.' <br/>For mycelium to be a truly viable solution to wildfires, however, it would have to work at the scale of the Western landscape. Hedstrom is experimenting with brewing mycelium into a liquid that can be sprayed across hundreds of acres. 'It's a novel biotech solution that has great promise but is in the early stages,' he said. <br/>Ravage doubts it could be so easy. 'Half the battle is how you target the slash,' he said. Success stories like the Balcones are rare. Ravage has spent a decade cultivating wild saprophytes and perfecting methods of applying them in Colorado's forests. <br/>He begins by mulching slash to give his fungi a head start. Then he seeds the mulch with spawn, or spores that have already begun growing on blocks of the same material, and wets them down. Fungi require damp conditions and will survive in the mulch if it is piled deeply enough. Given the changing character of Western forests, however, aridity poses a serious hurdle. <br/>Some Colorado farmers are using Hedstrom's fungi to turn forest slash into organic soil. It's a cheaper and more climate-friendly alternative to trucking in compost from Vermont. <br/>At his lab in the Rockies, Ravage grows about a ton of spawn annually. To meet the demands of forest-fire mitigation, he wants to produce 12 tons every week. This presents an opportunity for intrepid mushroom farmers, should the government choose to fund them, but it's not the only way agriculture could benefit. 'There's going to be a lot of wood chip waste continuously coming out of the forest,' saidAndy Breiter[9], a rancher in Boulder County. 'We can use those resources.' <br/>Some Front Range farmers pay to truck in compost from Vermont. Instead of adding synthetic fertilizers or importing compost, Breiter is using Hedstrom's mycelium to turn forest slashinto organic soil[10]that he can work into his degraded land. 'I'm trying to increase the productivity of my land while recognizing that past systems of productivity created these problems to begin with,' Breiter said. <br/> This article was produced in collaboration with The Washington Post.

The payment is the first of three under the country's Emission Reductions Payment Agreement (ERPA) with the FCPF. It is on track to unlock up to $60 million for the reduction of up to 12 million tons of CO2 emissions by the end of 2025.</p><p>To receive the first payment, Costa Rica's Ministry of Environment and Energy submitted an official monitoring report confirming the emission reductions were achieved and a thorough independent third-party validation and verification were conducted. The country has successfully reversed deforestation and forest degradation, with forests now covering nearly 60 percent of its territory.</p><p>\"We congratulate Costa Rica for being the first country in the region to successfully complete all the necessary steps to receive the first ERPA payment, and we look forward to continued collaboration on green growth, blue economy, and climate action,\" said Carine Clert, World Bank Country Manager for Costa Rica and El Salvador. \"Costa Rica is showing how sustainable management of natural assets can strengthen the inclusive growth that is so necessary for post-pandemic economic recovery,\" she added. The first payment will be used to strengthen the implementation of financing mechanisms operated by the Fondo Nacional de Financiamiento Forestal and activities carried out by the Sistema Nacional de Areas de Conservacion. A Benefit Sharing Plan (BSP) underpins the ERPA and ensures all participating stakeholders, including indigenous peoples and local communities are fairly recognized and rewarded for their role in reducing emissions, particularly vulnerable groups, such as women, youth, forest owners, holders of non-registered lands, and forest fire fighters.</p><p>Costa Rica's Emission Reductions Program aims to increase the nationwide impact of public policies that have worked over the last 30 years to protect the country's forest landscapes, which stretch across more than half of Costa Rica's 5.1 million hectares. This includes strengthening the governance of national protected areas, which cover 26 percent of the country's territory, and expanding national programs for sustainable forest management, fire management, and landscape restoration. It also aims to expand the country's Payment for Environmental Services program, which provides incentives to farmers or landowners in exchange for managing their land to provide an ecological service and promote forest conservation and carbon stock enhancement through reforestation, tree plantations, agroforestry, and silvopastoral systems.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2022/08/16/-costa-rica-receives-first-emission-reductions-payment-from-forest-carbon-partnership-facility\">https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2022/08/16/-costa-rica-receives-first-emission-reductions-payment-from-forest-carbon-partnership-facility</url></p><p>Contact: Cynthia Flores Mora, (506) 72989160, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:cfloresmora@worldbank.org\">cfloresmora@worldbank.org</email>;

These critical investments ensure all Washingtonians benefit from the economic recovery by making health care and prescription drugs more affordable, creating millions of green jobs, lowering energy costs and combating climate change,\" said Larsen.</p><p>The IRA addresses many of Larsen's priorities to lower costs for working families and seniors and combat climate change, including:</p><p>Lowering the Cost of Prescription Drugs and Health Care</p><p>-</p><p>Enables Medicare to directly negotiate the price of prescription drugs with drug companies</p><p>-</p><p>Caps out-of-pocket prescription drug costs at $2,000 per year for Medicare beneficiaries</p><p>-</p><p>Caps insulin copays at $35 per month for Medicare beneficiaries</p><p>-</p><p>Extends for three years the Affordable Care Act tax credits included in the American Rescue Plan that enabled 11,000 more people in the Second District and 95,000 people statewide to newly enroll in affordable health insurance plans.</p><p>Delivering the Largest Investment to Combat Climate Change in U.S. History</p><p>-</p><p>Taken together, provisions in the bill will reduce carbon emissions by roughly 40 percent by 2030 .</p><p>-</p><p>Invests in domestic energy production and manufacturing, including:</p><p>o $27 billion to support deployment of technologies to reduce carbon emissions , especially in disadvantaged communities</p><p>o $5 billion to support healthy forests, forest fire resiliency, forest conservation and urban tree planting</p><p>o $3 billion to support the purchase and installation of zero-emission equipment and technology at ports like the Port of Everett</p><p>o $3 billion for the U.S. Postal Service to purchase zero-emission vehicles</p><p>o $2.6 billion to conserve and restore coastal habitats around Puget Sound and other marine ecosystems</p><p>o $1 billion for cleaner heavy-duty vehicles like school and transit buses and garbage trucks</p><p>o $300 million to speed up production and adoption of cleaner aviation fuel</p><p>o Consumers will receive discounts for electric vehicles at the point of sale , rather than waiting for a tax credit rebate.</p><p>Lowering the Deficit and Making Biggest Corporations Pay Their Fair Share</p><p>-</p><p>Makes a historic down payment on deficit reduction of approximately $300 billion</p><p>-</p><p>Strengthens IRS enforcement against wealthy tax cheats and closes tax loopholes exploited by the wealthiest few</p><p>-</p><p>Implements a 15 percent corporate minimum tax which applies only to the 150 corporations earning over $1 billion in profits that pay less than 15 percent in taxes</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125387860</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:664W-PSC1-DYTH-G24N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"497\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 12, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It was also written by members of the LGBTQ+ community.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For the past 33 years, America has annually celebrated the LGBTQ+ community's bravery Oct. 11, National Coming Out Day. \u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Coming out refers to the act of someone telling others that they identify with some aspect of the LGBTQ+ community. National Coming Out Day was formally recognized nationally\u00a0in 1989 after the second national March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights.\u00a0</p><p>National Coming Out Day falls in the middle of October which is recognized as LGBTQ+ History Month. Rodney Wilson, a high school teacher from Missouri, thought it was important for LGBTQ+ history to be shared in schools, so he started this initiative in 1994. The Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network released a statement saying that \"LGBT History Month is an opportunity for educators to teach students about [LGBT] history and events.\"</p><p>In honor of National Coming Out Day, here are some creative ways you can come out of the closet with your own personal soundtrack: \u00a0</p><p>Lesbian - Buy a whole new car. A Subaru, specifically. And blare girl in red. That'll really help get the point across.\u00a0</p><p>Music Rec: \"Girls Like Girls\" by Hayley Kiyoko, \"Like Real People Do\" by Hozier\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Gay - Have you ever seen \"Legally Blonde?\" Elle Woods said it best, \"Gay men know designers, straight men don't,\" so start showing off your knowledge by pointing out last-season Prada and out-of-date Gucci.\u00a0</p><p>Music Rec: \"My Boy\" by Car Seat Headrest, \"Predatory Wasp of the Palisades\" by Sufjan Stevens\u00a0</p><p>Bisexual - Just start cuffing your jeans, wearing converse and drinking iced chai lattes with oat milk. Eventually, someone will get the hint.
