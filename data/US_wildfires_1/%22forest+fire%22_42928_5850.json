Statewide, Alaska is experiencing higher temperature trends that can cause drying, which in turn can spell more frequent and intense fires.</p><p>And on top of that, climate change is causing vegetation in the region to change. With warmer seasons, the soil thaws earlier, and different plants begin to grow there, Fresco said.</p><p>In some areas where once not-flammable lichen and moss grew, there might be more flammable grass and shrubs growing instead. So when lightning strikes, it's more likely to lead to a fire, and a fire that spreads, she said.</p><p>Tundra environments are vastly different around the state - in Utqiagvik, there is nothing that grows taller than a person's calf, while in the Southwest region, willow and alder thickets grow some 10-feet high, Thoman said.</p><p>Thoman also noted the western spread of the state's boreal forest - meaning that over the long term, a tundra fire in Southwest Alaska may just be considered a forest fire, with warmer summers able to support tree growth.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/rural-alaska/2022/06/13/st-marys-residents-pitch-in-to-help-protect-their-village-from-a-historic-tundra-wildfire/\">St. Mary's residents pitch in to help protect their village from a historic tundra wildfire</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">]</emphasis></p><p>The trend of increasing tundra wildfires isn't playing out the same around the state. Thoman said the increases are concentrated in tundra areas of Southwest Alaska and in the Noatak Valley, but the Seward Peninsula and North Slope aren't showing the same uptick, though it's not clear why.</p><p>While Fresco's fire modeling can't say where and when future fires will burn in a precise way, she said it points to more severe fire years, particularly in tundra areas.</p><p>\"It's extremely difficult to predict exactly when some of those more severe fire years might occur,\" Fresco said. \"But, certainly for tundra areas, the trend is towards greater risk of fire.\"</p><p>Fresco said whileit can be hard for people to look at research that predicts bad news, there's a positive side: It empowers people to plan and toask how communities can get ready, she said.</p><p>\"It's important to think about this statewide and to think how larger communities can help and support smaller communities in dealing with risk and then planning for risk,\" Fresco said. \"Because we're all in this together.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.adn.com/resizer/Q3xcBA4Xoho-5AN0rNpux3ObQes=/800x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/adn/H4PL3X5QNZBIBGTM2TKUROXTWY.jpg\">See image link</url><br/>Apoon Pass Fire burns through the tundra June 11, 2022.

Christopher T. Sununu has issued a proclamation that bans both outdoor burning and smoking in and near New Hampshire woodlands statewide due to the extremely high danger of wildfires that threaten the state.</p><p>The emergency ban became effective immediately upon his signature and will remain in effect until fire danger conditions change significantly.</p><p>The Executive Council has endorsed the proclamation.</p><p>\"This ban is necessary to protect New Hampshire from the very serious fire danger threat currently affecting our state,\" said Chief Steven Sherman of the N.H Forest Protection Bureau. \"While the restrictions may be a slight inconvenience to some, we must work together to protect lives, property and our natural resources from the imminent threat of wildfires.</p><p>\"The persistent and expanding impacts of the drought across New Hampshire, coupled with the fall season, are creating dangerous conditions for wildfires to occur. Fire departments have been fighting remote fires across the region, and with dry conditions and a lack of water, any open flame poses a hazard to our state at this time.\"</p><p>The Governor's proclamation bans the following:</p><p>kindling of open fire, including fires built for camping, the burning of debris, or warming, on all public trails or other public property, excluding public campgrounds; and</p><p>kindling of Category 3 fires; a fire greater than 4 feet in diameter or a fire not contained within a ring of fire resistive material; and</p><p>smoking a pipe, cigar and/or cigarette outdoors in or near public woodlands or on public trails; and</p><p>kindling of Category 1 and 2 \"campfires\"; those not contained within a ring of fire resistive material or in a portable fire place.</p><p>The proclamation does not ban the use of propane or liquid-fueled grills or camping stoves.</p><p>An infraction of the burning ban is a violation level offense which may result in a warning, violation or administrative summons with fine amounts from $124 to $1,000. In addition, anyone responsible for starting a wildfire is liable for the cost of suppressing the fire.</p><p>The U.S. Forest Service has additional restrictions on national forest lands. Citizens and visitors should contact the White Mountain National Forest Headquarters in Campton for additional information.</p><p>New Hampshire's Forest Protection Bureau is responsible for protecting the state's more than 4.5 million acres of both public and private forestlands from threats posed by wildland fire and forest-related crimes.</p><p>Protection from wildland fires is accomplished through a system of forest fire lookout towers, aerial surveillance, forest fire wardens, local fire departments and forest rangers working cooperatively to enforce fire protection laws and provide assistance with incident management and wildfire suppression.</p><p>On average, New Hampshire experiences about 250 wildland fires each year, which burn an average of 250 acres. Another 200-300 illegal non-permitted fires occur annually that are extinguished before they can become a wildfire.</p><p>Part of the N.H. Department of Natural and Cultural Resources, the Division of Forests and Lands protects and promotes the value provided by trees, forests and natural communities.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123975787</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60XP-6161-JCBF-S0C4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"547\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 25, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It is currently almost 300,000 acres of protected, mostly forested land that we all benefit from and enjoy in different ways. But I think it's a fair bet that many people don't understand or could use a refresher on everything from how the whole thing got started to how it works. </p><p>So, for the past several weeks I've been taking to a deep dive on the \u2018why's and \u2018how's of the Shawnee National Forest. This week I'm writing about the Forest Service's use of prescribed fire as a forest management technique on the Shawnee. Likely, you are familiar with Smokey Bear. Smokey became the Forest Service mascot in 1944 and informed several generations that \"Only You Can Prevent Forest Fires.\" Certainly, shortly after the Shawnee was designated as a National Forest in 1939, the goal was to protect the regenerating forest and the thousands of acres of recently planted pines and Smokey's message was spread far and wide. But, in 2001, the slogan changed to \"Only You Can Prevent Wildfires\" The change was intended to clarify that Smokey was promoting the prevention of unplanned outdoor fires and not prescribed fires. A prescribed fire is a planned fire that is overseen by professionals. Prescribed fires are carried out only under specific weather conditions and are designed to mimic fire that historically occurred in the forest. The ecological value and importance of fire in many forested ecosystems has become much better understood and appreciated in the last several decades. In general, many forests are dependent on fire to maintain a specific mix of forest trees and other plants. Without fire the forest composition changes and that impacts all the animals. Fire is particularly important to the regeneration of oak trees, which are the dominant trees in southern Illinois forests. If you've never seen a prescribed fire \u2018in action', they slowly creep along the forest floor making them generally pretty easy to control. Additionally, the prescribed fire seasons is October to April, a time when most of the forest wildlife has either migrated south or is hibernating. Specific to the Shawnee National Forest, planning for a prescribed fire begins months or sometimes years before it happens. Burn plans are written, reviewed, and approved by personnel with years of firefighting and risk management experience. Then, during the fire season, fire managers monitor weather and fuel conditions closely, and when the conditions are favorable, they gather the required personnel and equipment to implement a burn. In addition, the forest service can assist landowners with property adjacent to the Shawnee who wish to have prescribed burns conducted on their private land. Wildland fire specialists will provide a consultation and typically a Forest Stewardship Plan is developed for the landowner. If you own property adjacent to state or federal land and you are interested in the benefits that prescribed fire provides as a management tool, contact the Shawnee National Forest, Fire Management Officer at 618-253-7114. * Mike Baltz has a doctorate in biology and writes about changing the world from his home in Carbondale.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Mike Baltz photo Growth on the forest floor at Giant City State Park the spring after a fall prescribed fireU.S. Forest Service Prescribed fires are usually slow-moving fires that \u2018clean' the forest floor and are easy to control.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHDLY-0001342394</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHDLY2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64PF-J031-DY6F-J3PD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163823</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"537\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Paddock Publications, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Daily Herald</publicationName><edition>Daily Republican (Marion) Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"02\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>February 4, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>Forest Lands</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTkzOTc4NEQ2MTQwNDg0Q0E0NDNFRkRDRDU1QUE0OEU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

I'm Kim Brunhuber. I want to get to our breaking news this hour.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Israel is retaliating swiftly and with force against Hamas at this hour, targeting sites in Gaza and engaging the militants on multiple fronts. As the prime minister said a short time ago quote, \"We are at war.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now this after an hours-long barrage of rockets took the country by surprise and set off sirens as far as away as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Casualties have been reported. It's worth noting this is the 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur war in 1973.</p><p>Most alarming for Israelis near Gaza are confirmed reports of militants infiltrating Israeli territory. Hadas Gold joins us from Jerusalem.</p><p>The scale, the coordination of these attacks, what we're seeing now, it's just extraordinary.</p><p>What's the latest there?</p><p>HADAS GOLD, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The latest is the prime minister declaring this is a state of war. He's saying in an address to the people of Israel in just the last half hour, \"Citizens of Israel, we are at war. Not an operation, not in rounds, at war.\"</p><p>The Israeli military chief of staff also distributing an address to the citizens of Israel, saying the Israeli military is essentially flooding the zone around Gaza because of these infiltrations. That's been the most alarming aspect of this.</p><p>Yes, the number of rockets is very, very high. I mean, it's some of the highest I have seen in recent years. Yes, they have been reaching far. Here in Jerusalem, we have had to seek shelter. And just here in our offices, at least five times because of various air raid sirens. We have been hearing explosions in the sky which could be interceptions, impacts. But it's the infiltrations that are the most alarming. We do have reports in the Israeli media of Israeli soldiers and/or civilians being kidnapped. We have not confirmed those ourselves.</p><p>Those are being reported in the Israeli media but those have been kidnaps likely from along the border with Gaza or from the settlement villages within the area around Gaza. What we have confirmed from the Israeli military regarding those infiltrations is they came in from the sky, paragliders, from the ground and sea.</p><p>There's ongoing fighting, as we speak, on the ground in several villages and two army bases and the border station at the crossing in the northern part of Gaza, between militants and Israeli security officials. So that's why you hear Israeli military saying that they are flooding the zone to get to those people.</p><p>As we're reporting live, we're hearing people calling in from these villages, saying that I'm inside my bomb shelter. I can hear gunfire and knocks on my door. Please come help me.</p><p>In terms of the rockets, the Israeli military is saying 2,000 rockets have been fired since 6:30 this morning. That's about six hours ago. In 2011, during that 11-day war, there was 4,300 rockets. We have already passed 2,000 just in a few hours to give you a sense of the scale of how many rockets have been fired.</p><p>In terms of injuries, we have confirmed from hospitals, there's at least 140 injuries have been brought to hospital. We at least know 20 those are considered serious. We know of several fatalities, including the head of one of the regional councils in the south, who according to his regional council, he was killed while in an active firefight with militants.</p><p>So it's not clear among the injuries whether those are from injuries from rocket fire and shrapnel, whether from militant fire because we have been seeing videos of pickup trucks with militants in the beds of those pickup trucks, just firing as they go down the street.</p><p>Militants on the streets as well firing. And as we heard from the Israeli military, there are ongoing firefights in several of these villages as well as army bases, as well as the border crossing.</p><p>A completely unprecedented state of war for Israel, something they have not seen. And also the timing is so significant here. Once again, 50 years ago to the day, Israel was surprised with the Yom Kippur war in a surprise attack on a holiday.</p><p>It is a holiday today. It's also a Saturday, Shabbat. So a lot of people who are religious would be in synagogue. And so the parallels are incredibly striking.</p><p>[05:05:00]</p><p>GOLD: Hamas has called this operation the Al-Aqsa Storm, linking this to events at Al-Aqsa.</p><p>But what has been interesting is, while there's been tensions at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, also known as Temple Mount to Jews, a place so holy, so hotly contested by both religions, there hasn't been any sort of major flare-up.</p><p>No major Israeli police action or anything like that to signal that something could be happening. That's why this is such a surprise. Bibi Netanyahu said himself it was a surprise.</p><p>So there will be a the lot of questions not only just how was Israel not better prepared but also how did all of these militants get in?</p><p>Were they already in Israel because thousands of Palestinians enter on a daily basis with permits to work?</p><p>Did they come from the West Bank?</p><p>How did this all happen?</p><p>Another major question is whether other fronts will get involved as well, especially the north and especially Hezbollah. If Hezbollah get involved in the north, that puts this is on a whole different level.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: I mean, you talked about the surprise here. Certainly, people must be shocked to be waking up to this. A couple hours ago, such large scale rocket attacks and especially seeing the images of people, attackers driving through the streets armed. It must be terrifying.</p><p>What is the mood there among Israelis now?</p><p>GOLD: It's a lot of shock. It's shock this is happening.</p><p>It's questioning, how did the Israeli military and Israeli intelligence allow this to happen?</p><p>What's really striking for the everyday Israeli, as they are watching the news, is getting live calls from people in the south, who are hiding in their safe rooms, who are hearing this happening on the streets in front of them, who are reporting terrible things.</p><p>We want to confirm those before we bring them on air. But this is incredibly shocking for them. And that's why you hear the parallels to the Yom Kippur War because that's what happened, the holiest day for Jews during the year. And they were surprised in the same way.</p><p>There was a bit of disbelief back then this was happening. Not as much this time but there was a the lot of shock and fear from Israelis about what will happen now, how far into Israel have these militants got, because Hamas is calling on all Palestinians across Gaza, across the West Bank, across Jerusalem, to rise up.</p><p>They're saying grab your guns, your axes, your cars and any way you want and join our war. Join our war against Israel. I think that will be a major issue if we begin to see what we're seeing with those infiltrations in those Israeli villages. If we see it across other parts of Israel, that's a major issue in addition to the rocket attacks.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: All right, we'll get back to you in a little bit for updates. Hadas Gold in Jerusalem, thank you so much for that. Appreciate it.</p><p>We want to go Avi Melamed, the founder of the Inside the Middle East Institute.</p><p>Thank you so much for joining us here. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying, quote, \"We are at war.\"</p><p>The symbolism of the timing here, 50 years pretty much to the day of the Yom Kippur War in 1973.</p><p>AVI MELAMED, FOUNDER, INSIDE THE MIDDLE EAST INSTITUTE: Yes, thank you for having me.</p><p>You are correct. In many ways, there's a similarity between the two events. By the way, this is not the only similarity. There are other aspects that are like a common denominator when you think about the two different events.</p><p>I would like to provide a couple of insights, trying to put this whole situation into a wider perspective. From a military perspective, we are looking at a war that was orchestrated and organized and planned for a long period of time.</p><p>And of course, the biggest question in their perspective is, is this war the first phase toward a multifront war?</p><p>Particularly when you are talking about Hezbollah in Lebanon, all eyes (ph) also have to be very closely on Lebanon. In that regard, I would like to add a strategic dimension. We have to think about the Iranian hegemonic vision plan. It's part of the plan in which Hamas and Islamic Jihad plays a very significant role.</p><p>They are trying to establish what we call the Ring of Fire; namely, surrounding Israel from three different arenas -- Lebanon, Syria and Gaza Strip -- with militants and proxies that are supposed to attack simultaneously the state of Israel.</p><p>What we saw this morning is that one of those arena, Gaza Strip, was activated. Obviously the biggest question to follow in the next couple days, are we going to see the flare-up of the Lebanese or maybe Syrian arena?</p><p>In addition to that, the issue of the Palestinian Territories in the West Bank --</p><p>[05:10:00]</p><p>MELAMED: -- and areas within Israel populated by mixed population Jews and Israelis.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MELAMED: This is one insight I want to share.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: That's one of the questions I wanted to ask you. Our reporter Hadas raised that. Israeli authorities seem to be caught by surprise here. You're a former Israel intelligence official. This seems to represent a huge intelligence failure.</p><p>MELAMED: Definitely. At this point, even though we're in a preliminary stage, it's clear that Israel's major strategy in the context of defending this volatile area surrounding Gaza, that strategy basically failed.</p><p>What we see right now is a manifestation of Israel's worst scenario, where militants are actually taking over parts of communities and civilians in the Gaza Strip. So in that sense, definitely.</p><p>And as I said, there are many other aspects that have to be asked in that regard. But with your permission, I would like to go back and provide additional insights and observations.</p><p>I was talking about the military perspective and the Iranian master plan of the Ring of Fire. There's another interesting perspective.</p><p>That goes to the question, why did Hamas launch that war?</p><p>One different aspect is the fact that Hamas has been struggling for an ongoing period of time and it's been accumulative of criticism of people in Gaza Strip over Hamas. In the last couple months, there's been some relief because Israel enabled more and more people to go and to work in Israel. So this is one interesting aspect.</p><p>The other interesting aspect has to be viewed in the context of the power struggle between Hamas on the one hand and Palestinian Authority on the other end. Hamas goes to be the leader of the Palestinian. And as part of its ideology, Hamas goes to military action.</p><p>It basically says the only way to bring Israel down is through military use of power. In that sense, Hamas basically is -- basically say or do what he always say, hopefully Hamas basically hope that will gain him a credit within the Palestinian public opinion and so on.</p><p>There's another interesting aspect regarding the question, why did Hamas wage that war?</p><p>That has to be looked in the context of the normalization and particularly the recent talks between Israel and Saudi Arabia and the reports about it brewing sort of like peace agreement or agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Now I'm taking it to the Palestinian perspective. In the Palestinian arena, there is a growing discontent. The Palestinians are feeling that the Arab world, the brothers are abandoning them. And basically, the Palestinian says Saudi Arabia is the last one to defend us.</p><p>If the Saudis are going to join the process with Israel, it means that we have totally been thrown under the bus. What Hamas likely did here is actually sending a message to the regime, saying the Palestinians are not going to be excluded.</p><p>The Palestinians have a say and they have the ability to impact the trajectory of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and no one could ignore that war. So I think these are a couple things to look at when we ask ourselves, why did Hamas wage that war, because it is a war.</p><p>And particularly, when you look at the most significant question at this point regarding that, what is going to be Israel's response?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUNHUBER: Let me ask you about that because that's exactly where I want to go. I appreciate your perspective on the interpretation of the Hamas' motives here. But I want to ask about Israel's response. The cabinet meeting I think in an hour.</p><p>What are the options do you think in terms of their response and how might that be complicated if Israelis have been captured?</p><p>MELAMED: Israel is currently in a major dilemma. On the one hand, you have a government in Israel, reminding you, a large part of this government or vocal part of this government are coming from the more extreme right-wing factors. They clearly put a pressure on the Israeli government to take over Gaza Strip and reoccupy Gaza Strip.</p><p>The question is what will be the other positions of other parts of the Israeli government and the Israeli intelligence and security community. We are looking at (INAUDIBLE) because Israel, after this war, following the initiation of this war with Hamas --</p><p>[05:15:00]</p><p>MELAMED: -- it cannot go back to the old same story of the military rounds because, as of now, Hamas won its biggest strategic achievement ever. He basically was able to screen a picture where he was taking control over Israeli communities, apparently taking control of holding some Israelis as hostages.</p><p>Now that goes back to the Israeli government. And one of the things that we have to ask ourselves, is Israel going to launch a massive military operation actually, basically taking that specific situation as a point where Israel is now actively changing the reality that was formed in the Gaza Strip, since 2007, when Hamas took over the strip?</p><p>I would not exclude that scenario. It's very possible that we will witness a massive Israeli ground operation in Gaza Strip, that basically will aim to try and to change totally from the ground the conditions that have been prevailed for the last almost two decades.</p><p>This is a pivotal moment. We have to look and see what will be the scale and the volume of Israeli retaliation and response. We have to look whether it's going to evolve in expanding of this war to other arenas. We are looking at critical hours, critical days, definitely. This story has regional ramifications, not only domestic ones.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: Yes, absolutely true. We are out of time but appreciate your analysis. Avi Melamed, thank you so much.</p><p>MELAMED: My pleasure. Thank you for having me.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: We'll be right back.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[05:20:00]</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>BRUNHUBER: We want to get back to our breaking news. Israel is carrying out military strikes against Hamas in Gaza after the group launched a surprise attack early Saturday. Hamas militants are claiming to have fired 5,000 rockets, targeting airports and military positions.</p><p>Israeli officials say at least one person has died and at least 100 people have been injured. Israel's military says it will mobilize thousands of reservists to take on Hamas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRUNHUBER: Joining me now is Daniel Levy, president of the U.S. / Middle East Project.</p><p>Thank you so much for being here with us. I want to start with your reaction to the unprecedented events we're seeing right now.</p><p>DANIEL LEVY, PRESIDENT, U.S. / MIDDLE EAST PROJECT: I think the first thing to note is this element of surprise and the really staggering success in that respect by the Palestinian movements who launched this military effort.</p><p>I think that will over time play very badly in Israel. I think there was a sense of hubris, that you could keep the Palestinians in these conditions and not have these kinds of resistance actions.</p><p>I think the immediate thing is the Israeli Jewish community, the political parties, the representatives come around unified. But I think ultimately this will play into an already deep polarization inside Israel.</p><p>I think this, whatever happens next, will be considered a significant success for those Palestinian movements. It's not clear what happens next. It would be surprising if the Israeli response in Gaza did not also include a ground operation.</p><p>I think this comes at a time where we would have the most extreme government in Israel, endless provocations. You also have what feels like a quite fragile, weak internal Israeli environment and I think the Palestinian side have looked at that, those Palestinian movements who've launched this.</p><p>They have looked at the situation in Jerusalem. That resonates not only with Palestinians but far beyond. They've looked at issues like how Palestinian prisoners have been treated. They have looked at the normalization talks.</p><p>And this has been the response. And I think it's also an important reminder, as your viewers are realizing this morning, that really the issue in the Middle East isn't whether Israel and Saudi Arabia, who are not at war with each other, normalize or not.</p><p>The issue is what happens on Palestinian front. So many decades of occupation, there will not be security quiet instability. As long as the Palestinians don't have their rights and their freedoms.</p><p>We've been reminded of this. It also comes on the 50th anniversary of the last time Israeli intelligence had a huge failure, which was the 1973 war with Egypt, the Yom Kippur War. And so I think that will play into the Israeli psyche and into the analysis coming out of Israel this morning and in the coming days.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: In these attacks, we know Israelis, at least one, have been killed, many injured; some possibly kidnapped. We're still looking into those reports.</p><p>But when we look at the Israeli response, especially if we might see a ground operation is in Gaza, often we see innocent Palestinian civilians losing their homes, sometimes losing their lives.</p><p>What will the cost be, do you think?</p><p>LEVY: Well, I think you're absolutely right to point that out. I think the variable that may be most significant in the Israeli side of the equation from what you just mentioned is whether there are indeed live Israelis who have been taken prisoner in Gaza, which also impacts what kind of reaction Israel can undertake.</p><p>Let's remember the basic dynamics here. Gaza, home to over 2 million Palestinians, many of whom were driven out of Israel in 1948, in the Nakba, refugees. The majority of whom, refugees, living for decades now, coming on to two decades in what is essentially a blockade, a siege, an open-air prison.</p><p>[05:25:00]</p><p>LEVY: We have seen several iterations during that time of disproportionate strikes by Israel, waves of -- Israel, of course, has the sophisticated weaponry. And what we have seen on so many occasions is devastation, massive civilian loss.</p><p>Of course, massive loss to housing, to infrastructure, to schools on the Palestinian side. And unfortunately, we can expect that again. But daily life for Palestinians in Gaza and throughout the areas controlled by Israel, is one that is not normal. So Israelis are waking up to a very abnormal situation. But it's an abnormality that Palestinians live with all the time. It's just a question of what is the extremity of that. And in May of 2021, when there was the last major escalation, you saw what the Palestinians called the unity intifada. And you saw popular expressions of opposition to Israel, inside Israel, on the streets of Israel, in mixed town. You saw it inside the West Bank.</p><p>So I think one of the real questions is whether we will see that again during the coming days.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: Yes, so much still unknown. It's early morning still here on the U.S. East Coast. We haven't heard from the Biden administration on this.</p><p>What do you think the U.S. response will be or should be?</p><p>LEVY: I fear there is a significant gulf between the answer to those two questions, what it will be and what it should be. I think what it will be is predictable, which will be standing in solidarity with Israel, recognizing what they will call Israel's right to defend itself, never recognizing the Palestinian right to resist an illegal occupation and a permanent siege and blockade. So I think that's one thing we'll see.</p><p>The other thing that will be missing is an appreciation that you cannot keep people under permanent conditions of inhumane, immoral but also illegal occupation and not expect something like this, not expect there to be insecurity for the party that is doing that to the Palestinians.</p><p>And I think the rest of the world may look at this. I mean, look at the inadequate American response, to say, wait a minute. In one place, you celebrate resistance. You celebrate people taking up arms against an invasion, which is correctly considered to be illegal. That's in Ukraine.</p><p>And in this other place, you run cover for the people who are doing the illegal occupation.</p><p>And I think in the parts of the world that have woken up already and some that are also yet to wake up, they will see this as another example of the very selective American application of the standards it is claiming to uphold in one place and totally negates and undermines in another place.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: I'm not sure the parallels are quite equivalent but I do take your point. But we'll have to leave it there. Thank you so much, Daniel Levy. Really appreciate your perspective on this.</p><p>LEVY: Thank you, Kim.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: All right.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) BRUNHUBER: Israel declares war on militants in Gaza after Hamas launches a surprise attack on Israel and calls for a Palestinian uprising. We'll have a live report just ahead. Stay with us.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[05:30:00]</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>BRUNHUBER: Welcome back to all of you watching here in the United States and around the world. I'm Kim Brunhuber. This is CNN NEWSROOM.</p><p>Israel is retaliating swiftly and with force against Hamas at this hour, targeting sites in Gaza and engaging on multiple fronts.</p><p>As the prime minister said a short time ago, \"We are at war.\"</p><p>This after an hours-long barrage of rockets took the country by surprise and set off sirens as far as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Numerous casualties have been reported. This is also the 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War of 1973.</p><p>Most alarming for Israelis near Gaza are confirmed reports of militants infiltrating Israeli territory. Sam Kiley is standing by in London. But let's begin our coverage with our Jerusalem correspondent Hadas Gold.</p><p>What's the latest?</p><p>GOLD: We are just getting updated numbers of casualties. This is according to Israel's emergency services. They say there've been more than 250 injuries. At least 22 of them are dead. These are not final numbers yet. These are high casualty numbers considering this just started 6:30 am this morning, which is this barrage of rocket fire coming from Gaza toward Israel.</p><p>We know that thousands of rockets have been fired. To give you context, in that 2021 11-day war, it was considered a large operation and there was 4,300 rockets fired in total. Now we are nearing that number and we haven't even reached 24 hours yet.</p><p>Most alarming are the infiltrations. We have seen videos of militants on pickup trucks in these Israeli villages. We have seen videos of militants on the streets of Israel. We are getting reports of Israeli citizens in their houses, saying they are hearing the gunfire just outside their homes.</p><p>The Israeli military confirming there have been ongoing firefights in several Israeli villages in the south, including two army bases and one of the border crossings. We have seen reports of soldiers and/or civilians being captured and kidnapped.</p><p>There's a video published of an Israeli tank along the Gaza border fence, showing Palestinian gunmen dragging out an Israeli soldier. We have also seen videos in Gaza and our producer has seen it with his own eyes, of Israeli military vehicles that have been taken by militants driving into Gaza.</p><p>The Israeli military has not confirmed or commented on any sort of soldiers or civilians being kidnapped or killed. What we have right now are the casualty numbers from the emergency services of people within Israel.</p><p>That's 250 injured, more than 22 of them killed. What is also not clear is how many of those injuries are from rockets or militant fire. We know some of them, including the head of one of the regional councils in the south --</p><p>[05:35:00]</p><p>GOLD: -- was killed by militant gunfire while engaging with them on the streets. This is a very fluid, ongoing situation. We're watching the Israeli news channels right now, where they are just getting reports, live calls from people who are sheltering in place in these communities, in the south, with fear of these militants entering.</p><p>The Israeli military is saying some of them entered Israel by paragliding in, by sea and by foot. The rockets also have been far- reaching, as far as where we are in Jerusalem. I counted six rounds of sirens and heard multiple explosions in the sky. Very fluid ongoing situation, the likes of which Israel has not seen in 50 years.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: You're bringing us some new and disturbing details there. Hadas Gold in Jerusalem, thank you so much.</p><p>I want to bring in CNN's Sam Kiley, who is in London.</p><p>Sam, you've covered the region extensively. I want to get your analysis of what you're seeing now, what strikes you about the attack, about the response and what it could mean going forward.</p><p>SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It's on the historic significance of this, this historic intelligence failure by the Israelis, because this is a situation that has not been seen since the Israelis were effectively ambushed by the Arab world in 1973, 50 years almost to the day in the Yom Kippur War, when that surprise attack was launched.</p><p>Now Hamas has used a cover they claim of 5,000 rockets. The IDF are saying some 2,000 rockets or more are being fired all the time to launch this complex attack from the sea, from the air, infiltrating with paragliders and then on foot.</p><p>We have seen images of breaks in the Gaza fence and Hamas operatives and other militants entering Israel on motorbikes.</p><p>Now they are able -- by being able to infiltrate and effectively now conduct hostage-taking operations, potentially, there's some reports, including from my own sources within the IDF, that they fear there are hostages and dead bodies that have been taken into Gaza territory. We have seen the destruction of a Markova tank. That is about one of the most sophisticated tanks on the planet, very sophisticated Israeli piece of heavy armor, falling to militants on or close to the border fence there in Gaza.</p><p>And a Humvee being driven through the streets, all of that combining as an attempt by Muhammad Al-Deif, the leader of the Hamas military wing, inside the strip to make a call to arms right across the Middle East but in particular, trying now to cause a forest fire effectively in militant activity on the West Bank and then perhaps ultimately among ethnic Palestinians who are citizens inside Israel itself.</p><p>Where the Knesset has reported three years ago that some 400,000 weapons are in the hands of ethnic Palestinians inside Israel. If that combines to set off this chain reaction, then Israel will be very much on the back foot at a time when there will be extreme pressure, particularly from Israel's Right. And it is the right wing that dominate the government in Israel, on the prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to launch a very severe counterattack inside Gaza, possibly aimed to try to rid the Gaza Strip of Hamas altogether.</p><p>But as we have been hearing from Daniel Levy a few moments ago and other critics on the Right within Israel, this is seen particularly by the Israeli Left as an inevitable consequence of bottling up Palestinian hopes inside enclaves like Gaza.</p><p>But the real aim of the Palestinians here is to try to cause this chain reaction, an uprising on the West Bank, inside Israel itself, with the ultimate aim perhaps that this would be the doomsday scenario of involving Hezbollah out of Lebanon.</p><p>That I think at the moment is a distant prospect. The next 48 hours and how Israel responds will define this. But it is absolutely unprecedented to see infiltration on this scale, effectively infantry infiltration of towns reportedly, like Sderot, where we have seen a number of civilians that have been killed at a bus stop.</p><p>There's images of Hamas operatives driving around in pickup trucks, firing supposedly at random, opening fire on a police vehicle and even being involved in combat near the Sderot police station. This is the biggest town near Gaza. It's some distance from the Gaza Strip itself. There's been infiltration in the kibbutzes close to the Gaza Strip, too.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: I want to mention again, we have an updated Israeli death toll now at 22.</p><p>Sam Kiley, thank you for your analysis.</p><p>[05:40:00]</p><p>BRUNHUBER: We appreciate it.</p><p>And we'll be right back.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING) (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>BRUNHUBER: We want to get to our breaking news. Israel is at war after Hamas launched a surprise attack early Saturday. Hamas militants are claimed to have fired some 5,000 rockets targeting airports and military positions.</p><p>Israeli officials say at least 22 people have died. More than 250 have been injured. Israel's military says it's carrying out strikes in Gaza and thousands of reservists will be mobilized. We'll have more on this breaking news story the at the top of the hour with \"CNN THIS MORNING.\"</p><p>Turning now to news here in the U.S., President Joe Biden is facing criticism for moving forward with the construction of new barriers at the southern border.</p><p>Critics say the president's breaking a campaign promise to never build additional border walls. But Biden says he couldn't stop the move because Congress had already earmarked funds to construct the barriers, which will go up amid a rise in migrant crossings.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The money was appropriated for the border wall. I tried to get them to reappropriate, to redirect that money but they didn't. They wouldn't. And in the meantime, there's nothing under the law, other than they have to use the money for what it was appropriated. I can't stop that.</p><p>QUESTION: Do you believe the border wall works?</p><p>BIDEN: No.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUNHUBER: We have more details from Priscilla Alvarez in Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: President Biden came under fierce criticism this week over his administration's decision to build border barriers in south Texas.</p><p>Now the president has maintained, along with his officials, that they had to do this because of funds appropriated by Congress in 2019 for the purpose of physical border barriers.</p><p>Sources I've spoken with said the administration was essentially running up against a deadline and that they had to use these funds by the end of fiscal year 2023. Now in a notice to the Federal Register this week, the Homeland Security secretary said that he may have to break --</p><p>[05:45:00]</p><p>ALVAREZ: -- more than 20 laws to get this done in an expedited manner.</p><p>And that this is also an area of, quote, \"high illegal entries.\" This is going to be up to 20 miles of border barriers. It also includes gates, cameras, access roads and lights. But the Homeland Security secretary maintaining as well this week that this is -- that the border wall is not the response.</p><p>The administration's posture on this has not changed. But again, it was necessary because these funds were appropriated by Congress. Of course, all of this, though, putting a politically precarious issue at the forefront and leaving the president to defend barriers which he had previously spoken out against during his campaign.</p><p>Of course, this time, he is saying that it is because of those funds that were appropriated before he took office -- Priscilla Alvarez, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRUNHUBER: Mexico's president has denounced U.S. plans to build new border barriers as a, quote, \"publicity stunt\" ahead of next year's election. The Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Friday called the new barriers propaganda to win over voters.</p><p>He criticized the politics, saying, \"All U.S. presidents, with all due respect, either Republican or Democrat, have done it during their term to look good in the eyes of Americans that, respectfully, don't have all the information.\" All right. It is full speed ahead for tech giant Amazon. We'll tell you what they are sending into space and how it could help people on the ground. That story is straight ahead. Stay with us.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[05:50:00]</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Three, two, one, we have ignition and liftoff of the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket, carrying the prototype (ph) mission for Amazon's Project Kuiper.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUNHUBER: Amazon's plans to build constellations of satellites to blanket the globe in internet connectivity on Friday. The first two prototype satellites of Project Kuiper were launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida.</p><p>Now Amazon plans to begin building hundreds more satellites, eventually building a network of 3,200 to circle the globe and beam internet connectivity to the ground. Here's what a Kuiper Project executive had to say about the mission.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): About half the world's population lack connectivity or access to good connectivity. And we know what a difference that internet connectivity can make in people's lives, access to shopping, access to health care, access to education.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRUNHUBER: For more on this, I'm joined by Tim Farrar. He's president of TMF Associates.</p><p>Thank you so much for being here with us. So we're still a ways away from logging on to Amazon internet. There have been setbacks along the road when the rockets that were supposed to be traveling on exploded. It shows how hard this is technically to do.</p><p>So going forward, what are some of the biggest challenges still ahead in terms of trying to set up this constellation?</p><p>TIM FARRAR, TECHNOLOGY CONSULTANT AND PRESIDENT, TMF ASSOCIATES: Amazon has a long way to go. It's trying to launch over 3,000 satellites. That's going to take an awful long time. There are dozens of launches.</p><p>And the rockets need to be ready to launch those satellites as well as the satellites being manufactured, which is also going to take at least two or three years to complete all of that.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: Yes. And of course, Elon Musk's Starlink has thousands of satellites already in space.</p><p>So how significant is this competition going to be for Amazon?</p><p>FARRAR: Well, Amazon has got a long way to go. Starlink has been in full commercial service for about two years. So Starlink is going to have something like a five year lead by the time Amazon comes to market.</p><p>And it has got billions of dollars of revenue and millions of subscribers already. So that is a lot to catch up on. Amazon has got a lot of resources that it can (INAUDIBLE) but, still, you know, it's going to be a challenge.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: Yes, a five year lead.</p><p>Is that too far back to catch up, do you think? FARRAR: Well, it really depends on how big this market is. Elon Musk has said he might get tens of millions of subscribers around the world. Some analysts are even more optimistic than that. But to date, he only has got a couple of million customers.</p><p>If that market doesn't increase very fast, there won't be many customers left for Amazon to capture.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: Who would these customers, these subscribers be, exactly?</p><p>FARRAR: Well, the biggest share of those is going to come from consumers who are in remote areas or in places where they can't get broadband internet from wireless or fiber.</p><p>There's going to be other customers, as well, in terms of ships, planes, oil rigs, government customers. We have seen Starlink have great success in Ukraine as a source of capacity to help the forces there doing the war.</p><p>So there's a lot of opportunity here but it's going to come down to whether there's a big enough consumer market. That's really going to contain the bulk of their customer base and their revenues as well.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: You mentioned Ukraine. Starlink has been vital for Ukraine's war efforts in terms of providing that digital lifeline. But there's been a lot of hand wringing about so much power being wielded by one man, who can literally decide where and when Ukraine gets this access.</p><p>Do you think Amazon would provide a military alternative in cases like this?</p><p>FARRAR: I think that's what the government has got to be hoping for, is they will have a choice of providers. That will give them more leverage in terms of the conditions under which those services are supplied.</p><p>They really don't like it if one person can turn off the satellite system and deny access. Having a choice is always better. And hopefully, Amazon will be able to provide that.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: We have been talking about one person, Elon Musk. This rivalry between the two companies --</p><p>[05:55:00]</p><p>BRUNHUBER: -- between Amazon and Elon Musk's Starlink, how much of this competition do you think is personal between these two men?</p><p>FARRAR: I think there is a lot of personal rivalry. They started with rockets and now they have it in satellites. I don't think Bezos wants to see Musk win. So he's going to keep pushing very hard.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: Finally, sort of big picture here, there's so many satellite constellations up there already.</p><p>How do we manage the traffic without collisions and so forth?</p><p>FARRAR: It really depends on how big the market is. That will be what determines how many satellites are launched. We've heard about hundreds of thousands of satellites or possibly more being launched, the market probably isn't big enough to support all those.</p><p>So at some point, the music will stop. People will perhaps return to reality and realize what the size of this market is and hopefully that will happen before we get too carried away.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: It's fascinating, all the possibilities that are still out there that we're still exploring. We'll have to leave it there. Tim Farrar, thank you for being here with us.</p><p>FARRAR: Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRUNHUBER: That wraps this hour of \"CNN NEWSROOM.\" I'm Kim Brunhuber.

We strongly believe that our drilling efforts at X22 will optimize an already strong project, with near-surface high grades that will enhance the mine\u2019s strip ratio and positively impact the mine sequencing. Significant recent rainfall in Quebec has provided some relief to the forest fire situation in the Eeyou-Istchee James Bay region and operations at our site are slowly re-starting since receiving government approval to access our camp. We expect to ramp up and resume drilling and exploration activities in the coming week as we closely monitor the situation to ensure the safety of our staff and local communities.\u201d</p><p>The northeastern most region of X22 is showcasing strong grades and mineral continuity near surface. Wide intervals of mineralization such as 0.83 g/t AuEq of 82m from hole X22-23-042 are characterized by pervasive biotite alteration with disseminated sulfides, as well as sericitized shear zones and felsic porphyry dykes. High-grade intercepts such as 103.81 g/t AuEq from X22-23-042 are characterized by more discrete structures containing semi-massive pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite. The strategic execution of the X22 drill program has rapidly expanded and defined the mineralized trend, which now extends ~1 kilometre and is expected to have a positive impact on the economics in the upcoming Feasibility Study, which remains on schedule for targeted completion prior to the end of the 2023 calendar year.</p><p/><p>Figure 1: Plan View Map of Zone X22 Showing Current and

information.</p><p>Quality Assurance and Control </p><p>During the Zone X22 drill program, one meter assay samples were taken from NQ core and sawed in half. One-half was sent for assaying at ALS Laboratory, a certified commercial laboratory, and the other half was retained for results, cross checks, and future reference. A strict QA/QC program was applied to all samples, which included insertion of one certified mineralized standard and one blank sample in each batch of 25 samples. Every sample was processed with standard crushing to 85% passing 75 microns on 500 g splits. Samples were assayed by one-AT (30 g) fire assay with an AA finish and if results were higher than 3.5 g/t Au, assays were redone with a gravimetric finish. For QA/QC samples, a 50 g fire assay was done. In addition to gold, ALS laboratory carried out multi-element analysis for ME-ICP61 analysis of 33 elements four acid ICP-AES.</p><p>Qualified Person</p><p>The technical and scientific information in this press release has been reviewed and approved by Nicolas Guest, P.Geo., Senior Project Geologist, who is a Qualified Person as defined by NI 43-101. Mr. Guest is an employee of Troilus and is not independent of the Company under NI 43-101.</p><p>About Troilus Gold Corp.</p><p>Troilus Gold Corp. is a Canadian-based junior mining company focused on the systematic advancement and de-risking of the former gold and copper Troilus Mine towards production. From 1996 to 2010, the Troilus Mine produced +2 million ounces of gold and nearly 70,000 tonnes of copper. Troilus is located in the top-rated mining jurisdiction of Quebec, Canada, where is holds a strategic land position of 1,420 km\u00b2 in the Fr\u00f4tet-Evans Greenstone Belt. Since acquiring the project in 2017, ongoing exploration success has demonstrated the tremendous scale potential of the gold system on the property with significant mineral resource growth. The Company is advancing engineering studies following the completion of a robust PEA in 2020, which demonstrated the potential for the Troilus project to become a top-ranked gold and copper producing asset in Canada. Led by an experienced team with a track-record of successful mine development, Troilus is positioned to become a cornerstone project in North America.</p><p>For more information:</p><p>Caroline ArsenaultVP Corporate Communications+1 (647) <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:407-7123info@troilusgold.com\">407-7123info@troilusgold.com</email> \u00a0</p><p>Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Information</p><p>Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability; the estimate of Mineral Resources in the updated Mineral Resource statement may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-political, marketing, or other relevant issues.

Such statements and information are based on numerous assumptions regarding present and future business strategies and the environment in which Troilus will operate in the future. Certain important factors that could cause actual results, performances or achievements to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, amongst others, currency fluctuations, the global economic climate, dilution, share price volatility and competition. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause the actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements of Troilus to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, including but not limited to: there being no assurance that the exploration program will result in expanded mineral resources; risks and uncertainties inherent to mineral resource estimates; the impact the COVID 19 pandemic may have on the Company\u2019s activities (including without limitation on its employees and suppliers) and the economy in general; the impact of the recovery post COVID 19 pandemic and its impact on gold and other metals; the receipt of necessary approvals; general business, economic, competitive, political and social uncertainties; future prices of mineral prices; accidents, labour disputes and shortages; environmental and other risks of the mining industry, including without limitation, risks and uncertainties discussed in the most recent Technical Report and in other continuous disclosure documents of the Company available under the Company\u2019s profile at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url>. Although Troilus has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended.

Legislators who represent Curry and Roosevelt counties \u2014 all Republicans \u2014 favor stronger criminal penalties and have unanimously opposed a bill that would support abortion and gender-changing services, which would invalidate local ordinances.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The \"Reproductive and Gender Affirming Health Care\" bill received Senate approval on Tuesday and headed for Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham's desk. The bill passed the Senate on a vote of 23-15.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sen. Pat Woods and Sen. Stuart Ingle, whose districts include Curry and Roosevelt counties, voted against the bill, as the House representatives for Curry and Roosevelt counties, did when the bill was approved by the House on Feb. 21.</p><p>Woods wrote in an email that the bill passed despite evidence presented by Republican Sen. Gregg Shmedes, a surgeon representing a central New Mexico district, that showed gender-affirming care to be a failure in Sweden. In fact, Woods stated based on Shmedes' information, Sweden closed facilities after a showing that gender-changing can actually cause harm.</p><p>Besides, Woods added, \"I asked if this (bill) would bring an OB-GYN doctor to Clovis and received no answer. I have no confidence that this bill will bring in an OB-GYN doctor to Clovis.\"</p><p>\"This bill purports to be about reproductive choice but they only wanted to talk about abortions and gender-confirming care,\" Woods concluded.</p><p>Rep. Andrea Reeb, District 64, and Rep. Martin Zamora, District 63, presented a joint response to the bill.</p><p>\"HB 7 is direct attack on local control in New Mexico,\" they wrote in a joint email. \"This measure will significantly limit local municipality's ability to pass ordinances that align with the values of individual communities.\"</p><p>The bill would counter ordinances passed in Clovis and Roosevelt County that would prohibit delivery of medicine or medical equipment used for abortion.</p><p>Rep. Jack Chatfield, Disrict 67, wrote, \"I stand in strong opposition to abortions.\"</p><p>Anti-crime legislation</p><p>As of Thursday, there were several anti-crime bills that had passed the House but had not reached the Senate floor for votes. Most would increase penalties for offenses that include assaulting a peace officer and using firearms while committing drug felonies.</p><p>Ingle, R-Portales, said in an interview that he was waiting to see what appears in the Senate, but in general, he said, \"I support tougher sentences for criminals. If they can put them away for another five years, it suits me fine.\"</p><p>Woods wrote, \"I'm against crime. Violent offenders need to be removed from society. The non-violent offender needs to be punished appropriately. Regardless, everyone who breaks the law, needs to be held accountable.\"</p><p>Woods also wrote on Monday that the Senate Finance Committee, on which Woods has a seat, had not seen any crime bills.</p><p>Reeb, who recently retired as the Curry-Roosevelt county district attorney, expressed some disappointment in the progress of anti-crime legislation.</p><p>\"It seems that most crime bills have screeched to a standstill in this session,\" she wrote in an email. \"While that is not surprising, it is frustrating for so many New Mexicans that this crime crisis is not being taken seriously. Communities across our state are not safe and are demanding that we act and restore public safety.\"</p><p>Zamora stated that he, too, is frustrated with the pace of anti-crime legislation.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, this Legislature is unwilling to hold criminals accountable for their actions,\" he wrote. \"Since I began serving, the (L)egislature has made it easier for criminals and we have seen significant increases in crime across the state.\"</p><p>Chatfield wrote, \"The ultra-progressive agenda has resulted in a significant increase in violent crimes, homicides, and homelessness. \"</p><p>He added, \"I strongly support legislation to sufficiently fund our law enforcement agencies to restructure sentencing laws to keep violent criminals in jail.\"</p><p>Capital outlay</p><p>Capital outlay authorizations are also awaiting action as the 2023 legislative session enters its final week.</p><p>The News asked legislators about their priorities for capital outlay, and whether expectations of a windfall in tax revenues was resulting in excessive demands from local interests for capital outlay funds.</p><p>Woods wrote, \"I try to support those projects that have the most beneficial effect on a community.\"</p><p>Individual projects he hopes to see make the capital outlay cut in Curry County include, Clovis street light installation, Clovis Roy Walker Improvements, Curry County Livestock Pavilion construction, and Eastern Plains Council of Government office building improvements. He also listed projects in Quay, Harding and Union counties, other counties that Woods represents.</p><p>Ingle said in an interview, \"Each senator got about $5 million to put into their district. I have five counties to split it up among, including Curry, Roosevelt, Chaves, Lea and De Baca.\"</p><p>He added, \"It doesn't mean we'll get it all. We won't know until it actually passes.\"</p><p>Ingle pointed out that the House has its own capital outlay distributions.</p><p>\"We don't mess with theirs, and they don't mess with ours,\" he said, \"except to try to avoid single projects getting funds from both sources.\"</p><p>On the House side, Zamora wrote, \"I have used a portion of my capital outlay funds to support parks infrastructure and the Roy Walker Center.</p><p>He added, \"I believe that our funds should be expended to support the most at-need in our community, and I want to make sure that our children have the best recreation opportunities to encourage growth and future success.\"</p><p>Reeb wrote, \"I was able to use my capital outlay funds to support our downtown MainStreet, and other road infrastructure projects across our county. I also was able to use funds to support our parks and the Roy Walker Center, and helped fund a planning project for a future Curry County Sports and Recreation Center.\"</p><p>Chatfield wrote that he has been working with Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on supporting a planned regional behavioral health center that would serve east central New Mexico counties, including Curry and Roosevelt counties as well as other counties included in Chatfield's district, including Quay and Union counties.</p><p>\"This is a $45 million effort, and I am hopeful that with support from many lawmakers and the governor,\" he wrote, \"we can ensure that our entire region receives much needed behavioral health support.\"</p><p>Omnibus tax bill</p><p>The News also asked legislators about a proposed omnibus tax bill, which would combine other tax bills proposed in the session into a single piece of legislation.</p><p>Woods wrote of the omnibus tax bill, \"The only good thing it does is provide rebates. Everything else is anti-business. Because of the anti-business aspects of the bill, I will not support it.\"</p><p>Other legislators did not comment on the tax bill.</p><p>Other legislation</p><p>Woods alone offered comments about bills he would realistically like to see passed before the session ends on Saturday.</p><p>\"I strongly favor SB105 which would require two people on trains that pass thru New Mexico,\" he wrote. \"We don't need trains that can exceed three miles in length passing through New Mexico's wide-open spaces without anyone on them.\"</p><p>Woods said he would also support a Senate bill that would allow the state's Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department \"to contract and conduct forest fire prevention.\"</p><p>He said he also supports a House bill cosponsored by Chatfield that would make it possible to have federal funding for half of the cost of meat inspection. Chatfield has said this bill would support an expansion of meat packing in New Mexico and reduce New Mexico cattle ranchers' dependence on corporate-controlled meat packing plants in Texas.</p><p>Woods said he also supports bills that would allow New Mexico Lottery winners to remain anonymous and a bill aimed at livestock theft that \"will tie the severity of the punishment to the value of the loss.\"</p><p>Ingle also mentioned a voting rights bill that the Senate was set to consider on Wednesday.</p><p>He would not support new voting rights measures, he said, because \"voting rights don't need to change.\"</p><p>Current measures on voting rights, he said, are adequate enough that \"if you don't vote, it's because you're too darned lazy.\"</p><p>On voting rights, Woods wrote, it \"should be reasonable to require proof of ID and residence at the time of registration.\"</p><p>\"What is unreasonable is to make a permanent absentee voter list,\" he added. \"How many ballot applications will be sent to people who have moved without informing the county clerk? How many Christmas cards do you get returned every year?\"</p><p>Early last week, Woods weighed in on bills that would raise minimum wage and expand family leave allowances for employees in the state.</p><p>\"Minimum wage increase fuels inflation,'\" he wrote in an email. \"Any time you increase money in the economy without increasing products and services, that increase is eaten up by higher prices on goods and services and increases the cost of living.\"</p><p>On the family leave enhancement bill, he wrote, \"Not everyone who has a baby needs time off. Time off to help a family member is a broad statement.\"</p><p>\"As this is written,\" he wrote, \"everyone in the family who works for a different employer could apply for time off to help one person.\"</p><p>The bill's provisions that allow time off for employees facing abusive behavior, Woods wrote, \"make the employer fund an employee's actions for self-defense.\"</p><p>If such a benefit becomes available, he said, people are likely to abuse it.</p><p>\"It takes away from productivity and sooner or later puts that job at risk,\" Woods wrote.</p><p>Woods also criticized a bill that would charge parents whose children get unauthorized access to firearms with a misdemeanor if their child is caught using the weapon to threaten others, and a felony if the child kills someone with a gun.</p><p>Woods said he would rather see laws that punish parents who do not ensure their children attend school or allow their children to bully others.</p><p>___ (c)2023 Eastern New Mexico News, Clovis, N.M.

Kymeta is pitching the land mobility Ku-band antenna as a communication solution for government, defense, and first responder customers. It covers the full Ku-band and is capable of operating on Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) networks. Kymeta Vice President of Product Lilac Muller told <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Via Satellite</emphasis> that this product was redesigned from the previous u7 antenna not only with improvements to the core technology, but also for usability and quick connectivity.\u00c2\u00a0 \"We have built-in cellular cellular connection, and a built-in SD-WAN router with a Wi-Fi bubble. You turn on your car, the system connects, and you have a Wi Fi bubble around you. The user shouldn't be thinking about the technology and the antenna, they should just be connected and that's what we had in mind when we designed this product,\" she said.\u00c2\u00a0 Neville Meijers, Kymeta chief product and marketing officer told <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Via Satellite</emphasis> the product has been designed specifically for land mobility needs in that it has high environmental tolerance to operate in extreme hot and cold environments, and it has been designed to use low power and it operates on a vehicle without any additional power than the battery.\u00c2\u00a0 Kymeta is selling the u8 as an antenna; an ODU which allows customers to connect to their own modem; and a turnkey terminal with embedded satellite modem, cellular modem, and SD-WAN capabilities. </p><p>Kymeta is also offering a purchasing option designed for users like first responders, an end-to-end subscription package to the hardware and Kymeta Connect hybrid satellite-cellular connectivity service.\u00c2\u00a0 \"There are a lot of customers like first responders who have never bought satellite capacity and probably without this land mobile solution would never even contemplate buying satellite capacity,\" Meijers said. \"We want to offer the customer a very easy way to adopt our product from an end-to-end perspective, so we packaged together the hardware, together with the network. Having this ability to provide them with always-on communication resonates very strongly with them.\"\u00c2\u00a0 \"We believe that the combination of our service, together with our unique hardware is going to open up the land mobility space in a way that people have been asking for for many years, but has never happened,\" he added.\u00c2\u00a0 The product launch follows after <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.satellitetoday.com/business/2020/08/25/bill-gates-leads-kymetas-85m-funding-round/\">beta trials kicked off in August</url>, testing the product around the world in North America, Asia-Pacific region, and Europe. Kymeta reports beta testing demonstrated throughputs of over 45 Mbps in land mobile environment with large scan-off angles of over 50 degrees. Muller said customer response to the trials has been \"incredible.\"\u00c2\u00a0 Also in August, Kymeta closed an $85 million funding round led by Bill Gates, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.satellitetoday.com/business/2020/08/18/kymeta-acquires-service-provider-lepton-global-to-ramp-up-go-to-market-push/\">acquired satellite service provider\u00c2\u00a0Lepton Global Solutions LLC</url>, to strengthen its go-to-market position for the u8 and Kymeta Connect. The <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">U.S. Forest Service</emphasis> has the Kymeta antenna installed on its vehicles, Kymeta announced in its Monday press release.\u00c2\u00a0 \"My team works in some of the most densely populated, rugged, and steep forest terrain in the U.S.,\" commented Tim Dunfee, deputy forest fire chief of the U.S. Forest Service. \"There are places across our varied terrain that have been engulfed by fires and communications cell towers that have been destroyed, causing loss of all communications. When we tested Kymeta's solutions, we could use FaceTime and make voice calls for the first time.

As Yi-kang ventures through the forest to assess the fire, she finds the charred body of Lee Se-wook (Yun Ji-on). Se-wook was one of the killers using poisoned yogurt drinks to murder hikers. The recap also shows Kang Hyun-jo (Ju Ji-hoon)[3] getting locked inside a shed with Il-nam's (Min Moo-je) children, as someone sets off a fire to kill them. <br/><br/>As the forest fire gets closer to the local towns, emergency services are dispatched to the mountains.

As Dae-jin and the rangers try to stop the fire, he notices the wind's trajectory has changed. The wind shifts the fire's direction toward Haedong village. Back in town, Il-nam's wife begs the firefighters to save her children. She explains they are likely hiding at Gap Cave for safety.  <br/><br/>Dae-jin overhears and decides to venture into the forest with his team to save them despite the danger. Hyun-jo talks to Jung Goo-Young (Oh Jung-se) and realizes Yi-kang never returned from the mountain. As the team hurries to reach Gap Cave, Hyun-jo uses a drone to look for an access point.  <br/><br/>Yi-kang finally calls over the radio and explains she is closest to the children's location. The team arrives, but she and the children are nowhere to be found. The fire has become too dangerous for the rangers, and they call off the search. But Hyun-jo notices the fire cabinet is open. Before the team arrived, Yi-kang and the children made their way out of the cave.

At the hospital, Hyun-jo explains Se-wook's dental records were a match. Hyun-jo questions why he started having visions after his friend's death on the mountain. He deduces the killer is making the murders look like hiking accidents.  <br/><br/>Jirisan Episode 8 then shifts to present-day 2020. Yi-kang and Lee Da-won (Go Min-si) continue to scour the mountain for clues. While De-won checks the motion cameras, Yi-kang is called to the police station to talk to herb collectors. One collector retells the story of Mount Jirisan's ghost. A hooded figure covered in blood appears, and whoever sees him dies.  <br/><br/>Fans' theories after Episode 1 of the K-drama[32] are true. Hyun-jo's spirit stayed behind on the mountain after he was attacked and put into a coma. His spirit appears to the people who are connected to the killer. Yi-kang confirms the ghost another hiker saw before almost falling to his death was Hyun-jo. She soon realizes De-won saw Hyun-jo's ghost and might be in danger. Up in the mountain, someone is following De-won.  <br/><br/>As De-won runs in fear, she trips. The person is holding a broken yogurt drink and wearing a Mount Jiri ranger jacket. De-won looks relieved and asks what the person is doing in the mountain.  <br/><br/>Jirisan is available to stream on iQiyi[33].  <br/> Read the original article from The Cheat Sheet[34] <br/> [ 1]:

But they show how just a handful of people with roles in the country's decentralized election system can try to muck up the process and try to sow chaos in elections. And they demonstrate the continued hold that former President Donald Trump's unfounded conspiracy theories of widespread election fraud have over his allies and supporters around the country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At least two counties on Monday voted to not certify their respective county elections: Cochise County in Arizona, where county supervisors voted 2-1 to delay certification until at least Friday, beyond the Monday statutory deadline, and Luzerne County in Pennsylvania, where the county board deadlocked 2-2 on a certification vote, with one abstention who later said he would vote to certify at a future meeting.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Counties failing to certify elections is largely unprecedented in recent American history, even after the 2020 election, and litigation is basically guaranteed.</p><p>Marc Elias, a prominent attorney in the Democratic Party, tweeted shortly after the vote that the Arizona county would be sued, after his firm sent a letter on behalf of a seniors group threatening a lawsuit if the board did not certify the results. Monday evening, his firm followed through with that threat, filing a lawsuit in state court seeking to force Cochise to certify its election results.</p><p>\"Defendants voted against canvassing the 2022 general election results until at least December 2, 2022, and have thus made clear that they will not comply with their non-discretionary, mandatory legal duty to complete the canvass by the statutory deadline to do so. In doing so, Defendants are violating Arizona law,\" the suit argued.</p><p>Meanwhile, Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs also filed a suit with similar aims late Monday. Last week, her office sent a letter last week to the Cochise County board, in which state elections director Kori Lorick promised legal action, further warning that if the board had not certified by the state's canvassing deadline, the state would proceed regardless. </p><p>Hobbs, a Democrat, is also the state's governor-elect. She defeated Republican Kari Lake, a former TV anchor who has refused to concede the race.</p><p>\"Absent this Court's intervention, the Secretary will have no choice but to complete the statewide canvass by December 8 without Cochise County's votes included,\" attorneys for Hobbs wrote. \"The Board's unprecedented inaction should not disenfranchise tens of thousands of voters in Cochise County.\" Lake carried the county by 18 points.</p><p>Cochise County supervisors voted Monday to call for a special meeting Friday about the security of their voting machines, saying they would like to hear further presentations on whether they were properly certified for use in the midterm election.</p><p>The secretary of state's office did not directly address litigation in a statement after the Cochise County vote on Monday. \"The Secretary of State's Office provided supporting documentation that confirmed Cochise County's election equipment was properly certified,\" Sophia Solis, a spokesperson for the office, wrote in an email. \"The Board of Supervisors had all of the information they needed to certify this election and failed to uphold their responsibility for Cochise voters.\"</p><p>Pennsylvania's Luzerne County had serious problems on Election Day, where voting centers ran out of paper ballots early in the day. A court order there eventually kept polling places open for two additional hours so voters would be able to cast ballots, and Spotlight PA reported that the local district attorney is investigating the shortage.</p><p>Elias, the Democratic attorney, seemed to allude to a potential lawsuit there. And a statement from the Pennsylvania Department of State late Monday afternoon said that the department \"has reached out to [Luzerne] officials to inquire about the board's decision and their intended next steps.\"</p><p>But the results in Luzerne will likely be certified soon, even absent immediate court action. Daniel Schramm, a Democrat on the county board who voted to abstain from the vote earlier Monday, said in an interview with the Associated Press later Monday that he would soon vote to certify the results.</p><p>\"I wanted to research to see exactly how many people were just not allowed to vote. I couldn't find any,\" Schramm told the AP, telling the wire service that election officials contacted two-thirds of the workers who ran individual polling places and \"they reported nobody was turned away.\" The AP reported that a meeting to certify the results has been scheduled for Wednesday.</p><p>An attorney for the county had told board members during the meeting that it was possible the state or candidates could \"file actions\" after the county failed to certify the election.</p><p>There are few examples in recent elections of a county refusing to certify legitimate results. Earlier in the year, Otero County, N.M., initially refused to certify election results in the state's summer primary. The New Mexico secretary of state sued, and the state Supreme Court ordered the county to certify, which it ultimately did.</p><p>The Cochise County board meeting Monday morning was brief. But during the Luzerne County meeting and in another meeting in Maricopa County, Arizona's largest county, angry people demanded that county officials not certify the vote, sometimes calling for a new election to be held.</p><p>In Maricopa, protesters targeted both board Chair Bill Gates and Recorder Stephen Richer, both Republicans, after tabulation machines at many polling places in the county were unable to read ballots on the day of the election. (Voters who faced problems could have chosen to instead submit their ballots to be tabulated at a central voting site, and some sites saw long lines.) One person appeared to call for Gates to be executed for treason during a public hearing on Monday.</p><p>After an hours-long hearing, Maricopa's Republican-dominated board voted unanimously to certify the election. Lake, the losing gubernatorial candidate, tweeted out several videos with people chastising election officials in in Maricopa County.</p><p>Elsewhere, the certification process also faced protests, but officials still certified the vote. In Michigan, for example, the state's bipartisan board of state canvassers voted unanimously on Monday to certify the results of the state's election. Kristina Karamo - the Trump-endorsed candidate for secretary of state who was handily defeated earlier this month - pleaded with the board not to certify but was rejected, and the canvassers briefly left the room due to disruptions.</p><p>\"A lot of the questions that arise are from lack of proper understanding, which is unfortunately fed by candidates and party officials on both sides of the aisle who feed into this nonsense, who make these claims that fire everybody up because it's a short-term gain for them and that's dangerous to our system,\" Tony Daunt, the Republican chair of the board, said during the meeting, according to the Detroit Free Press. \"And me talking about this is essentially trying to put out a forest fire with a Dixie cup right now.\"</p><p>Holly Otterbein contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-00071232</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6705-1BK1-F118-92KJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-12-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1238\"/><timeReceived>4:08 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"11\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>November 29, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>Elections</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTlGMTIwRjY1ODQ4NDQyRUE1MkJFMUQwMTE1MDhGQjY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX001648</classCode><className>SUITS &amp;

A cellular automaton model is used to analyze percolation and transport of a distributed-fibrosis inflicted heart-like tissue. </p><p>Although based on a rather simple mathematical model, it leads to several important outcomes: (1) It is shown that, for a single wave front (as the one emanated by the heart's sinus node), the percolation of heart-like matrices is exactly similar to the forest fire case. (2) It is shown that, on the average, the shape of the transport (a question not dealt with in relation to forest fire, and deals with the delay of action potential when passing a fibrotic tissue) behaves like a Gaussian. (3) Moreover, it is shown that close to the percolation threshold the parameters of this Gaussian behave in a critical way. From the physical point of view, these three results are an important contribution to the general percolation investigation. The relevance of our results to cardiological issues, specifically to the question of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">reentry initiation</emphasis>, are discussed and it is shown that: (A) Without an ectopic source and under a mere sinus node operation, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">no arrhythmia</emphasis> is generated, and (B) A sufficiently high refractory period could prevent some reentry mechanisms, even in partially fibrotic heart tissue.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>The combination of percolation, transport and tortuosity is proving to be of great importance in many scientific areas.</p><p>Percolation is a well-established mathematical field (See e.g. review1), which has been applied to quite a few physical, biological and medical domains.</p><p>Critical exponents are numbers describing systems' behavior near second order (continuous) phase transitions in thermodynamic systems and near percolation transitions. They are considered to be independent of the actual or specific system, and to depend only on the systems' intrinsic character such as the system's dimensions and the nature of interactions between its particles. Percolation problems deal with the clustering of identical substances randomly and uniformly distributed in space with an occupation probability <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis>, hindering passage through the system. For an infinite system, there exists a certain threshold probability, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">c</emphasis>, above which passage through the system is completely blocked. For finite systems the transition is gradual. Near <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">c</emphasis>, some physical properties do not depend on the actual substances nor on the clustering structures. These properties behave, asymptotically, only as a power law of the distance from <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">c</emphasis>, i.e., they are proportional to , where \u03b2 is a constant (the critical exponent for this property).</p><p>One of the directions in which percolation theory has evolved is the so-called forest fire model (FFM)2, 3, a part of a general \"directed percolation\" (DP) models, where the percolation can only move in a single forward direction and backwards movement is prohibited, such as for fire propagation. Electrical and thermal passage through different media have also been investigated by percolation methods4. For a review see Ref.5. Tortuosity and transport issues (not dealt with in FFM) are considered in combination with percolation for different materials and passage avenues. For a critical review see Ref.6.</p><p>Electrical movement in neurons, in the heart and brain tissues, is what we want to call \"semi directed percolation\" (SDP). Here, once a cell has operated, it passes into a \"refractory period\" in which it is prevented from reactivation. However, in contrast to FFM, the refractory period persists only for a limited time, allowing movement in the opposite direction. SDP therefore seems to be a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">different type of percolating systems</emphasis>.</p><p>Percolation and transport in such SDP media may have important implications in cardiology7\u201310, where malfunction in action potential movement can lead to tachycardia and fibrillation, and in brain investigations11. The transport and delay of arrival of action potential through fibrotic tissues are of major importance in understanding the initiation of heart arrhythmias (for an expansion of this issue see the \"Discussion\" section). However, although simple percolation (see e.g. 12. for a recent approach to the subject) and diffuse 13and anisotropic conduction14 through heart tissues has been considered, there has been no systematic investigation of the combined issue of percolation, transport and tortuosity for the SDP problem. Note that \"tortuosity\" in the heart tissue is referred to as zig zag movement based on the seminal15 study. We start such systematic investigation in this paper. We restrict ourselves here to heart-like cells since in the brain realm the system is further complicated by the existence of two kinds of cells there, excitatory and inhibitory ones. We consider here only excitatory type of cells.</p><p>Here we treat \"forest fire\" and heart-like cellular automata models to understand site percolation of these systems under increasing percentages of non-operating cells. For the heart-like SDP we only use cases where the refractory period is equal or larger than the active one. The case of shorter refractory periods will be dealt with in future publications.</p><p>It turns out that, in the sense of percolation, both systems, the FFM and the SDP kind examined here, behave <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">likewise</emphasis>, which could have been somewhat surprising. In contrast to the FFM case, however, for the heart case the transport of the process is of major importance, namely, how many end-cells are activated (and the delay and locations of the arriving action potentials. Therefore, besides percolation itself, two additional features, the fraction of the starting \"objects\" that reaches the other side of the percolating area (percolation throughput or transport16) and the delay time in this fraction arrival there (average time of arrival, related to the tortuosity6, 17 or zigzag13, 15 of the AP route) are treated here. The throughput or transport and the delay (related to the tortuosity of the routes it took) in its arrival at the other side and the spread in arrival times are measured by the Gaussian parameters of the average fraction. These questions of transport are prevalent in hydrological and other geological domains (e.g.6) and there is a vast amount of literature devoted to them, but not so for the heart problem. Note, however, that transport here is <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">different</emphasis> from hydraulic or electrical conductivity, in which movement occurs under Darcy's law or Ohm's law (see e.g. Ref.10), since there is no voltage or pressure difference which drives the AP across the heart. AP movement is nonlinear and is simulated here only by the influence of one cell on its immediate neighbors.</p><p>In the present percolation problem, we are also going to look for physical properties which behave critically near the percolation threshold. Based on Ref 10, the two obvious candidates are the tortuosity and the throughput. Indeed, as we shall see, near enough to the percolation point, these properties do behave in such a way.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Model</emphasis></p><p>The model we use is a simple 2D square cellular automata grid of n \u00d7 n cells. Time is discrete and measured by generations (or time units).</p><p>Each cell at each generation can assume several characteristics denoted by digital numbers from 0 to 2 (and 9, see below). A cell, which is at mode 1, is operating, namely containing action potential (AP). The label 0 denotes a \"waiting\" cell, a cell that can be excited into an operating one (see below). Label 2 denotes cells in their refractory period in which no stimulation by neighboring cells can induce them to operate. The label can be increased to 3, 4 etc. to relate to the length of the refractory period (in generations) which depends on the last number used for the particular \"trial\".</p><p>Only nearest neighbors of a cell, i.e., the four cells closest to the specific cell, and not next nearest ones (those diagonally bordering it) are considered here as \"cell neighbors\" which can transfer it to be active.</p><p>In the \"diagonal\" percolation case, treated here as well, the rule is different, i.e., only the \"upper\" two diagonally bordering cells of a specific cell can influence it.</p><p>Label transitions from one generation to the next is done for all cells according to the following rules:</p><p>A cell labelled 1, is transferred to label 2 (if present in this trial)</p><p>A cell labelled 2, passes over to label 3 (if present in this trial), 3 goes to 4 etc.</p><p>A cell with the final label of refractoriness for this trial, changes to 0 in the next generation. For example, for equal operating (1) and refractory (2) periods, only these labels exist and the system follows the rule: .</p><p>A cell labelled 0, transfers to 1 in the following generation if one or more of its \"cell neighbors\" was operative, i.e., labelled 1 at the present generation.</p><p>For the FFM case, a cell whose label is 1, transfers to 9 (inoperative) in the following generation.</p><p>The percolation in the system is investigated by rendering, at the beginning of each trial, a specific percentage, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">q</emphasis>, of cells to be inoperative, labelled 9 (site percolation). These are randomly spread among all grid cells, excluding the first and last rows of the grid. The percolation percentage is .</p><p>A \"run\" consists of starting the system (matrix) thus built, by a wave of AP, created as elucidated below, and running the system for enough generations (6 times the matrix size) so that all \"residual\" AP's can be collected at the final row. A \"trial\" consists of 40 runs, each performed for different random starting systems. Trials were performed for each <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> between 0 and 100 (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">q</emphasis> between 100 and 0).</p><p>At the start of each trial, all cells except those having a label 9 and those in the first row, are labelled 0. Cells of the first row are turned operative (labelled 1). This arrangement insures an AP wave through the system. In this work, only a single front of AP wave is treated. In this way, no active reentry mechanism is developed in the heart like system (see \"Discussion\"). Two consecutive waves, repeated stimulation in this framework and waves approaching from orthogonal directions will be discussed in future investigations.</p><p>We treat two questions here.</p><p>The first is a comparison of the percolation threshold of an SDP and of three others: a forest fire one, a different unidirectional system and a system devoid of refractory. The second is the transport and tortuosity of a system in which refractory time is equal to operative time (1 \u2192 2 \u2192 0), of different sizes and under increasing numbers of inoperative cells.</p><p>The first problem includes four systems of 100 \u00d7 100 cells are analyzed. These are: (1) A system with no refractory (1 \u2192 0). (2) A system with a refractory period of a single time unit (1 \u2192 2 \u2192 0) (3) A system similar to \"forest fire\" model (1 \u2192 9). (4) A DP in which a cell transfers from 0 to 1 only if one, or both, of its two upper diagonal neighbors is operative. Forty matrices of each system are treated, and the number of trials, in which at least one active cell survives, are counted and drawn as a function of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis>.</p><p>For the second issue, diverse sizes of (1 \u2192 2 \u2192 0) systems are analyzed, each with a number of different random <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">q</emphasis>'s and for a single starting wave of AP.</p><p>Several generations of a typical case are presented in Fig. 1A, where the complex development of the AP activation through the system is manifested. Numbers of active cells arriving at the last row (also called \"arriving AP\") are counted as a function of time units for a long time (6 times system's size). Figure 1B depicts an exemplary route of such active cells through the system very near the percolation threshold. The total number of such cells is called \"throughput' while the normalized average delay of arrival is the \"tortuosity\". If the system is devoid of obstacles (zero number of 9-cells), all active cells would arrive there exactly after a number of time units equivalent to the system's size. In this case throughput is maximal and tortuosity is one. With obstacles, some activity is lost, so throughput is diminished and active cells are delayed on their route to the end row, so tortuosity is increased. The trial average of 40 runs of numbers of active cells arriving at the last row as a function of time (units) is approximated by a Gaussian distribution. Near percolation, critical exponents for the parameters of this Gaussian are computed.Figure 1</p><p>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A</emphasis>) Several generations of a typical case: Matrix 20 \u00d7 20, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> = 60%.

Moreover, when analyzing a matrix with the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">same</emphasis> randomly distributed inoperative cells, results of the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">complete spatiotemporal development</emphasis> of active cells for the FFM and for the SDP systems turned out to be the same. Therefore, no regular critical exponents for the 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 0 will be presented case, as they are also identical to those of the FFM (1 \u2192 9).</p><p>Figure 2 represents the percolation results of these cases. All percolations occur at around . The likeness of the percolation graphs of the 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 0 case and that of the 1 \u2192 0 case (no refractory period) is probably unexpected, since the results for each run, on matrices of the two cases with the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">same</emphasis> randomly distributed inoperative cells, are <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">vastly</emphasis> different. This difference could clearly have been predicted, since for such runs, the amount of active cells reaching the end row is much higher for the second case.Figure 2</p><p>(Colors on line) Percolation curves for the four cases.

This average may be fitted by a normal distribution curve, namely:  whose parameters, ,  and  provide information related to the final amount, the average delay of its arrival and the average spread of the latter.

Note that here, these two parameters, namely the time (measured in generations) and the length of the route taken (measured in cell lengths), have the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">same value</emphasis>. This is unlike the hydrologic cases where these two are usually different. The reason for their equality here is that the AP can move down the region only one cell per generation. The minimum number of generations necessary for a starting AP to reach the opposite side of the investigated region is the region's length in unit cells, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L</emphasis>. The average length of the route, , taken by the AP to move from the initial position to the final one, is .

They can be found in the FFM literature.</p><p>There exist several path-finding algorithms. For example, the A* or A-star algorithm (See e.g. Ref.18), which finds the best (shortest) route from a specific cell to a target cell, or a random walk algorithm (See e.g. Ref.19) which can also evaluate tortuosity. It would be interesting to compare near percolation routes of AP in the present model (e.g., the route in Fig. 1B) with these methods.</p><p>Figure 3B shows the Gaussian average outcome of the active cells arrival at the end row of the system. The emergence of a Gaussian distribution of the average transport seems natural since the inoperative cells are randomly spread and the average is governed by the central limit theorem. Table 1 provides the parameters of such average outcomes for different matrix sizes and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis>'s. The appearance of critical behaviors of both  (and tortuosity, \u03c4) and  (throughput) near percolation (Fig. 4), is similar to the hydrological16 or electrical results, although the critical exponents are different (e.g. for \u03c4 ~ \u2212 0.15 vs. \u2212 0.28 from Eq. 50 and values in Ref.17) and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L</emphasis> does not have the same influence. We do not expect a precise correspondence since no \"driving potential\" exists here, as noted above.</p><p>Note that all following discussion pertain to the specific model treated here.</p><p>In the heart tissue, such percolation problems could arise when a portion of the heart tissue is riddled with scars20, fibrosis20, 21 or fatty globules22.</p><p>Fibrosis in the heart develops in many pathogeneses in the body (see the comprehensive Ref.22). It can induce a variety of heart problems by changing the tissue structure, such as fibrotic expansion of the cardiac interstitium, stiffer ventricles etc.22. We discuss here only arrhythmias, which can be prompted23 by fibrosis. As shown by Ref.24, results in rodent models imply that fibrotic areas cause slower kinetics or even a disruption of impulse propagation. These results are depicted in the present model by the tortuosity and transport on the one hand, and the approach to a complete AP stoppage for fibrosis percentage near percolation threshold on the other.</p><p>The relation between fibrosis and atrial fibrillation appears in several studies25. This and other fibrosis developed arrhythmic malfunctions are usually induced by an active reentry mechanism, a closed path on which an AP pulse is rotating, inducing target waves, spirals or double spirals in the tissue. Alongside with the fibrotic area in which a reentry route (RR) may develop, the \"activation\" of the RR needs additional factors. No activation can take place without a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">unidirectional block</emphasis> and the latter can probably be induced only by the influence of two or more consecutive AP waves arriving at the RR.</p><p>In the model discussed here, there can be no <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">active</emphasis> reentry circuit for a movement of a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">single AP front</emphasis>. For, suppose an RR exists in the percolation matrix. In the absence of a unidirectional block, the development would be as follows. It is well known that when two AP waves meet, they annihilate each other. An AP reaching the RR on its way would enter and proceed by moving on it <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">in both forward directions</emphasis>. Thus, if their passage times are different, the faster AP would emerge on the other end if it is open. In this case, the faster AP would also enter the route of the slower one and annihilate it. In any case, no circulating (active) reentry route would be possible.</p><p>The influence of a fibrotic spot (FS) in the heart tissue can depend on its position inside the heart. The delay and the lower AP amount reaching its other side caused by the FS, besides reducing contraction in the spot itself, can lead to problems in the adjoining tissue. If the FS encounters an obstacle, such as a scar, the heart boundary or a blood vessel, the region there may suffer too. If, however, the FS is surrounded by healthy tissue, then, under a single stimulation, the AP in the healthy tissue will arrive first and will in fact erase the delay of the FS in the next area. The scenario here is as follows. Consider an FS, of impaired tissue within a healthy one. The impairment can be a scar, fibrosis, tumor etc. We consider here only a fibrotic FS as treated here. If the action potential's conduction velocity (CV) is slowed down in FS, as we have shown it to be, one could assume that any action potential (AP) emerging from the FS, say AP1, would be delayed with respect to the AP in the healthy tissue outside A, say AP2. The former AP, AP1, could turn backwards without encountering AP2 creating an active reentry path. This however cannot happen without a unidirectional block. Thus, fortunately for animals, if the fibrotic area (FS) is surrounded by healthy tissue, the AP, moving faster in the healthy tissue than in the FS and arriving earlier on the other, distant, side of the FS, can move around the latter and squash (annihilate) any late arriving AP from the FS. The reason for this is the following. The AP2, being faster than AP1, can rotate around the distant boundary of FS and enter the FS itself, moving backwards there, and mutually annihilating with any AP1. In the present model this annihilation is carried out by \"merging\" of the two cells, i.e. by both activating the last intermediary cell between them, and the latter expiring, having refractory cells in both of its directions. Thus, if a healthy tissue surrounds the fibrotic one, it may quench the intermittent behavior of the FS. Otherwise, The FS can possibly be morbid for a fibrotic patient.</p><p>Although we have presented results for a normal distribution of the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">average</emphasis> behavior of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">different</emphasis> fibrotic tissues, for a specific patient it is a definite single fibrotic case with the erratic behavior shown as one of the individual graphs in Fig. 3A.</p><p>The spatial distribution of the arriving AP's is also of interest. In fibrotic tissues, the electricity emerges unevenly. There exist \"breaking locations\" where AP appear after its tortuous journey. Following breaking, these AP's can encounter inoperative cells on the last row of the matrix on both of their sides, in which case no additional cells become activated. If, however, one or both sides of the arriving AP were in the waiting (0) mode, there would be additional adjacent operative cells in the next generations. An example of this spatiotemporal behavior is shown in Fig. 5 for a 50 \u00d7 50 matrix with 25% fibrosis (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> = 75).Figure 5</p><p>(Colors on line) Active (AP) cells arrivals at the end row of the matrix for a specific trial of a 50 \u00d7 50 fibrotic tissue (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> = 75%). Abscissa \u2013 No. of cell along the row, Ordinate\u2014Time of arrival (time units from wave starting time).</p><p>It is seen that there are only 11 breaking locations (blue), in order of arrival: (A) cells Nos. 16, 25 and 41, arriving on generation 56. (B) location 39 arriving at 57 etc. Note that, for a specific patient, these locations would emit the AP intermittently in time at each incoming wave. The other 21 cells (red) are activated along the last row.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conclusions</emphasis></p><p>The major results of this study for a fibrotic heart tissue are: (1) A fibrotic area induces delays in the active cells, reductions in their quantity and spreads in their arrival, both spatially and temporally. Both these delays and quantity reductions behave critically near percolation. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">(</emphasis>2) A single wave moving in a heart like model of a refractory period equal or larger than the active period, is identical to a movement in a forest fire model, including the percolation curves. This behavior can possibly be broken for multiple waves. (3) Therefore, even in a fibrotic area and even if surrounded by healthy setting, no active reentry mechanism can be initiated under a single stimulation. Conceivably, multiple waves or shorter refractory period, are needed for such a purpose.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><p>[1].Saberi, AA.

But they show how just a handful of people with roles in the country's decentralized election system can try to muck up the process and try to sow chaos in elections. And they demonstrate the continued hold that former President Donald Trump's unfounded conspiracy theories of widespread election fraud have over his allies and supporters around the country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At least two counties on Monday voted to not certify their respective county elections: Cochise County in Arizona, where county supervisors voted 2-1 to delay certification until at least Friday, beyond the Monday statutory deadline, and Luzerne County in Pennsylvania, where the county board deadlocked 2-2 on a certification vote, with one abstention who later said he would vote to certify at a future meeting.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Counties failing to certify elections is largely unprecedented in recent American history, even after the 2020 election, and litigation is basically guaranteed.</p><p>Marc Elias, a prominent attorney in the Democratic Party, tweeted shortly after the vote that the Arizona county would be sued, after his firm sent a letter on behalf of a seniors group threatening a lawsuit if the board did not certify the results. Monday evening, his firm followed through with that threat, filing a lawsuit in state court seeking to force Cochise to certify its election results.</p><p>\"Defendants voted against canvassing the 2022 general election results until at least December 2, 2022, and have thus made clear that they will not comply with their non-discretionary, mandatory legal duty to complete the canvass by the statutory deadline to do so. In doing so, Defendants are violating Arizona law,\" the suit argued.</p><p>Meanwhile, Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs also filed a suit with similar aims late Monday. Last week, her office sent a letter last week to the Cochise County board, in which state elections director Kori Lorick promised legal action, further warning that if the board had not certified by the state's canvassing deadline, the state would proceed regardless. </p><p>Hobbs, a Democrat, is also the state's governor-elect. She defeated Republican Kari Lake, a former TV anchor who has refused to concede the race.</p><p>\"Absent this Court's intervention, the Secretary will have no choice but to complete the statewide canvass by December 8 without Cochise County's votes included,\" attorneys for Hobbs wrote. \"The Board's unprecedented inaction should not disenfranchise tens of thousands of voters in Cochise County.\" Lake carried the county by 18 points.</p><p>Cochise County supervisors voted Monday to call for a special meeting Friday about the security of their voting machines, saying they would like to hear further presentations on whether they were properly certified for use in the midterm election.</p><p>The secretary of state's office did not directly address litigation in a statement after the Cochise County vote on Monday. \"The Secretary of State's Office provided supporting documentation that confirmed Cochise County's election equipment was properly certified,\" Sophia Solis, a spokesperson for the office, wrote in an email. \"The Board of Supervisors had all of the information they needed to certify this election and failed to uphold their responsibility for Cochise voters.\"</p><p>Pennsylvania's Luzerne County had serious problems on Election Day, where voting centers ran out of paper ballots early in the day. A court order there eventually kept polling places open for two additional hours so voters would be able to cast ballots, and Spotlight PA reported that the local district attorney is investigating the shortage.</p><p>Elias, the Democratic attorney, seemed to allude to a potential lawsuit there. And a statement from the Pennsylvania Department of State late Monday afternoon said that the department \"has reached out to [Luzerne] officials to inquire about the board's decision and their intended next steps.\"</p><p>But the results in Luzerne will likely be certified soon, even absent immediate court action. Daniel Schramm, a Democrat on the county board who voted to abstain from the vote earlier Monday, said in an interview with the Associated Press later Monday that he would soon vote to certify the results.</p><p>\"I wanted to research to see exactly how many people were just not allowed to vote. I couldn't find any,\" Schramm told the AP, telling the wire service that election officials contacted two-thirds of the workers who ran individual polling places and \"they reported nobody was turned away.\" The AP reported that a meeting to certify the results has been scheduled for Wednesday.</p><p>An attorney for the county had told board members during the meeting that it was possible the state or candidates could \"file actions\" after the county failed to certify the election.</p><p>There are few examples in recent elections of a county refusing to certify legitimate results. Earlier in the year, Otero County, N.M., initially refused to certify election results in the state's summer primary. The New Mexico secretary of state sued, and the state Supreme Court ordered the county to certify, which it ultimately did.</p><p>The Cochise County board meeting Monday morning was brief. But during the Luzerne County meeting and in another meeting in Maricopa County, Arizona's largest county, angry people demanded that county officials not certify the vote, sometimes calling for a new election to be held.</p><p>In Maricopa, protesters targeted both board Chair Bill Gates and Recorder Stephen Richer, both Republicans, after tabulation machines at many polling places in the county were unable to read ballots on the day of the election. (Voters who faced problems could have chosen to instead submit their ballots to be tabulated at a central voting site, and some sites saw long lines.) One person appeared to call for Gates to be executed for treason during a public hearing on Monday.</p><p>After an hours-long hearing, Maricopa's Republican-dominated board voted unanimously to certify the election. Lake, the losing gubernatorial candidate, tweeted out several videos with people chastising election officials in in Maricopa County.</p><p>Elsewhere, the certification process also faced protests, but officials still certified the vote. In Michigan, for example, the state's bipartisan board of state canvassers voted unanimously on Monday to certify the results of the state's election. Kristina Karamo - the Trump-endorsed candidate for secretary of state who was handily defeated earlier this month - pleaded with the board not to certify but was rejected, and the canvassers briefly left the room due to disruptions.</p><p>\"A lot of the questions that arise are from lack of proper understanding, which is unfortunately fed by candidates and party officials on both sides of the aisle who feed into this nonsense, who make these claims that fire everybody up because it's a short-term gain for them and that's dangerous to our system,\" Tony Daunt, the Republican chair of the board, said during the meeting, according to the Detroit Free Press. \"And me talking about this is essentially trying to put out a forest fire with a Dixie cup right now.\"</p><p>Holly Otterbein contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-00071024</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66YY-23J1-JDJ6-K1YY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-12-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1238\"/><timeReceived>10:21 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"11\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>November 28, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>Elections</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTlGMTIwRjY1ODQ4NDQyRUE1MkJFMUQwMTE1MDhGQjY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX001648</classCode><className>SUITS &amp;

The action-oriented dialogue was co-organized by the Ministry of Civil Protection of Greece and the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR). It contributes to regional efforts on climate change adaptation and supports the implementation of the 'EFDRR Roadmap 2021-2030' and the 'Arab Region's Prioritized Plan of Action 2021-2024', as well as the 'Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030'.</p><p>During the past summer, many countries in the Eastern Mediterranean region and beyond have experienced periods of extreme temperatures and heatwaves, causing devastating wildfires that have resulted in burnt areas being four times greater than the 2006-2021 average across Europe, according to the European Forest Fire Information System . An enhanced understanding of measures to manage wildfire and heat risks is urgently needed to address the increasingly long wildfire seasons that are impacting more areas and populations than before. Furthermore, the recent IPCC report has identified the Eastern Mediterranean region as a climate change \"hotspot\" and indicated that the region will experience warming that is 20% higher than average.</p><p>The climate emergency calls for strengthened collaboration between countries to develop common strategies for addressing extreme temperatures and heatwaves as well as to share experience that contribute to the prevention of wildfires and curb the devastating impacts of these hazardous events. The participants discussed adaptation to extreme temperatures, including the adoption of nature-based solutions, particularly in urban areas, as well as the need to shift from a focus on fire suppression to prevention to address the increasingly violent and rapidly spreading wildfires. They discussed cross-border compatibility and use of data for climate projections, forecasting and early warning systems. More than 150 participants, including ministers, experts, and stakeholders from the region, attended four sessions of the hybrid event.</p><p>The Ministerial Roundtable focused on sharing experiences, identifying solutions, and enhancing the political momentum and commitments to address the risks and impacts of extreme temperatures, heatwaves and wildfires, whilst accelerating the implementation of the Sendai Framework in the region.</p><p>Mr. Christos Stylianides, Minister for Climate Crisis and Civil Protection, in his opening remarks, said: \"We have the opportunity to discuss at a high political level, because we all agree that business as usual is simply not enough. Today's Action-oriented dialogue aims at engaging all stakeholders, the whole of society, in our combined efforts to boost cooperation in the region. Therefore, we should capitalize on existing structures, taking advantage of the successful European Union Civil Protection Mechanism to act as an umbrella for promoting regional cooperation in the East Mediterranean. I am confident that this meeting will mark the beginning of a process which will actually implement actions. There is still much to be done, but our societies want us to continue working towards building resilient cities, regions, and countries.\"</p><p>Ms. Mami Mizutori, Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction, highlighted: \"There is an urgent need to ramp up disaster risk reduction as part of the solution to address the climate emergency, while raising and achieving climate ambition\". She further called the countries \"to work towards creating a world with Zero Climate Disasters. A future, where extreme temperatures, heatwaves and wildfires do not have to devastate. For that, we must enact the changes that reduce the impact of future crises.\".</p><p>The action-oriented dialogue included three technical sessions that focused on the role of technology in tackling climate issues; empowering local authorities and local partnerships to address climate change, develop local resilience plans, adapt to the extreme temperatures and heat waves; and the implementation of a whole of society approach to resilience-building, which ensures that groups at risk are included in disaster risk reduction processes. These technical sessions exchanged on lessons learnt and gathered recommendations on the way to advance regional cooperation on the respective topics, which fed into the outcome document presented at the Ministerial Roundtable.</p><p>Background information</p><p>Participating countries and entities:</p><p>lbania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, France, Greece, Egypt, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Lebanon, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Palestine, Romania, Turkiye, Council of Europe, Disaster Preparedness and Prevention Initiative for South Eastern Europe, European Commission, Union for the Mediterranean.</p><p>About the EFDRR Roadmap 2020-2030</p><p>The European Forum for Disaster Risk Reduction Roadmap 2021-2030 supports the Sendai Framework's coordinated implementation of disaster risk reduction and related Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals. The Roadmap 2021-2030 builds on the 2015-2020 Roadmap and lessons from the Covid-19 response and recovery. The new Roadmap recommends four action areas for accelerating the implementation of the Sendai Framework's priorities and to create a more disaster-resilient region by 2030:</p><p>Understanding and communicating existing, emerging and future systemic risks;</p><p>Inclusive and collaborative systems for governance and decision-making;</p><p>Supporting investments in resilience;</p><p>Preparedness for response and resilient recovery.</p><p>Find out more here.</p><p>About the Arab Region's Prioritized Plan of Action 2021-2024</p><p>The Prioritized Plan of Action 2021-2024 was developed and endorsed by Arab states as an outcome document of the Fifth Arab Regional Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction, hosted by the Government of Morocco in November 2021. The Prioritized Action Plan 2021-2024 aims to provide measurable DRR actions under each of the four priorities for action of Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction to support the implementation of the Framework and the Arab Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction and its Programme of Work. Arab states convene twice a year together with all relevant stakeholders and UN agencies to follow up on the implementation of the Prioritized Action Plans and discuss progress, challenges and gaps with the aim to put forward recommendations for accelerating the achievement of the set targets. The first Prioritized Action Plan was prepared after the endorsement of the Arab Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction to cover the period from 2018 to 2020 and was adopted by Arab states as an outcome document at the Africa-Arab Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction, hosted by the Government of Tunisia in October 2018.</p><p>About the EFDRR Action-oriented Dialogues</p><p>The EFDRR Roadmap action-oriented dialogues are a series of multilateral thematic dialogues led by governments, in partnership with UNDRR, aimed at sharing experiences and developing adapted policies and actions to address pressing disaster risk reduction-related issues, and to enhance transboundary cooperation to accelerate the implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125512230</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66NP-5BG1-DYTH-G264-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-10-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1262\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"10\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>October 21, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Kymeta is pitching the land mobility Ku-band antenna as a communication solution for government, defense, and first responder customers. It covers the full Ku-band and is capable of operating on Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) networks. Kymeta Vice President of Product Lilac Muller told <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Via Satellite</emphasis> that this product was redesigned from the previous u7 antenna not only with improvements to the core technology, but also for usability and quick connectivity.\u00c2\u00a0 \"We have built-in cellular cellular connection, and a built-in SD-WAN router with a Wi-Fi bubble. You turn on your car, the system connects, and you have a Wi Fi bubble around you. The user shouldn't be thinking about the technology and the antenna, they should just be connected and that's what we had in mind when we designed this product,\" she said.\u00c2\u00a0 Neville Meijers, Kymeta chief product and marketing officer told <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Via Satellite</emphasis> the product has been designed specifically for land mobility needs in that it has high environmental tolerance to operate in extreme hot and cold environments, and it has been designed to use low power and it operates on a vehicle without any additional power than the battery.\u00c2\u00a0 Kymeta is selling the u8 as an antenna; an ODU which allows customers to connect to their own modem; and a turnkey terminal with embedded satellite modem, cellular modem, and SD-WAN capabilities. </p><p>Kymeta is also offering a purchasing option designed for users like first responders, an end-to-end subscription package to the hardware and Kymeta Connect hybrid satellite-cellular connectivity service.\u00c2\u00a0 \"There are a lot of customers like first responders who have never bought satellite capacity and probably without this land mobile solution would never even contemplate buying satellite capacity,\" Meijers said. \"We want to offer the customer a very easy way to adopt our product from an end-to-end perspective, so we packaged together the hardware, together with the network. Having this ability to provide them with always-on communication resonates very strongly with them.\"\u00c2\u00a0 \"We believe that the combination of our service, together with our unique hardware is going to open up the land mobility space in a way that people have been asking for for many years, but has never happened,\" he added.\u00c2\u00a0 The product launch follows after <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.satellitetoday.com/business/2020/08/25/bill-gates-leads-kymetas-85m-funding-round/\">beta trials kicked off in August</url>, testing the product around the world in North America, Asia-Pacific region, and Europe. Kymeta reports beta testing demonstrated throughputs of over 45 Mbps in land mobile environment with large scan-off angles of over 50 degrees. Muller said customer response to the trials has been \"incredible.\"\u00c2\u00a0 Also in August, Kymeta closed an $85 million funding round led by Bill Gates, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.satellitetoday.com/business/2020/08/18/kymeta-acquires-service-provider-lepton-global-to-ramp-up-go-to-market-push/\">acquired satellite service provider\u00c2\u00a0Lepton Global Solutions LLC</url>, to strengthen its go-to-market position for the u8 and Kymeta Connect. The <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">U.S. Forest Service</emphasis> has the Kymeta antenna installed on its vehicles, Kymeta announced in its Monday press release.\u00c2\u00a0 \"My team works in some of the most densely populated, rugged, and steep forest terrain in the U.S.,\" commented Tim Dunfee, deputy forest fire chief of the U.S. Forest Service. \"There are places across our varied terrain that have been engulfed by fires and communications cell towers that have been destroyed, causing loss of all communications. When we tested Kymeta's solutions, we could use FaceTime and make voice calls for the first time. We now have a Kymeta antenna installed on one of our vehicles and deploy it to every forest fire.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SATTDY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SATTDY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61FV-16T1-DYTC-0011-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">277894</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"603\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Access Intelligence, LLC.

In the climactic scene of \"The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst,\" the New York real estate heir could be heard in a bathroom muttering: \"What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.\" \"What I did not say out loud or, perhaps I said very softly, is: \u2018They'll all think I killed them all, of course,'\" he testified. House Dems introduce voting rights bill: House Democrats introduced a voting rights bill Tuesday on the site where the late Georgia congressman John Lewis was brutally assaulted in 1965 as he and others marched for civil rights for Black Americans. Standing at the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala., Democratic Rep. Terri Sewell, Alabama, led Democrats in advocating for the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would protect voters from discrimination by restoring and strengthening elements of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHDLY-0001296929</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHDLY2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63D9-NX71-JBRC-V51V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163823</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"399\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Paddock Publications, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Daily Herald</publicationName><edition>WEB EditionNC1 EditionNC2 EditionMF12 EditionNC3 EditionNM1 EditionNC EditionNC14 EditionMC1 EditionMC3 EditionMD1 EditionML2 EditionNL1 EditionNC14C EditionNC4 EditionCLFM EditioneBlast Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 18, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Improper Tabulation</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDRDMUU3QzgzQ0RCNDBGREFBRDNFRjY3MjdDRTcwQTg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6N0U1MEVBQUFGMjc2NDk4Qjg0QkY0OUM4N0QyNkNCNjU</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjY5MjRCQzAyQjY0NDJFMThDNkJCNjdGQzMxNkY4RjY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6N0U1MEVBQUFGMjc2NDk4Qjg0QkY0OUM4N0QyNkNCNjU</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Enforcement Actions</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzU2Mjg1NDVEOUU5NDE1NzlFOUZDNDU0M0MwNUFEMkU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDRDMjRGNDlCRkYxNDkzNEIwMzIzNTk0NEExQ0YzMTc</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODAxMkJDODE1OEM0NERCNzhFOUU1OTdGRTA1OUI1NTg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDRDMjRGNDlCRkYxNDkzNEIwMzIzNTk0NEExQ0YzMTc</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Elections</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkQ5M0E3QzA1NkNENEExM0ExNDBCNDQ3QTdERUU5NkQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkM1MTYwRDE0NkJBNEVFMEIxQjM3RUE2NDRFQUFEODY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Just ahead, devastating scenes in Maui where dozens have lost their lives to raging wildfires, the latest from Hawaii just ahead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then horrific violence in Ecuador as a presidential candidate is assassinated after a campaign event less than two weeks before the elections there more on what we know. And Russia on edge after a string of attacks and a massive explosion, a closer look at the mood inside the country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We begin with the breaking news in Hawaii where the death toll from wildfires raging through the Island of Maui has jumped dramatically now to 36. The U.S. Coast Guard and Navy helicopters are being used in search and rescue efforts as firefighters, battle the flames and residents get out any way they can.</p><p>Hawaii's Lieutenant Governor Sylvia Luke warns that it will take years for Maui to recover from the destruction brought by these wildfires. Hawaii's Director of Economic Development and Tourism spoke to CNN a short time ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES TOKIOKA, DIRECTOR AT DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND TOURISM: One of the meetings earlier it's our understanding that the fires are not totally contained. But they're not blazing like they were last night because the winds have died down. Maui Forest Fire Department Chief Brad Ventura and his team have been doing an incredible job given the circumstances.</p><p>We couldn't get the helicopters up because of the wind. But now that the wind has subsided, they're working on the dumps with water onto the affected area.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACFARLANE: And do searching because we'll have much more about this later in the show including a live report from the ground. Ecuador is under a state of emergency after a presidential candidate was gunned down at a campaign event. It was captured here on video and we want to warn you the footage is disturbing.</p><p>Fernando Villavicencio was leaving a rally at a school near the capital Quito when shots rang out. Here's the moment it happened. Well, this comes just 10 days before the presidential election as a lawmaker Villavicencio was outspoken about corruption and the violence caused by drug trafficking.</p><p>Our Rafael Romo joining us now with the latest on the situation and Rafael, we know that Ecuador has been rocked by gang violence in recent years, but this is really a shocking event for the country. Just walk us through what we know what happened in this attack?</p><p>RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Shocking indeed, Christina and very brazenness. Well the attack happened right after the presidential candidate had finished a rally at a school in Quito Ecuador's capital, according to campaign aides, contacted by CNN and a video that appears to show the moment of the attack.</p><p>All of a sudden, a burst of gunfire was heard as he was getting into a waiting vehicle. Several people were hit by the bullets, including Fernando Villavicencio, a 59 year old activist, journalist and politician who was running in Ecuador's presidential elections to be held in less than two weeks August 20.</p><p>As Villavicencio gets in the backseat of the vehicle at least 12 gunshots can be heard. A policeman quickly closes the door behind Villavicencio and many people are seen taking cover from the gunfire including his security detail. The Ecuadorian Attorney General's office later said that at least nine people were injured in the attack including a candidate for the National Assembly and two Police officers, Christina.</p><p>Current Ecuadorian President Guillermo Lasso later said on social media that he is outraged and shocked. He called the attack and assassination. Lasso also expressed solidarity and sent his condolences to Villavicencio's wife and daughters. He also vowed that this crime will not go unpunished, Christina, back to you.</p><p>MACFARLANE: All right, Rafael Romo there with the latest on that shocking event out of Ecuador. Thank you. Now to several new developments in Ukraine, authorities have ordered a mandatory evacuation around the city in the Kharkiv region due to intense Russian shelling heavy combat also continues in Southern Ukraine.</p><p>[08:05:00]</p><p>Meanwhile, the Russian controlled Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant lost connection to its main remaining external power line. A state owned power generating company says the plant has had to switch to a backup line. Our Chief International Security Correspondent Nick Paton Walsh joins us live from Zaporizhzhia with the latest.</p><p>Nick, I want to talk to you about what is occurring in the Kharkiv region and Kupyansk because this is one of the town's, one of the regions that were liberated by Ukraine last September. So how significant are these orders for an evacuation today?</p><p>NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yes, certainly, it's a change of focus and the change really of Ukraine controlling the narrative. This is a place that has been the focus of Russian advances, Russian investment, frankly, of artillery and troops over the past week.</p><p>So it does appear to be having enough of an impact that Ukrainian officials have issued that mandatory evacuation order, Kupyansk were there months ago, a large enough town for this if there are indeed enough people still living in the wreckage there. Member law has gone back since it was liberated to mean that the Ukrainians are concerned about Russian activity around.</p><p>In fact, Ukrainian officials suggesting that as many as 600 artillery attacks may have occurred there in the last 24 hours or so this is right up to the northeast, from where I'm standing. And where Ukraine's counter offensive is putting most of its focus. And so you could argue this is perhaps a bid by the Russians to distract Ukrainian forces that are trying to amass here.</p><p>Perhaps take some pressure off the slightly southern focus of Russia's previous advances, Bakhmut. It is unclear what their larger strategic goal is because Kharkiv the city, well, that's pushed the Russians back significantly. And this is some drive away from there.</p><p>But it may be a bit, too by a bit of breathing space, perhaps for the Russians in the north, and possibly withdraw Ukrainian resources that may otherwise have been sent to the southern front here where I should say we are still hearing reports of heavy fighting. Russian officials suggesting that a lot of the settlements along the front line where Ukraine is trying to advance are getting hit quite hard.</p><p>We've seen ourselves that there are gradual moves forward by Ukrainian officials. And then there's a whole separate narrative too frankly in Kherson, the Dnieper River of suggestions that Ukrainian forces there made a brief crossing and of causing some trouble for the Russians there too.</p><p>So a lot moving, I should just give you some context about the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. That is essentially concerns about the main power supply. There is a backup supply the Russian officials managing it so they're going to get that main power supply back on track.</p><p>They think so a sign of potentially a crisis down the line, but at the moment, known it seems no major cause for alarm, Christina.</p><p>MACFARLANE: All right, Nick Paton Walsh with the latest from Zaporizhzhia there on all of this, thanks, Nick. Let's switch to Russia though, because Russia is saying its shot down two drones headed to Moscow and fall another attack near Crimea. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is up for us for more on this from Berlin.</p><p>And Fred, this just the latest in a string of attempts to target the capital, I believe these attempts were foiled. What impact is this having?</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think it has a pretty major impact. And I think you're absolutely right. It's a string of attempts, but it also is becoming almost a daily occurrence. And, you know, we have those two very separate areas. On the one hand, you have the area around Sevastopol in occupied Crimea.</p><p>But you also have the Russian capital as well. If we look at Sevastopol, that seems like a pretty straight forward military target. That is the main base of the RussianBlack Sea fleet. And the Russian was saying that they shot down two drones there near the Sevastopol area and also took down nine additional Ukrainian drones over the Black Sea.</p><p>Some of them using the electronic countermeasures, but some of them are also being shot down as well. But I think that the Moscow situation is certainly one that is very troubling right now for the Russian leadership. You have those two drones that the Russians say they shot down tonight, and I was sort of looking at the area where that happened.</p><p>One of it was around a Kaluga, which I would say is around 150 kilometers southwest of Moscow, a new restring of town called the garden rings, very beautiful towns Kaluga, by the way, as well, that's still pretty far away from the capital. But the other one is near the sort of beltway highway around Moscow road called the MKAD, which means that it was pretty close to actually being on the territory of the Russian capital.</p><p>And of course, there were also drone attacks that happened yesterday that were foiled also by the Russians and near Moscow as well. And then last week, of course, we had attacks that took place and actually hit the financial district in Moscow. So certainly something that will be troubling and even the spokesman for the Kremlin said at that point in time, it's a security threat, Christina.</p><p>MACFARLANE: Yes, certainly is that Fred Pleitgen there, thank you. Well, let's return now to our top story this hour. At least 36 people have been killed in unprecedented wildfires that are sweeping through the Hawaiian island of Maui. Thousands of people have been displaced.</p><p>And as the flames closed in, many residents made harrowing escapes by boat car or swimming into the ocean.</p><p>[08:10:00]</p><p>Winds are decreasing overnight as Hurricane Dora. Hundreds of kilometers to the south are moving farther away from the islands. It has been fueling the flames. Well, CNN's Veronica Miracle joins us now live from Maui, Hawaii. Veronica, the news of these 36 deaths is just devastating for this small community, bring us up to date on that toll and also the efforts to try and control these wildfires. How that's going?</p><p>VERONICA MIRACLE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Christina, it's absolutely devastating. This information coming in overnight, it is the middle of the night here in Maui. So many residents will be waking up to this news that those 36 people that their community members, friends and loved ones have died.</p><p>And it is fear that there are more in terms of the firefighting efforts. That fire in behind it that devastated and decimated that area is one of three fires currently burning on the island. Firefighting efforts continue as well as search and rescue efforts. And also --</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look at the harbor.</p><p>MIRACLE (voice over): The view from above is of shock and heartbreak.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh my god.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We were not prepared for what we saw. It looked like an area that had been bombed in the war.</p><p>MIRACLE (voice over): Wildfires rampaging across the island of Maui.</p><p>DUSTIN KALEIOPU, LOST HOUSE IN MAUI WILDFIRE (ph): Our entire street was burned to the ground.</p><p>MIRACLE (voice over): Decimating homes and businesses.</p><p>TOKIOKA: Local people have lost everything. They've lost their house. They've lost their animals and it's devastating.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Lahaina is on fire.</p><p>MIRACLE (voice over): The historic town of Lahaina, a popular tourist and economic hub on the island's West Side, particularly affected with hundreds of structures impacted.</p><p>VOICE OF CLAIRE KENT, HOUSE BURNED IN LAHAINA ON MAUI (ph): It happened so fast. People stuck in traffic trying to get out and they're -- on both sides of the road like something out of a horror movie.</p><p>MIRACLE (voice over): Most of the fires on Maui fueled in part by violent winds caused by Hurricane Dora churning more than 800 miles away. Those winds now subsiding as the storm pushes away.</p><p>MAJOR GENERAL KENNETH S. HARA, ADJUTANT GENERAL AT HAWAII STATE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE: The primary focus is to save lives and to prevent human suffering and mitigate great property loss.</p><p>MIRACLE (voice over): State Department crews assisting in efforts to restore communication across the islands and distribute water with military helicopters aiding and extinguishing the fires.</p><p>HARA: To CH-47 supporting Maui County, they flew 13 hours did 58 drops and about 150,000 gallons of water to assist with suppression of the fire.</p><p>MIRACLE (voice over): Recovery will be a long road ahead according to Hawaii's Lieutenant Governor Sylvia Luke.</p><p>LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR SYLVIA LUKE, HAWAII: The damage to the infrastructure. It's not just buildings. I mean, these were small businesses that invested in Mali. These were local residents. And, you know, we need to figure out a way to help a lot of people in the next several years.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIRACLE: And Christina, 11,000 people were flown out of Maui yesterday, another 1500 people expected to leave today. Airlines are increasing their flights. They're reducing their fares. They're asking people officials who are asking people to leave the island. They're also asking people to cancel their vacations and to not come here to save the resources so desperately needed by those who need it here on this island, Christina.</p><p>MACFARLANE: Yes, so many thousands of tourists as well as we know on the island at the moment, Veronica, we will check back in with you on a regular basis. Thank you so much there, live from Maui. Now, right now West African leaders are meeting in Nigeria's capital to discuss how to respond to the coup in Niger.</p><p>And these are live pictures of the meeting taking place now being led by the President of Niger who is also the Chair of ECOWAS the Economic Community of West Africa has threatened the possible use of force if the ouster of President isn't reinstated. Its demands have so far been ignored.</p><p>So the block is now meeting to decide next steps. The democratically elected President Mohamed Bazoum says he has been kept in isolation with dwindling food and no medicine or electricity. Meantime, the coup leaders have just unveiled a new government.</p><p>CNN's Larry Madowo has been following the story and joins us now live from Nairobi, Kenya, as a sailor at that meeting been underway now for a couple of hours. What is the expectation for what may come out of that today? And what more are you hearing on the health of the ouster of President Bazoum?</p><p>LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: All right, Christina, let me begin with this meeting happening right now ECOWAS leaders back in Abuja, the Nigerian capital to deliberate on how they will handle the situation in Niger.</p><p>[08:15:00]</p><p>They promised in the last met at another extraordinary summit that if the military content Niger did not reinstate President Mohamed Bazoum within a week they would use all measures, including force that deadline passed on Sunday evening. So, now at this meeting that's going on right now. They have to determine if they will, in fact sending their armies or they will find other diplomatic or political solutions. Some countries in the region have said they will contribute troops to this ECOWAS mission, if it were to happen. The Foreign Minister in Senegal, which is a member of ECOWAS said they would contribute troops because Niger is one coup to many.</p><p>Why is that one coup to many? Because that same region that had 7, 8 coups distanced in 2020, in Burkina Faso, in Mali, in Guinea and in Niger, if this is successful. So while that is going on, let's talk about President Mohamed Bazoum, who has been held since July 26.</p><p>He says now he's running out of food. He has not had human contact since August 4, and not even access to his doctor who's the one used to bring him foodstuffs and medicines and all that. And the U.S. is now saying that they are concerned about his safety. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEW MILLER, SPOKESMAN OF U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT: With respect to President Bazoum. We are greatly worried about his health and his personal safety and the personal safety of his family. In all the conversations Secretary Blinken has had with President Bazoum inquiring about his safety has been the first things.</p><p>He's brought up is one of the reasons that Acting Deputy Secretary Nuland wanted to see him personally when she was in the country on Monday, and it's a matter that remains of concern to us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MADOWO: So the last time President Mohamed Bazoum was seen in public was July 31, when he met with the transitional President of Chad, Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno. So far has been receiving calls, Christina, but has not been seen since then.</p><p>MACFARLANE: All right, and then Larry will continue to follow this story is that meeting continues in the house to come. Larry Madowo, there from Nairobi thank you. OK, still to come. Search and rescue efforts continue on the Hawaiian Island of Maui where wildfires blazed a path of destruction here from one resident holding out hope for his loved ones.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACFARLANE: Let's return to the devastating wildfires ravaging the Hawaiian Island of Maui, at least 36 people have died. Officials warn the death toll could be much higher as search and rescue efforts are still underway in what was once a popular tourist spot.</p><p>The historic town of Lahaina is destroyed and hundreds of people and families are displaced. Most of the fires on Maui were fueled in part by violent winds from Hurricane Dora which is now nearly 1300 kilometers away, causing the winds to decrease slightly.</p><p>And I want to bring in Meteorologist Jennifer Gray. And Jennifer, I guess the fact that the winds are beginning to die down is a good sign but obviously very challenging conditions here for search and rescue teams to be operating in.</p><p>[08:20:00]</p><p>JENNIFER GRAY, CNN METEOROLOGIST: You're right I mean the winds decreasing are very good news but the damage is really already been done just immense damage across Maui. So you were mentioning the winds and what led to all of this. You're right. It's basically a two part scenario, we had Hurricane Dora that was just south of the Hawaiian Islands a good 700 miles at its closest approach.</p><p>And then we have this strong area of high pressure to the north. So these both working together created very strong winds funneling between the strong areas of low pressure, which was Dora and the strong high to the north. So it was the perfect scenario for just complete destruction across Maui.</p><p>And the Hawaiian Islands created very strong winds. We saw wind gusts as high as 82 miles per hour, but a lot of wind gusts reported between 55 and 65 miles per hour. You mentioned the winds are decreasing they are 15 to 20 mile per hour winds. This is pretty much right now.</p><p>And then as we go throughout the day, you can see a hyena right around 15 to 20 miles per hour winds, and then they'll steadily decrease. Of course, we're not going to have completely calm conditions because it's Hawaii. We constantly have a breeze across the island, but about 10 to 15 are definitely normal.</p><p>So here are the hotspots that we saw, according to from NASA imagery, and then they just the smoke just blew and the fires just blew down the mountain side of the hillside. The hotspots detected over Lahaina right now you can see just a couple and then compared to yesterday where we had all of the fires and a lot of hot spots.</p><p>So you can see it definitely improving across there. A lot of that is because all of this is already burned. So there's nothing more to burn but at least the fire control is getting better. But the damage has already been done just a devastating scenario there.</p><p>MACFARLANE: Yes, absolutely. And we know its middle of the night there one wonders what these residents and families are going to be waking up too in the morning. Thank you very much, Jennifer. All right still to come a flurry of mysterious fires and explosions throughout Russia have left systems rattled. Why Russian state media is downplaying the cause, that story coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACFARLANE: An explosion near the Russian capital on Wednesday killed at least one person injured at the 60 people. 12 people are still unaccounted for. It happened at an industrial plant where Russian state media says power techniques are made. Russian investigators say they have now detained the Plant Director. CNN's Matthew Chance reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The explosion shook the Russian city sending a dark mushroom cloud billowing into the skies. Closer to the blast, you can see the windows falling from the buildings above. Even residence shot with the devastation.</p><p>When local records these images of her destroyed sewing business, and suggests a drone may have been spotted by one of her friend's moments before the explosion. Outside a local reporter spots what appears to be an artillery shell on the ground. Although officially the blast is being cast as an industrial accident that a fireworks factory.</p><p>[08:25:00]</p><p>Russian officials denying sabotage or that this is sensitive military plant, making optical equipment like night vision goggles for Russia's war.</p><p>ANDREI VOROBYOV, GOVERNOR OF MOSCOW REGION: This place hasn't been used to produce mechanical optics for ages, says the Moscow Governor at the scene. It's only pyrotechnics made here he insists.</p><p>CHANCE (voice over): Still amid an upsurge of attacks at home, Russians have good reason to be nervous. August has been particularly fraught with a spike in small scale drone strikes on Russian cities, including the capital. Also been at least two dozen arson attacks on military recruitment centers across the country.</p><p>Like this one in the Far Eastern republic of Buryatia, home of more casualties in the Ukraine conflict than any other Russian region. But arrests and nationwide Russian officials say vulnerable citizens like pensioners are being duped into fire bombings by Ukrainian agents posing as police or creditors calling in loans.</p><p>I was called by bankers says this arrested woman and I thought they were the FSB, she says. But a spokesman for one Russian partisan group denies Russians have been coerced, telling CNN that if people weren't angry with the authorities, they wouldn't do anything, the Kremlin he says wants to hide the true level of discontent.</p><p>At the moment there's no real evidence the latest factory explosion was anything more than the devastating safety breach officials claim. That with the impact of war now increasingly felt at home. It's that many Russians on edge. Matthew Chance, CNN, Moscow.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MACFARLANE: And that is the latest for us.

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (P.L. 93-288, hereinafter the Stafford Act)/1 authorizes the President to \"declare\" a Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG). An FMAG declaration makes FMAG grants available to provide federal assistance to supplement state, local, territorial, and tribal (SLTT) efforts for the control, management, and mitigation of any fire on certain public or private forest land or grassland that might become a major disaster./2</p><p>FEMA defines control, management, and mitigation as those activities undertaken, generally, during the incident period of a declared fire, to minimize the immediate adverse effects and to manage and control the fire./3</p><p>The current FMAG system was established by regulation in October 2001./4</p><p>These grants provide federal assistance for fire suppression activities. This authority has been delegated to the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA's) Regional Administrators./5</p><p>Once issued, the FMAG declaration authorizes various forms of federal assistance such as the provision of equipment, personnel, and grants to state, local, and tribal governments. This federal assistance requires a cost-share, with state, local, and tribal governments responsible for 25% of the expenses.</p><p>The Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 (Division D of P.L. 115-254; hereinafter DRRA) authorizes FEMA to provide Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) Post Fire grants, under Section 404 of the Stafford Act, in any area that receives a FMAG declaration even if no presidential major disaster declaration was made.</p><p>This report discusses some frequently asked questions received by the Congressional Research Service on FMAGs. It addresses questions regarding how FMAG declarations are requested, how requests are evaluated using thresholds, and the types of assistance provided under an FMAG declaration.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Wildfire Jurisdiction</p><p>The federal government is responsible for wildfires that begin on federal and tribal lands; states are responsible for wildfires that begin on nonfederal lands (in some areas, local government may be responsible for initial wildfire response); and some tribes are responsible for wildfires that begin on tribal lands. For comingled land ownership, response efforts may be managed jointly across multiple federal, state, tribal, or local agencies.</p><p>* * *</p><p>1 42 U.S.C. Sec.Sec.5121 et seq. For further analysis on the Stafford Act, see CRS Report R43784, FEMA's Disaster Declaration Process: A Primer, by Bruce R. Lindsay.</p><p>2 P.L. 93-288, codified at 42 U.S.C. Sec.5187(a).</p><p>3 Federal Emergency Management Agency, Fire Management Assistance Grant Program and Policy Guide, FEMA FP-104-21-0002, June 2021, p. 1, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_fmagppg_063121.pdf\">https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_fmagppg_063121.pdf</url> (hereinafter FMAG PPG 2021).</p><p>4 44 C.F.R. Sec.152. Prior to that time, the program was known as the Fire Suppression Assistance Program. The program, however, was administered in a similar fashion. Then, as now, the FEMA Regional Administrators worked with the requesting state, the \"Principal Advisor,\" as well as FEMA leadership prior to the announcement of Stafford Act assistance under Section 420.</p><p>5 44 C.F.R. Sec.204.24. There are 10 FEMA regions in the United States and its territories. Each region is headed by a FEMA Regional Administrator who oversees all policy, managerial, resource, and administrative actions that affect the region. The FEMA Regional Administrator is also responsible for ensuring that policies, programs, and administrative and management guidance are implemented in a manner consistent with FEMA's overall goals.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Declaration Process</p><p>How Are FMAGs Requested?</p><p>An FMAG declaration can be requested by a state when the governor determines that a fire under state jurisdiction is burning out of control and threatens to become a major disaster./6</p><p>At that point, a request for assistance can be submitted to FEMA. Typically, requests are submitted to the FEMA Regional Administrator. Requests can be submitted any time - day or night - and can be submitted by telephone to expedite the process. Telephone requests must be followed by written confirmation within 14 days of the phone request./7</p><p>Can a Tribal Leader Request an FMAG Declaration?</p><p>Pursuant to 44 C.F.R. Sec.204.22, a governor or a governor's authorized representative are the only officials authorized to request FMAG declarations. Tribal governments/8 are not authorized to make FMAG declaration requests at this time./9</p><p>After an FMAG declaration is approved, a tribal government may act as a recipient or as a subrecipient of an FMAG grant under the state./10</p><p>A tribal government acting as a recipient assumes all responsibilities of a \"state\" for the purposes of administering the grant./11</p><p>What Information Needs to Be Included in the FMAG Request?</p><p>The FMAG request should include cost estimates to support the request as well as information about the fire including the size of the fire(s) in acres or square miles; the name, location, and population of the community (or communities) threatened; the number of primary and secondary residences and businesses threatened; the distance of the fire to the nearest communities; the number of persons evacuated (if applicable); the current and predicted 24-hour weather conditions; and the degree to which state and local resources are committed to this fire and other fires in federal, state, and/or local jurisdictions./12</p><p>The verbal request must be followed up with a completed \"Request for Fire Management Assistance Declaration\" (FEMA form 078-0-1) and the \"Principal Advisor's Report\" (FEMA form 078-0-2)./13</p><p>* * *</p><p>6 For the remainder of this report, references to a state or states also applies to territories and the District of Columbia.</p><p>7 44 C.F.R. Sec.206.392. See also FMAG PPG 2021, pp. 4-5.</p><p>8 P.L. 113-2, Sec.1110(c), 42 U.S.C. Sec.5122, and 44 C.F.R. Sec.204.3 define Indian tribal government to include any Indian or Alaska Native tribes, bands, nations, pueblos, villages, or communities recognized by the Secretary of Interior under the Federally Recognized Tribe List of 1994, 25 U.S.C. Sec.479a.</p><p>9 FMAG PPG 2021, p. 4.</p><p>10 The recipient is the government to which a grant is awarded and which is responsible for the use of the funds provided. Generally, a state is the recipient of an FMAG. However, after a declaration a tribal government may choose to be a recipient or may act as a subgrantee under a state. A subrecipient is an applicant that is awarded a subgrant and is accountable to the recipient for the use of grant funding provided. See 44 C.F.R. Sec.204.3.</p><p>11 FMAG PPG 2021, p. 4.</p><p>12 FMAG PPG 2021, pp. 5-6.</p><p>13 Declaration forms can be located at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fema.gov/assistance/public/fire-management-assistance\">https://www.fema.gov/assistance/public/fire-management-assistance</url>.</p><p>* * *</p><p>How Is FMAG Assistance Determined?</p><p>FEMA Regional Administrators use the following criteria to evaluate wildfires and make a determination whether to issue an FMAG. The four criteria below are considered in order of descending priority during the evaluation process of a threat of a fire or fire complex:/14</p><p>1. the threat to lives and property including critical facilities, infrastructure, and watershed areas;</p><p>2. the availability of state and local firefighting resources;</p><p>3. high fire danger conditions based on nationally accepted indices such as the National Fire Danger Rating System;/15 and</p><p>4. the potential economic impacts of the fire./16</p><p>In addition, FEMA uses fire cost thresholds to evaluate requests for FMAG declarations. There are two types of fire cost thresholds used to help determine if a state or tribal nation is eligible for fire assistance: (1) individual thresholds for a single fire, and (2) cumulative thresholds for multiple fires. Cumulative thresholds are applied to multiple fires burning simultaneously, or the accumulation of multiple fires in a single fire season. Threshold amounts vary by state (see Table 1). The individual fire cost threshold for a state is the greater of $100,000 or five times the statewide per capita indicator,/17 multiplied by the state population./18</p><p>Taking Pennsylvania as an example, generally, a single fire would need to meet or exceed $1,150,739 in damages for Pennsylvania to be eligible for an FMAG declaration in CY2023.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Table 1. Selected Examples of CY2023 Individual and Cumulative Fire Thresholds by State</p><p>Source: FEMA, CY2023 Fire Cost Thresholds, provided by FEMA Congressional Affairs staff, August 15, 2023. The states were selected to illustrate how the individual and cumulative fire thresholds are calculated and applied.</p><p>* * *</p><p>14 FMAG PPG 2021, p. 5.</p><p>15 The National Fire Danger Rating System is a system that allows fire managers to estimate today's and tomorrow's fire danger for a given area. See Forest Service, National Fire Danger Rating System, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/cibola/landmanagement/resourcemanagement/?cid=stelprdb5368839\">https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/cibola/landmanagement/resourcemanagement/?cid=stelprdb5368839</url>.</p><p>16 FMAG PPG 2021, p. 5.</p><p>17 The FY2023 per capita indicator is $1.77. See FEMA, Per Capita Impact Indicator and Project Thresholds, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fema.gov/assistance/public/tools-resources/per-capita-impact-indicator\">https://www.fema.gov/assistance/public/tools-resources/per-capita-impact-indicator</url>.</p><p>18 The fire cost thresholds for each state are adjusted annually for inflation using the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the U.S. Department of Labor. FMAG PPG 2021, p. 32, and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Consumer Price Index, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bls.gov/cpi/\">https://www.bls.gov/cpi/</url>.</p><p>* * *</p><p>In contrast, the formula for the cumulative fire threshold for a given state is one of two amounts - $500,000 or the amount of that state's individual fire threshold multiplied by three, whichever is greater. Returning to the Pennsylvania example, the sum of three individual fire thresholds equals $3,452,217. Since that amount is larger than $500,000, cumulative fire damages in Pennsylvania must meet or exceed $3,452,217 to be eligible for assistance. In contrast, the individual fire threshold for Alaska is $100,000, but the cumulative threshold is $500,000, not the sum of three individual fire thresholds ($300,000).</p><p>Can Denials for FMAG Assistance Be Appealed?</p><p>If FEMA denies the request for an FMAG declaration, the state has one opportunity to appeal. The appeal must be submitted in writing to the Regional Administrator no later than 30 days from the date of the denial letter. The appeal should contain any additional information that strengthens the original request for assistance. The Regional Administrator will review the appeal, prepare a recommendation, and forward the appeal package to the FEMA Headquarters Office. The FEMA Headquarters Office will notify the state of its determination in writing within 90 days of receipt of the appeal (or receipt of additional requested information)./19</p><p>The state may request a time extension to submit the appeal. The request for an extension must be submitted in writing to the Regional Administrator no later than 30 days from the date of the denial letter. The request for an extension must include a justification for the need for an extension. The FEMA Headquarters Office will notify the state in writing whether the extension request is granted or denied.</p><p>Does an FMAG Exclude the Possibility of an Emergency or Major Disaster Declaration Under the Stafford Act?</p><p>No, an emergency or major disaster can still be declared after an FMAG declaration has been issued. However, the emergency or major disaster declaration must be initiated by a separate request for assistance by the state or tribal government. Figure 1 illustrates processes for disaster declarations.</p><p>If either an emergency or major disaster declaration is approved in addition to an FMAG declaration, eligible costs should be claimed under the most appropriate designation. In the case of a major disaster declaration for a fire that received an FMAG declaration, generally eligible costs should be claimed under the major disaster declaration so the state can maximize funding under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP)./20</p><p>* * *</p><p>19 FMAG PPG 2021, p. 10.</p><p>20 FMAG PPG 2021, p. 14.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Figure 1. Disaster Declaration Process</p><p>Source: CRS interpretation of 44 C.F.R. Sec.Sec.206.33, 206.35-206.40, 206.46 (for emergency and major disaster declarations), and 44 C.F.R. Sec.Sec.204.21-204.26 (for FMAGs).</p><p>Notes: An expedited major disaster declaration may be requested and the Joint Preliminary Damage Assessment requirement may be waived for \"incidents of unusual severity and magnitude that do not require field damage assessments to determine the need for supplemental Federal assistance under the Act\" (44 C.F.R. Sec.206.33(d) and 44 C.F.R. Sec.206.36(d)).</p><p>* * *</p><p>Funding</p><p>How Are FMAGs Funded?</p><p>FMAGs are funded through FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), the main account FEMA uses to provide disaster assistance./21 The DRF is a no-year account--unused funds from the previous fiscal year are carried over to the next fiscal year.</p><p>Funds in the DRF fall into two categories. The first category is for disaster relief costs associated with major disasters under the Stafford Act. This category reflects the impact of the Budget Control Act (P.L. 112-25, BCA), which allows appropriations to cover the costs incurred as a result of major disasters to be paid through an \"allowable adjustment\" to the discretionary spending limits./22 The second category is colloquially known as \"base funding.\" Base funding includes activities not tied to major disasters under the Stafford Act. Base funding is scored as discretionary spending that counts against the discretionary spending limits. FMAGs are funded through the DRF's base funding category.</p><p>Can FMAGs Still Be Issued If the DRF Balance Is Low?</p><p>The decision to issue a FMAG declaration is not contingent on the DRF balance. Similarly, FMAGs do not reduce the amount of funding available for major disasters. When the DRF balance was low in the past, FEMA used its \"immediate needs funding\" (INF) policy until supplemental appropriations were passed to replenish the DRF. Under INF, long-term projects (such as mitigation work) are put on hold and only activities deemed urgent are funded. FMAGs would most likely fall into the category of events with an \"urgent\" need. Under the INF policy, FEMA also delays interagency reimbursements, and recovers funds from previous years in order to stretch its available funds.</p><p>What Are the Cost-Share Requirements for FMAGs?</p><p>As with many other Stafford Act disaster assistance grant programs (Public Assistance, Hazard Mitigation Grant assistance, Other Needs Assistance) the cost-share for FMAGs is based on a federal share of 75% of eligible expenses. The grantee (the state) and subgrantees (local communities) assume the remaining 25% of eligible costs./23</p><p>* * *</p><p>21 For more information on the DRF, see CRS Report R45484, The Disaster Relief Fund: Overview and Issues, by William L. Painter.</p><p>22 For more information on the allowable adjustment, see CRS In Focus IF10720, Calculation and Use of the Disaster Relief Allowable Adjustment, by William L. Painter.</p><p>23 For more information on Stafford Act cost shares, see CRS Report R47646, Stafford Act Cost Shares: History, Trends, Analysis, by Erica A. Lee.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Does FEMA Advance Funds to States or Reimburse States for Completed Work?</p><p>Under the FMAG process, FEMA reimburses grantees for eligible activities they have undertaken. The state application for specific grant funds must be submitted within 90 days after the FMAG is granted. That time frame permits the state to gather all information and supporting data on potentially eligible spending to include in their grant application package. The package must also stipulate that the fire cost threshold was met./24 Following submission of the grant application, FEMA has 45 days to approve or deny the application.</p><p>FMAG Assistance</p><p>What Types of Assistance Are Provided Under an FMAG Declaration?</p><p>FMAG assistance is similar in some basic respects to other FEMA assistance. For example, FMAGs will not replicate or displace the work of other federal agencies, nor will FEMA pay straight-time salaries for public safety forces, though it will reimburse overtime expenses for the event. Other eligible expenses can include costs for</p><p>* equipment and supplies (less insurance proceeds);</p><p>* mobilization and demobilization;</p><p>* emergency work (evacuations and sheltering, police barricading and traffic control, arson investigation);</p><p>* prepositioning federal, out-of-state, and international resources for up to 21 days when approved by the FEMA Regional Administrator;</p><p>* personal comfort and safety items for firefighter health and safety;</p><p>* field camps and meals in lieu of per diem; and/or</p><p>* the mitigation, management, and control of declared fires burning on comingled federal land, when such costs are not reimbursable by another federal agency.</p><p>An FMAG declaration authorizes temporary forms of assistance to individuals and households including emergency sheltering and medical care, but does not authorize permanent forms of assistance to repair and rebuild homes. In addition, neither rental assistance nor other forms of assistance provided to individuals and households under FEMA's Individual Assistance program are made available after an FMAG declaration./25</p><p>Is Mitigation Funding Included in an FMAG Declaration?</p><p>Until 2018, only major disaster declarations made statewide hazard mitigation grants available. DRRA amended the Stafford Act to make Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP)/26 funding available after FMAG declarations as well. HMGP assistance includes measures that substantially reduce the risk of future damage, hardship, loss, or suffering in any area affected by a major disaster, or any area affected by a fire for which assistance was provided under Section 420 of the Stafford Act.</p><p>* * *</p><p>24 Other agreements that must be in place include an approved State Administrative Plan, a FEMA-State Agreement for the incident, and an approved State or Tribal Hazard Mitigation Plan. While these are important steps, they are also part of the ongoing, operational relationship between the state and the FEMA regional office and have likely been accomplished or can be accomplished or revised during the nine-month time frame.</p><p>25 For more information, see CRS Report R46014, FEMA Individual Assistance Programs: An Overview, by Elizabeth M. Webster.</p><p>26 For more information, see CRS Report R46989, FEMA Hazard Mitigation: A First Step Toward Climate Adaptation, by Diane P. Horn.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Under Section 404 of the Stafford Act as amended by DRRA, HMGP Post Fire grants are provided to states and tribes on a sliding scale based on the percentage of funds spent for FMAG assistance. For states and federally recognized tribes with a FEMA-approved Standard State or Tribal Hazard Mitigation Plan, the formula provides for up to 15% of the first $2 billion of estimated aggregate amounts of disaster assistance, up to 10% for amounts between $2 billion and $10 billion, and 7.5% for amounts between $10 billion and $35.333 billion./27 States and federally recognized tribes with a FEMA-approved Enhanced State or Tribal Hazard Mitigation Plan will receive 20% of the estimated aggregate amounts of disaster assistance./28</p><p>Interaction with Other Federal Agencies</p><p>How Are FMAGs Different from Other Types of Federal Fire Assistance?</p><p>FEMA assistance through FMAGs is a direct relationship with the states to assist in wildfire response activities for fires which begin on lands under the state's jurisdiction. FMAGs are employed so a disaster declaration may not be necessary. The federal government provides other types of assistance related to wildfire management generally, such as postfire recovery assistance or assistance planning and mitigating the potential risk from future wildfires./29</p><p>States and other entities may also enter into various cooperative agreements (e.g., mutual aid agreements, cooperative fire protection agreements, fire compacts) with federal agencies that have a fire protection responsibility./30 These agencies most commonly include the Forest Service, within the Department of Agriculture, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and National Park Service, within the Department of the Interior (DOI)./31 Each specific agreement outlines the terms and conditions for sharing resources during fire incidents and establishes cost reimbursement procedures, if necessary. Under some mutual aid agreements, for example, cost reimbursement may not be required for some emergency suppression services. Under cooperative fire protection agreements, the federal government may provide wildfire prevention, detection, and suppression services on a cost-reimbursement basis. The various types of cooperative agreements allow for a coordinated interagency response that deploys and mobilizes resources to areas of greatest need. Response activities are coordinated regionally through 10 Geographic Area Coordination Centers (GACCs) and nationally through the National Interagency Coordination Center (NICC)./32</p><p>* * *</p><p>27 42 U.S.C.

FMAG assistance is not generally available in conjunction with emergency suppression assistance from the federal government. FMAGs provide assistance for suppression operations on nonfederal lands, whereas suppression operations on federal lands are the responsibility of the federal agency with jurisdiction. Limited exceptions may occur for declared fires on lands in which the ownership is comingled federal and nonfederal, and the costs incurred by the eligible entity are not entitled to any other type of federal reimbursement./33</p><p>FMAG and other federal assistance may potentially occur in conjunction when there is a cooperative agreement between federal, state, and other governmental or tribal partners to coordinate emergency wildfire protection and response activities./34 The cooperative agreement often delineates different geographic areas where the state government is responsible for initial suppression operations, regardless of land ownership, and vice versa, where the federal government may be responsible for providing suppression operations in lands under nonfederal ownership. The cooperative agreements specify how costs are to be apportioned among the partners, including provisions allowing for reimbursement, in accordance with applicable federal and state statutes. In the circumstance where a state (or other eligible entity) conducted suppression operations on federal land and the costs were not reimbursable, an FMAG may potentially be applied for and used to cover eligible costs.</p><p>Do FMAGs Assist with Fires on Federal Lands?</p><p>No, most fires that begin on federal land are the responsibility of the federal agency that owns or manages the land, and are not eligible to receive FMAG assistance./35 There are some exceptions, however. For example, FMAGs may be available to assist with declared fires that occur in areas with a mix of federal and nonfederal land, if the state has a responsibility for suppression activities under a cooperative agreement with the applicable federal agency, and those costs are not reimbursable under another federal statute./36</p><p>* * *</p><p>33 44 C.F.R.

Forester and Resource Land Manager Terri Hall is one of those people. <br/>'Rayonier was my first permanent job after graduating from college. I started working for Rayonier in 1989 in the old Chandlery Building in downtown Fernandina. At that time, it was known as ITT Rayonier, Corporate was in Connecticut and the timberlands were primarily in Florida and Georgia.' </p><p><br/>Today, Rayonier's timberlands span across the Southeast from South Carolina to Texas, and in Washington and Oregon in the Pacific Northwest as well as forests in New Zealand. <br/>Terri soon found her home in Rayonier's Florida Resource Unit, our team based in Rayonier's southernmost forests in Florida. <br/>'I started in Technical Services, then worked for the Florida region as a timber sales forester. Since 1992, I have had 5 different job titles but my office for all of them has been right here at the Bradford Forest Office.' <br/>If that isn't extraordinary enough, her boss has been with her for the span of her career. Rick Piagno, a colleague who eventually became her boss in 1996, is still her boss and Resource Unit Leader today. <br/>'So I've had the same boss for 26 years and have worked for the same company for 32 years!' she chuckled. <br/>Forging a career path all her own <br/>Many foresters have a family background in the profession or some previous experience, but not Terri. She chose this career based on her own goals and objectives. <br/>'I had no experience and no family background, I just wanted a job that was not going to be boring. I didn't want to be stuck behind a desk all day long, and I wanted variety in my line of work. I definitely have variety. We always say: don't make too hard of plans because every morning things are likely to change.' <br/>Terri studied hard to earn her forestry education. She holds a Bachelors and Masters degree from Auburn University. Yet, she still encounters many misconceptions about her field of expertise. <br/>'When I say I'm a forester, people think I sit in a fire tower. So I get to explain all that's involved, from site management to seed selection, planting, disease control, working with loggers, fire fighting, sampling and statistics. People don't realize all that goes into the education and daily work of it all.' <br/>Terri began when few women worked directly in the field <br/>Terri says it never concerned her that she was one of only a few women foresters. Nor did it motivate her to approach her job or make career decisions any differently. <br/>'When I went to school there were 3 other women in my forestry classes. When I began working I think there was \u2014 I don't really pay attention to this \u2014 no, there were not any other field women when I came. Then a couple more did come on but most of them did not stay in the field, they went into specialized things like technical services, GIS or research. I don't know of many who were actually in forest management. <br/>'I've never had a problem though. The nice thing about forestry is everyone is so great. Whether it's Rayonier employees, contractors, loggers or employees with the Florida Forest Service, everyone's just good, down-to-earth people. I've loved every minute of it. Honestly, unless somebody pointed out that I was one of the only women around, I never paid attention to it.' <br/>A day in life of this Rayonier forester <br/>In December 2021, when Rayonier employee Robert Hall shadowed Terri for a day and took the photos included in this story, she and her team were dealing with seasonal planting. She began her day in the field supervising planting and taking plots. <br/>'In this picture, I'm laying out my pole to measure it for the correct length for a 35th-acre plot. I then swing the pole and count the seedlings on the plot.' <br/>Terri has to count the number of trees to ensure the contractor is planting the correct density. 'Planting compliance is complicated. Planting density can be affected by so many factors including bedding width, quality of the site prep and weather conditions. Really, the only thing a planter can control is how far apart the trees are in the bed.' <br/>Back at the office, there are forest fire maps to review and analyze <br/>'We do a lot of work looking at fire protection and things we can do to reduce fire danger, especially in Florida. Sometimes that's through release work, in which we chemically spray under the trees to reduce competition. You create a map of all the stands to show what areas need a reduction in fire danger. After evaluating the map, we make plans for the coming year to do activities in these high risk areas such as mowing or spraying to mitigate the danger.' <br/>Next, it's on to timber sales \u2014 of which Terri has 21 pending for Bradford County <br/>This involves checking in on and meeting with the loggers every 10 days to make sure harvesting is going according to plan. <br/>'When I go out there, my biggest concerns are: stumps being low and trees being cut to the right top diameter so they're getting proper utilization of the trees. Also, I check that the roads are not being torn up, no oil spills, that the right area's being cut \u2014 you'd be surprised what can happen! \u2014 and that they only use our designated crossings. Since it rains a lot in Florida and we're so close to the water table, we're also very concerned about soil disturbance and wood not being left on the ground.' <br/>'So I go to the field every week to check on the loggers and walk the timber sale area, making sure they haven't messed up any sites, channels or roads and ensure they have what they need. I try to maintain a good working relationship with the loggers where they feel free to call and tell me what they need whether it is road work, additional tickets or clarification of the sale area.' <br/>Now, she moves on to overseeing planting and nursery inventory <br/>'Whenever the planting crew works on my forests, I give them maps showing the planting area, number of acres, species to be planted, the seed lot number and the trees per acre to be planted. One of the most challenging things about planting season is getting the seedlings from the nursery to the field when the planters need them. It is a huge coordinated effort when the forests in different states are all planting at once and getting their trees from our one nursery in Elberta, Alabama.' <br/>The seedlings are delivered in refrigerated vans which are left on-site. When that inventory runs low, it's up to Terri to ensure they have a new van of seedlings on the way so planting isn't interrupted or delayed. <br/>With the seedlings taken care of, Terri checks on the health of the larger tree stands <br/>No matter how well you plan, cultivate and care for them, some trees are bound to experience pest pressure and/or disease. A regular part of Terri's work includes evaluating trees for early signs of trouble. <br/>'When you find a spot in a stand where the pine needles are turning red, you look for evidence like pitch tubes, popcorn or sawdust to try and identify the forest pest. Once you figure out the pest, you have to decide on a course of action. For example, if it's southern pine beetle, we know that pest travels fast! So you might have to cut them down plus create a buffer around them to capture the red, dead and dying. This creates a buffer to protect the healthy trees. So when we see dead spots we have to look at them and see what's going on.' <br/>This level of consistent observation is critical to preserving and maintaining healthy forests and wildlife habitats. <br/>What Terri loves most about being a forester <br/>Terri's love and passion for her work comes through in everything she does. Here's what she loves most about her job. <br/>'Some of it has to do with the actual work and some of it has to do with the management. I enjoy the freedom and the responsibility, I'm free to make decisions and I've been given a lot of responsibility. I appreciate the trust that's involved. I like the challenge because we're always looking for better ways to do this and solutions for the problems that come up. I especially like having an area that's mine to manage. <br/>'I love that I have the whole spectrum. From the time I put the seedling in the ground to the time the loggers cut it. I choose the seedlings for each stand, I determine whether the stand gets some intermediate treatment, and I'm the one who's out there helping to protect it either through fire fighting or pest management. <br/>'Another thing I like about my job is how we're structured. There's a lot of accountability. If I don't make sure the logger got it right then I'm going to hear it from the site prep guy. If I don't ensure that the site prep is right, I am going to hear it from the planting contractor. I'm in charge of the whole rotation.

The revisions also bar trans and gender nonconforming students from participating in sports that align with their gender.</p><p>Students streamed out of classrooms throughout schools in Loudon, Fairfax Prince William Stafford, Arlington, and Spotsylvania counties.</p><p>\"I can't be engaged in class if I'm worried that my rights are being taken away,\" said Kat in a press release, a student who walked out at Manor High School in Portsmouth. Kat went on to note that these guidelines would \"endanger my community and \"undermine the ability for every Virginia student to thrive.\"</p><p>Another student at Hermitage High School in Henrico County, Len, noted the devastating impact of these polices: \"As a transgender student, it seems like the Governor thinks that erasing my ability to be myself will make my community disappear. But it'll only lead to harassment, abuse, and depression among trans students. I'm just trying to learn and graduate, not become a political pawn.\"</p><p>Natasha, a student who walked out at Oakton High School in Fairfax County, highlighted the political motivations of these attacks: \"Governor Youngkin says that he cares about parental rights and Virginia, but he's just attacking Queer students. If he truly cared about our students, he wouldn't be putting us at risk for depression, harm, abuse, and harassment. Students know we have the potential to build schools that let everyone succeed, but we can't do that with these policies.\"</p><p>Sanghvi stated students decided to stage the walkouts \"as a kind of way to disrupt schools and essentially have students be aware of what's going on.\"</p><p>2022 has already seen a record breaking year for anti-LGBTQ legislation, with over 200 anti-LGBTQ state bills being proposed across the country. The majority of these bills directly target LGBTQ youth, specifically trans youth, in schools.</p><p>Similar student walkouts in protest of anti-LGBTQ policies have taken place this year in Texas, Florida, Missouri, Utah, and dozens of other cities that participated in a separate national Queer Youth Walkout event in March.</p><p>\"Almost half of Virginia's K-12 students attend schools in divisions that have fully adopted the Virginia Department of Education's model policies for the treatment of transgender students,\" said Narissa Rahaman, Executive Director of Equality Virginia.</p><p>\"These policies, developed in accordance with evidence-based best practices, give teachers and administrators critical tools to create safe, inclusive and learning environments for all students. School boards in every corner of our Commonwealth have a unique and urgent opportunity to protect transgender students by adopting the model policies.\"</p><p>More than 300 students walked out of classes, chanting, \"Trans rights are human rights,\" and, \"D-O-E [Department of Education], leave us be!\" at McClean High School.</p><p>Over 17,000 comments were submitted by Tuesday morning to the Virginia Department of Education (DOE), which will review and potentially make revisions to the guidelines before they're finalized by the state superintendent, according to spokesman Charles Pyle.</p><p>According to Equality Virginia the state's Department of Education revised 2022 model policy will:</p><p>Requires parents of trans youth to request their child be deadnamed and/or misgendered, practices in which a trans person's birth name or sex assigned at birth is revealed without permission.</p><p>Prevent students from using their correct name, unless they get parental consent and get it legally changed.</p><p>Let parents opt LGBTQ students out of counseling, regardless of the student's will.</p><p>Prevent school districts from collecting data on rates of depression in the LGBTQ student body.</p><p>Require school administrators and faculty to out any transgender and gender expansive student, and may allow schools to out all queer students</p><p>Name and pronoun changes would require a request from parents, as well as official legal documents or court orders noting the change.</p><p>Prohibit schools from addressing students by their correct pronouns if they don't align with assigned birth sex.</p><p>Prohibit schools from recognizing nonbinary pronouns.</p><p>Ban transgender students from participating in school sports.</p><p>Ban transgender students from using bathrooms that align with their gender identity.</p><p>\"The reversal of life saving policies that protect LGBTQ students in Virginia sends a toxic message that Governor Youngkin prioritizes dangerous politics over protections for Virginia students,\" GLAAD's President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis said on Monday, ahead of the walkouts.</p><p>\"LGBTQ youth across the board deserve to feel safe in schools, and these baseless policies continue to fuel the ongoing anti-trans legislative forest fire.\"</p><p>According to reports, the Richmond School Board rejected the draft policies, saying the board \"affirms the commitment to providing protections for all students regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.\"</p><p>\"The goal of this document is to persuade local school districts who may not have expertise on trans kids, to pursue a particular approach to treating those kids,\" said Professor Jack Preis with the University of Richmond's School of Law.</p><p>\"Just because this document encourages that particular approach does not mean that school districts are insulated from lawsuits.</p><p>I expect a lot of students or parents of students will file lawsuits challenging the decisions that the local districts make. And it's irrelevant whether or not the local district made that decision because of the model policy or any other reason it might have made that decision.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125524315</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66R3-GX51-DYTH-G32M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-10-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1040\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"09\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>September 28, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

On Denny Way, between 12th Ave. and 13thAve., Ramirez hangs his work on the ultramarine wall of the adjacent post office, lays a carpet before his studio and settles into one of his antique chairs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I tell people when they're walking by, 'Welcome to my art show! This is my studio. Doesn't this place look classy with rugs on the pavement in the alleyway?'\" Ramirez said, punctuating his sentences with laughter.</p><p>Ramirez's work, which he described as \"subtly political\" and cheekily critiqued as \"too colorful,\" spans a range of artistic idioms. Since many of the paintings are years old, Ramirez tracks his artistic evolution through the pictures he has yet to sell, preferring those done in the impasto technique.\u00a0</p><p>Occasionally, a passerby stops in the alley. With \"Abby Road\" humming on the radio, Ramirez wastes no time in making a friendly entreaty.</p><p>\"That radio is from 1942, it's still going! Just listen to that sound,\" Ramirez told an intrigued pedestrian, pointing towards his vestige from the Golden Age.</p><p>\"They don't make them like they used to,\" the man responded. Ramirez winked; he had a speaker behind the long-malfunctioning radio.</p><p>Ramirez, born in Southern California and raised in Lake Stevens, Wash., has collected antiques and painted since age 12, first expressing his artistic intrigue on rocks, then moving to canvas. After attending three separate art schools in the Pacific Northwest, Ramirez settled in Capitol Hill, where he has etched out an array of friendships.</p><p>Ricardo's \"Ladder to Heaven\" on the corner or 12th and Denny (Adeline Ong)</p><p>\"Everybody knows me in the streets,\" Ramirez said of his status as a local artist.</p><p>For much of his time on Capitol Hill, Ramirez has worked in the service industry, done odd jobs and sold art and antiques to get by. He most recently worked as a parking attendant for the corporation Ace Parking. During his four-year tenure with Ace, Ramirez's hours had been reduced from full-time to part-time, making it nearly impossible to survive. When the pandemic hit, Ramirez was serving nurses at the Kaiser Permanente Capitol Hill office. After long periods of under-scheduling, management eventually fired Ramirez while the pandemic continued to rage. One of the main reasons for his termination, Ramirez suspects, was his leniency with the clientele.</p><p>\"I got laid off for not charging the nurses,\" Ramirez said. \"The doctors get a free, hidden parking lot and the nurses have to pay $18 after working all day-10 or 12 hours-saving people's lives. Look, I'm raised by hippies, and we have the value that just 'cause it's a manager, just 'cause it's the president, or whoever's telling you what to do, doesn't mean it's right.\"\u00a0</p><p>Ramirez's studio, by technical standards, is a garage; in a long line of garages meant to provide parking for nearby tenets. According to Ramirez, his good friend, Ed Hills, used to live in The Randolph, the apartment complex overlooking the garages. When Hills lived in The Randolph, about 20 years ago, rent, including access to the garage, cost him $450 a month. As the process of gentrification drew unusually well-to-do tenets to the building, Ramirez warned of the outcome.</p><p>\"This is not good Ed,\" Ramirez remembered saying at the time. \"[The landlord] brought all these [upper-class] people in here to throw all you people out who have been here for a long time and raise all the rents.\"</p><p>In this context, Ramirez's claim to be \"psychic sometimes\" was confirmed. Between 2010 and 2020 the cost of living in Seattle rose 23.2%, rents increased by nearly 92% during the same time. Capitol Hill, once a working-class neighborhood with a concentrated presence of gay artists like Ramirez, began to pander to the lucrative needs of tech workers and the youthful impulse to go out. Those who made the neighborhood desirable in the first place were mostly pushed aside.</p><p>Luckily, Ramirez managed to hold onto his studio through continued spikes in the cost of living and the ballooning of Seattle's median income. If the kindness issued from the open doors of his studio is any indication, Ramirez clearly cherishes the garage he's been \"grandfathered\" into.</p><p>\"This is the spot,\" Ramirez said. \"There are people roaming up and down, I'll have crowds, and husbands and wives and their kids coming in. Their moms are like 'oh this is so cool, you gotta see this.'\"</p><p>\"Oil painting takes over the world\" (left) and one painting depicting Ricardo's brother from his Halloween series (right) (Adeline Ong)</p><p>As cars awkwardly maneuvered around Ramirez, his chairs, carpet, radio and work; the artist told stories, retreated into the studio for refreshment and made bounteous invitations to the nearest pedestrian. Though the alleyway was chiefly an individualized parking lot, two other artists made use of their units: a drum teacher and a potter.</p><p>\"I dream about only artists in here instead of cars,\" Ramirez said, facing the long line of locked units.</p><p>Leave a Comment</p><p>A &amp;

It's been brutal out here. One of the many problems facing forests is timber theft, which is awfully hard to prove unless you stumble across the people doing it, which is very unlikely given they are hanging out in a forest where no one lives. But tree DNA is now providing evidence to convict these scumbags:[1] </p><p><br/><br/>The blazing fire that tore through Washington state's Olympic National Forest in 2018 scorched 3,300 acres of land and destroyed dozens of valuable bigleaf maple trees. Amid the wreckage were oversized stumps with sawed-off limbs \u2014 a signal that the flames could have been a devastating casualty of a poorly planned tree heist. <br/>Two men were responsible, federal investigators said, and the proof was in the trees' genetic makeup. <br/>In a first for a federal criminal trial, prosecutors used tree DNA to prove the remains matched that of the timber the men sold to local mills. <br/>The tree genetics convinced jury members in Tacoma, Wash., and on Thursday they convicted Justin Andrew Wilke for his role in the theft and trafficking of illegally reaped timber. <br/>Wilke and Shawn Edward Williams were charged with multiple felonies related to the scheme in September 2019. Williams pleaded guilty in December 2019 to stealing the trees and setting the fire. He was sentenced to 30 months in prison last September. <br/>His attorney, Gregory Murphy, said in a statement to The Washington Post that Wilke 'did not dispute that he, along with other uncharged coconspirators, unlawfully profited from unlawfully logged maple in 2018.' <br/>'In fact, Mr. Wilke repeatedly offered to plead guilty to the six counts of which he was ultimately convicted,' Murphy said. 'But Mr. Wilke has always maintained that he did not cause a forest fire.' <br/>Wilke faces up to 10 years in prison, prosecutors said. <br/><br/>I'm sure these guys thought this was a gold-plated scheme that could never go wrong. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/07/12/justin-wilke-tree-dna-theft/\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/07/12/justin-wilke-tree-dna-theft/</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-LGAM101153162914855117125979100067</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LGAM-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63CX-CHS1-F03R-N27K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484261</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"382\"/><timeReceived>9:15 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Lawyers, Guns, and Money</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 16, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>GHC (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>washington</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>timber theft</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>dna</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>forests</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Prison Officials</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OEI4RDRGRjZCNDIyNDQ3RkEyRTE0ODU4QkQ3REQ2NTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTcwRjREMkY2QzBGNDhEMjg0NEM3RUI1QTA5RTlGRjc</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Estate, Gift &amp;

One expert said it's a recipe for disaster on the wildlands where some timber has a fuel moisture drier than kiln-dried wood.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very dangerous fire day tomorrow,\u201d fire behavior specialist Stewart Turner said at a briefing Thursday night on the edge of the Santa Fe National Forest in Las Vegas, New Mexico.</p><p>\u201cLike we saw last Friday, epic fire behavior,\u201d Turner said. \u201cIt's a day that as a firefighter, we'll write about, we'll read studies about. It's going to be a big fire day.\u201d</p><p>A swath of the country stretching from Arizona to the Texas panhandle is expected to be hit the hardest by the return of the bad firefighting weather that has generated unusually hot and fast-moving fires for this time of year, forecasters warned.</p><p>Red flag warnings were in place Thursday for all of New Mexico and parts of Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma and Nebraska.</p><p>More than 3,000 firefighters were battling fires in Arizona and New Mexico on Thursday \u2014 about half of those in northeast New Mexico, where more than 187 square miles (484 square kilometers) of mostly timber and brush has been charred.</p><p>They focused Thursday on preventing it from moving into the rural New Mexico community of Ledoux. That meant bolstering fire lines and sending in crews tasked with protecting structures.</p><p>\u201cGreat progress again today,\u201d incident commander Carl Schwope said Thursday night. But \u201ctomorrow has the potential to be a very destructive day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be chaotic if anything close to what happened (last) Friday occurs,\u201d added operations chief Jayson Coil.</p><p>Sheriff Chris Lopez, of New Mexico's Miguel County, confirmed for the first time Thursday night the fire there has destroyed at least 166 residences, 108 outbuildings and three commercial buildings. He joined authorities in neighboring Mora County in pleading with residents to pay close attention Friday to sudden changes in closures and evacuation orders.</p><p>\u201cFalling trees, possibly falling power lines, that\u2019s the kind of winds we're looking at,\u201d Lopez said.</p><p>Turner, the fire behavior specialist, said the gusty winds are only part of the problem. He said moisture levels in downed logs and woody debris are \u201cextremely dry\u201d\u2014 just 2% in small twigs, pine needles and grasses that \u201cactually carry a forest fire across the landscape.\"</p><p>Moisture in a small log \u201cthe size of a 4-by-4 post you buy at the lumber store ... are coming down to 8%,\u201d he said. \u201cKiln-dry is 12%. So out there, that\u2019s drying to what a kiln would do.\u201d</p><p>In northern Arizona, authorities downgraded some some evacuation orders at a fire that has destroyed at least 20 homes near Flagstaff. It's now estimated to be 43% contained. Another fire 10 miles (16 km) south of Prescott was 23% contained, but officials at both blazes warned of worsening conditions expected Friday.</p><p>Elsewhere, one national incident team continued to oversee a large prairie fire in Nebraska, where more than 200 firefighters were battling a blaze that has been burning since last week.</p><p>About 68 square miles (176 square kilometers) of mostly grasses and farmland have been blackened near Nebraska's state line with Kansas, several homes were destroyed and at least one person was killed. That fire was 88% contained Thursday.</p><p>___</p><p>Sonner reported from Reno, Nevada. Margery A.

It's home to the country's second-highest volcano, Mount Rinjani which towers at 3,726m above sea level.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Climbing Mount Rinjani is no easy feat. The trek up</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">to its crater rim stretches a total of 7.9km with a vertical height of 2,639m.</p><p>Scaling the summit is even more arduous, with an additional distance of 10.4km</p><p>from the crater rim.</p><p>Setting up of camp on Mount Rinjani's crater rim before nightfall. | PHOTO BY Jay Lim</p><p>This is what lead trekker Razikin (pictured below), 24, does for a living. \"(In a week), I climb 2 to 3 times,\" said the young Indonesian who's been working for Hajar Trekking in the past 6 years.</p><p>The Potters</p><p>To qualify as a lead trekker, one has to first serve as a porter, carrying water, food, and cooking supplies for tourists who have signed up for the hike.

Porters who can't afford</p><p>sports shoes would still go ahead with the ascent in their flip-flops. By the</p><p>end of the journey, the feet are usually covered with painful blisters.</p><p>\"Many people cry, it's so hard,\" Mr Razikin recalled.</p><p>Porters are allowed to lead a group hike only after having served for a few years, but those with a better command of English and can communicate with foreign travellers better tend to be promoted faster. Mr Razikin, for example, was promoted after a year.</p><p>A Volatile Job</p><p>Mr Razikin knows his job is volatile.</p><p>For 3 months a year, Mount Rinjani is closed for</p><p>hiking due to safety concerns. The closure can be prolonged when natural</p><p>disasters strike.</p><p>After Lombok braved two deadly earthquakes and landslides in 2018, the hiking trails at Mount Rinjani were closed for almost a year as the National Park Agency and the Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation assessed the safety of the volcano.</p><p>Aftermath of a landslide which occurred right beside part of the trekking path up Mount Rinjani. | PHOTO BY Jay Lim</p><p>Houses destroyed in the 2018 earthquakes which are currently being rebuilt. | PHOTO BY Jay Lim</p><p>Last October, the national park was also closed for 2 weeks after a forest fire broke out near the summit.</p><p>Part of the hiking trail near the crater rim of Mount Rinjani affected the forest fire. | PHOTO BY Jay Lim</p><p>With the eruptions of New Zealand's Whakaari (White Island) last December and The Philippines' Taal Volcano in January, the heightened volcanic activities have also deterred some travellers from visiting active volcanoes. This is bad news for the likes of Mr Razikin, who counts on volcano tourism for a living.</p><p>When the trails are closed, Mr Razikin and other</p><p>porters will have to find work elsewhere, such as Bali.</p><p>\"(In Bali), I work in restaurants, massage parlors,\"</p><p>the 24-year-old said. He can make an average of 1.5 million rupiah (S$150) a month</p><p>from the odd jobs, but that's \"not enough\" to sustain his family.</p><p>In contrast, if he leads a 2-day, 1-night tour up</p><p>Mount Rinjani, he can make 400,000 rupiah (S$40.20), and receives roughly</p><p>another 400,000 rupiah in tips. If he makes 3 such trips a week, he can earn</p><p>2.4 million rupiah, or close to S$1,000 a month.</p><p>Still</p><p>Hopeful</p><p>As such, Mr Razikin still prefers his job as a trekking guide despite its dangers.

(AP) \u2014 Thousands of firefighters continued to slow the advance of destructive wildfires in the Southwestern U.S. but warned they were bracing for the return Friday of the same dangerous conditions that quickly spread the wind-fueled blazes a week ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At least 166 homes have been destroyed in one rural county in northeast New Mexico since the biggest fire currently burning in the U.S. started racing through small towns east and northeast of Santa Fe on April 22, the local sheriff said.</p><p>Winds gusting up to 50 mph (80 kph) were forecast Friday in the drought-stricken region. One expert said it's a recipe for disaster on the wildlands where some timber has a fuel moisture drier than kiln-dried wood.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very dangerous fire day tomorrow,\u201d fire behavior specialist Stewart Turner said at a briefing Thursday night on the edge of the Santa Fe National Forest in Las Vegas, New Mexico.</p><p>\u201cLike we saw last Friday, epic fire behavior,\u201d Turner said. \u201cIt's a day that as a firefighter, we'll write about, we'll read studies about. It's going to be a big fire day.\u201d</p><p>A swath of the country stretching from Arizona to the Texas panhandle is expected to be hit the hardest by the return of the bad firefighting weather that has generated unusually hot and fast-moving fires for this time of year, forecasters warned.</p><p>Red flag warnings were in place Thursday for all of New Mexico and parts of Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma and Nebraska.</p><p>More than 3,000 firefighters were battling fires in Arizona and New Mexico on Thursday \u2014 about half of those in northeast New Mexico, where more than 187 square miles (484 square kilometers) of mostly timber and brush has been charred.</p><p>They focused Thursday on preventing it from moving into the rural New Mexico community of Ledoux. That meant bolstering fire lines and sending in crews tasked with protecting structures.</p><p>\u201cGreat progress again today,\u201d incident commander Carl Schwope said Thursday night. But \u201ctomorrow has the potential to be a very destructive day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be chaotic if anything close to what happened (last) Friday occurs,\u201d added operations chief Jayson Coil.</p><p>Sheriff Chris Lopez, of New Mexico's Miguel County, confirmed for the first time Thursday night the fire there has destroyed at least 166 residences, 108 outbuildings and three commercial buildings. He joined authorities in neighboring Mora County in pleading with residents to pay close attention Friday to sudden changes in closures and evacuation orders.</p><p>\u201cFalling trees, possibly falling power lines, that\u2019s the kind of winds we're looking at,\u201d Lopez said.</p><p>Turner, the fire behavior specialist, said the gusty winds are only part of the problem. He said moisture levels in downed logs and woody debris are \u201cextremely dry\u201d\u2014 just 2% in small twigs, pine needles and grasses that \u201cactually carry a forest fire across the landscape.\"</p><p>Moisture in a small log \u201cthe size of a 4-by-4 post you buy at the lumber store ... are coming down to 8%,\u201d he said. \u201cKiln-dry is 12%. So out there, that\u2019s drying to what a kiln would do.\u201d</p><p>In northern Arizona, authorities downgraded some some evacuation orders at a fire that has destroyed at least 20 homes near Flagstaff. It's now estimated to be 43% contained. Another fire 10 miles (16 km) south of Prescott was 23% contained, but officials at both blazes warned of worsening conditions expected Friday.</p><p>Elsewhere, one national incident team continued to oversee a large prairie fire in Nebraska, where more than 200 firefighters were battling a blaze that has been burning since last week.</p><p>About 68 square miles (176 square kilometers) of mostly grasses and farmland have been blackened near Nebraska's state line with Kansas, several homes were destroyed and at least one person was killed. That fire was 88% contained Thursday.</p><p>___</p><p>Sonner reported from Reno, Nevada. Margery A.

(AP) \u2014 Thousands of firefighters continued to slow the advance of destructive wildfires in the Southwestern U.S. but warned they were bracing for the return Friday of the same dangerous conditions that quickly spread the wind-fueled blazes a week ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At least 166 homes have been destroyed in one rural county in northeast New Mexico since the biggest fire currently burning in the U.S. started racing through small towns east and northeast of Santa Fe on April 22, the local sheriff said.</p><p>Winds gusting up to 50 mph (80 kph) were forecast Friday in the drought-stricken region. One expert said it's a recipe for disaster on the wildlands where some timber has a fuel moisture drier than kiln-dried wood.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very dangerous fire day tomorrow,\u201d fire behavior specialist Stewart Turner said at a briefing Thursday night on the edge of the Santa Fe National Forest in Las Vegas, New Mexico.</p><p>\u201cLike we saw last Friday, epic fire behavior,\u201d Turner said. \u201cIt's a day that as a firefighter, we'll write about, we'll read studies about. It's going to be a big fire day.\u201d</p><p>A swath of the country stretching from Arizona to the Texas panhandle is expected to be hit the hardest by the return of the bad firefighting weather that has generated unusually hot and fast-moving fires for this time of year, forecasters warned.</p><p>Red flag warnings were in place Thursday for all of New Mexico and parts of Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma and Nebraska.</p><p>More than 3,000 firefighters were battling fires in Arizona and New Mexico on Thursday \u2014 about half of those in northeast New Mexico, where more than 187 square miles (484 square kilometers) of mostly timber and brush has been charred.</p><p>They focused Thursday on preventing it from moving into the rural New Mexico community of Ledoux. That meant bolstering fire lines and sending in crews tasked with protecting structures.</p><p>\u201cGreat progress again today,\u201d incident commander Carl Schwope said Thursday night. But \u201ctomorrow has the potential to be a very destructive day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be chaotic if anything close to what happened (last) Friday occurs,\u201d added operations chief Jayson Coil.</p><p>Sheriff Chris Lopez, of New Mexico's Miguel County, confirmed for the first time Thursday night the fire there has destroyed at least 166 residences, 108 outbuildings and three commercial buildings. He joined authorities in neighboring Mora County in pleading with residents to pay close attention Friday to sudden changes in closures and evacuation orders.</p><p>\u201cFalling trees, possibly falling power lines, that\u2019s the kind of winds we're looking at,\u201d Lopez said.</p><p>Turner, the fire behavior specialist, said the gusty winds are only part of the problem. He said moisture levels in downed logs and woody debris are \u201cextremely dry\u201d\u2014 just 2% in small twigs, pine needles and grasses that \u201cactually carry a forest fire across the landscape.\"</p><p>Moisture in a small log \u201cthe size of a 4-by-4 post you buy at the lumber store ... are coming down to 8%,\u201d he said. \u201cKiln-dry is 12%. So out there, that\u2019s drying to what a kiln would do.\u201d</p><p>In northern Arizona, authorities downgraded some some evacuation orders at a fire that has destroyed at least 20 homes near Flagstaff. It's now estimated to be 43% contained. Another fire 10 miles (16 km) south of Prescott was 23% contained, but officials at both blazes warned of worsening conditions expected Friday.</p><p>Elsewhere, one national incident team continued to oversee a large prairie fire in Nebraska, where more than 200 firefighters were battling a blaze that has been burning since last week.</p><p>About 68 square miles (176 square kilometers) of mostly grasses and farmland have been blackened near Nebraska's state line with Kansas, several homes were destroyed and at least one person was killed. That fire was 88% contained Thursday.</p><p>___</p><p>Sonner reported from Reno, Nevada. Margery A.

All the other access roads were blocked by piles of plastic and other semitrailers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEMON: So, we do have a crew on the way to that scene, and they're going to bring you live a report from there soon. But officials say that the cause of the fire likely won't be known until it is extinguished. But they say the fire could burn for days. And we're going to be live on the ground in Richmond just a little bit later on, on CNN This Morning.</p><p>COLLINS: And while we wait for new developments on that, we're also tracking new body cam video that came out of Louisville overnight, Louisville Police officers, as they rushed in to stop the mass shooter at the bank. This video comes from the body cameras of the first two officers to arrive on the scene. The rookie cop who was shot in the head, Officer Nicholas Wilt, he's still in the hospital actually recovering, and his training officer, who was the one who ultimately killed the gunman.</p><p>I do want to warn you that what you're about to see is the moment that the shooter opened fire as the officers were approaching the entrance of this bank.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're making entry from the from the east side pressing the main.</p><p>[07:05:04]</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: Police say the gunman was waiting in the lobby to ambush police after killing five of his co-workers. An eyewitness cell phone video shows a different angle. You can see the training officer run and take cover as bullets fly. He struggles to see the gunman to the glass as the rookie officer lays outside the entrance, severely wounded. He finally gets a clear shot about three minutes later. We're about to play the body camera video again. The wounded officer is blurred and you'll see the gunman's body on the floor.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: God, I don't have an angle. I think I got him down. I think he's down.</p><p>Suspect down. Get the officer. No, he's down. Get the officer.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEMON: We warned you, it is very disturbing to watch that the gunman is there on the ground surrounded by shattered glass. We're going to talk more about this newly released by the cam video and the police response.</p><p>I want to bring in CNN Senior -- excuse me, Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst, Mr. John Miller. John, good morning to you. It's -- you know, we have to remember that someone was shot there, still recovering, the police officer. Just your overall response to that video and the police response?</p><p>JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: Well, this is something police are practicing all the time. You know, it's no secret to the law enforcement community as it is into us. We live in the active shooter world now. That's a reality we've discussed on this show, more active shooters than there have been days of the year. So, this has been a developing focus in training.</p><p>It was a year ago today that I was standing in front of those microphones in Brooklyn for the active shooter on the subway who shot ten people in New York City. And, you know, we worked on this to make sure that everyone of 36,000 police officers in New York was trained in these tactics.</p><p>And what you see here, you know, C.J. Galloway, the police officer, fires that shot that takes the gunman down, and his partner, you know they're approaching with these tactics in mind. They go to the far left, they're hugging that wall and they find out the hard way, the wall they're using for cover is the wrong angle. You know, nick goes down, C.J. cuts to the left and finds, you know, different cover. You just saw him on that video switching sides trying to get that beat on the gunman.</p><p>Deputy Chief Humphrey said yesterday it wasn't perfect but it was pretty good, you know, in the circumstances, and I would go through a door with either one of these officers. And what does not perfect mean when you're under fire? It means in a perfect world, you would have waited for two more units, formed a four person contact team, split two directions so that the subject field of fire would be split into and so on. But perfect doesn't exist in these situations. You go with the cards you're dealt and they did, and they both acted very heroically, and aside from the courage, very tactically proficient.</p><p>COLLINS: Yes. And you can hear their concerns on the audio for the other officer, Officer Nicholas Wilt, who's still recovering, who has been shot. Can we talk about what we're hearing from the mayor, though? And one thing that I was so struck by that he said yesterday is he was talking about what the rules are in Louisville and the laws and essentially saying that the gun that that should have used because of the law that they have there will eventually one day, unless something changes, be auctioned off.</p><p>MILLER: So, they're not the only place that does that. A sensible law is that you don't confiscate guns from criminals and then put them back out into a marketplace where they're going to return to the street possibly to other criminals. But that is one of those states where the gun laws are minimalist to the point of being nonexistent, meaning, if you pass the federal background check that shows in their records, the NICS check, they call it, you're not a convicted felon or wanted -- currently wanted criminal, you're able to buy that weapon.</p><p>HARLOW: You also, to Kaitlan's point, in Kentucky, you do not need a permit to carry a concealed weapon, including a -- this is a legally purchased AR-15-style rifle. MILLER: That's right. And, I mean, Poppy just to extend the bizarre situation there, you have to be a resident of most states to buy a gun in that state.</p><p>[07:10:01]</p><p>In Kentucky, you can be a resident of any state as long as you are entitled to have a weapon in the state you're from, which means you can (INAUDIBLE) rules concealed weapon no matter where you're from.</p><p>LEMON: I want you to continue on. But just so people can see, just to bring home what you're saying, a person over 21 who can legally purchase a firearm can carry it concealed in public, no universal background checks, no red flag laws, no waiting period between the purchase of a firearm to physical transfer to a buyer enacted a Second Amendment sanctuary bill prohibiting local authorities from enacting federal gun regulations. Sorry to interrupt, but I just wanted to (INAUDIBLE) what you're saying.</p><p>MILLER: That's what we're talking about, Don. And, I mean, there are other states like that. In the NRA databases and all that, when you look it up state by state, one of the rules here, they call that a free state.</p><p>COLLINS: Yes. So many questions for it, and you're hearing it from city officials themselves. John Miller, thanks for breaking down that and also the body cam footage with us.</p><p>MILLER: Thanks.</p><p>LEMON: Thank you, John. Coming at 9:00 P.M. on CNN Tonight, John is going to -- Kaitlan is going to be traveling to Kentucky to speak with Governor Andy Beshear about this.</p><p>HARLOW: Just one week after former President Trump was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to 34 felony criminal charges in the hush money probe, the Manhattan district attorney who brought those charges is now suing the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jim Jordan. He's accusing the Trump ally of trying to interfere with his office's criminal case. The committee is investigating Bragg's handling of the case, demanding more documents and testimony.</p><p>So, let's bring in Senior Legal Analyst and former Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District Elie Honig. Elie, obviously, we should note, we've known it before that you were former colleague of D.A. Bragg, that team prosecuting Trump. It's rare, right, to see this sort of back and forth in this way between, you know, leading member of Congress at the judiciary committee and the D.A. prosecuting the former president.</p><p>ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: It's very rare, Poppy. This is what happens when the law meets politics. And now we are in this really unique scenario that we have not seen anything quite like before.</p><p>Now, all of this swirls around last week's indictment by the Manhattan D.A. Alvin Bragg of Donald Trump over the documentation around hush money payments made by Donald Trump before the 2016 election to Stormy Daniels. Of course, this was the first ever indictment of a president or a former president.</p><p>Now, people started to take sides pretty early here. For example, Representative Jim Jordan, the new House judiciary chairman, wrote a letter to Alvin Bragg in which he said, quote, this is an unprecedented abuse of prosecutorial authority and he demanded information from Bragg around the case.</p><p>I want you to pay attention to the date of that letter from Jim Jordan, March 20th. That is before the indictment was unsealed. That is before the indictment was even voted on.</p><p>HARLOW: Before we knew what the charges were, before the grand jury has even indictment.</p><p>HONIG: The indictment, excuse me, did not exist.</p><p>Now, Alvin Bragg responded to Jim Jordan and said, no thanks, Congress, this is not for you. Jim Jordan did not take well to that response. And so what Jim Jordan has now done is request information and testimony from Alvin Bragg, the D.A., from Matthew Colangelo, one of the ADAs who's on the team prosecuting Trump, and then Jim Jordan served a subpoena from the House Judiciary Committee on Mark Pomerantz, a former ADA who was working on this case but resigned about a year ago.</p><p>And now what Alvin Bragg has done with this lawsuit is he's gone into federal court and he's asked the judge to do two things. One, quash, as we say, meaning block the subpoena to Mark Pomerantz, and, two, if they should subpoena Alvin Bragg or anyone else, Bragg says, I want a ruling right now that that kind of subpoena is invalid and will not be enforced.</p><p>HARLOW: Well, what kind of judge is going to make this decision and on what legal grounds do they make the decision on?</p><p>HONIG: So, this is this is the judge. She is a federal judge. Her name is Mary Kay Vyskocil. She was appointed to the bench by Donald Trump in 2019. I never appeared in front of her. She came onto the bench after I left that district. But I asked around, she is not known as a partisan or an ideologue. She was basically a corporate big firm lawyer for about 30 years.</p><p>Now, Alvin Bragg has taken this case to federal court. He's a state prosecutor, but he's essentially walked this case across the street because it deals with Congress, which has federal jurisdiction. So, we are in the district court, which is the trial level court. There will be a hearing next week. The loser of that hearing can appeal to the second circuit and then perhaps up to the U.S. Supreme Court</p><p>HARLOW: But this could also go up to the --</p><p>HONIG: Potentially, the Supreme Court decides what it wants to hear.</p><p>HARLOW: How fast does this move?</p><p>HONIG: Well, the hearing is set for next week. That's on a pretty quick timeframe. So, I expect this to move within weeks. I don't think we're going to have this dragged out.</p><p>HARLOW: What do you think? Do you think Jim Jordan is going to get what he wants? I mean, asking for grand jury information is highly unusual.</p><p>HONIG: So, you've hit on Alvin Bragg's first argument that he makes in his brief. He says, this is grand jury information. It is secret. It is not to be out there in the public realm. Alvin Bragg also argues in his brief, he says, you're Congress, you have no jurisdiction over me as a local county D.A. prosecutor.</p><p>[07:15:04]</p><p>And he makes a constitutional argument. He says the Tenth Amendment says that what we call the plenary police power, meaning the power to regulate local safety, that is not for you, the federal Congress, that is for me as a local official. Alvin Bragg also writes in his brief, quote, this is a campaign of intimidation, retaliation and obstruction.</p><p>Now, Jim Jordan is not going to go without a fight. He has not yet filed his legal brief, but he's arguing this is an attempt to interfere in the 2024 election. He argues Bragg has received -- his office has received some federal funding and he's argued what we're really doing here is looking at potential legislation.</p><p>HARLOW: of which I think Kara said they used $5,000.</p><p>HONIG: $5,000 on this case. And, by the way, the fact that some federal funds were used here doesn't mean Congress gets to ask whatever they want with no limitations.</p><p>HARLOW: Okay. Elie, thank you, that helped so much. I appreciate it.</p><p>This morning, Donald Trump could get another Republican challenger in the presidential primary race. Senator Tim Scott formally announcing he is launching an exploratory committee.</p><p>LEMON: And guess where we're going? We're going back to Ireland for President Biden's historic visit. Donie O'Sullivan is standing by and speaking to fans, relatives too of President Trump.</p><p>COLLINS: And family.</p><p>LEMON: President Biden, sorry.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[07:20:00]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEPHEN COLBERT, HOST, THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT: The trip is part diplomacy and part homecoming because Biden's ancestors came to the U.S. from Ireland in the mid 1800s when Biden was just ten.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COLLINS: President Biden making a historic visit today to Northern Ireland to mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Peace Accords. He started the day by sitting down with the new British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and next hour, he is set to speak at a university there. You can see him here during his arrival in Belfast.</p><p>The president's goal is to ensure that the peace plan that was brokered by the United States in 1998 remains in place. It is something he has talked about often since taking office. You can see his special envoy, former Congressman Joe Kennedy there.</p><p>Later this morning, the president is going to head south, though, to Dublin, and on the way the place where his great, great, great grandfather grew up.</p><p>CNN's Donie O'Sullivan is live in Carlingford, Ireland, for us. Donie, I mean, we can get a sense of just how excited people are. I saw in your teas, there was a cake with an American flag on it behind you. And you know he's known as the Irish president since JFK.</p><p>DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely JFK started this tradition as 60 years ago this year of U.S. presidents coming to Ireland to find their Irish roots. And a lot of people already showing up here in Carlingford. The president is not expected here for hours, but they've already closed down the streets.</p><p>And I want to introduce you to a very popular man in the town. His name is Peter McGuigan (ph). Peter?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're very welcome, Donie. You're very welcome.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Peter, could you tell us a little bit about why -- what does this mean to the community? Why does it matter?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, Donie, it means everything. It means everything not only to Calingford here but to the whole peninsula. You know, we are competing here in this peninsula with Alexi Killarney (ph) and with Galway (ph). But today, Joe Biden will change that for us and we will be the tops.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: and you were telling me earlier a summary to Biden's ancestors left here around the time of the family. You also have a lot of family that immigrated to America.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There's nobody in this peninsula cannot go back to their origin, says somebody belong to them, didn't emigrate to the USA, everybody did. And we were grateful for the attention and grateful for what we received and the welcome we received when we went to America as immigrants. And we'll extend that welcome today President Biden to come here and join us. O'SULLIVAN: And that special relationship between Ireland and the United States, I mean, it even goes up to this present day, the role that Bill Clinton had in the Good Friday Agreement and Senator George Mitchell, and now, of course, Biden is in Belfast today trying to encourage leaders in Northern Ireland to get the government back together there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's time to put our leg onto the table that fell down. But without the President Clinton, the Good Friday Agreement would never have happened. He was it was exclusively down to him and Hillary Clinton were to get that up and rolling. And, hopefully, it will be back up again and the unions will come back in and sit at the table I will enjoy and a great Ireland. And we'll have a party, a big party.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: So, Biden is going to be probably walking along the street later, at least you hope.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, we hope he walked down here (INAUDIBLE) security people.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Tell me tell me about this flag. What's going on with this?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That is called the Irish-American historical flag.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Okay.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It was originally belonged to an American Marine.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Right.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But it found its way by auction into Ireland many years ago, and it's here 25 years. It belonged to a friend of mine and Warrenpoint.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: And it's signed by the --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's signed by the last 14 presidents.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: And you're hoping that --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're hoping -- we've left a little -- see that (INAUDIBLE), for President Biden to sign that today.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: I quickly want to bring in Donna, whose Peter's daughter. Donna, Kaitlan, you mentioned the cakes, and Donna baked these cakes. You have this fantastic tea room here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: All I've done has been baking all night long. We've had our cakes, we have our cupcakes, apple tarts made, homemade brown bread. We're waiting on, Joe.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: You're hoping he takes away --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're waiting on Joe. If he doesn't come. We can come to him, okay?</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Guys, back to you in New York. It's a fun time here. We got the whole --</p><p>LEMON: Why back to us? I mean, this is so much fun. We can just hang out with you guys all day. We need a couple of pints here.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Yes come on over. Come on over. They're admiring the cakes.</p><p>COLLINS: Donie, are we sure they're not there for you? I feel like you're getting just as big of a reception?</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: No, I don't think so. No, I'm not too popular in these parts. We're footballing rivals, we're sports rivals from where Peter is from.</p><p>COLLINS: Epic.</p><p>[07:25:00]</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We won the (INAUDIBLE) in 1957. We never --</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: You haven't won one since.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We won in a row, (INAUDIBLE) calls it.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Alabama football, I'm sure you're a big fan.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, yes.</p><p>COLLINS: Yes, yes. Show him Nick Simmons' picture. Tell him I said, roll Tide.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: (INAUDIBLE) craziness now, Peter.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's right?</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Yes.</p><p>COLLINS: Thank you, Donie.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We will welcome Donie anytime, welcome to come back anytime.</p><p>LEMON: All right.

A company spokesperson from First Aid Global LLC in TarzanaCalifornia believes that now more than ever aSmoke Escape Hoodis the ultimate escape device that stands between the safety of your family's lives and the devastating effects of a fire.</p><p>\"2021 will soon surpass 2020 as the most destructive wildfire season in California history,\" First Aid Global's spokesperson proclaims from their offices in Southern California. \"The escape product comes in a flat plastic folder that contains a sealed smoke hood. We have been selling this device to oil platforms, cargo vessels, businesses and industries for nearly two decades now, but there has always been a market for this life-saving device to the general public. A smoke escape hood could stand between your family's safety and the devastating effects of a house fire or forest fire. There's no reason why mom and dad can't have this inexpensive escape device too!\"</p><p>The smoke hood is easy to don by simply pulling the device over the user's head, so with its hermetic rubber gasket neck seal, the device fits adults as well as children. It passed UL Certification and the Kapton Polymide Film actually resists temperatures up to 450-degrees Celsius. A demonstration video of holding a lighter flame to the hood can be seen onFirst Aid Global's Youtube Page.</p><p>First Aid Global has been selling first aid, safety and preparedness supplies since 1997 and their HK Smoke Escape Hood is only available on their own website at:<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.firstaidglobal.com/smoke-escape-hood\">https://www.firstaidglobal.com/smoke-escape-hood</url>.</p><p>Media Contact</p><p>Brandon Copley, First Aid Global LLC, 8187054911,<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:sales@firstaidglobal.com\">sales@firstaidglobal.com</email></p><p>Twitter,Facebook</p><p>SOURCE First Aid Global LLC</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=UN72594&amp;Transmission_Id=202108111800PR_NEWS_USPR_____UN72594&amp;DateId=20210811\"/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRNEWS-UN7259420210811</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRNEWS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63BR-JSX1-JB72-14S8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8054</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"333\"/><timeReceived>6:00 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>PR Newswire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 11, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But they show how just a handful of people with roles in the country's decentralized election system can try to muck up the process and try to sow chaos in elections. And they demonstrate the continued hold that former President Donald Trump's unfounded conspiracy theories of widespread election fraud have over his allies and supporters around the country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At least two counties on Monday voted to not certify their respective county elections: Cochise County in Arizona, where county supervisors voted 2-1 to delay certification until at least Friday, beyond the Monday statutory deadline, and Luzerne County in Pennsylvania, where the county board deadlocked 2-2 on a certification vote, with one abstention who later said he would vote to certify at a future meeting.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Counties failing to certify elections is largely unprecedented in recent American history, even after the 2020 election, and litigation is basically guaranteed.</p><p>Marc Elias, a prominent attorney in the Democratic Party, tweeted shortly after the vote that the Arizona county would be sued, after his firm sent a letter on behalf of a seniors group threatening a lawsuit if the board did not certify the results. Monday evening, his firm followed through with that threat, filing a lawsuit in state court seeking to force Cochise to certify its election results.</p><p>\"Defendants voted against canvassing the 2022 general election results until at least December 2, 2022, and have thus made clear that they will not comply with their non-discretionary, mandatory legal duty to complete the canvass by the statutory deadline to do so. In doing so, Defendants are violating Arizona law,\" the suit argued.</p><p>Meanwhile, Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs also filed a suit with similar aims late Monday. Last week, her office sent a letter last week to the Cochise County board, in which state elections director Kori Lorick promised legal action, further warning that if the board had not certified by the state's canvassing deadline, the state would proceed regardless. </p><p>Hobbs, a Democrat, is also the state's governor-elect. She defeated Republican Kari Lake, a former TV anchor who has refused to concede the race.</p><p>\"Absent this Court's intervention, the Secretary will have no choice but to complete the statewide canvass by December 8 without Cochise County's votes included,\" attorneys for Hobbs wrote. \"The Board's unprecedented inaction should not disenfranchise tens of thousands of voters in Cochise County.\" Lake carried the county by 18 points.</p><p>Cochise County supervisors voted Monday to call for a special meeting Friday about the security of their voting machines, saying they would like to hear further presentations on whether they were properly certified for use in the midterm election.</p><p>The secretary of state's office did not directly address litigation in a statement after the Cochise County vote on Monday. \"The Secretary of State's Office provided supporting documentation that confirmed Cochise County's election equipment was properly certified,\" Sophia Solis, a spokesperson for the office, wrote in an email. \"The Board of Supervisors had all of the information they needed to certify this election and failed to uphold their responsibility for Cochise voters.\"</p><p>Pennsylvania's Luzerne County had serious problems on Election Day, where voting centers ran out of paper ballots early in the day. A court order there eventually kept polling places open for two additional hours so voters would be able to cast ballots, and Spotlight PA reported that the local district attorney is investigating the shortage.</p><p>Elias, the Democratic attorney, seemed to allude to a potential lawsuit there. And a statement from the Pennsylvania Department of State late Monday afternoon said that the department \"has reached out to [Luzerne] officials to inquire about the board's decision and their intended next steps.\"</p><p>But the results in Luzerne will likely be certified soon, even absent immediate court action. Daniel Schramm, a Democrat on the county board who voted to abstain from the vote earlier Monday, said in an interview with the Associated Press later Monday that he would soon vote to certify the results.</p><p>\"I wanted to research to see exactly how many people were just not allowed to vote. I couldn't find any,\" Schramm told the AP, telling the wire service that election officials contacted two-thirds of the workers who ran individual polling places and \"they reported nobody was turned away.\" The AP reported that a meeting to certify the results has been scheduled for Wednesday.</p><p>An attorney for the county had told board members during the meeting that it was possible the state or candidates could \"file actions\" after the county failed to certify the election.</p><p>There are few examples in recent elections of a county refusing to certify legitimate results. Earlier in the year, Otero County, N.M., initially refused to certify election results in the state's summer primary. The New Mexico secretary of state sued, and the state Supreme Court ordered the county to certify, which it ultimately did.</p><p>The Cochise County board meeting Monday morning was brief. But during the Luzerne County meeting and in another meeting in Maricopa County, Arizona's largest county, angry people demanded that county officials not certify the vote, sometimes calling for a new election to be held.</p><p>In Maricopa, protesters targeted both board Chair Bill Gates and Recorder Stephen Richer, both Republicans, after tabulation machines at many polling places in the county were unable to read ballots on the day of the election. (Voters who faced problems could have chosen to instead submit their ballots to be tabulated at a central voting site, and some sites saw long lines.) One person appeared to call for Gates to be executed for treason during a public hearing on Monday.</p><p>After an hours-long hearing, Maricopa's Republican-dominated board voted unanimously to certify the election. Lake, the losing gubernatorial candidate, tweeted out several videos with people chastising election officials in in Maricopa County.</p><p>Elsewhere, the certification process also faced protests, but officials still certified the vote. In Michigan, for example, the state's bipartisan board of state canvassers voted unanimously on Monday to certify the results of the state's election. Kristina Karamo - the Trump-endorsed candidate for secretary of state who was handily defeated earlier this month - pleaded with the board not to certify but was rejected, and the canvassers briefly left the room due to disruptions.</p><p>\"A lot of the questions that arise are from lack of proper understanding, which is unfortunately fed by candidates and party officials on both sides of the aisle who feed into this nonsense, who make these claims that fire everybody up because it's a short-term gain for them and that's dangerous to our system,\" Tony Daunt, the Republican chair of the board, said during the meeting, according to the Detroit Free Press. \"And me talking about this is essentially trying to put out a forest fire with a Dixie cup right now.\"</p><p>Holly Otterbein contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-00070617</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66XN-70T1-F118-94MD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1238\"/><timeReceived>8:35 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"11\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>November 22, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>Elections</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTlGMTIwRjY1ODQ4NDQyRUE1MkJFMUQwMTE1MDhGQjY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX001648</classCode><className>SUITS &amp;

Alex Padilla, D-California, issued the following news release and letter:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) joined Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), and Doug LaMalfa (R-Calif.) in leading a bipartisan letter to the United States Forest Service (USFS) regarding the lack of forest management and fire preparedness efforts made in Grizzly Flats, the California town that was destroyed by the Caldor Fire in August 2021. With the worst of this year's fire season over, Padilla's letter urges the Forest Service to reevaluate its fire prevention strategies and improve its community protection efforts to prevent further destruction caused by future wildfires.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As revealed in a recent investigation by CapRadio, the Forest Service failed to take the necessary steps to protect Grizzly Flats from a wildfire the size of the Caldor Fire despite models showing its imminence and pleas from the community to do so. According to the investigation, the failure to fully implement the Trestle Forest Health Project in a timely manner ultimately led to the town's destruction as a result of the fast-moving fire, which followed a path predicted by models.</p><p>\"Fire modeling from the Forest Service highlighted that a severe wildfire could engulf the town in as little as 24 hours. The Forest Service then spent nearly 10 years developing the Trestle Forest Health Project to protect Grizzly Flats by removing fuels on 15,000 acres of forest by 2020 to prevent a catastrophic fire using a combination of commercial thinning, hand thinning, and prescribed fire,\" wrote the lawmakers. \"However, the recent investigation found that the Forest Service neglected priority areas at the highest risk for fire, delayed the deadline for the project's completion, only completed 14% of the intended work, and only implemented the commercial thinning elements of the project that produce revenue for the forest unit.\"</p><p>\"It is unacceptable that the town's proactive efforts and calls for aggressive fire mitigation assistance were met with inaction and delays from the Forest Service,\" continued the lawmakers. \"Though we understand the administrative and environmental hurdles facing forest management projects - including staffing shortages, funding challenges, climate change, and endangered species concerns - the length of delays with regard to the Trestle Forest Health Project are particularly egregious and raise broader concerns.\"</p><p>Since taking office, Padilla has made improving the federal response to wildfires one of his top priorities. Padilla's FIRE Act, which will update the Stafford Act that governs the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to improve its wildfire preparedness and response programs, recently passed the Senate unanimously. He introduced a package of bills aimed at ensuring California has the federal resources it needs to protect communities impacted by wildfire smoke and is leading legislation aimed at battling wildfires, protecting workers, and helping combat the effects of wildfire smoke. Padilla's Fire Suppression Improvement Act, a bill to help ease the burden on state and local governments who are shouldering the weight of increasingly devastating wildfires, was unanimously advanced out of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. Padilla also successfully advocated for California to receive billions for wildfire response and drought relief in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.</p><p>* * *</p><p>November 18, 2022</p><p>To: The Honorable Randy Moore, Chief, United States Forest Service, 1400 Independence Ave., SW, Washington, DC 20250</p><p>Dear Chief Moore,</p><p>We write to inquire about the Forest Service's failed implementation of the Trestle Forest Health Project resulting in the destruction of Grizzly Flats, California, which was almost entirely wiped out by the 2021 Caldor Fire. In light of the recent investigation by CapRadio and the California Newsroom - and the billions of dollars that Congress has recently provided for hazardous fuels projects - we request that you provide us with a detailed briefing regarding the failed implementation of the Trestle Project, which experts have determined could have saved the town and spared its residents.</p><p>As highlighted in the investigation by CapRadio and the California Newsroom, the Forest Service warned the residents of Grizzly Flats decades ago that a blaze such as Caldor could destroy their town, which is surrounded on three sides by the Eldorado National Forest. Fire modeling from the Forest Service highlighted that a severe wildfire could engulf the town in as little as 24 hours. The Forest Service then spent nearly 10 years developing the Trestle Forest Health Project to protect Grizzly Flats by removing fuels on 15,000 acres of forest by 2020 to prevent a catastrophic fire using a combination of commercial thinning, hand thinning, and prescribed fire. However, the recent investigation found that the Forest Service neglected priority areas at the highest risk for fire, delayed the deadline for the project's completion, only completed 14% of the intended work, and only implemented the commercial thinning elements of the project that produce revenue for the forest unit.</p><p>On the other hand, the residents of Grizzly Flats took immediate action after being presented with the fire risk modeling. A volunteer Grizzly Flats Fire Safe Council was formed following that modeling and raised over $2 million dollars through grants and grassroots funding to protect their community. Over the next 15 years, the council created fire breaks on the north, east, and west sides of the town - with the understanding that the Forest Service would complete its forest management and fire mitigation plan that included a fuel reduction project on the town's highly-combustible southern side, a promise that the Forest Service ultimately never fulfilled.</p><p>On August 17, 2021, the entire town of Grizzly Flats was destroyed by the Caldor Fire. The fire followed the southern path that had been predicted by the modeling and that would have been mitigated by full implementation of the Trestle Forest Health Project.</p><p>It is unacceptable that the town's proactive efforts and calls for aggressive fire mitigation assistance were met with inaction and delays from the Forest Service. Though we understand the administrative and environmental hurdles facing forest management projects - including staffing shortages, funding challenges, climate change, and endangered species concerns - the length of delays with regard to the Trestle Forest Health Project are particularly egregious and raise broader concerns.</p><p>In light of this example - and in anticipation of billions of dollars being spent on similar projects throughout California and the West in the coming years - we request a full explanation for the delays on the Trestle Forest Health Project and a thorough overview of the uncompleted components of the project, the misplaced focus on the commercial thinning elements of the project, the lack of prescribed burns, and any administrative delays that ultimately resulted in the project being left incomplete. We also ask that you name any other communities in California for which the Forest Service has identified a high risk of catastrophic wildfire and is in the process of preparing a plan - or has prepared a plan but not yet fully implemented it.</p><p>We look forward to your response, and we hope to continue working together to increase the efficiency and funding for crucial wildfire mitigation projects to prevent further tragedies.</p><p>View co-signers here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.padilla.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/California-Delegation-on-Caldor-Fire_Trestle-Forest-Health-Project-FINAL4.pdf\">https://www.padilla.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/California-Delegation-on-Caldor-Fire_Trestle-Forest-Health-Project-FINAL4.pdf</url></p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-feinstein-lead-bipartisan-letter-urging-forest-service-to-evaluate-its-strategies-and-better-protect-communities%EF%BF%BC/\">https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-feinstein-lead-bipartisan-letter-urging-forest-service-to-evaluate-its-strategies-and-better-protect-communities%EF%BF%BC/</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>T40-MgEditor-8003514 T40-MgEditor</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8003514</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66XG-RJ81-JC11-13PP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1328\"/><timeReceived>9:10 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"11\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>November 22, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Padilla's FIRE Act, which will update the Stafford Act that governs the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to improve its wildfire preparedness and response programs, recently passed the Senate unanimously.

Padilla's Fire Suppression Improvement Act, a bill to help ease the burden on state and local governments who are shouldering the weight of increasingly devastating wildfires, was unanimously advanced out of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.

In light of the recent investigation by CapRadio and the California Newsroom - and the billions of dollars that Congress has recently provided for hazardous fuels projects - we request that you provide us with a detailed briefing regarding the failed implementation of the Trestle Project, which experts have determined could have saved the town and spared its residents.</p><p>As highlighted in the investigation by CapRadio and the California Newsroom, the Forest Service warned the residents of Grizzly Flats decades ago that a blaze such as Caldor could destroy their town, which is surrounded on three sides by the Eldorado National Forest. Fire modeling from the Forest Service highlighted that a severe wildfire could engulf the town in as little as 24 hours. The Forest Service then spent nearly 10 years developing the Trestle Forest Health Project to protect Grizzly Flats by removing fuels on 15,000 acres of forest by 2020 to prevent a catastrophic fire using a combination of commercial thinning, hand thinning, and prescribed fire. However, the recent investigation found that the Forest Service neglected priority areas at the highest risk for fire, delayed the deadline for the project's completion, only completed 14% of the intended work, and only implemented the commercial thinning elements of the project that produce revenue for the forest unit.</p><p>On the other hand, the residents of Grizzly Flats took immediate action after being presented with the fire risk modeling. A volunteer Grizzly Flats Fire Safe Council was formed following that modeling and raised over $2 million dollars through grants and grassroots funding to protect their community. Over the next 15 years, the council created fire breaks on the north, east, and west sides of the town - with the understanding that the Forest Service would complete its forest management and fire mitigation plan that included a fuel reduction project on the town's highly-combustible southern side, a promise that the Forest Service ultimately never fulfilled.</p><p>On August 17, 2021, the entire town of Grizzly Flats was destroyed by the Caldor Fire. The fire followed the southern path that had been predicted by the modeling and that would have been mitigated by full implementation of the Trestle Forest Health Project.</p><p>It is unacceptable that the town's proactive efforts and calls for aggressive fire mitigation assistance were met with inaction and delays from the Forest Service. Though we understand the administrative and environmental hurdles facing forest management projects - including staffing shortages, funding challenges, climate change, and endangered species concerns - the length of delays with regard to the Trestle Forest Health Project are particularly egregious and raise broader concerns.</p><p>In light of this example - and in anticipation of billions of dollars being spent on similar projects throughout California and the West in the coming years - we request a full explanation for the delays on the Trestle Forest Health Project and a thorough overview of the uncompleted components of the project, the misplaced focus on the commercial thinning elements of the project, the lack of prescribed burns, and any administrative delays that ultimately resulted in the project being left incomplete. We also ask that you name any other communities in California for which the Forest Service has identified a high risk of catastrophic wildfire and is in the process of preparing a plan - or has prepared a plan but not yet fully implemented it.</p><p>We look forward to your response, and we hope to continue working together to increase the efficiency and funding for crucial wildfire mitigation projects to prevent further tragedies.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-feinstein-lead-bipartisan-letter-urging-forest-service-to-evaluate-its-strategies-and-better-protect-communities%ef%bf%bc/\">https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-feinstein-lead-bipartisan-letter-urging-forest-service-to-evaluate-its-strategies-and-better-protect-communities%ef%bf%bc/</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CODUPB-COSSMB21218T8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66XG-JM71-DYVR-P288-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1291\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"11\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>November 21, 2022</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Over the next 15 years, the council created fire breaks on the north, east, and west sides of the town with the understanding that the Forest Service would complete its forest management and fire mitigation plan that included a fuel reduction project on the town's highly-combustible southern side, a promise that the Forest Service ultimately never fulfilled.</p><p>On August 17, 2021, the entire town of Grizzly Flats was destroyed by the Caldor Fire. The fire followed the southern path that had been predicted by the modeling and that would have been mitigated by full implementation of the Trestle Forest Health Project.</p><p>It is unacceptable that the town's proactive efforts and calls for aggressive fire mitigation assistance were met with inaction and delays from the Forest Service. Though we understand the administrative and environmental hurdles facing forest management projects including staffing shortages, funding challenges, climate change, and endangered species concerns the length of delays with regard to the Trestle Forest Health Project are particularly egregious and raise broader concerns.</p><p>In light of this example and in anticipation of billions of dollars being spent on similar projects throughout California and the West in the coming years we request a full explanation for the delays on the Trestle Forest Health Project and a thorough overview of the uncompleted components of the project, the misplaced focus on the commercial thinning elements of the project, the lack of prescribed burns, and any administrative delays that ultimately resulted in the project being left incomplete. We also ask that you name any other communities in California for which the Forest Service has identified a high risk of catastrophic wildfire and is in the process of preparing a plan or has prepared a plan but not yet fully implemented it.</p><p>We look forward to your response, and we hope to continue working together to increase the efficiency and funding for crucial wildfire mitigation projects to prevent further tragedies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125567820</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66X9-DMC1-DYTH-G2KC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1256\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"11\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>November 21, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

I'm Kim Brunhuber.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're following breaking news out of Israel, where that country's military is now mobilizing, including its reserves, in response to this morning's surprise rocket attack from Gaza.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The security cabinet is expected to meet in the coming hours and Israel's president said the country is facing a very difficult moment. The attacks began early today as many people were still sleeping. Hundreds of rockets have been fired into Israel with no letup so far.</p><p>Israeli officials say there were multiple injuries, some of them serious, and at least one fatality. Israel's defense minister just proclaimed Israel will win this war. The Israeli military also warns the number of militants have infiltrated Israel from Gaza. Hadas Gold joins us now from Jerusalem.</p><p>Hadas, the scale, the coordination of these attacks, what we're seeing now just extraordinary.</p><p>What's the latest?</p><p>HADAS GOLD, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: This is completely unprecedented. And this is war, Kim. Something that Israel is not seen the likes of this coordinated attack. Many are comparing it to the Yom Kippur war, which perhaps purposely is on its 50th anniversary as we speak.</p><p>That war started in October 6, 50 years ago. That was a surprise attack on Israel and that's what we're experiencing now, starting at 6:30 in the morning. A barrage of rockets and it's been nonstop since then.</p><p>Here in Jerusalem, we've had at least, I would say, five or six air raid sirens go off. I would say, I lost count of the number, of the explosions I've heard in the air above us. That could be interceptions, that could be rocket impacts. If we get a siren we will take you with us into our protected space.</p><p>But we are just getting some new information right now, as we speak, from the Israeli military. They're having a briefing right now. They say that there have been 2,000, at least, rockets fired. Hamas has claimed more than 5,000.</p><p>The Israeli military is also saying the infiltrations, this is something that is new and unprecedented. They say that these infiltrations happened through the air, through paragliders, through the sea and through the ground.</p><p>They say, as we speak, there are fights, active firefights, going on in various Israeli cities and villages, around Gaza, including two army bases. That gives you an idea of the number of militants who have infiltrated, managed infiltrate from Gaza into Israel.</p><p>It's not clear if they were already there, whether they came in through the sea and sky as the Israeli military said. We are also hearing Israeli media reports of civilians in these villages, in these cities, saying that they are barricading themselves in their bomb shelters because they hear firefights right outside their doors.</p><p>As we, speak again, Israeli military saying that they have active firefights in several villages in southern Israel., including two army bases, including one of the border crossings, the main border crossing into Israel.</p><p>They've called up thousands of Israeli military reservists and have named this operation Swords of Iron. Hamas has called this the Al-Aqsa Storm operation and they are connecting this directly to tensions that have been building at the Al-Aqsa compound, also known as the Temple Mount to Jews.</p><p>This is a place that is so holy to both religions. While there have been tensions there over the past couple weeks, especially during Jewish holidays of Sukkoth, there hasn't been any sort of specific trigger point of an Israeli military raid or arrest being undertaken at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound.</p><p>While we have been reporting for a year and a half of clashes and tensions in the occupied West Bank between Israeli military and militants, there hasn't been a specific trigger point. I think that's why there's so many questions right now for the Israeli military about how it seems as though everybody was caught off guard.</p><p>Another thing that we are following very closely -- and we don't have this confirmed-- are those reports of potentially Israeli soldiers or civilians who have been captured or killed.</p><p>What we know so far for sure is that there have been at least 100 injuries within Israel itself. We know of at least two fatalities, including one who was a regional council head for the Negev. According to the Negev regional council, they say this person was killed while in a firefight with militants on the streets. But we are expecting to hear of more fatalities potentially in the coming hours. Again, those reports of more than 100 injuries are coming from two separate hospitals. The IDF have declared a state of war alert. They've advised all Israeli civilians in the south to essentially just stay in their shelters, lock the doors.</p><p>[04:05:00]</p><p>GOLD: All other Israeli civilians have been advised to stay close to their shelters. Because all the way out here in Jerusalem, a place that's normally kept out of these conflicts, we've already heard five air raid sirens. Tel Aviv has been affected. The area around the airport has been affected.</p><p>As far as we, know Ben Gurion Airport, the main international airport, has not been shut down yet. It is still operating. We do know that air raid sirens have gone off there as well. And now, we also have confirmation the Israeli military has started its airstrikes in Gaza.</p><p>And we should expect a very, very heavy and strong Israeli military response to this because of this unprecedented attack, a combination coordinated these rockets plus these military infiltrations. Again, something that Israel has not experienced, a surprise attack, since the Yom Kippur war.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: I want to ask you about that, Hadas, just how unprecedented this is, such large scale rocket attacks. Especially, Israelis seeing these images of armed attackers driving around the streets. It must be terrifying.</p><p>What is the mood right now among Israelis?</p><p>GOLD: I think the mood right now is a bit of shock, a bit of how could this happen?</p><p>Rocket attacks have become -- I don't want to say normal but they've become a part of the equation that we expect, especially with conflict with Gaza.</p><p>But what is different is these infiltrations -- and there will be huge questions for the Israeli security establishment of how they let this happen. Just seeing these videos of militants on the backs of pickup trucks, driving through Israeli towns, militants on the streets, militants in army bases, managing to enter army bases and engage with soldiers there.</p><p>These are firefights happening in civilian towns. I don't know if Israel's ever seen anything like that. And that's what's different about this. Rocket attacks, that's something that we've been accustomed to in these conflicts with Gaza.</p><p>And Israel does have the Iron Dome defense system, that does manage to intercept most of these rockets. These infiltrations though, this is something new. I should make it clear that it's not like Gazans never go into Israel. Thousands of Gazans have permits to enter Israel every day to work. So there will be a major question whether some of those people are the ones who are behind this. Or if they're all, as Israeli military said so far, some of these infiltrations came from the air. We saw videos of paragliders.</p><p>They came from the sea, they said, as well. And they came somehow, you know, in other ways on the ground. But really an unprecedented situation that has clearly taken Israel by surprise in some way.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: All right, Hadas Gold in Jerusalem. We'll be back in a little bit with the latest. Thank you so much.</p><p>We move now to Miri Eisin, a retired colonel in the Israel Defense Forces.</p><p>Thank you so much for being here with us. You were listening to our reporter giving us the latest. First, I just want to start with the symbolism of the timing here; 50 years, pretty much the day of the Yom Kippur war in 1973.</p><p>COL. MIRI EISIN (RET.) ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES: Most definitely at the exact same time that perhaps Israel and Saudi Arabia were getting closer and a time period which has been so difficult for Israel.</p><p>You're seeing terror organization saying we're not going to allow a change in the situation. We're going to do something bombastic, not different in that sense from when they tried to blow up the Oslo accords in 1994-1995.</p><p>We are seeing something here which is unprecedented, I said before also, hopefully won't happen. But if there is an alert I'm going to have to go off the air. I too have had several alerts this morning in the Tel Aviv area. And we're all feeling the 50-year weight of what was there. I was a kid in the '73 war but it definitely feels the same.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: Yes. I do want to ask you, what seems so strange here, how these people got in, we heard there from the sea and the sky.</p><p>Paratroopers?</p><p>How unusual is this?</p><p>EISIN: So the term that Hadas was using was paragliders. And those are a kind of -- absolutely -- first of all, there's no question whatsoever. We're looking at something which is coordinated, planned, long term planning.</p><p>So I'm going to put aside for the moment the strategic surprise. I'm sure we'll talk about that endlessly. I just want to talk at the moment, when we talk about Hamas training. Hamas doing different things, they fire rockets into the sea. They do all sorts of different actions. And you watch it.</p><p>But they did not actively participate in any of the main exchanges that took place in the last two years. And I say two years of planning, two years of executing it. Let's be clear, you can always plan and execute.</p><p>Of course, the question is, how are we so surprised?</p><p>And I'll add in that we expected, in a horrific way, a very similar type of scenario up north. And one of the things that we always say about Hamas in the Gaza Strip is what they do, Hezbollah can do times 10. So right now, I'm sitting here in the Tel Aviv area.</p><p>[04:10:00]</p><p>EISIN: And I'm more worried about the implications of something similar to what we've been seeing in these last six hours, expanding and including also the entire northern front.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: That's exactly, yet because Hamas, we heard them exhorting Palestinians, Arabs, to take up weapons and attack.</p><p>So do you expect this to spread?</p><p>EISIN: I don't expect it, necessarily, to spread. But this is something that was very well planned, very well coordinated. And I worry. I'm the incoming director of the Institute for International Counter-Terrorism, ICT.</p><p>Just a month, ago when we were sitting there talking about the challenges themselves, what am I worried about right now?</p><p>I'm worried about this and, yes, I'm going to say it, now, it's something that does come out of Iran. The person who has come out and spoken until now in the Palestinian arena is the ever figure that we never see, Muhammad Al-Deif. He is totally an Iranian run person.</p><p>Saleh al-Arouri, who is the Hamas person in Lebanon, used to sit inside Turkiye, another very strong Iranian connection. And in that sense, the fear here is that there is something that is broader and could yet spread.</p><p>And I want to say clearly, I have no doubts that Israel will prevail. But just like we ask ourselves on how strong are we, we're in the middle right now of battles taking place inside Israeli towns. And they're still at it right now. We will prevail. But the price is going to be horrible.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: Before I let you go, I do want to ask you about Israel's response here. Israel's security cabinet, they're meeting I think in two hours from now.</p><p>What are the options do you think in terms of a response?</p><p>And if Israelis have been captured, how does that complicate the response?</p><p>EISIN: It complicates it completely. And let's be very clear. Israel is already responding. When we are responding, we were strategically surprised. That means that our response is to the ones that we knew from before.</p><p>But this is something that we were not necessarily ready for. So right now, we're a ship in that sense. It's going to take a little bit of time until we move and change. And we will do so. But the responses are going to be, first of all, how we deter Hezbollah and make sure this doesn't also open a northern front.</p><p>Hamas itself, that they pay the price. I want to say clearly, it's not the people of the Gaza Strip; it's Hamas. Hamas just did a cross border land, air, underground attack into Israel and they sit in the Gaza Strip and they are going to be hit. And it is going to be harsh and difficult and war never looks good. And they started a war and it's going to continue.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: Yes, I'm afraid so. We'll have to leave it there but we really appreciate your expertise on this. Miri Eisin, thank you so much.</p><p>EISIN: Thank you so much.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: All, right we'll be right back.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[04:15:00]</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>BRUNHUBER: Let's get back to our breaking news this hour. Israel has launched a military operation against Hamas after the group carried out a surprise attack from Gaza. Hamas is claiming to have fired some 5,000 rockets early Saturday, targeting airports and military positions.</p><p>Israel has declared a state of war alert and is striking a number of military targets in Gaza.</p><p>Back here in the U.S., President Biden is facing criticism for moving forward with the construction of new barriers at the southern border. Critics say the president is breaking a campaign promise to never build additional border walls during his term.</p><p>But Biden says he couldn't stop the move because Congress had already earmarked funds to construct the barriers, which will go up amid a rise in migrant crossings.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I was told that I had no choice, that Congress passes legislation to build something -- whether it's an aircraft carrier, a wall or provide for a tax cut. I can't say I don't like it, I'm not going to do it. If this hadn't been vetoed, this law.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUESTION: Yesterday you try to re-appropriate the funds.</p><p>BIDEN: We tried to ask the Congress to consider changing the law.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUNHUBER: We get more details now from CNN's Priscilla Alvarez in Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: President Biden came under fierce criticism this week over his administration's decision to build border barriers in south Texas.</p><p>Now the president has maintained, along with his officials, that they had to do this because of funds appropriated by Congress in 2019 for the purpose of physical border barriers.</p><p>Sources I've spoken with said the administration was essentially running up against a deadline and that they had to use these funds by the end of fiscal year 2023. Now in a notice to the Federal Register this week, the Homeland Security secretary said that he may have to break more than 20 laws to get this done in an expedited manner.</p><p>And that this is also an area of, quote, \"high illegal entries.\" This is going to be up to 20 miles of border barriers. It also includes gates, cameras, access roads and lights. But the Homeland Security secretary maintaining as well this week that this is -- that the border wall is not the response.</p><p>The administration's posture on this has not changed. But again, it was necessary because these funds were appropriated by Congress. Of course, all of this, though, putting a politically precarious issue at the forefront and leaving the president to defend barriers which he had previously spoken out against during his campaign.</p><p>Of course, this time, he is saying that it is because of those funds that were appropriated before he took office -- Priscilla Alvarez, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRUNHUBER: Now later today, New York's mayor is expected to visit the stretch of jungle between North and South America that hundreds of U.S. bound migrants cross each day.</p><p>Eric Adams says he'll speak directly with asylum seekers moving through Panama's Darien Gap and discourage them from making the dangerous trek. He says his city is struggling to house more than 60,000 migrants who've entered the U.S. seeking refuge. Adams says the influx is a significant problem that requires new solutions.</p><p>[04:20:00]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D-NY), NEW YORK CITY: We have been treating this major shift in human movement globally like a small cold, when in fact, it is a major flu.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUNHUBER: The mayor's visit will come a day after the presidents of Costa Rica and Panama also toured the area. Both leaders said they were there to get a firsthand look at the severity of the crisis. So far, this year more than 4,000 people have crossed the gap. Migrants say their journey has been risky and full of suffering.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): What I can tell you is that it's not a jungle, it's a killing river.

Thank God, we came out alive.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUNHUBER: Costa Rica and Panama are urging regional leaders to convene in a meeting later this month to address the crisis.</p><p>And Mexico's president has denounced U.S. plans to build new barriers as a, quote, \"publicity stunt\" ahead of next year's election. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Friday called the new barriers \"propaganda\" to win over voters.</p><p>But Obrador criticized the politics, saying, quote, \"All U.S. presidents, with all due respect, either Republican or Democrat, have done it during their term to look good in the eyes of Americans that, respectfully, don't have all the information.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRUNHUBER: And joining me now is Muzaffar Chishti, the director of the Migration Policy Institute office at the NYU School of Law.</p><p>Thank you so much for being here with us. So many Democrats say they're disappointed in the president's perceived U-turn on building the wall. Biden says it was a legal requirement. He had to spend the money Congress allocated for border barriers legally. He says his hands were tied.</p><p>I mean, you're a lawyer; is that true?</p><p>MUZAFFAR CHISHTI, DIRECTOR, MIGRATION POLICY INSTITUTE OFFICE, NYU SCHOOL OF LAW: I think his hands were tied for a very specific reason. It's that they tried to undo what then President Biden had done in terms of the allocation for building the wall.</p><p>And the state of Texas and the state of Missouri are challenging their decision to pause the building of the wall and that went to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which sent the case back to a federal judge in Texas. And that federal judge was about to rule. And from all indications, given the history of that judge on migration matters, it's quite reasonable to believe that he would have said that the Biden administration has to build the wall. So in that regard, I think their hands were tied.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: Now President Biden says, despite this, walls don't work. That's a key question here.</p><p>Do they?</p><p>What does the research say?</p><p>CHISHTI: Research shows that, unless they're in highly dense urban settings, where there's a lot of traffic, they don't work. Other than the real environmental and wildlife protection issues, if you build them in remote areas, they tend to be ineffective.</p><p>For the simple reason that, for every tall wall, you can have a ladder that is taller. And you can already have various instruments, which can cut off the material with which defenses are built. Smugglers are very artful at these things.</p><p>So they will find a way to break the wall or break the barriers. And then, effectively, it hands people in the hands of smugglers more than deterring them. And finally, if the wall is only 20 miles long, which as this wall would be, migrants will go somewhere else where there isn't a wall.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: I spent a lot of time along the border reporting there. And you see even some of the new wall that then president Trump had built, within days, people had cut right through that. So it's a huge challenge.</p><p>There is also ongoing legal battles in Texas over these floating barriers that are meant to keep migrants from crossing the Rio Grande.</p><p>Will they have any meaningful impact on the number of migrants who attempt to cross?</p><p>CHISHTI: That's also litigation within that case (INAUDIBLE) the Supreme Court. And it's hard to believe why that would work. Most of those buoys as they use in Texas are actually in international waters.</p><p>And to believe that the state of Texas, this is not the federal government, the state of Texas which wants to build those, whether the state of Texas has even authority to do that it is quite contested.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: What does work in terms of short term options?</p><p>Are there solutions the Biden administration should be exploring now that will help in the immediate term?</p><p>CHISHTI: We believe so.</p><p>[04:25:00] CHISHTI: There is no magic bullet, obviously. But there are certain things we can do which would be more effective than a wall. And the most critical thing we can do is reform the asylum system.</p><p>Almost all people coming to the border are invoking the right of asylum. They don't run away from Border Patrol. They arrive at the border, lift their hand and say, hi, we're here seeking asylum.</p><p>And that asylum system today processes cases in an immigration system that is so backlogged that it takes years. We believe it would take up to seven years for your case to be heard.</p><p>During that time, people get the right to stay here and they get the right to work here. That has become a magnet for people who actually are not eligible for asylum. We think we should reform the asylum system so that cases are adjudicated within months as against years.</p><p>And that can be done by sending cases not to a backlogged immigration code system (ph) but to asylum officers at U.S. Immigration Customs Services, who are country specialists and who can really manage to get a control on determining cases within months as against years.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: Yes, everyone agrees the system is broken but we can't agree on how to fix that. We'll have to leave it there but, Muzaffar Chishti, thank you so much for being here with us. Really appreciate it.</p><p>CHISHTI: Thank you so much for having me.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>BRUNHUBER: We're keeping an eye on developments in Ukraine, which is reporting new strikes on its grain infrastructure. It says Russia hit grain facilities in the Odessa region for a second straight day on Saturday.</p><p>Its attacks also damaged apartment buildings and left four people wounded.

At least 52 people were killed on Thursday, which prompted the U.N. to send its human rights investigators there.</p><p>The U.N. human rights coordinator said the strike amounted to a war crime.

I'm Kim Brunhuber. This is CNN NEWSROOM. I want to get back to our breaking news this hour. Israel is carrying out military strikes against Hamas targets in Gaza after the group launched a surprise attack early Saturday. Hamas militants are claiming to have fired some 5,000 rockets, targeting airports and military positions. Israeli officials say at least one person has died and several people have been wounded.</p><p>I want to bring in CNN's Sam Kiley, who is standing by in London.</p><p>Sam, you've covered the region extensively.</p><p>What do you make of the scale of this attack?</p><p>And the means Hamas is using here?</p><p>SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Kim, I think that this is almost unprecedented. The previous level of, frankly, intelligence failure from Israel would've been the Yom Kippur war 50 years ago almost today, when they launched a surprise attack against Israel.</p><p>Now we have a surprise attack using the cover of a claimed 5,000 missiles. Israelis say 2,000 missiles. But of course, those missiles are still flying out of Gaza.</p><p>The IDF have confirmed, that's Israeli Defense Forces, that Palestinian militants then infiltrated or, as part of this complex operation, have infiltrated Israel from the sea and the air using paragliders, motorized paragliders, to get across the fence and defensive lines separating Israel from Gaza into Israeli territory.</p><p>Now the local media -- and indeed, we've confirmed this -- at least two kibbutzes have been infiltrated close to the Gaza Strip. Israeli media also reporting gun battles are ongoing in Sderot. That is the biggest town closest to the Gaza, Israeli town, where reportedly hostages were taken, even reports of hostages being taken into Gaza, back into Gaza, possibly including dead bodies along with them.</p><p>This is an extremely complex, long in the planning attack. Almost exactly a year ago, I was in Jenin on the West Bank, when militants there were saying that there were plans for a conflagration of this kind.</p><p>Muhammad Al-Deif, the leader of the military wing of Hamas in the Gaza Strip, has indeed called for Arabs in the region to take up arms, any type of arms. He said rifles, clubs, axes, whatever is handy to rise up against the Israelis.</p><p>[04:35:00]</p><p>KILEY: Now that is a real problem for the Israelis. If there is a forest fire that catches, first of all, inside the occupied West Bank in Palestinian Territories there, where there've been increased levels of militant activities over the past two years.</p><p>Above all, inside the Palestinian population inside Israel proper, where the Knesset, the Israeli parliament reported years ago that there were at least 400,000 weapons already in the hands of ethnic Palestinians who hold Israeli citizenship.</p><p>If that was all combined, clearly that's what Hamas is hoping for, this could put Israel severely on the back foot.</p><p>With that, Israel is now mobilizing a war alert state, not a declared state of war but something close to it, with the prime minister now calling imminently a Security Council security cabinet meeting, where they will decide what their response on the wider scale will be inside Gaza.</p><p>Now clearly, if there are hostages inside Gaza, that could complicate their operations. But there will be a great deal of pressure from -- I think across the Israeli political spectrum for a very powerful military response from Israel against Gaza.</p><p>But as I say, that will be complicated if this catches fire among militant groups elsewhere, particularly on the West Bank and, above all, inside the Israeli body politic itself.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: Yes, certainly with the fears of this conflict widening, we can expect it will be a robust response from Israel.</p><p>I mean, what impact do you think that might have on Palestinians in the Gaza Strip?</p><p>KILEY: Well, they've seen and endured many, many Israeli military incursions. And of course, aerial bombardments even more frequently as a consequence or as a response to not just Hamas but Palestinian Islamic Jihad, another militant group, firing rockets out of Gaza into Israeli territory.</p><p>But I think we can anticipate that, whatever happens in Gaza, it will be on a nearly unprecedented scale. We have, in the past, seen ground troops going in, tanks, heavy weapons being deployed by Israel inside Gaza territory.</p><p>But in some respects, that's kind of what Hamas is looking for, because that brings the war face to face for -- between their militants, highly trained militants, and Israeli soldiers, putting Israeli soldiers at greater risk.</p><p>So there will be an option here for the Israelis to rely almost exclusively on airpower, where they have total dominance, effectively, over the Gaza Strip, to try to break the military back of Hamas and the other militant groups inside Gaza.</p><p>And that means for the population of Gaza, things are going to get awful lot worse over the next few days, to be sure, Kim.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: Certainly the fear. Sam Kiley in London, thank you so much.</p><p>I want to go to CNN's Hadas Gold, who is in Jerusalem.</p><p>So Hadas, you're back in the stairwell there. I know you've sort of had to go in and out of taking shelter. A fast-moving story, certainly.</p><p>What's the latest?</p><p>GOLD: Since 6:30 am, essentially, there's been this barrage of rockets from Gaza toward Israel. But this is what's unprecedented, is not only the number of rockets and the fact that Jerusalem has been targeted.</p><p>I think we've had at least five or six air raid sirens, that's why we had to come in right before we came on air with you, we got another siren, which means go seek shelter. We've been hearing interceptions or impacts all day long from these rockets coming into Israel.</p><p>Now according to Israeli military, we just had a briefing with them, more than 2,000 rockets have been fired just in the last five hours or so. And they continue as we speak.</p><p>To put that into context, in that 2021 11 day war between Hamas militants and Israel, something like 4,300 rockets were fired. So that was 11 days. This is just five or so hours since this started at 6:30 am.</p><p>The other unprecedented thing, I think, this is probably the most alarming aspect of all this, is these infiltrations of Palestinian militants into Israeli communities in the south.</p><p>According to the Israeli military, when we spoke to them within the last half an hour or so, they say that they are actively fighting in firefight with militants on the ground in several Israeli communities, including two army bases as well as the border crossing, the areas crossing between Gaza and Israel.</p><p>So active firefights on the streets. We're hearing harrowing reports of Israeli civilians essentially been trapped in their homes. And my producer now just handed me, it seems as though the prime minister saying this is war. He is saying that Israel is in a state of war. That is coming from the prime minister himself. Earlier today, we heard from the Israeli military, saying they were in a state of war alert.</p><p>[04:40:00]</p><p>GOLD: But it appears now they're declaring this essentially a state of war. What's also amazing in all of this is the fact that these militants infiltrated -- now, some of them might have already been in Israel, because thousands of Palestinians have permits to work in Israel every day.</p><p>According to the Israeli military, some of these infiltrations came through the air, through paragliding as well as from the sea and the ground. This was clearly a very well coordinated and planned attack.</p><p>Hamas is calling this the Al-Aqsa Storm and they're connecting this directly to what's been happening at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound. What's fascinating is there hasn't been a specific trigger moment.</p><p>There wasn't a major raid or incursion into the Al Aqsa mosque compound, which is also known as the Temple Mount to the Jews, a place so holy for both of them. There was no other significant event that triggered this.</p><p>This is essentially a surprise, attack and there's a lot of questions for the Israeli military and security establishment about how they were caught so off guard, especially when you look at the parallels. Almost 50 years exactly, the Yom Kippur war started in almost the exact same way.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: Yes and, Hadas, Israel's security cabinet meeting in a couple of hours.</p><p>What do you think the options are in terms of a response here?</p><p>GOLD: Well, we already know that thousands of Israeli military reservists have been called up and that the response has already begun with airstrikes in the Gaza Strip.</p><p>And I think we will see a very, very heavy response from the air, the ground and elsewhere. I don't think -- I think that the Israeli government and military is preparing itself for an extended war. They're calling this war an extended conflict.</p><p>Another major question is not just what's going to be coming out of Gaza but whether other fronts will be activated as well, whether something will happen on the north with Hezbollah or with the other Palestinian militant groups there.</p><p>In my time, here I've spoken to Israeli military officials or former officials. They always say that what worries them the most is what happens on the north because a conflict like this, the one we're in right now between Hamas and the Israeli military, a conflict like that with Hezbollah would be on a completely different level.</p><p>So that is a major concern as well, is whether the north will get involved, whether Hezbollah or those other Palestinian military groups will get involved. We should expect a very, very heavy military response. Already, thousands of military reserves being called up to serve.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: All right, we really appreciate the update there. Hadas Gold in Jerusalem. Thank you so much.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[04:45:00]</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>BRUNHUBER: Israel is retaliating swiftly and with force against Hamas at this hour targeting sites in Gaza and engaging the militants on multiple fronts. This comes after an hours long barrage of rockets took the country by surprise.</p><p>Sirens as far as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Numerous casualties have been reported. It's worth noting that this is also the 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur war of 1973.

He gave his perspective on what Amazon has to do to be a player in the satellite space race.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TIM FARRAR, TECHNOLOGY CONSULTANT AND PRESIDENT, TMF ASSOCIATES: Amazon has a long way to go. It's trying to launch over 3,000 satellites. That's going to take an awful long time. There are dozens of launches.</p><p>And the rockets need to be ready to launch those satellites as well as the satellites being manufactured, which is also going to take at least two or three years to complete all of that.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: Yes. And of course, Elon Musk's Starlink has thousands of satellites already in space.</p><p>So how significant is this competition going to be for Amazon?</p><p>FARRAR: Well, Amazon has got a long way to go. Starlink has been in full commercial service for about two years. So Starlink is going to have something like a five year lead by the time Amazon comes to market.</p><p>And it has got billions of dollars of revenue and millions of subscribers already. So that is a lot to catch up on. Amazon has got a lot of resources that it can (INAUDIBLE) but, still, you know, it's going to be a challenge.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: Yes, a five year lead.</p><p>Is that too far back to catch up, do you think?</p><p>FARRAR: Well, it really depends on how big this market is. Elon Musk has said he might get tens of millions of subscribers around the world. Some analysts are even more optimistic than that. But to date, he only has got a couple of million customers.</p><p>If that market doesn't increase very fast, there won't be many customers left for Amazon to catch him.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRUNHUBER: We will have the full interview in the next hour with more on what to expect as this new space technology race continues and what it could take for these interconnections to truly take off. Be sure to stay tuned for that.</p><p>Amazon's launch wasn't the only recent liftoff. A Spanish company successfully launched the country's first reusable rocket on Saturday after two previously scrubbed attempts. The spacecraft ascended more than 25 miles above the Gulf of Cadiz.</p><p>After five minutes of flight, it landed in the Atlantic Ocean to be retrieved by the company. This was the scene inside mission control. Engineers cheering, as you can see, congratulating each other as the rocket took off.</p><p>Well, she is tumbling her way into the history books. U.S. gymnast Simone Biles sets another record for her unprecedented new medal count, next. Stay with us.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[04:50:00]</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>BRUNHUBER: A small painting with a $15,000 price tag just two years ago turns out to be the work of the 17th century Dutch master, Rembrandt. Now it could fetch $18 million at auction in London. Have a look here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUNHUBER (voice-over): Christie's auction house sold \"The Adoration of the Kings\" two years ago in Amsterdam. They originally believed it could've been created by one of Rembrandt's students or an artist close to him. But after 18 months of X-rays, examinations and extensive discussions with scholars, the work was deemed the real deal. So the painting, now consigned to Sotheby's, is set for auction on December 6th in London.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUNHUBER: Well, she struck gold yet again. American gymnast, Simone Biles, has won another all-around title at the world championships. That makes Biles the most decorated gymnast, male or female, of all time. CNN's Patrick Snell has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PATRICK SNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: On Friday, the Belgian city of Antwerp, the 26 -year old Simone Biles making her own very special piece of history by winning the women's individual all-around gold medal at the World Artistic Gymnastics championships.</p><p>This for the sixth time in her already storied career. Simone, to get things started, not doing the Biles II but a nearly perfect vault, 15.100 the score. And that puts her at the top of the leaderboard after one rotation. From there, she simply never looked back.</p><p>[04:55:00]</p><p>SNELL: Absolutely majestic. An uncharacteristic stumble though on the floor but not a consequence as it was not part of a major move, the American nailing these. Still finishing a half point better in the floor exercise than her closest competitor.</p><p>Biles' performance all the more remarkable, having taking breaks from the sport after both the Rio and the Tokyo Olympics. Now she is the most decorated gymnast in competition history.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONE BILES, U.S. GYMNAST: I don't know, I think I'm always shocked. You guys are so good with the stats. I'm just here along for the ride, to contribute to the U.S. and just have fun.</p><p>OK, I was emotional because it was my first worlds here 10 years ago and then now my sixth one. So it is crazy. But I swear I do have something in my eye that's been bothering me for like four hours and I cannot get it out. So while I was looking up there, it was like a combination of both.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SNELL (voice-over): By winning gold, Biles also becoming the most decorated female or male gymnast ever, surpassing the Belarusian Vitaly Scherbo's record of 33 overall medals across both the Olympics and the worlds. Biles extending her own record with her 27th world championship medal, 21 of them gold.</p><p>SNELL: Simone will have a chance to add to her medal haul this weekend as she competes in women's vault and uneven bars finals on Saturday and the balance beam and floor exercise finals on Sunday. For now, though, it's back to you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRUNHUBER: That wraps up this hour of CNN NEWSROOM, I'm Kim Brunhuber. I will be back with more breaking news out of Israel, where prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared the country is at war. We will have live reporting from Israel, coming up in just a moment. Please do stay with us.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2023100721CNV11</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69BN-G7S1-F072-X001-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7047\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"10\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>October 7, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>World Affairs</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Middle East</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>War</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Military</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Backgrounders</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Communications Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxMkU0NzE2OEE2NDIxNEE3QzU0NjU2MDRERUNGNDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Fixed Satellite Services</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkE2NjYyOUIzRTJFNDcwNjhCMDE1RkM3MDU1RTg1NUY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDAxNTAwQTRFOTc5NDVFQTlBNTdBOUNGMTdENDNBMjk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>International Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUJBMkUzQ0QwN0E0NEM4RDgzMjM1QTREMkU3RDdBODQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Asylum</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0IyQzc2NTFGMjM2NDRBMkEwQUFBREJBNUI1Q0RCN0M7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTZCMUU5OEUyREYzNDM4MjkzMkFCQzA0MTM3QUY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>N921000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BODIES &amp;

It was an alarming diagnosis for one of the most charismatic creatures on Earth.</p><p>Headlines, of course, are much simpler than their subjects, and often do little more than capture attention. It is nice that the International Union for the Conservation of Nature identified a problem, but simply doing so does little to correct it. A listing by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature does not carry the weight of a similar determination by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. This is an important difference because the listing by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature carries no obligation of changes in policy - whereas a listing by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service would. As importantly, it was not the monarch butterfly as a species that was listed, but only the migratory subspecies of the monarch, known as Danaus plexipus plexipus.</p><p>Perhaps the most widely known of all insects, the monarch butterfly is a biological wonder. Within this single subspecies, there are two fairly distinct populations, the western monarch that migrates east/west, overwintering on the California and Baja California coast, and the eastern monarch that migrates north/south. The overwintering populations in California once numbered in the tens of thousands while the eastern population had overwintering populations of nearly a billion deep in the forests of central Mexico.</p><p>I first traveled to the overwintering sites of the eastern monarch 32 years ago. There, the trees themselves were completely covered in butterflies from the top to the bottom, with tree branches and trunks nothing but shivering butterflies. Standing at the feet of evenly spaced ancient oyamel fir trees brought to life by millions of fluttering butterflies easily puts any human-made cathedral to shame. Where Pacific Grove could proudly boast 10,000 to 20,000 butterflies, the forests of Mexico boasted hundreds of millions. That meant literally hundreds of tons of butterflies blanketing the boughs. There, we tagged thousands of butterflies to help estimate the population size and track their journey north.</p><p>Now, the populations here and in Mexico have dropped by more than 90 percent, leading to the desperate cry for help from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.</p><p>The perils facing the migratory monarch are real and growing. Let's consider the Oxford English Dictionary's definition of an endangered species: \"a species at serious risk of extinction.\"</p><p>There are numerous and complex threats to survival of the monarch - rapidly expanding industrial agriculture that is eating up habitats, herbicides that are killing their host plants and insecticides that are killing the butterflies. Climate change is also likely to have a profound but as yet unknown impact on the migration.</p><p>In Mexico, the relatively tiny forests migratory monarch butterflies rely upon for winter sanctuary are cleared for firewood, timber and agriculture (primarily avocados for U.S. consumption). One forest fire, a fraction of the size of that now burning near Yosemite, could wipe out monarch habitat in a few short days. Rarely have the challenges of our species and another species been so clearly tied.</p><p>So what can we do?</p><p>The proclamation of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature accomplishes very little except perhaps to pressure governments to step up and take action. What we need is an official listing by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. In granting the monarch \"endangered species\" status, we would have the tools and ability to implement real solutions that might include myriad steps, from habitat protection to restrictions on the use of certain insecticides and herbicides that we know are killing the butterflies.</p><p>If you visit the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service website, you will read that the agency has yet to even propose the species for listing. In its words, \"That process is deferred while we work on higher-priority listing actions.\" In other words, there are likely huge political downsides to tackling agricultural and development interests in the United States. Write your congressional leaders and encourage them to encourage the Fish and Wildlife Service to follow solid data instead of political expediency.</p><p>In the meantime, we can all take some important steps to act locally, everywhere along the monarch's 4,500-mile migratory route. Plant native milkweeds and butterfly friendly flowers; the nursery Caterpillar Chow is a great local source of milkweeds. Invest your donor dollars in verifiable conservation programs like those successfully implemented by ECOLIFE Conservation for the eastern population of monarch butterflies. And buy as many agricultural products as you can from local and organic suppliers.</p><p>Toone is a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, author of \"On the Wings of the Condor\" and founder of ECOLIFE Conservation.

Prescribed fire activities are highly weather dependent, which requires prescribed fire personnel to evaluate short- and long-term weather conditions and fuel moisture contents. This process relies on coordination with the National Weather Service and Air quality regulators to determine the best possible weather conditions that promote smoke dispersal and limit smoke impacts to local and regional communities. Smoke may be visible for several days after implementation. If you see smoke in the Spencer Springs area of the Raft River Division, near North Heglar summit on the Sublett Division, or in the Rock Creek recreation corridor on the Cassia Division; there is no need to contact 911.

Outdoor enthusiasts have canceled scores of trips, outfitters say, crimping what was supposed to be a banner year as the COVID-19 pandemic eased. Others say outdoor enthusiasts are so eager to return to the wilderness that the fires and dry conditions are not enough to keep adventurers away, for now.</p><p>\"People are still coming,\" said Ann Schwaller, wilderness program manager for the Superior National Forest. \"Fire is a natural part of wilderness and it doesn't typically drive visitors away.\"</p><p>People are calling and asking lots of questions, said public information officer Joanna Gilkeson, but numbers don't appear down, though visitor numbers aren't released until the end of the year.</p><p>Piragis Northwoods Co. in Ely has had a busy summer finding alternate entry points for customers who lost initial permits as the forest service closed a number of lakes and campsites. Some just didn't rebook, said owner Steve Piragis.</p><p>\"It's cut down on what was going to be a record year by a long shot,\" he said.</p><p>Demand remains high for Boundary Waters overnight camping permits, said Ely Outfitting Co.'s Jason Zabokrtsky, but many who aren't getting the trip they want are canceling outright, dealing a significant blow to outfitters.</p><p>\"But when you look at how few permits are available for the rest of the summer, what's obvious is people aren't fettered by drought this summer, or the pandemic or wildfires,\" he said.</p><p>Schwaller said it's important for visitors to remember there are hundreds of primitive and dispersed campsites outside the Boundary Waters.</p><p>\"There are campgrounds full of reservations,\" she said, and places that look just like the Boundary Waters with even fewer people to share space with.</p><p>'Things are happening'</p><p>The smoke and drought have only pushed Duluth resident Chris Pascone Up North more often. A four-season Boundary Waters user with his three daughters, it's not a burned-down \"dystopia,\" he said.</p><p>\"But it's clear to me things are happening,\" Pascone said. \"This summer, for the first time, it sank in that the Boundary Waters I know and love may not be the same in 20 to 30 years.\"</p><p>The smoke hasn't deterred the mostly longtime customers of Heston's Lodge, a rustic resort nestled on Gunflint Lake along the Gunflint Trail. The smoke comes and goes, said co-owner Barb Gecas, who has lived there 38 years.</p><p>\"We're in yet another cycle,\" she said of the drought. \"1995 was a very hot summer. It was dry, and there were fire bans. That was the very beginning of realizing that I had to learn to live with forest fire.\"</p><p>People still came following the 1999 blowdown storm that flattened large swaths of the wilderness area, Piragis said, noting the recession that began in 2008 had a far bigger effect on the region's economy.</p><p>However, drought conditions started earlier in the area this summer than the last big drought he could recall.</p><p>\"What's it going to be like here in September when it really gets dry?\" he said.</p><p>Whether continued drought and subsequent fires affect use of the Superior National Forest is unknown, Zabokrtsky said.

Intense winds whipped a grass fire south of Boulder near Marshall into a massive firestorm that became too large and fierce for firefighters to battle.</p><p>\"The only battle was evacuation, as the towns of Louisville and Superior and [the] northern suburbs of Denver lay in the fire's wind-driven path,\" said Amateur TV (ATV) enthusiast and dealer Jim Andrews, KH6HTV, of Boulder. Andrews said the only thing limiting the fire's spread was the fact that the winds diminished by that evening.</p><p>\"By that time, hundreds of homes had burned down,\" Andrews said, whose own house among them. \"This was not a typical forest fire, but an urban firestorm.\" Thousands of people were evacuated.</p><p>BCARES Board of Directors Chairman and Region 1, District 3 Emergency Coordinator Allen Bishop, K0ARK, said that a request from the Boulder Office of Emergency Management (OEM) to activate the emergency operations center (EOC) is what initiated the ARES activation. \"At that time, staffing was initiated with the activation of the BCARES Radio Network, with three BCARES members assigned to the EOC,\" Bishop said. The BCARES Net was promptly activated.</p><p>ARES volunteers supported communication at evacuation sites and established emergency communication as commercial power failures and preventive shutdowns by utilities caused a loss of commercial communication. \"Within about 8 hours,\" Bishop said, \"battery back-up systems for cell phones and landlines failed, and 911 services went down.\"</p><p>\"To facilitate a restoration of these emergency services, BCARES activated the Mountain Emergency Radio Network (MERN),\" Bishop said. Established in 2010, MERN consists of repeaters installed at fire stations in Gold Hill and Allenspark, at community centers in Nederland and Raymond, and the privately owned Airlink Repeater. \"These repeaters provided the emergency communication links that facilitated the restoration of 911 communications back to the dispatch center for the duration of the power outages,\" Bishop explained. The Allenspark Neighbors Emergency Network (ANEN) and Airlink (Alternate Access Radio Network) participated.</p><p>According to Bishop, as the Marshall Fire expanded, evacuation center support was requested at three locations to provide on-site situation reports using Winlink. Bishop said BCARES members and mutual-aid ARES operators from neighboring Districts established local communication with the BCARES EOC radio position from designated field locations. BCARES was activated for 2 days.</p><p>As Andrews reported, Boulder County announced on New Year's Day that nearly 1,000 homes were lost. In addition to his own home, the fire destroyed his daughter's home next door, as well as the homes of all his close neighbors. \"We had no official warning of the coming firestorm,\" Andrews said. \"My only warning was from our daughter who saw it happening.\" No one died as a result of the fire, but, Andrews added, \"KH6HTV VIDEO, as a supplier of ATV gear, will be out of operation for a very long time to come.\" Andrews edits the monthly Boulder Amateur Television Club TV Repeater's REPEATER newsletter.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124959988</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64K2-BNC1-JCBF-S541-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-01-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"564\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"01\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>January 18, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N624230EG</classCode><className>DISASTER &amp; EMERGENCY AGENCIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N624230MM</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SHELTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX000194</classCode><className>BOARDS OF DIRECTORS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N515110CC</classCode><className>RADIO BROADCAST INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001842</classCode><className>WIND ENERGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>STX001359</classCode><className>POWER FAILURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001694</classCode><className>TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX001900</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp; UTILITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000A0Z7</classCode><className>MOBILE &amp; CELLULAR TELEPHONES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX545</classCode><className>DENVER, CO, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GS121</classCode><className>COLORADO, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The university had NSF research expenditures totaling more than $144 million, topping other institutions such as the University of Washington, Texas AandM University and the University of Michigan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The NSF funds bold ideas across multiple disciplines, laying the foundation for future breakthroughs that will impact society. Producing that kind of impact is what inspires and motivates everything we do,\" said UT Austin President Jay Hartzell. \"I'm especially proud of our research teams and research support staff whose incredible work enable us to leverage NSF funds so effectively.\"</p><p>Examples of NSF funding abound on the UT Austin campus. The NSF designated UT Austin as a National Artificial Intelligence Institute in fiscal 2020, competitively awarding professors Adam Klivans, Alex Dimakis and their colleagues in computer science and computer engineering a cooperative agreement to establish the Institute for Foundations of Machine Learning. Now a hub for interdisciplinary research, the institute brings together mathematicians, roboticists, data scientists and ethicists to create new classes of algorithms that can lead to more sophisticated and beneficial AI technologies.</p><p>In the Jackson School of Geosciences, Assistant Professor Ashley Matheny won an NSF CAREER grant to support her work studying the lateral transport of water within trees something that, to date, has been poorly understood. To do this, she's designing sensors that can measure water content at different depths when inserted directly into trees. This information will give scientists a more complete picture of how plants use water, which, in turn, could improve drought and forest fire predictions.</p><p>Moody College of Communication graduate student Anastazja Harris received a doctoral dissertation grant from the NSF to study the role that AI literacy plays in hiring managers' acceptance of artificial intelligence-based screening and interview recommendations. Specifically, she wants to know whether a person's AI understanding or lack thereof affects whether that person follows the technology's suggestions or dismisses them. \"It's an important distinction,\" Harris said.</p><p>And NSF awards have also enabled scientists at UT's Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) to deploy Frontera, the fastest supercomputer at any university in the world. Each year, thousands of researchers and students from across the country use TACC's systems to power data-heavy projects in everything from astronomy and engineering to medicine and manufacturing.

These restrictions are designed to help minimize the chances of human-caused wildland fires.</p><p>While lightning is the number one cause of fires on the forest, human-caused fires are a major concern. Preventable causes include escaped campfires, careless smokers, equipment and vehicle malfunctions, dragging trailer chains, fireworks and playing with matches. More about how to avoid starting wildland fires is found online at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.readyforwildfire.org/prevent-wildfire/one-less-spark-campaign/\">https://www.readyforwildfire.org/prevent-wildfire/one-less-spark-campaign/</url>.</p><p>Modoc National Forest Fire-Use Restrictions include:</p><p>* Building, maintaining, attending or using a fire, campfire or stove fire, except in the South Warner Wilderness and Designated Recreation Sites that will be listed at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/modoc/alerts-notices\">https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/modoc/alerts-notices</url> once the order goes into effect.</p><p>* Smoking, except within an enclosed vehicle or a building, within the Designated Recreation Sites or while stopped in an area at least three feet in diameter that is barren or cleared of all flammable material.</p><p>* Welding or operating an acetylene or other torch with open flame.</p><p>* Operating an internal combustion engine, except on National Forest System roads or trails, or within the Designated Recreation Sites listed in the attached documents.</p><p>Exemptions to these restrictions include:</p><p>* Lanterns or portable stoves using gas, jellied petroleum, or pressurized liquid with a valid free California campfire permit (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.preventwildfireca.org/Campfires/\">www.preventwildfireca.org/Campfires/</url>). Barbeque grills using briquettes are not allowed.</p><p>* Chainsaws and other equipment within the terms of a valid permit. Fuelwood-cutting permits are available at any Modoc National Forest office. Permit holders are asked to call 530-233-8819 for operational hours before heading out for the day.</p><p>Similar restrictions are also in effect on the neighboring lands. Since restrictions can vary by ownership, visitors should contact the area they plan to visit for specific fire restrictions and conditions.

Firefighters start a back burn. When the raging forest fire reaches the burned-over forest, it peters out because there is nothing left to burn.</p><p>This is all well and good, except: Would I be willing to have trees that I own sacrificed to protect a forest owned by others? Would I be willing to let my mother die so that strangers I do not know could be spared from being infected during a pandemic?</p><p>It is one thing to think of sacrificing property for the greater good; it is another to consider sacrificing human lives. In the case of controlling a forest fire, the loss of a few trees to preserve many trees seems reasonable. When the same reasoning is applied to human lives, it seems cold, calculating and cynical.

I can't even imagine the difficulties a person of color must overcome. That said, I support your position of not letting bygones be bygones. For four years, America has been raped and butchered by the current administration. Forgiveness begins with awareness, confession, contrition and penance.

Their study suggests that the absence of a rapid, contemporary decline in global wildfire emissions with burned area is the increasing forest wildfire emissions. This study can guide the future development of a global carbon budget monitoring and inversion framework based on satellite remote sensing. Dr. Zheng's research article, \" Increasing forest fire emissions despite the decline in global burned area,\" has been published in Science Advances on 24th Sep (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abh2646\">https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abh2646</url>).</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1662181/image_1.jpg\"/></p><p>Satellites have detected a global decline in fire burned areas over grasslands, coincident with a small increase over forests over the past decades. Bo Zheng and his colleagues developed an atmospheric inversion system to show that global fire emissions have been stable or slightly decreasing despite the substantial decline in global burned area since 2000, caused by emission increase from forest fires offsetting the decreasing emissions from grass and shrubland fires. Forest fires are larger CO2 sources per unit area burned than grassland fires, with a slow or incomplete follow-up recovery \u2014 sometimes no recovery due to degradation and deforestation. With fires expanding over forest areas, the slow recovery of CO2 uptake over burned forest lands weakens land sink capacity, implying that pressures from global fires on climate have not been relieved despite the decline in global burned area.</p><p>About:</p><p>Tsinghua SIGS is a graduate education and research institution jointly established by the prestigious Tsinghua University and the Shenzhen Government.

The burn will begin at approximately 10:00 am and will last approximately three hours, with residual smoke and small spot fires continuing through the rest of the day and evening. The areas affected include the Savannah behind the Visitor Center and the area located on the right-hand side as you enter the front gate of the park.</p><p>This area borders Hwy 210 on one side, Moores Creek Missionary Baptist Church on another side, and park roads and buildings on the other two sides.</p><p>Moores Creek conducts these burns annually for several reasons:</p><p>1. By applying prescribed fire on a regular and rotational basis, the park reduces the amount of fuel loads that exist in the park that, if left untreated, would pile up and cause a major forest fire, posing serious threats to the park and neighboring lands.</p><p>2. By applying prescribed fire on a regular and rotational basis, the park is transforming the landscape back to what it may have looked like historically in 1776 at the time of the battle. This measure reduces the amount of invasive and weedy trees that tend to grow in areas that are not maintained by fires which naturally occurred historically.</p><p>More than 20,000 National Park Service employees care for America's 423 national parks and work with communities across the nation to help preserve local history and create close-to-home recreational opportunities.
