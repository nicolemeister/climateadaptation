Relative humidity levels tend to remain low during springtime in Vermont after the snow has melted and before leaves emerge. Photo by Emma Cotton/VTDigger </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Spring may put floods, rushing rivers and mud on the minds of many Vermonters, but April and May are also the state's fire season, and officials have warned against backyard burning without consulting the <url normalizedValue=\"https://anrweb.vt.gov/FPR/vtFPR/FireWardenDirectory.aspx\">local fire warden</url> .\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> On Monday, officials <url normalizedValue=\"https://fpr.vermont.gov/forest/wildland-fire/monitoring-fire-danger\">categorized many areas</url>  across Vermont as having a high fire risk, and the rest of the state's risk was moderate. The forecast of fire conditions is updated daily.</p><p> 'Certainly, taking a look at the fire danger map and seeing that it's elevated would probably indicate that it'd be a poor choice to burn,' said Dan Dillner, the state's forest fire supervisor.\u00a0</p><p> Dillner said he's working with the National Weather Service to decide whether a 'red flag' warning will be warranted for Tuesday. The warning would not indicate a higher fire risk but rather predict that an existing fire would spread quickly and be more difficult to manage.\u00a0</p><p> When the ground is not covered in snow and leaves have yet to emerge, the air becomes unusually dry, said Robert Haynes, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Burlington.\u00a0</p><p> 'Part of that exchange between plants and air helps to add a little bit of moisture back into the air,' Haynes said. 'So when we have that greenery, it's really hard for us to get those really low relative humidity values as it is when we don't have those leaves.'</p><p> In the summer, a 50% relative humidity level would be considered dry, Dillner said.\u00a0</p><p> 'Today for the Champlain Valley they're looking at humidity of 21%. So that's a super dry day,' he said. 'If you're a runner, you might notice that your chest is gonna burn a little today because there's no moisture in the air.'</p><p> That low humidity is likely to dry out vegetation or debris, and could cause grass or brush to burn.\u00a0</p><p> Haynes expects the dry conditions to persist through the weekend, with the exception of Wednesday, when he expects humidity to rise slightly. Wind is expected to die down over the weekend, which could reduce the risk.</p><p> Burning debris is the most common cause of wildfires in the state, according to Dillner. Of all the fires that have occurred in Vermont over the past several years, only a few have been caused naturally, he said.</p><p> In most cases, the people who started them failed to consult their fire warden, who can supply a wealth of information about how best to burn, he said. A permit from the local warden is required for burning.\u00a0</p><p> 'It's usually someone that decides they're not interested in following the rules, or don't know, and they decide to burn anyway,' Dillner said.\u00a0</p><p> When it's safe to burn, officials from the state's Department of Environmental Conservation urge Vermonters to <url normalizedValue=\"https://dec.vermont.gov/press-release/backyard-burning-reminders-released\">reduce air pollution</url>  by allowing green materials to dry before burning them, consider wind direction and speed, making fires that burn hot, and check air quality conditions beforehand.</p><p> 'Our best suggestion is to avoid burning altogether and let the materials decompose naturally,' said John Wakefield, compliance section chief with the department's air quality and climate division.</p><p> Fire season overlaps with flood season, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://dec.vermont.gov/press-release/spring-flood-safety-tips-vermont-dec\">officials also are warning</url>  Vermonters to avoid roads covered in water, sign up for emergency flood alerts and determine whether their residence is located in a flood hazard area.\u00a0</p><p> Read the story on VTDigger here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://vtdigger.org/2023/04/10/during-high-fire-risk-officials-warn-against-backyard-burns-in-many-areas-of-the-state/\">During high fire risk, officials warn against backyard burns in many areas of the state</url> .</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://vtdigger.org/2023/04/10/during-high-fire-risk-officials-warn-against-backyard-burns-in-many-areas-of-the-state/\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXVG-VTDG127906168116795238725876100061</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IVNN-127906</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6808-6MN1-JCMN-Y08M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484298</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"601\"/><timeReceived>11:05 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

Firstly, the management team will give you the results for 2023, and then we are going to have the Q&amp;A session.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now I'd like to give the floor to Chairman, Zhang Zhiyong, who is going to give you a presentation on the overall performance of the company in 2023.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Zhang Zhiyong:</emphasis></p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. Welcome, and thank you for joining us for China Towers 2023 Annual Results Presentation. We'd like to express our gratitude to you for your long-term support and interest in China Tower.</p><p>Today's presentation is divided into three parts. Firstly, I'm going to give you the overall performance of the company, and then for the specific performance, it's going to be taken over by Mr. Gao Chunlei. And then in terms of our financial performance, it's going to be presented by Mr. Hu Shaofeng. After our presentations, we would be very happy to answer any question you have.</p><p>In terms of the overall performance of the company, for last year, the company proactively provided service and moved towards the strategic goals of Cyberpower, Digital China and Dual Carbon, fortified its position of One Core and Two Wings while continuously deepen the development in sharing and coordination. The overall results for the past year grew steadily. Specifically, our overall performance was excellent. Our operational performance achieved double-digit growth of 11% and supported by multiple pillars, Two Wings' business revenue increased to 12.2% of the total operating revenue. So we have multi revenue sources established and our Smart Towers serving digital governance. At present, 217,000 telecom towers have been upgraded to digital towers.</p><p>The company also accelerated technological innovation. The R&amp;D investment increased by 38%. The company also shared its fruitful results with shareholders. The dividend payout increased by 15.7%. In terms of the key indicators in 2023, as you can see from the slide, the major indicators are listed here. The annual operating revenue reached RMB94.01 billion, an increase of 2% year-on-year. Profit attributable to the owners of the company reached RMB9.78 billion, up 11%. As of the end of 2023, the number of tenants reached 3.658 million and the tenancy ratio was 1.79, up 0.05 from the end of last year. The cyclical level continued to increase. Due to the implementation of our policy, you can see our colocation rate continue to improve. You can see that five indicators are red, meaning continue to improve. There is one indicator registered negative growth.</p><p>I believe this is of great concern to every one of you here. That is our operating cash flow. There seemed to be a negative growth. This is very much a result of the new round of pricing agreement and service agreements. So we need to upgrade and adjust the charging system. We also need to verify data of all orders. We need to negotiate new service standards. The account receivable collection process was negatively affected, and the cash flow level was lower than that of the previous year. I'd say, this slide was temporary because in Q4 last year, it's already recovering. In January and February, it's a positive growth trend again. For the management, we trust for the year 2024, the cash flow level will return to a normal level. The drop last year is just a temporary thing.</p><p>In terms of our One Core and Two Wings business, I'd say, each business segment maintained a very good development trend. As you can see from the table here, excluding the impact of the commercial pricing agreements, which is a very big item last year. Excluding the impact of the commercial pricing agreements because we have offered some discount as a result of the pricing agreement. Operating revenue on a comparable basis was RMB97.72 billion, up 6% from the previous year. It's a very healthy, very positive growth trend. In terms of other business, apart from our TSP business, the Two Wings business also grew very well. It accounted for 87.4% of total revenue. Revenue from the Two Wings business totaled RMB11.50 billion accounting for 12.2% of total revenue. That's after we excluding the impact of the commercial pricing agreements.</p><p>You can see that our revenue from the Two Wings business has continued to improve in terms of its share of our total revenue growth. For the TSP business, we can continue to consolidate our leading position. We expand the 5G network penetration coverage and seize the opportunities arising at key counties, fully push forward the healthy development of the TSP business. On the comparable basis, the TSP business grew by 3.4% and in term of our Smart Tower business, we continue to enhance resource sharing. Last year, the company had built 586,000 5G base stations, up 9.5% year-on-year, achieving a historical high. We have cumulatively built 2.347 million 5G base stations, supporting China in leading the world in terms of 5G network deployment. We are indeed the leading force in the development of 5G in China. In terms of DAS business, it's another growth engine for the company.</p><p>The company continued to leverage its advantage in coordinated construction, innovative products and service solutions to help to satisfy the demand for 5G upgrading of existing DAS as well as expanding to the new DAS market. Our covered building area was up 37.3% year-on-year, reaching 10.15 billion square meters. Our subway and high-speed railway tunnels coverage was up 20.1% year-on-year, reaching 11,625 and 12,447 kilometers respectively. You can see the DAS coverage continue to expand. As for our Two Wings business, firstly, if we look at the Smart Tower business, the company sees the opportunities in digital economy and digital social governance, rely on our plentiful high point site resources a specialize operation advantages, while continue to enhances core capabilities in five areas of platform, data, algorithm, application and operation.</p><p>We also aim to build the differentiated advantages with this algorithm from mid- to high-point monitoring service, continuously transforming telecommunication towers to digital towers. As you can see from the slide, now we provide over 100 meter high-point algorithm. With the plentiful scenario trainings, we are able to provide more than 100 meter high-point high precision algorithms. At the same time, we have established more than 1.3 million unique meter high point database. So our algorithm will be more and more precise. We'll have more and more data and we'll be able to offer more value in the future. In terms of our energy business, our advantage has been shown in the recent years. We try to meet customer need by accelerating the product innovation.</p><p>We try to meet customer need in terms of battery exchange and power backup. We tried to upgrade the battery exchange products and develop standardized products for power backup. Also, we accelerated the platform's upgrade and optimize our service systems to strengthen our service capabilities. At the same time, we enhanced the level of delicate management to optimize resource allocation. So we push forward battery exchange system. For traction battery, we have a power backup. So there is a cascade utilization of batteries we have a much higher efficiency in our Tower business.</p><p>So for last year, our revenue from energy business achieved RMB4.21 billion, which is a year-on-year increase of 31.7%. The business scale continued to expand rapidly. For last year, the company continued to expand its innovation led development strategy cultivated the new advantages in high quality development through technological innovation.

We improve results output efficiency, empowered our technological advancement and enhanced quality and efficiency.</p><p>The end new R&amp;D investment increased by 38% with the application for invention patents increased by 47% and the authorized invention patents increased by 2x. The company also continued to optimize the technological innovation systems and mechanisms. It built a four in one innovation system led by the headquarters and was also the first batch establishing six technological innovation centers in places such as Hangzhou. We used the full list of capability level projects, resource allegation, and achieved transformation to drive technological innovation. The company's taking the lead in carrying out over 100 key scientific research projects to accelerate the formation of new quality productive forces.</p><p>As you can see from the slide, the company continue to improve its operational management capabilities. We can say for last year as a whole, we firstly implemented various measures for the digital management of fund assets by carrying out intelligent operation maintenance that one could for all single set accounting system and construction of the treasury system to improve digital operation capabilities. In addition, we deepened the incentive system of management level employees by implementing specialized talent programs to stimulate the motivation within the company. Thirdly, we reformed innovation capability and depend the sharing of existing resources with new talents. Colocation rate reached 85% were continuing house their sharing social resources.</p><p>Last year, 36.3% of new grant tower sites were constructed by utilizing social resources. So we improved the resource coordination and sharing capabilities of the company. Fourthly, we launched the collaborate development of the One Core and Two Wings strategy, drive the upgrade of telecommunication tower to digital tower. So through having power exchange cabinets to provide reverse power supply to base stations, we established a large-scale operation and maintenance system, connecting all customers' access and maintenance, monitoring and ordering dispatching to improve the collaborative development capability. Thus, we can lower cost and further improve efficiency.</p><p>Our core towering business, we can provide comprehensive support and service to our customers. We utilize existing operation and maintenance systems to fully serve our One Core and Two Wings customers, so that our operation and management cost can be greatly reduced. As you can see, this year, in terms of our operating revenue and we have the impact of the new commercial pricing agreement, we still achieve an 11% growth in net profit. That's very much due to the improvement in our operation and management efficiency. The company also continued to improve its payout ratio.

According to news reporting from Hyderabad, India, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"The large volumes of Internet of Things (IoT) data transmission to and from the cloud leads to one of cloud -centric processing's major drawbacks: latency. Fog computing gives a solution to this by bringing the processing closer to the edge devices.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Science Engineering Research Board (SERB), India, UoH IoE by MHRD, India. <br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from the University of Hyderabad, \"Although a lot of work has been done which makes use of fog nodes like aggregators and offloaders, data intensive tasks like machine learning are still, for the most part, being performed on cloud. In a fog network, there are multiple fog devices, albeit resource-constrained ones. We can make use of distributed processing to collectively utilize these resources. So, we propose CANTO, a general distributed framework which uses the actor model to train neural networks on a network of fog devices in an IoT setting. Since the actors communicate using messages and act according to the type of message they receive, the framework provides a new message type wherein we can specify parameters like the dataset, the size of each dataset part, the activation function, learning rate, etc. The framework is containerized and deployed in a docker swarm. The framework is demonstrated with the use case on IoT-based forest fire prediction.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"In addition, the effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated with respect to accuracy, latency and load distribution.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Canto: an Actor Model-based Distributed Fog Framework Supporting Neural Networks Training In Iot Applications.

But on Friday, Apellis Pharmaceuticals bucked the industrys losing trend in geographic atrophy (GA), scoring a second commercial nod for its C3 inhibitor pegcetacoplan.</p><p>The FDA has approved pegcetacoplan under the name Syfovre as the first treatment for GAan advanced stage of age-related macular degeneration that is also a leading cause of blindness.</p><p>Think of having a forest fire in your retina, where your retina slowly but certainly dies completely, Cedric Francois, M.D., Ph.D., Apellis co-founder and CEO, said of the disease in an interview ahead of Syfovres approval.</p><p>Prior to Syfovre, there were no FDA-approved therapies for geographic atrophy. Now, Apellis hopes the story can be re-written.</p><p>Its important to note, however, that this is not a drug that flips the switch on day one, the CEO pointed out.</p><p>Syfovre is no cure, with approval based on the drugs ability to slow growth of a marker of disease progression, rather than the ability to improve or even stall central vision loss.</p><p>Its a drug where you make an investment over many years, and where the longer you stick to the therapy, the better this drug is going to work for you, Francois said.</p><p>Apellis sees that as one of its drugs core strengths. The longer you treat, the better this drug works, he explained.</p><p>Another potential edge for Apellis drug is its flexible dosing regimen, which is every 25 to 60 days. Further, Apellis has worked hard to ensure its therapy works in any type of GA patient, Francois said. Regardless where the lesion in your eye is locatedwhether its centrally, whether its more in the peripheryour drug can slow these lesions down.</p><p>The FDA based its approval on positive 24-month results from Apellis late-stage Derby and Oaks studies. The trials found Syfovre lowered the rate of GA lesion growth versus placebo and demonstrated increased treatment effects over time. The greatest benefit seentracking on the high-end at a 36% reduction in lesion growthwas between the 18- and 24-month mark, Apellis said in a release.</p><p>Syfovre is expected to hit the market by the beginning of March, Apellis said. The drug will be made available through specialty distributors and pharmacies around the U.S. It costs $2,190 per vial before discounts, Apellis said in a company presentation Friday.</p><p>Apellis has been working intensively on its GA launch for the past four years, Francois said. In 2022, the company recruited around 100 field-based representatives to chip in on the launch, including sales and medical affairs reps, reimbursement managers and more. Those representatives have now been on the road for more than two quarters building awareness with doctors and patients, Francois said.</p><p>Apellis entered the commercial realm with pegcetacoplans first approval in the rare blood disorder paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria in 2022. The drug made $65 million in sales in its first year on the market.

Critics have described \"Vespers\" as a marked, climate change-inspired departure from Adams' previous compositions - \"direct and message-driven\"; a score that \"mourns and damns, and declares where in the past Adams might have simply observed.\" But Adams is surprised that reception to \"Vespers\" has invoked so much politics.</p><p>Before pivoting to a prolific performance and composition career in his mid-thirties, Adams was a full-time environmental activist who moved to Alaska to campaign for the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act and serve as executive director of the Northern Alaska Environmental Center. Prior to that, he had graduated first in his class with a degree in composition from the California Institute of the Arts. His decision to return to music after a decade in activism is perhaps a puzzling one - in light of environmental threats that have only grown more dire, would his concern for the Earth not be more useful in activism than concert halls? Yet, his music has always retained the strong influence of his love for nature: Many of his previous works, like Pulitzer prize-winning \"Become Ocean,\" are lush soundworlds more impressionistic and awe-inspired than condemnatory and wholly unlike the haunting \"Vespers,\" which are explicitly titled after a prayer service that coincides with nightfall.</p><p>It makes sense, in some ways, for people to conceive of \"Vespers\" as an overtly political statement, especially given its venue. Classical music is not an industry known for its eager embrace of change, nor is its aging audience particularly concerned about the peril of the warming climate. Patrons of classical music follow similarly: One of the leading benefactors of the Philadelphia Orchestra, who commissioned and performed \"Vespers,\" is the Hess Foundation, of Leon Hess' crude oil wealth. Adams' composition explicitly names Homo sapiens in its sung list of 192 endangered species and prominently features the lonely call of the last Kaua?i ?o?o, a bird native to Hawaii that went extinct in the 1980s. The work thus reads as rebellion in a space that has ventured only half-heartedly from its ivory tower.</p><p>Yet to Adams, this deviation from his apolitical style is completely personal - a characteristic that he previously sought to keep out of his compositions. Music, he writes in an essay shared with the HPR, \"is a spiritual discipline, and the daily practice of my art is my form of prayer.\" Like for many of us, though, the circumstances of 2020 and 2021 left an indelible mark on him, not just because of the pandemic and severe weather events, but because those events came closer to home. A massive forest fire ravaged the areas surrounding his house, and his best friend died a climate refugee. Adams bore this grief into his new composition, which he calls \"perhaps the most unabashedly personal and expressive music I've ever composed.\" With \"Vespers,\" he did not seek to sermonize but only to mourn - a friend, a home, a planet.</p><p>\"I can't help but wonder,\" Adams says in this same essay, \"If I'd voiced my grief and offered my prayers in the language of Christianity or another established religious tradition, would 'Vespers of the Blessed Earth' be received very differently, as a sacred work? Perhaps because my faith has no name, because it's grounded directly in the earth, Vespers seems to be heard as 'political art.'\"</p><p>Adams seems to hit upon a particularity of the climate crisis - it has taken on such a stubbornly political character, but politics hardly encapsulates the whole of it. Admittedly, it is hard to think of an issue that fits neatly within any meaningful definition of \"political,\" but climate change is a uniquely universal plight. The wealthy can move inland to stave off the threat of coastal flooding and buy new homes after a wildfire, but outrunning the problem will not be feasible for even the very richest in a few decades. The impacts of climate change do not discriminate between believers and non-believers, as can be seen by the smog from Nova Scotia's climate change-induced wildfires that blanketed much of the East Coast in early June.</p><p>However, just 54% of American adults - a scant majority - view climate change as a major threat, and that proportion has been trending downward since 2019 across party lines. We seem to be fatigued by accelerating natural disasters and expert-generated figures foretelling our demise; we have grown so used to the alarms that we have learned to speak over them. What, then, can climate art do where decades of political activism have failed?</p><p>To borrow a metaphor from chemistry, there is an activation energy of collective will that we have not yet achieved to disrupt the equilibrium of climate apathy. More exigent than any predicted disaster, especially to electorally beholden politicians, are the threats to the millions of jobs in fossil fuel industries and the prospect of slowed short-term economic growth. It is too easy for us to ignore the existential question of climate change in favor of the ones that we know how to understand, and our transactional relationship with the environment only exacerbates it. In the current popular discourse around climate change, everything in nature is something to be captured or harnessed for every last bit of economic productivity, from the energy that powers our homes to the development of ecotourism destinations that threaten those same ecosystems. As long as this is true, we will always be able to justify our myopia.</p><p>Here I see a challenge that artists are uniquely poised to address: to help us zoom out of our man-made political quandary and establish a relationship with nature that treats its preservation as an end rather than a means to a profitable one. We can take our cues from Adams, who describes using his compositions to \"transcend myself, to be in touch with mysteries larger, older, and deeper than I can fathom.\" There is a whole host of practical considerations that we must address - how we will make equitable energy transitions and how we will triage biodiverse ecosystems - but perhaps some answers are scattered somewhere along the path to a more reverent relationship with the planet that gives us life and, lest we forget, can take it away.</p><p>The rhetoric of survival that every humanitarian and governmental agency has employed is saturated to the point of inefficacy. In its stead, it is worth imagining a role for climate art that escapes the confines of politics and leans into an essential function of good art: reminding us of our humanity and the value of the world beyond our constructed one.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5536633</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:691K-B561-DY7P-T3KS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1127\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Harvard Political Review: Harvard University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 26, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>PHILADELPHIA ORCHESTRA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Cambridge</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>MA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Energy &amp;

According to news originating from Guimaraes, Portugal, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Wildland fires have become a major research subject among the national and international research community. Different simulation models have been developed to prevent this phenomenon.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Portuguese Foundation For Science And Technology; O3f-an Optimization Framework To Reduce Forest Fire. <br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from University of Minho: \"Nevertheless, fire propagation models are, until now, challenging due to the complexity of physics and chemistry, high computational requirements to solve physical models, and the difficulty defining the input parameters. Nevertheless, researchers have made immense progress in understanding wildland fire spread. This work reviews the state-of-the-art and lessons learned from the relevant literature to drive further advancement and provide the scientific community with a comprehensive summary of the main developments. The major findings or general research-based trends were related to the advancement of technology and computational resources, as well as advances in the physical interpretation of the acceleration of wildfires. Although wildfires result from the interaction between fundamental processes that govern the combustion at the solid- and gas-phase, the subsequent heat transfer and ignition of adjacent fuels are still not fully resolved at a large scale. However, there are some research gaps and emerging trends within this issue that should be given more attention in future investigations.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Hence, in view of further improvements in wildfire modeling, increases in computational resources will allow upscaling of physical models, and technological advancements are being developed to provide near real-time predictive fire behavior modeling. Thus, the development of two-way coupled models with weather prediction and fire propagation models is the main direction of future work.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: A Systematic Review and Bibliometric Analysis of Wildland Fire Behavior Modeling.

Removing potential fuel from the forest floor deprives future fires of material that would make them more serious and spread faster. It is a time-honored technique of forestry management and fire prevention used around the world, and is especially important in the Pinelands, an ecologically fragile 1.1-million-acre nature reserve in the center of the most densely populated U.S. state. </p><p>The small fires being set this week in various parts of the Pinelands come as the state has been experiencing a dry spell that could lead to more and bigger fires. \"We have had a pretty dry run the last few months,\" said Shawn LaTourette, the state's environmental protection commissioner, shortly before setting some small fires yesterday in a section of Bass River State Forest in Little Egg Harbor Township, near the border of Ocean and Burlington counties. \"That concerns me,\" he said. \"This area has the largest fire history in the state,\" added Trevor Raynor, a section warden with the New Jersey Forest Fire Service. The area being set ablaze on yesterday was not far from where four Eagleswood Township firefighters died in a blaze in 1977, and where five members of the Civilian Conservation Corps died in a 1936 fire. The forest floor was densely blanketed in pine needles, dead leaves, dry twigs and underbrush that could provide explosive fuel to a future wildfire. Burning it using small fires under controlled, closely watched conditions is like an insurance policy against future fires becoming worse than they otherwise would be. LaTourette used a drip torch - a metal canister of gasoline with a long, thin spout - to pour fuel onto leaves and pine needles in a defined area called a plow line, with the prevailing wind blowing against the fire to keep it small instead of fanning it from behind and pushing it through the forest. When a defined \"burn box\" has been completely consumed, firefighters will douse it from pumper trucks maintained by the forest fire service. The goal is to proactively burn 20,000 to 25,000 acres per year. There were over 900 wildfires in New Jersey last year, most of them either deliberately set or accidentally caused by people, authorities said. They added that fire is a natural part of the Pinelands ecosystem, and helps encourage pine trees to open their cones and drop seeds to spur the growth of new trees.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CLIWRE-0000017f5088d6eca17f52b971f00000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CLIWRE2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:654D-R3B1-JDGB-0182-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388351</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"428\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ClimateWire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"03\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>March 4, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Now around after this event, it's divided into 2 parts. Firstly, the management team will give you the results for 2023, and then we are going to have the Q&amp;A session. Now I'd like to give the floor to Chairman, Zhang Zhiyong, who is going to give you a presentation on the overall performance of the company in 2023.</p><p>ZHIYONG ZHANG, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, CHINA TOWER CORPORATION LIMITED: Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. Welcome, and thank you for joining us for China Tower's 2023 Annual Results Presentation. We like to express our gratitude to you for your long-term support and interest in China Tower. Today's presentation is divided into 3 parts. Firstly, I'm going to give you the overall performance of the company. And then for the specific performance, it's going to be taken over by Mr. Chunlei Gao. And then in terms of our financial performance, it's going to be presented by Mr. Hu Shaofeng. After our presentations, we would be very happy to answer any questions you have. In terms of the overall performance of the company for last year, the company proactively provided service and moved towards the strategic goals of cyberpower, Digital China and dual carbon, fortified its position of One Core and Two Wings, we're continuously deepen the development in sharing and coordination.</p><p>The overall results for the past year grew steadily specifically our overall performance was excellent. Our operational performance achieved double-digit growth of 11% and supported by multiple pillars, Two Wings business revenue increased to 12.2% of the total operating revenue. So we have a multi-revenue sources established. And our Smart Tower is serving digital governance at present, 217,000 telecom towers have been upgraded to digital towers. The company also accelerated technological innovation, the R&amp;D investment increased by 38%. The company also shared its fruitful results with shareholders. The dividend payout increased by 15.7%. In terms of the key indicators in 2023, as you can see from the slide, the major indicators are listed here.</p><p>The annual operating revenue reached RMB 94.01 billion, an increase of 2% year-on-year. Profit attributable to the owners of the company reached RMB 9.78 billion, up 11%. As of the end of 2023, the number of tenants reached 3.658 million, and the tenancy ratio was 1.79, up 0.05% from the end of last year. The site co-location level continued to increase. And due to the implementation of our policy, you can see our co-location rate continue to improve. You can see that 5 indicators are red, meaning continue to improve.</p><p>There is one indicator, registered negative growth. And I believe this is of great concern to every one of you here. That is our operating cash flow. There seems to be a negative growth. This is very much a result of the new round of pricing agreement and service agreements. So we need to upgrade and adjust the charging system, and we also need to verify data of all orders, and we need to negotiate new service standards. So the account receivable collection process was negatively affected. And the cash flow level was lower than that of the previous year. I'd say this slide was temporary because in Q4 last year, it's already recovering. And in January and February, it's a positive growth trend again. So for the management, we trust for the year 2024. The cash flow level will return to a normal level. And so the drop last year is just a temporary thing.</p><p>So in terms of our One Core and Two Wings business, I'd say each business segment maintained a very good development trend. As you can see from the table here, excluding the impact of the commercial pricing agreements, which is a very big item last year. So excluding the impact of the commercial pricing agreements -- because we have offered some discount as a result of the pricing agreement. Operating revenue on a comparable basis was RMB 97.72 billion, up 6% from the previous year. So it's a very healthy, very positive growth trend. In terms of other business, apart from our TSP business, the Two Wings business also grew very well. It accounts for 87.4% of total revenue. So revenue from the Two Wings business totaled RMB 11.50 billion, accounting for 12.2% of total revenue. That's after we're excluding the impact of the commercial pricing agreements.</p><p>So you can see that our revenue from the Two Wings business has continued to improve in terms of its share of our total revenue growth. For the TSP business, we continue to consolidate our leading position. We expand the 5G network penetration coverage and seize the opportunities arising at key countries fully push forward the healthy development of the TSP business. For -- on the comparable basis, the TSP business grew by 3.4%. And in term of our Two Wings business, we continue to enhance resource sharing. Last year, the company had built 586,000 5G base stations, up 9.5% year-on-year, achieving a historical high. We have cumulatively built 2.347 million 5G base stations, supporting China in leading the world in terms of 5G network deployment.</p><p>So we are indeed the leading force in the development of 5G in China. In terms of DAS business, it's another growth engine for the company. The company continued to leverage its advantage in coordinated construction, innovative products and service solutions to help satisfy the demand for 5G upgrading of existing DAS as well as expanding to the new DAS market. So our covered building area was up 37.3% year-on-year, reaching 10.15 billion square meters. Our subway and high-speed railway tunnels coverage was up 20.1% year-on-year reaching 11,625 and 12,447 kilometers, respectively. So you can see the DAS coverage continue to expand.</p><p>As for our Two Wings business, firstly, if we look at the Smart Tower business, the company seize the opportunities in digital economy and digital social governance, rely on our plentiful mid-to-high point side resources and specialized operation advantages while continue to enhance its core capabilities in 5 areas of platform data algorithm, application and operation. We also aim to build the differentiated advantages with this algorithm for mid-to-high point monitoring service, continuously transforming telecommunication towers to digital towers. As you can see from the slide, now we provide over 100 meter high point algorithm. So with the plentiful scenario trainings, we are able to provide more than 100 mid-to-high point high-precision algorithms.</p><p>At the same time, we have established more than 1.3 million unique mid-to-high point database. So our algorithm will be more and more precise. We have more and more data, and we'll be able to offer more value in the future. In terms of our energy business our advantage has been shown in the recent years. We try to meet customer need by accelerating the product innovation. We try to meet customer need in terms of battery exchange and power backup. We try to upgrade the battery exchange products and develop standardized products for power backup. Also we accelerated the platforms, upgrade and optimize our service systems to strengthen our service capabilities. At the same time, we enhanced the level of dedicated management, optimized resource allocation. So we push forward battery exchange business for traction battery. We have a power backup. So there is a cascade utilization of batteries. We have a much higher efficiency in our tower business.</p><p>So for last year, our revenue from energy business achieved RMB 4.21 billion, which is a year-on-year increase of 31.7%. The business scale continued to expand rapidly. For last year, the company continued to expand its innovation development strategy, cultivated the new advantages in high-quality development through technological innovation. We centered around target the forefront of world technology, serving the main battlefields of the economy. Fulfill the product -- production and operation needs and meet actual customer needs, production and business needs. We focus on key areas such as AI, new energy, computing power networks, 5G-A and 6G and increased investment in scientific and technological innovation, we improved results output efficiency, empowered our technological advancement and enhanced quality and efficiency, the annual R&amp;D investment increased by 38%, with the application for invention Patents increased by 47% and the authorized invention patents increased by 2x.</p><p>The company also continued to optimize the technological innovation systems and mechanisms. We built a four-in-one innovation system led by the headquarters and was also the first batch establishing 6 technological innovation centers in places such as Hangzhou. We used the [Four Lists] of capability level projects, resource allocation and achievement transformation to drive technological innovation. The company is taking the lead in carry out over 100 key scientific research projects to accelerate the formation of new quality productive forces.</p><p>As you can see from the slide, the company continued to improve its operation and management capabilities. We can say for last year as a whole, we've firstly implemented various measures for the digital management of fund assets by carrying out intelligent operations and maintenance, the one-code-for-all, single-site accounting system and construction of the treasury system to improve digital operation capabilities. In addition, we deepened the incentive system of management level employees by implementing specialized talent programs to stimulate the motivation within the company.</p><p>Thirdly, we reformed innovation capability and deepened the sharing of existing resources with new tenants, co-location rates reached 85%. We continue to enhance their share on social resources. Last year, 36.3% of new ground tower sites were constructed by utilizing social resources. So we improved the resource coordination and sharing capabilities of the company. Fourthly, we launched the collaborate development of the One Core and Two Wings strategy, drive the upgrade of telecommunication digital tower. So through having power exchange cabinets to provide reverse power supply to base stations, we established a large-scale operation and maintenance system, connecting all customers, access and maintenance, monitoring and ordering dispatching to improve the collaborative development capability.</p><p>Thus, we can lower cost and further improve efficiency. The -- our core or our Two Wings business, we can provide comprehensive support and service to our customers. So we utilize existing operation and maintenance systems to fully serving -- to fully serve our One Core and Two Wings customers so that our operation and management cost can be greatly reduced. So as you can see, this year, in terms of our operating revenue and we have the impact of the new commercial pricing agreement. We still achieved an 11% growth in net profit. That's very much due to the improvement in our operation and management efficiency.</p><p>The company also continued to improve its payout ratio. The company always attached great importance to shareholder returns and we maintained a proactive dividend policy so that our shareholders can share the fruits of the company's development. So considering the future development needs and our cash flow level, the Board recommended the distribution of a final dividend of RMB 0.03739 per share for 2023, an increase of 15.7% year-on-year. The dividend payout ratio of distributable net profit is 75%. In the future, the company will continue to build on its development momentum, improve profitability and create greater value for shareholders. The company actively practices corporate social responsibility and is committed to achieving a harmonious symbiosis with society and the environment.</p><p>In terms of environmental protection, the company reduced duplicated investment construction in industry through co-sharing. And also, we try to save land and reduce carbon emissions through various initiatives. In terms of our social contribution, the company successfully fulfilled its high-quality communication service for major events, for example, Asian Games in Hangzhou and the [universities] in Chengdu. China Tower has provided important [telecommunication] support. And also our emergency response in hazardous weather was also outstanding. So in terms of corporate governance, we stick to the diversification of the Board, and we utilize the rich experience of our board members. We try to implement high-quality corporate governance to ensure the interest of our shareholders.</p><p>So this is the last slide of mine. Looking to the future, we will achieve quality development through our strategic guidance. We will achieve upgrading and transformation and we will follow the development of emerging industries and by deepening the implementation of cyberpower, accelerating the upgrades of digitalization transformation to green and low carbon with the ample room for the company's development.

The intense heat had skinned them. One's intestines were visible on its belly.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Arvaniti is one of thousands of farmers in the neighbourhood of Alexandroupolis hit hard by forest fires that started a week ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In addition to dozens of sheep and goats, she lost her 60 chickens, valuable feed stored up for the winter, and a field house where she spent nights delivering newborn sheep.</p><p>'Sheep only birth at night, and I have some ewes who are ready to drop,' she said. 'I've nowhere to stay to help them, and I've no shelter for them.'</p><p>The fires, thought to have been sparked by a lightning storm, had devastated 72,000 hecatres (178,000 acres) of Western Thrace and East Macedonia, Greece's northeastern regions as of Thursday and the fires continued to burn on Friday. It is Europe's largest fire in recent years, according to the European Commission.</p><p>Altogether, Greece has lost 120,000 hectares (295,000 acres) to fires this year, one of its worst annual tallies, and fire season is not over yet.</p><p>Vagia Arvaniti surveys the ruins of her sheep pens [John Psaropoulos/Al Jazeera]</p><p>The government has not yet said how much compensation farmers will receive, but agriculture ministry officials are touring the area before the fires are even out tallying claims.</p><p>The government has some fiscal space. Tax <url normalizedValue=\"mailto:https://www.naftemporiki.gr/finance/economy/1506827/proypologismos-protogenes-pleonasma-356-dis-to-7mino/\">revenue</url>  for the first seven months was 2.25 billion euros higher than expected. But the announcements may take time, and farmers need cash now to repurchase feed and rebuild stables.</p><p>Nikos Grigoriadis, who directs the federation of farmers' co-operatives in the area, said he is giving out feed on credit to as many members as he can.</p><p>'I estimate we have to make available 600,000 to 700,000 euros' worth of emergency feed to our 3,500 members. Some are proud and will accept nothing on credit. Others simply cannot pay,' he said.</p><p>'I don't think we're ever going to see this money back, or not for a very long time,' he added.</p><p>One of those who cannot pay is Hussein Husseinoglou, a builder from the village of Dikela. He described discovering what was left of his tool and sheep shed on the mountainside.</p><p>'My equipment didn't just burn. It melted. My animals were fused into a ball,' he said. Asked to estimate the cost of his machinery, he said, 'I can't put a number on it. I've been working as a builder for 28 years. All my fortune was there.'</p><p>The cooperative is not the only source of immediate help. The roads were dotted with pick-up trucks carrying hay and feed as unscathed farmers helped neighbours.</p><p>A Bulgarian man who had a house in Dikela donated truckloads of hay for Husseinoglou's surviving sheep.</p><p>Arvaniti's sheep were burned alive in their shelters [John Psaropoulos/Al Jazeera]</p><p>'People did what they could'</p><p>The fire's destruction seemed arbitrary. One vineyard was singed around the edges but spared. An olive grove bore a line of burned trees. Fire drove a phalanx of destruction through a field, but left two solar photovoltaic installations on either side of it unharmed.</p><p>In the Muslim village of Avra, Mustafa Sofu and his brother saved their 650 sheep and goats but saw their alfalfa and barley feed go up in smoke.</p><p>'These alfalfa balls go for seven or eight euros apiece, and [my brother] lost three thousand, so the damage is over 20,000 euros' worth. And the whole barn was burned,' he said. 'We expect the government will help us now.'</p><p>Sheep shelters and toolsheds seem to have been the main property losses.</p><p>A few houses burned in the village of Dikela, but there was remarkably little structural damage overall given the scale of the fires.</p><p>In the village of Palagia, near Arvaniti's farm, the elementary school burned down but no houses were lost.</p><p>Locals said that is because they defied evacuation orders to protect their properties.</p><p>'The village was ordered to evacuate but all the men stayed to defend their homes. I was here, too,' said plumber Nektarios Mamatzanian, a resident of Palagia.</p><p>'People did what they could with their garden hoses, but at some point, the water was cut off.'</p><p>Water mains pressure is often provided by electric pumps, but the pumps failed when the fire burned through electricity poles and wires.</p><p>'The fire service helped after locals insisted,' said Mamatzanian. Had the village been evacuated as ordered, it might not have survived.</p><p>The fire reached the outskirts of Palagia but homeowners defied an evacuation order to defend their properties [John Psaropoulos/Al Jazeera]</p><p>Unusual, unprecedented</p><p>Alexandroupolis Mayor Yiannis Zampoukis said his evacuation policy saved lives.</p><p>'We typically have one or two fires each summer, but such a phenomenon hasn't existed in Alexandroupoli's recent history,' Zampoukis told Al Jazeera.</p><p>'We had to evacuate 12,000 people between 2am-4am [on Monday] and at the same time, we had to evacuate our municipal summer camp and the church's summer camp, two old people's homes, and the Alexandroupoli hospital,' he said, clearly proud at the municipality's swift action.</p><p>This was very much the opposite of what happened in Mati, a resort east of Athens, in 2018 when the fire service, municipality and regional administration all failed to evacuate residents squarely in the path of a wind-whipped forest fire.</p><p>More than 100 were killed, and the incident has since led authorities to prioritise human life and downplay the preservation of property.</p><p>Debate has also raged about how to defend the environment. Fighting a forest blaze is difficult. When the fire reached the village of Koila, for instance, firefighters set up a line of defence on a ridge. For hours, they fought back flames with hoses as villagers helped carry hoses and ferry water to the engines. But a sudden gust of wind overwhelmed them, bringing the fire over the ridge in seconds, darkening the sky with smoke and ash.</p><p>The seemingly unbeatable ferocity with which a fire burns a desiccated forest has led many experts to emphasise the importance of fire prevention through cleaning of dead wood, the building of fire breaks and other measures.</p><p>'Each year, we hear that fire conditions were something new, unusual or unprecedented.

Earth Force is excited to announce the top winners in the RISE Challenge - a national program to help more young people take action to help their communities become more resilient to natural hazards.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Here are the 2023 winners:</p><p>RISE ChallengeColorado</p><p>1st Place ($1,000): Estes Park Middle School - Estes Park, CO</p><p>Project Title: EPMS Resilience Team</p><p>Project Summary: After years of evacuations due to more wildfires, Estes Park Middle School Resilience Team built upon their work last year to engage state officials about wildland urban interface codes and building practices that create resilience against wildfire. Students visited the State Capitol to meet with Senator Cutter and Gov. Polis to advocate for CO Senate Bill 23-166 that establishes a Wildfire Resilience Code Board. This Board will work to ensure community safety from and more resiliency to wildfires by reducing the risk of wildfires to people and property through the adoption of statewide codes and standards. This Bill was signed May 12th, 2023! In addition to their advocacy, the Resilience Team planted trees and participated in community events that bring awareness to watershed health.</p><p>RISE ChallengeBig Sky</p><p>1st Place ($1,000): Glacier High School - Kalispell, MT</p><p>Project Title: Pulling Our Share</p><p>Project Summary: Students in Montana face an increasing amount of uncontrolled wildfires. Part of the issue is that forests are being altered at an increasing rate thanks to the growing population of noxious invasive weeds. After a forest fire, invasive weeds have a blank canvas to grow before the indigenous plants have a chance to take root. Their solution? Increase their community's resilience to wildfires by organizing noxious weed pulling groups. This will give the native species a better chance to repopulate after a wildfire before the noxious weeds can take over.</p><p>RISE ChallengeIllinois</p><p>1st Place ($1,000): Libertyville High School</p><p>Project Title: Libertyville APES-Eastern Shoreline Erosion</p><p>Project Summary: After being unable to use their school's field due to ongoing flooding, the winning students wanted to make a change. The students decided to install a native pollinator buffer strip along a 300 foot section of frequently flooded (and therefore unusable) land between their school's softball practice field and a nearby lake. The project will mitigate flooding, create habitats for pollinators, and educate the community about pollinators, native plants, and stewardship.</p><p>\"The importance of being resilient in the face of natural hazards is universal,\" says Vince Meldrum, President and CEO at Earth Force. \"Resilience emerges from the ability of communities, with support from all levels of government and the private sector, to plan and prepare for, respond to, recover from, and adapt to new conditions. The RISE Challenge is a proven method for young people to participate in these efforts.\"</p><p>About Earth Force:</p><p>Earth Force is a national 501(c)3 organization. We are the home of Environmental Action Civics. Our mission is to engage young people as active citizens who improve the environment and their communities now and in the future. Through Earth Force and its network of partners, young people get hands-on, real-world opportunities to practice civic skills, acquire a deep understanding of the environment, and develop the skills and motivation to become lifelong leaders in addressing community issues.

That's not the case with Claire Dederer's thrilling collection, which grew out of an essay in Paris Review. The \"dilemma\"? What to do with work we love by people who do horrible things. In other words, is there any way to watch \"Chinatown\" without being disgusted by the behavior of director/actor Roman Polanski or to read \"Lolita\" without conflating its pedophile antihero with author Vladimir Nabokov? In chapters devoted to Polanski (whose \"monstrousness,\" she writes, is as vast as the Grand Canyon), Woody Allen, Nabokov (whom she defends, definitively) and Pablo Picasso, Dederer addresses our ability to hold two competing ideas in our heads at the same time.</p><p>Dederer is especially good at examining how personal our responses are to art and to the transgressions of artists. Just as many people voted for Donald Trump despite unsavory things they knew about him (the \"dilemma\" that began Dederer on the path to her book), maybe some of us can enjoy Allen's \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" without thinking about him (it's harder, of course, with a movie such as \"Annie Hall,\" in which he appears as a version of himself). Nobody said it was going to be easy to make choices, whether in politics or trips to the multiplex.</p><p>The writer also looks in the mirror, examining her own failings as a human being and weighing them against those of art giants. Dederer lucidly lays out her conclusions in a provocative, wildly entertaining book that eschews definitive answers but asks one fascinating question after another.</p><p>Poverty, by America</p><p>By Matthew Desmond</p><p>Like \"Monsters,\" it's a book that could alter the way you see the world. Desmond's follow-up to his trailblazing, Pulitzer Prize-winning \"Evicted\" (in which he embedded himself with Milwaukeeans with insecure housing) also takes a deep dive into poverty and injustice. It also doesn't pretend to be balanced. It reads almost like a passionate speech, urging us to dig deeper, to forget what we think we know as we try to understand the inequities upon which America was built. Citing movements such as Minneapolis' Inquilinxs Unidxs por Justicia (United Renters for Justice), Desmond asks us all to become \"poverty abolitionists\" and to recognize that when those of us who are keeping our heads above water encounter someone who isn't, those circumstances are related. He also lays out a plan he says would \"fix\" poverty in America, which makes \"Poverty, by America\" a surprisingly hopeful work.</p><p>The Talk</p><p>By Darrin Bell</p><p>Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoonist Bell's book is a memoir in the form of a graphic novel. As he begins contemplating giving \"the talk\" (about how to navigate encounters with police) to his son, Bell reflects on his own youth - when, because his Black father was out of the picture, his white mom had to give him \"the talk.\" Bell also looks back at the journey - romantic, embarrassing, scary, inspiring - that drove him from childhood in Los Angeles to creating a daily newspaper comic strip and other cartoons for the New Yorker and elsewhere. Each page of the lively, handsome book (which Bell created digitally, rather than with pen and paper) contains something vivid or funny or heartbreaking - often all three. In his Star Tribune review, Chris Barsanti wrote that the bittersweet book \"minimizes overt commentary, making satiric jabs, instead, with brevity, wit, insight and humanity.\"</p><p>Wifedom</p><p>By Anna Funder</p><p>Essayist Funder had long been a fan of \"Animal Farm\" writer George Orwell but when she began to examine his life and work, she had some questions. Why, for instance, did he never mention his wife by name when he covered the Spanish Civil War, although she typed and edited his notes, faced more danger than he did and arguably did more valuable work? The more Funder looked into the relationship between George and Eileen Orwell, the more she saw Eileen's uncredited role in her husband's accomplishments. Funder's bold, bracing book blends nonfiction with novelistic passages (clearly delineated) in which she imagines Eileen's activities, as well as a sort-of memoir, in which Funder questions the idea of \"the woman behind the man.\" Her conclusion? \"Wifedom is a wicked magic trick we have learned to play on ourselves. I want to expose how it is done and so take its wicked, tricking power away.\"</p><p>Fever in the Heartland</p><p>By Timothy Egan</p><p>Who knew Indiana was a hotbed of the Ku Klux Klan - and white supremacy - in the 1920s? D.C. Stephenson is the vile antihero of this provocative history by Egan, whose other books include \"The Worst Hard Time.\" Texan Stephenson's goalposts included becoming a KKK Grand Dragon, turning his adopted state of Indiana into the one with the highest per-capita KKK membership, planning a run for president of the United States - oh, and almost getting away with murder. His victim was the book's other main character, Madge Oberholtzer, whose brief relationship with Stephenson ended with her tragic demise. Egan's book is filled with astonishing and entertaining details (women in the KKK used cones under their hoods to protect their hairdos) but its story - a warning about the horrors that result when we fall under the spell of a demagogue - is a sobering one.</p><p>Ghosts of the Orphanage</p><p>By Christine Kenneally</p><p>\"A damning book, from start to finish,\" is how former Star Tribune books editor Laurie Hertzel summed up \"Ghosts\" in her review. Kenneally's focus is St. Joseph's Orphanage in Vermont, which she describes as \"a factory of pain,\" but her tale of the abuse and torture of children also includes Native boarding schools as well as children's homes in Ireland, Canada and Australia, most of them run by the Catholic Church. Kenneally combines exhaustive interviews with surviving nuns, some who were themselves victims of abuse (one observes, \"We had permission to kick the children\"), and their victims, who remain traumatized half a century after the events they describe. Hertzel wrote that Kenneally \"chips away at the secrets, finding documentation and corroboration. The reportage in this book is impeccable. She never says more than she can prove, but she also never says less.\"</p><p>Master Slave Husband Wife</p><p>By Ilyon Woo</p><p>In the market for a true story that reads with the tension of a pulse-pounding thriller? How about this wouldn't-believe-it-except-every-word-is-true premise: Ellen and William Craft escape the Georgia plantation where they are enslaved in 1848. They make their way north - on trains, boats and carts - in disguise: Ellen (whose father also was her \"owner\") takes advantage of her light skin and pretends to be a white man, traveling with her attentive slave (William). Woo's fast-paced narrative follows them on 12 legs of their journey to freedom, hounded by slave catchers and their own occasional slip-ups. In a story that seems tailor-made for the movies, the Crafts eventually became advocates for emancipation and suffrage, and even reunited with long-lost family. Woo has said her goal is a \"dramatic history that reads like a novel\" and, in the spellbinding \"Master, Slave,\" she manifested that.</p><p>Black and Female</p><p>By Tsitsi Dangarembga</p><p>\"The force that propels my narrative through the damage is the hope not to be consumed, not to have my being rotted away, by the trauma,\" writes Dangarembga in her essay collection. \"I write to raise mountains, hills, escarpments and rocky outcrops over the gouges in my history, my societies and their attendant spirits.\" The Zimbabwean writer's novel \"Nervous Conditions\" was cited by the BBC as one of the 100 books that most shaped our world. In her Star Tribune review of \"Black and Female,\" Shannon Gibney called the essays \"trenchant\" for the way they grapple with the lingering effects of colonialism and explore efforts to achieve gender equity in Zimbabwe. Gibney wrote that she was moved by the essayist/playwright/filmmaker/novelist's reach across oceans to link her struggles with those of greats such as Audre Lorde, Paule Marshall and Toni Morrison.</p><p>Fire Weather</p><p>By John Vaillant</p><p>A roundup of books about famous fires led several readers to write to ask, \"Have you read 'Fire Weather'? It's fantastic.\" Thanks, guys! Vaillant's National Book Award finalist comes in three parts. The first establishes the context for what he calls the most intense fire on Earth, ever. It was in 2016 in Alberta, and it was brought about by a perfect storm: a dry spring, high winds, leafless trees, shortsighted officials and denial. A forest fire quickly torched nearly the entire city of Fort McMurray, which becomes the book equivalent of a disaster movie in Vaillant's gripping second section. His reporting gifts are complemented by an imaginative ability to help us understand, for instance, how 19th-century beaver pelt traders were like Netflix and how a fiberglass bus shelter could melt like a milk bottle. Vaillant's spectacular book is also, unfortunately, an urgent one.</p><p>Unraveling</p><p>By Peggy Orenstein</p><p>\"This witty, irreverent memoir is, at heart, extremely serious,\" wrote Laurie Hertzel of a book that might not sound like it is. Subtitled \"What I Learned About Life While Shearing Sheep, Dyeing Wool and Making the World's Ugliest Sweater,\" it finds Orenstein facing multiple personal crises in the midst of the pandemic. Like many people, she responds by doing something with her hands. Unlike most of those people, she doesn't just knit a sweater but gathers her own wool and then cards and dyes it. The heavy (and not-as-ugly-as-she-claims) result is a sweater suitable only for when the Californian visits her father in Minnesota. But the point of the book is to talk about the environment, family and the work women do: \"Making something from nothing is the quintessential magic of women, whether turning fiber to thread or flour to bread or engaging in the ultimate creative act: conjuring new humans from nowhere at all.\"</p><p>Chris Hewitt \u00b7 612-673-4367</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRIB-MERLIN72816959</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRIB2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69R9-S3F1-JC8F-K00F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8384</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1675\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Star Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN)</publicationName><edition>METRO EDITION</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 26, 2023 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>BOOK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>REVIEW</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>LIST</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>HOLIDAY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009UDR</classCode><className>NON FICTION LITERATURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>ST000CA2H</classCode><className>POVERTY &amp; HOMELESSNESS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000A5F8</classCode><className>ACTORS &amp; ACTRESSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009IR9</classCode><className>ENTERTAINMENT &amp; ARTS AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008XWL</classCode><className>EVICTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST0009VC0</classCode><className>ARTISTS &amp; PERFORMERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000A5F8</classCode><className>ACTORS &amp; ACTRESSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009IR9</classCode><className>ENTERTAINMENT &amp; ARTS AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008XWL</classCode><className>EVICTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST0009VC0</classCode><className>ARTISTS &amp; PERFORMERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>PE0009THX</classCode><className>DONALD TRUMP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX614</classCode><className>MINNEAPOLIS, MN, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS139</classCode><className>MINNESOTA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

According to news originating from Manhattan, Kansas, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"The bushfires that occurred in Australia in late 2019 and early 2020 were unprecedented in terms of their scale, intensity, and impacts.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include U.S. Department of Agriculture. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Kansas State University: \"Using nitrogen dioxide (NO [ [2] ] ) and carbon monoxide (CO) data measured by the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), together with fire counts and fire radiative power (FRP) from MODIS, we analyzed the temporal and spatial variation of NO [ [2] ] and CO column densities over three selected areas covering savanna and temperate forest vegetation. The D NO 2 / D CO emission ratio and emission factor were also estimated. The D NO 2 / D CO emission ratio was found to be 1.57 \u00b1 1.71 for temperate forest fire and ranged from 2.0 \u00b1 2.36 to 2.6 \u00b1 1.92 for savanna fire. For savanna and temperate forest fires, satellite-derived NO [ [ x ] ] emission factors were found to be 1.48 and 2.39 g kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, whereas the CO emission factors are 107.39 and 126.32 g kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. This study demonstrates that the large-scale emission ratio from the TROPOMI satellite for different biomass burnings can help identify the relative contribution of smoldering and flaming activities in a large region and their impacts on the regional atmospheric composition and air quality.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"This method can be applied to study the emissions from other large fires, or even the burning of fossil fuel in megacities, and their impact on air quality.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Estimation of biomass burning emission of NO [ [2] ] and CO from 2019-2020 Australia fires based on satellite observations.

The head of the local Aragon government, Javier Lamb\u00c3\u00a1n, said yesterday that the situation was critical in the town of A\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00b3n de Moncayo and the priority for the 300 firefighters fighting the blaze was to protect human lives and villages. </p><p>The wildfire, which began Saturday, developed a 31-mile perimeter in less than 24 hours, the local forest chief said. Its estimated burned surface could be up to 20,000 acres, state news agency EFE reported. Those who fled took shelter in three different sports centers in nearby towns. Firefighters said the outlook for taming the blaze depends on the weather, but gusty winds up to 37 mph were predicted. Drought and extremely high temperatures in the Mediterranean country are turning 2022 into the worst year of the century in terms of fires. So far this year, the Spanish Ministry for Ecological Transition has registered 43 large wildfires, which are those that have burned at least 1,250 acres. That is four times the amount of the previous year and a record for the last decade. The European Forest Fire Information System says 615,000 acres have burned in wildfires so far this year in Spain. That's almost four times the country's full-year average of 165,000 acres since 2006, when records began.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-00000182a1ded10ba1bbfbfea23f0000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66CC-YHX1-JBSK-R00M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"244\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 15, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DRDO</classCode><className>PRESS AGENCY RELEASES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000A2MB</classCode><className>ARAGON, SPAIN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC325</classCode><className>SPAIN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Another major blaze on the outskirts of Athens torched homes, reducing some to piles of smoking rubble, and encroached into the national park on Mount Parnitha, one of the last green areas near the Greek capital.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">From Friday to Tuesday, 355 wildfires broke out, Climate Crisis and Civil Protection Minister Vassilis Kikilias said. On Wednesday, firefighters were tackling 99 blazes, fire department spokesman Ioannis Artopios said in an evening briefing, including 55 that had broken out in the previous 24 hours.</p><p>Authorities made 140 wildfire-related arrests, including 117 for negligence and 23 for deliberate arson, Artopios said, adding that nearly all were for heat-inducing or agricultural outdoor work.</p><p>Gale-force winds combined with hot, dry weather to whip up the flames, making the blazes exceptionally difficult to bring under control, authorities said.</p><p>Weather conditions this summer have been \u201cthe worst since meteorological data have been gathered and the fire risk map has been issued in the country,\u201d Kikilias told a news conference. Extensive parts of Greece have been placed at Level 5, the highest for fire risk, seven times this year, which Kikilias said was double the number of 2021, four times that of 2019 and seven times more than in 2012.</p><p>Authorities issued dozens of evacuation orders for villages, Alexandroupolis' outskirts and seaside areas, with the coast guard and private boats plucking some people from beaches and coasts.</p><p>Although winds were gradually abating in many parts of the country, the risk of new fires remained high.</p><p>\u201cConditions remain difficult and in many cases extreme,\u201d Artopios said.</p><p>Firefighters searching recently burnt areas in the Alexandroupolis region, which is near the border with Turkey, <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/wildfires-greece-evacuation-firefighters-375a33b022ba619d09b15b056ed3f3f7\">discovered the bodies of 18 people</url> believed to be migrants in a forest Tuesday.</p><p>Alexandroupolis coroner Pavlos Pavlidis told The Associated Press all were male and two were minors between 10 and 15 years old.</p><p>Greece's Disaster Victim Identification Team was tasked with identifying the bodies and was setting up a telephone hotline that would operate 9am-5pm local time (0600GMT-1400GMT) from Thursday in English, Arabic, Pashto, Turkish and Urdu for potential relatives of the victims.</p><p>Two other people died Monday, one in northern and one in central Greece.</p><p>With firefighting forces stretched to the limit, Greece asked other European countries for assistance. Germany, Sweden, Croatia and Cyprus sent water-dropping aircraft. Romanian, French and Czech firefighters helped on the ground.</p><p>Evacuations were ordered for several neighborhoods and a migrant camp on the northwestern fringe of the Greek capital, as a wildfire that started Tuesday raced up a mountain toward Parnitha national park, threatened a military base and torched homes in the foothills.</p><p>More than 200 firefighters backed by volunteers, military and police forces, were battling the blaze, supported until nightfall by 12 planes and 14 helicopters. In Alexandroupolis, 17 planes and eight helicopters provided air support to the ground firefighting forces.</p><p>Supreme Court prosecutor Georgia Adilini asked the Alexandroupolis prosecutor to launch investigations into whether organized arson groups were operating in the region. Kikilias said the fire in the northeastern border region started in 15 different places inside a forest, with strong winds and dry conditions contributing to create a massive fire front.</p><p>\u201cAny firefighting forces, no matter how strong they were, would not have been able to bring it under control,\u201d Kikilias said.</p><p>Adilini also asked the Alexandroupolis prosecutor to investigate incidents of racist violence after police arrested three men on suspicion of imprisoning 13 migrants whom they accused of being linked to the wildfire.</p><p>One Albanian and two Greeks were charged Wednesday with a series of crimes, including kidnapping, and were being held pending a preliminary court hearing. A video posted online showed one of them referring to the migrants in terminology used for livestock and urging members of the public to round up migrants.</p><p>Across the border in Turkey\u2019s Canakkale province, strong winds fanned a wildfire for a second day. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said winds reaching 70 kilometers (40 miles) per hour at times were hampering efforts to extinguish the blaze but said firefighters had managed to halt its spread.</p><p>\u201cHopefully, we will get it under control soon,\u201d Erdogan said in a televised address.</p><p>Ibrahim Yumakli, Turkey\u2019s forestry minister, said firefighting teams and more than two dozen fire-dousing planes and helicopters had largely blocked the blaze from spreading beyond the 15 square kilometers (5.8 square miles) it had already affected.</p><p>Authorities suspended maritime traffic through the narrow Dardanelles Strait linking the Aegean Sea to the Sea of Marmara, which the water-dropping aircraft were using to refill, the minister said.</p><p>Authorities evacuated an elderly care home and more than 1,250 people from nine villages and closed down a highway. Hospitals treated more than 80 people for the effects of smoke.</p><p>Erdogan urged citizens to exercise care and help prevent wildfires.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, more than 90% of fires in our country are caused by humans,\" he said. \"Negligence or carelessness lead to great disasters.\"</p><p>In Tenerife in Spain's Canary Islands, authorities said a wildfire burning for more than a week was nearly under control after scorching 150 square kilometers (58 square miles).</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very tough battle that the firefighting teams are winning,\u201d said Canary regional government counselor Manuel Miranda.</p><p>Spain is sweltering under its fourth heat wave this summer.

Ronan L\u00c3\u00a9austic, an official in the Gironde region, said 8,000 evacuated residents have been authorized to come back home. </p><p>The fire in the Gironde and Landes regions has burned more than 29 square miles since Tuesday. Marc Vermeulen, commander of the Gironde fire brigade, said the blaze is not extinguished yet and is still burning underground, where there is a lot of peat. Roads in the area have been reopened to residents only and going into the forest remains forbidden. More than 360 firefighters arrived in France on Friday from Germany, Romania, Poland and Austria to help battle the fire, joining over 1,000 French firefighters already at the site. Greece and Italy each sent two specialized Canadair aircraft. A series of heat waves have compounded a critical drought that has hit much of Europe, creating prime wildfire conditions. The Gironde region was hit last month by giant wildfires that forced the evacuation of more than 39,000 people. More than 232 square miles of forest has burned so far this year in France, more than any other year in the past decade, according to the European Forest Fire Information System. The European Union's Earth-monitoring Copernicus program said satellite observations showed estimated carbon emissions from wildfires in France during June, July and August were the highest since 2003, reflecting the severity of this year's fire season.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-00000182a1d9d92fa7a3e7ff65d50000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66CC-YHX1-JBSK-R00N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"263\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 15, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Another major blaze on the outskirts of Athens torched homes, reducing some to piles of smoking rubble, and encroached into the national park on Mount Parnitha, one of the last green areas near the Greek capital.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">From Friday to Tuesday, 355 wildfires broke out, Climate Crisis and Civil Protection Minister Vassilis Kikilias said. On Wednesday, firefighters were tackling 99 blazes, fire department spokesman Ioannis Artopios said in an evening briefing, including 55 that had broken out in the previous 24 hours.</p><p>Authorities made 140 wildfire-related arrests, including 117 for negligence and 23 for deliberate arson, Artopios said, adding that nearly all were for heat-inducing or agricultural outdoor work.</p><p>Gale-force winds combined with hot, dry weather to whip up the flames, making the blazes exceptionally difficult to bring under control, authorities said.</p><p>Weather conditions this summer have been \u201cthe worst since meteorological data have been gathered and the fire risk map has been issued in the country,\u201d Kikilias told a news conference. Extensive parts of Greece have been placed at Level 5, the highest for fire risk, seven times this year, which Kikilias said was double the number of 2021, four times that of 2019 and seven times more than in 2012.</p><p>Authorities issued dozens of evacuation orders for villages, Alexandroupolis' outskirts and seaside areas, with the coast guard and private boats plucking some people from beaches and coasts.</p><p>Although winds were gradually abating in many parts of the country, the risk of new fires remained high.</p><p>\u201cConditions remain difficult and in many cases extreme,\u201d Artopios said.</p><p>Firefighters searching recently burnt areas in the Alexandroupolis region, which is near the border with Turkey, <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/wildfires-greece-evacuation-firefighters-375a33b022ba619d09b15b056ed3f3f7\">discovered the bodies of 18 people</url> believed to be migrants in a forest Tuesday.</p><p>Alexandroupolis coroner Pavlos Pavlidis told The Associated Press all were male and two were minors between 10 and 15 years old.</p><p>Greece's Disaster Victim Identification Team was tasked with identifying the bodies and was setting up a telephone hotline that would operate 9am-5pm local time (0600GMT-1400GMT) from Thursday in English, Arabic, Pashto, Turkish and Urdu for potential relatives of the victims.</p><p>Two other people died Monday, one in northern and one in central Greece.</p><p>With firefighting forces stretched to the limit, Greece asked other European countries for assistance. Germany, Sweden, Croatia and Cyprus sent water-dropping aircraft. Romanian, French and Czech firefighters helped on the ground.</p><p>Evacuations were ordered for several neighborhoods and a migrant camp on the northwestern fringe of the Greek capital, as a wildfire that started Tuesday raced up a mountain toward Parnitha national park, threatened a military base and torched homes in the foothills.</p><p>More than 200 firefighters backed by volunteers, military and police forces, were battling the blaze, supported until nightfall by 12 planes and 14 helicopters. In Alexandroupolis, 17 planes and eight helicopters provided air support to the ground firefighting forces.</p><p>Supreme Court prosecutor Georgia Adilini asked the Alexandroupolis prosecutor to launch investigations into whether organized arson groups were operating in the region. Kikilias said the fire in the northeastern border region started in 15 different places inside a forest, with strong winds and dry conditions contributing to create a massive fire front.</p><p>\u201cAny firefighting forces, no matter how strong they were, would not have been able to bring it under control,\u201d Kikilias said.</p><p>Adilini also asked the Alexandroupolis prosecutor to investigate incidents of racist violence after police arrested three men on suspicion of imprisoning 13 migrants whom they accused of being linked to the wildfire.</p><p>One Albanian and two Greeks were charged Wednesday with a series of crimes, including kidnapping, and were being held pending a preliminary court hearing. A video posted online showed one of them referring to the migrants in terminology used for livestock and urging members of the public to round up migrants.</p><p>Across the border in Turkey\u2019s Canakkale province, strong winds fanned a wildfire for a second day. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said winds reaching 70 kilometers (40 miles) per hour at times were hampering efforts to extinguish the blaze but said firefighters had managed to halt its spread.</p><p>\u201cHopefully, we will get it under control soon,\u201d Erdogan said in a televised address.</p><p>Ibrahim Yumakli, Turkey\u2019s forestry minister, said firefighting teams and more than two dozen fire-dousing planes and helicopters had largely blocked the blaze from spreading beyond the 15 square kilometers (5.8 square miles) it had already affected.</p><p>Authorities suspended maritime traffic through the narrow Dardanelles Strait linking the Aegean Sea to the Sea of Marmara, which the water-dropping aircraft were using to refill, the minister said.</p><p>Authorities evacuated an elderly care home and more than 1,250 people from nine villages and closed down a highway. Hospitals treated more than 80 people for the effects of smoke.</p><p>Erdogan urged citizens to exercise care and help prevent wildfires.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, more than 90% of fires in our country are caused by humans,\" he said. \"Negligence or carelessness lead to great disasters.\"</p><p>In Tenerife in Spain's Canary Islands, authorities said a wildfire burning for more than a week was nearly under control after scorching 150 square kilometers (58 square miles).</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very tough battle that the firefighting teams are winning,\u201d said Canary regional government counselor Manuel Miranda.</p><p>Spain is sweltering under its fourth heat wave this summer. The country's weather service said up to 16 temperature records for August were broken Tuesday.</p><p>Sporadic fires were also reported in Italy, which has been engulfed in a heat wave expected to extend into the weekend with temperatures above 38 degrees Celsius (100 F) in many cities.</p><p>With their hot, dry summers, southern European countries are particularly prone to wildfires.</p><p>European Union officials have blamed <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/climate-change\">climate change</url> for the increasing frequency and intensity of <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/hot-summer-climate-change-el-nino-9c5151f2fca2cd77d92a1c7bc61a0035\">wildfires in Europe</url>, noting that 2022 was the second-worst year for wildfire damage on record after 2017.</p><p>___</p><p>Kantouris reported from Alexandroupolis.

Melinda Adams instead is pulled toward the term pyromantic - a lover of \"good fire\" for the benefits it can bring to people, communities and the environment as a whole.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Langston Hughes Assistant Professor in Indigenous Studies &amp; Geography &amp; Atmospheric Science at the University of Kansas, Adams extols the benefits of cultural or ceremonial fire in a new paper she has co-written for the journal Ecopsychology.</p><p>Adams collaborated on the paper, titled \"Solastalgia to Soliphilia: Cultural Fire, Climate Change, and Indigenous Healing,\" with Erica Tom, instructor in English at the Santa Rosa (Calif.) Junior College, and Ron Goode, honorable chairman of California's North Fork Mono Tribe. They detail the benefits to university students and community members who took part in a series of ceremonial burns on Indigenous lands in California that they organized as part of ongoing community-based participatory research project in partnership with the University of California-Davis (where Adams obtained her doctorate) and the Southwest Climate Adaptation Science Center.</p><p>The researchers wrote that by taking part in a ceremonial burn (the term Goode and Adams both use) a few acres at a time -- usually through pile burning or grass burning for the restoration of culturally significant plants -- and guided by traditional environmental knowledge, the participants shifted in significant ways from the \"Solastalgia\" of the paper's title -- a word coined by Australian philosopher Glenn Albrecht for looming environmental dread -- to \"Soliphilia,\" defined as a heightened state of environmental awareness and concern, which the authors say also engenders feelings of control.</p><p>\"Whether you are a Native person that's learning about fire, an allied person that's wanting to learn about the presence of Indigenous peoples and our land stewardship and climate solutions, or community members that care about the places that we all live and work in and hopefully all care about, there's a role for everybody in learning about good fire,\" Adams said.</p><p>As wildfires have grown larger and more frequent as the result of climate change, so, too, has the fear of them grown in the Western states.</p><p>\"We've had young people and students who experienced the Carr Fire or the Paradise fire, so they've lost their family homes or been affected in some way,\" Adams said. \"Or they were already afraid of fire from engrained ideas that all fire is bad fire. So students participated in the ceremonial burn demonstrations to learn an Indigenous perspective of not running from fire but working with it as a land stewardship tool. The experience is powerful as a healing concept. ... There's growing interest in cultural fire because it's a mitigation tool that people are starting to educate themselves about. These are practices that we have held onto, as Indigenous peoples, since time immemorial.\"</p><p>Adams studies and leads cultural/ceremonial fire from an Indigenous lens and invites others to learn from traditional practices, with Indigenous peoples always leading these demonstrations. She says her eco-cultural work serves to reiterate what Indigenous communities have always known: Through close connections with lands and waters, and scientific observation over time, there are numerous benefits to purposely lit cultural fire.</p><p>\"In addition to the cultural-social effects of cultural fire, I also study the soil effects of cultural fire, of native fire, and its potential for carbon storage -- everybody's raving about carbon storage with climate effects - and I also talk about the water-holding capacity that good fire invites to soilscapes,\" Adams said.</p><p>The authors wrote that the benefits of \"placing fire on the land\" can be expanded from an individual to an environmental level as participants in programs like the one Adams helped lead in California take the lessons they've learned into their careers in the field.</p><p>Adams, who joined KU's faculty in spring 2023, led her first ceremonial burn at the KU Field Station in March. She looks forward to more, working with tribes, nearby Haskell Indian Nations University (of which Adams is also an alumna), faculty and community members and Indigenous peoples in the Midwest.</p><p>\"That's part of my work in trying to widen the scope of good fire,\" Adams said. \"We say good fire, meaning it's purposeful, it has an ecological, cultural or social benefit that it's bringing, as opposed to catastrophic wildfire, forest fire, which in most of us it's ingrained to be dangerous and something to stay away from. ... Not all fire is bad fire.\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>The University of Kansas is a major comprehensive research and teaching university.

They are wrong about everything. In response to this remarkable inability, political operatives diligently rewrite the history under the guise of adjusting the data. </p><p><br/><br/>The old ways were grossly inaccurate. Things we did 50 or 100 years ago (sometimes just a few years ago) were just wrong, and now that we can see this, we're fixing it. Note that first, this never applies to the failures of communism, whose path is paved with historical adjustments, and second - their changes ALWAYS advanced the approved narrative. <br/> Their predictions suddenly garner a patina of truth. <br/> We saw this earlier this year after F. Joe Biden took office. Official US Forest Fire[1] wildfire Data was adjusted so that the immediately visible history showed a dramatic escalation of fires. The actual data showed the opposite at best and at worst no discernible trend. Fearmongering Climate Cultists couldn't let that stand, so they burned 57 years of unnecessary data 'acreage'[2] and hid the evidence. <br/> History is rewritten by the stealers of elections, and the not-so-old adage must now go. And they've come for tornadoes. <br/> Until recently, the data on strong tornadoes - the ones that are the best documented and difficult to 'miss' looked like this. <br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://granitegrok.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/EF3-EF5-Strong-Tornadoes.pngEF3-EF5\">https://granitegrok.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/EF3-EF5-Strong-Tornadoes.pngEF3-EF5</url> Strong Tornadoes US <br/><br/> The trend is going in the wrong direction. Climate chaos is not well served, which has made the severe weather sadists unhappy and the 'experts' whose budgets and grant funding rely on the narrative. So, NOAA stepped in to help. <br/> You can no longer find this old saw. The new data looks like this. <br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://granitegrok.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/New-tornado-chart.png\">https://granitegrok.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/New-tornado-chart.png</url><br/><br/> Wait, Steve, this looks like it's all tornados, not just strong ones. Fair enough, but that's because I can't find the strong tornado data anymore, and neither could the source at WUWT[3]. It's gone.

According to news reporting originating from Tehran, Iran, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"As a result of climate change, climatic catastrophes, such as wildfires, are likely to increase. Wildfires continue to occur frequently and spread with greater intensity due to extreme weather conditions.\" </p><p><br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from University of Tehran: \"In recent years, explosive fire growths have been reported in the United States, Australia, and other parts of the world. A combination of climate change and human activity has caused the semi-arid forestry areas in Iran's northern provinces to become more desiccated, leading to an increase in wildfires. The accuracy of the resulting fire susceptibility maps (FSMs) will directly be related to the performance of the method classifier. In this study, we use an ensemble classifier to model the FSM for a selected forestry case study area in one of the northern provinces of this country. Therefore, FSM is generated based on established criteria using the ensemble model. With Decision Trees, K nearest neighbor, and Logistic Regression, the ensemble model was created using the soft-voting method. A forest fire inventory data is created based on data collected over five years using GPS and the MODIS thermal anomalies product for training and testing the applied approach.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The K-fold method was used for validation, and the resulting FSM was validated using five accuracy assessment metrics. The best result from the area under the curve (AUC) yields 93% for fold 9, and the mean AUC for ten folds yields 88%.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Ensembling of Decision Trees, Knn, And Logistic Regression With Soft-voting Method For Wildfire Susceptibility Mapping.

He has pledged to limit deforestation to 140,000 hectares (about 346,000 acres) a year by creating economic alternatives to deforestation and cutting deals with Amazonian communities.</p><p>He also called on   the conservation of the Amazon, the world's largest rainforest, by contributing money and cancelling debt in South America, thereby freeing up funds to invest in environmental initiatives.</p><p>But Petro's anti-deforestation campaign has been bolstered by parallel efforts from the EMC, which has ordered a logging ban in the parts of the Amazon under their control.</p><p>In May 2022, the EMC announced sanctions of 1 million Colombian pesos, or $251, for every hectare of forest destroyed.</p><p>It imposed new rules in September, following Petro's August inauguration, that went even further, according to Juanita Velez, co-founder of the Conflict Responses Foundation.</p><p>The EMC ordered the new ban to last through Petro's four-year term, during which the government is expected to provide 'long-term solutions' for landless farmers in the Amazon.</p><p>A dirt road cuts through a section of the Amazon rainforest in the Caqueta province, Colombia [Christina Noriega/Al Jazeera]</p><p>The armed group is involved in ongoing negotiations with the Petro government, as part of the 'total peace' plan.

Talks between the EMC and the government resumed in July, in preparation for peace negotiations.</p><p>Those dialogues are taking place against the backdrop of low deforestation rates not seen since 2013. The country lost 123,517 hectares (about 305,000 acres) of forest in 2022,   compared to 2021. And in the Amazon, deforestation dropped by 36 percent.</p><p>Recent figures show that illegal logging decreased most dramatically in regions where the EMC has uncontested power, such as the Caqueta, Meta and Guaviare provinces.

Amid ongoing dialogues with the government, 40 Amazonian communities have also banned deforestation indefinitely.</p><p>But for the ban to last, the government needs to invest heavily in rural communities that have historically been neglected and provide them with economic alternatives, he argued.</p><p>'The communities are complying with the suspension of logging and fires,' Medina said.

Russian and Ukrainian shelling across the country overnight killed in at least six people, officials said. Separately, Moscow's second-largest airport briefly suspended flights early Sunday following a foiled drone attack near the Russian capital. Ukraine's air force said Russia launched 70 attack drones and missiles, including cruise missiles from aircraft over the Caspian Sea and Iranian-made, Shahed-136/131 strike UAVs. </p><p>Serhiy Tyurin, deputy head of Ukraine's Khmelnytsky region military administration, said three waves of missiles hit the Starokostiantyniv area, damaging several buildings and igniting a fire at a warehouse. The strike may have been intended for the city's airfield, officials said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the facilities of aircraft engine manufacturer Motor Sich in the Zaporizhzhia region had also come under attack. The Russian barrage came after a Ukrainian drone attack on a Russian tanker in the Black Sea near Crimea late Friday. Ukraine also struck a major Russian port with drones earlier the same day. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova condemned what she called a Ukrainian \"terrorist attack\" on a civilian vessel in the Kerch Strait. \"There can be no justification for such barbaric actions, they will not go unanswered and their authors and perpetrators will inevitably be punished,\" Zakharova posted on the Telegram messaging app. An official with Ukraine's Security Service confirmed to The Associated Press that a Ukrainian drone packed with 450 kilograms (992 pounds) of explosive the service struck the tanker that as transporting fuel for Russian forces. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. Russia's Federal Agency for Marine and River Transport posted on Telegram that although the drone blasted a hole in the tanker's engine room, there were no casualties among the 11 crew members. On Sunday, a Ukrainian missile hit the Chonhar bridge that connects the Russian-occupied Kherson region and northern Crimea. The strike caused minor damage to the bridge's roadway, said Vladimir Saldo, the Moscow-installed leader of the Kherson region. He also said that several more rockets had been shot down by air defense forces at the time of the attack. The bridge, which is one of three key road bridges connecting the Crimean peninsula to the mainland, was previously attacked on July 22 and 29. Two of the six fatalities overnight Sunday occurred during a Russian air strike in Ukraine's Kharkiv region, according to the head of the local regional military administration, Oleh Syniehubov. Another four people were injured. Zelenskyy said that a guided bomb had hit a blood transfusion center in the area's Kupyan district late on August 5. \"This war crime alone says everything about Russian aggression,\" Zelenskyy wrote on social media. \"Defeating terrorists is a matter of honor for everyone who values life.\" Heavy shelling continued along the frontline in Eastern Ukraine as Kyiv continues to push forward with its ongoing counteroffensive. Elsewhere in the Kharkiv region, a 58-year-old woman was killed and a 66-year-old man was hospitalized after Russian shelling of the village of Podoly, an official said. In Ukraine's eastern Kupyan region, Russian missiles injured a 55-year-old man and ignited a forest fire, officials said on social media. Russian attacks in the Donetsk region villages of Torske and Niu-York killed two people, local governor Pavlo Kyrylenko posted on social media. Ukrainian shelling in Russian-held Donetsk killed a woman in her eighties, the city's Moscow-appointed mayor Alexei Kulemzin said Sunday. The shelling also set the main building of a university on fire, according to the Moscow-installed head of the illegally annexed region, Denis Pushilin. Russia's Emergency Situations Ministry said that the blaze caused the building's roof to collapse, but that there were no casualties. Moscow's Vnukovo airport, located 15 kilometers (9 miles) southwest of the Russian capital, briefly suspended flights Sunday morning after a drone was shot down in the airspace around the city. The attack was one of four strikes on the Russian capital in the space of a month, spotlighting Moscow's vulnerability as Russia's war in Ukraine drags into its second year. The drone was destroyed by air defense systems in the Podolsk region of the Moscow suburbs, the Russian defense ministry said. The Russian defense ministry said no one was injured from the abortive drone attack, although Russian media outlet Baza later reported that a 77-year-old man suffered a shrapnel wound to his hand. The reports could not be independently verified. Ukrainian authorities, which generally avoid commenting on attacks on Russian soil, didn't say whether it launched the raid. Flights were last halted at the airport on July 30, when two drones crashed into the Moscow City business district after being jammed by Russian air defenses.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Workers install the Ukrainian coat of arms on the shield in the hand of the country's tallest stature, the Motherland Monument, after the Soviet coat of arms was removed, in Kyiv, Ukraine, Sunday, Aug. 6, 2023.

And that finally is a bit of a glimmer of hope for us.\u201d</p><p>Meanwhile, hundreds of fires continued to rage across British Columbia and 35,000 people were under evacuation orders Sunday.</p><p>\u201cIt is still very much dynamic,\u201d said Jerrad Schroeder, a British Columbia Wildfire Service chief. \u201cThere\u2019s still portions of this fire that we just have not prioritized.\u201d</p><p>The provincial government has issued a state of emergency and urged people not to travel for non-essential reasons to the central interior and southeast portions of the province due to \u201csignificant\u201d wildfire activity.</p><p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the approval of British Columbia\u2019s request for federal assistance and said the government was deploying assets from the Canadian Armed Forces to assist in evacuations. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to be here with whatever support is needed,\u201d he said on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p><p>Canada has seen a record number of wildfires this year that have also caused choking smoke in parts of the U.S. All told, there have been more than 5,700 fires, which have burned more than 137,000 square kilometers (53,000 square miles) from one end of Canada to the other, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. There are still more than 1,000 active fires in the country, according to the agency.</p><p>In northern Canada, firefighters continued to battle a blaze that threatened Yellowknife, the capital of the Northwest Territories.</p><p>Fire information officer Mike Westwick said the fire remained about 15 kilometers (nine miles) from the city, which was left virtually empty after nearly all of its 20,000 residents fled for safety.</p><p>\u201cEven as things dried out and fire behavior picked up, we were able to do some good suppression work form the air and limit the progression,\u201d he said at a media briefing Sunday night.</p><p>That blaze is one of 237 wildfires burning in the Northwest Territories.</p><p>In a Facebook post, Yellowknife officials said they were working with 20 contractors and 75 volunteers to establish wildfire defense lines around the city, such as fire breaks, water sprinklers and cannons, and aircraft dropping fire retardant. A protective line of 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) has been established.</p><p>\u201cWe are not out of the woods yet as many factors can change the status of a fire quickly,\u201d the post said.</p><p>Shane Thompson, the province's environment minister said the fire was \u201cunlikely to reach the outskirts of the community today or tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>In Hay River, evacuees could be looking at weeks before they can return home, Mayor Kandis Jameson said in a Sunday morning statement to the community\u2019s 3,800 residents. Warm, dry weather and steady winds are forecast for the upcoming week, she said.</p><p>In Fort Smith, southeast of Yellowknife and just north of the Alberta border, the town of about 2,600 remained under an evacuation order Sunday. Officials asked residents to stay away and urged anyone who remained behind to leave because a fire burning four kilometers (2.5 miles) away could be pushed toward the community.</p><p>\u201cEvery person that returns requires evacuation assistance if the fire enters the community. Please do not add additional strain to the already taxed support network in the community,\u201d Fort Smith Protective Services said in a social media post.</p><p>Officials said they could not predict when residents would be allowed to return to their homes.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a timeline at this point,\u201d said Jennifer Young, information officer for the Emergency Management Organization. \u201cWhen it\u2019s safe to do so we will look at our re-entering plan do it in a phased approach.\u201d</p><p>Despite the advances made by firefighters in the Lake Okanagan region, which includes Kelowna, a city of 150,000 people about 90 miles (150 kilometers) north of the U.S. border, fire chief Broland conceded that \u201csome may be coming back to nothing\u201d when evacuees are allowed to return.</p><p>\u201cSome of you have lost your homes. There\u2019s no question about that,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are lots of backyards where the fire has come right to your patio furniture. And it\u2019s been stopped there because of the work of the 500 people that are on the ground fighting. \u201d</p><p>In Lake Country, a community north of Kelowna, fire chief Darren Lee said Sunday that crews were moving out of the initial attack stage \u201cinto more sustained action\u201d on a fire near there. He also asked residents whose homes are not near the fire to leave their sprinklers off to save water for the firefighting effort.</p><p>Among those who fled as flames threatened their homes was Todd Ramsay. He recalled sitting on his deck in Kelowna\u2019s North Clifton area watching the fire rage on the other side of Lake Okanagan, about 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) away. He didn\u2019t think it would be possible for the flames to jump the lake, but they did.</p><p>\u201cSure enough, it started raining pine cones and tree bark,\u201d he said. A fire quickly started behind his house and there were \u201chuge plumes of smoke just carrying embers across the lake.\u201d Ramsay said he turned on a water sprinkler and he and his family packed up to flee Thursday night as trees were burning, wondering if they\u2019d see their home again.</p><p>By Saturday, Ramsay, his wife, two children, two cats and a dog had driven to North Vancouver to stay with his sister. Ramsay heard his house had not burned but didn\u2019t know for sure.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s definitely some anxiety around it.

And that finally is a bit of a glimmer of hope for us.\u201d</p><p>Meanwhile, hundreds of fires continued to rage across British Columbia and 35,000 people were under evacuation orders Sunday.</p><p>\u201cIt is still very much dynamic,\u201d said Jerrad Schroeder, a British Columbia Wildfire Service chief. \u201cThere\u2019s still portions of this fire that we just have not prioritized.\u201d</p><p>The provincial government has issued a state of emergency and urged people not to travel for non-essential reasons to the central interior and southeast portions of the province due to \u201csignificant\u201d wildfire activity.</p><p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the approval of British Columbia\u2019s request for federal assistance and said the government was deploying assets from the Canadian Armed Forces to assist in evacuations. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to be here with whatever support is needed,\u201d he said on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p><p>Canada has seen a record number of wildfires this year that have also caused choking smoke in parts of the U.S. All told, there have been more than 5,700 fires, which have burned more than 137,000 square kilometers (53,000 square miles) from one end of Canada to the other, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. There are still more than 1,000 active fires in the country, according to the agency.</p><p>In northern Canada, firefighters continued to battle a blaze that threatened Yellowknife, the capital of the Northwest Territories.</p><p>Fire information officer Mike Westwick said the fire remained about 15 kilometers (nine miles) from the city, which was left virtually empty after nearly all of its 20,000 residents fled for safety.</p><p>\u201cEven as things dried out and fire behavior picked up, we were able to do some good suppression work form the air and limit the progression,\u201d he said at a media briefing Sunday night.</p><p>That blaze is one of 237 wildfires burning in the Northwest Territories.</p><p>In a Facebook post, Yellowknife officials said they were working with 20 contractors and 75 volunteers to establish wildfire defense lines around the city, such as fire breaks, water sprinklers and cannons, and aircraft dropping fire retardant. A protective line of 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) has been established.</p><p>\u201cWe are not out of the woods yet as many factors can change the status of a fire quickly,\u201d the post said.</p><p>Shane Thompson, the province's environment minister said the fire was \u201cunlikely to reach the outskirts of the community today or tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>In Hay River, evacuees could be looking at weeks before they can return home, Mayor Kandis Jameson said in a Sunday morning statement to the community\u2019s 3,800 residents. Warm, dry weather and steady winds are forecast for the upcoming week, she said.</p><p>In Fort Smith, southeast of Yellowknife and just north of the Alberta border, the town of about 2,600 remained under an evacuation order Sunday. Officials asked residents to stay away and urged anyone who remained behind to leave because a fire burning four kilometers (2.5 miles) away could be pushed toward the community.</p><p>\u201cEvery person that returns requires evacuation assistance if the fire enters the community. Please do not add additional strain to the already taxed support network in the community,\u201d Fort Smith Protective Services said in a social media post.</p><p>Officials said they could not predict when residents would be allowed to return to their homes.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a timeline at this point,\u201d said Jennifer Young, information officer for the Emergency Management Organization. \u201cWhen it\u2019s safe to do so we will look at our re-entering plan do it in a phased approach.\u201d</p><p>Despite the advances made by firefighters in the Lake Okanagan region, which includes Kelowna, a city of 150,000 people about 90 miles (150 kilometers) north of the U.S. border, fire chief Broland conceded that \u201csome may be coming back to nothing\u201d when evacuees are allowed to return.</p><p>\u201cSome of you have lost your homes. There\u2019s no question about that,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are lots of backyards where the fire has come right to your patio furniture. And it\u2019s been stopped there because of the work of the 500 people that are on the ground fighting. \u201d</p><p>In Lake Country, a community north of Kelowna, fire chief Darren Lee said Sunday that crews were moving out of the initial attack stage \u201cinto more sustained action\u201d on a fire near there. He also asked residents whose homes are not near the fire to leave their sprinklers off to save water for the firefighting effort.</p><p>Among those who fled as flames threatened their homes was Todd Ramsay. He recalled sitting on his deck in Kelowna\u2019s North Clifton area watching the fire rage on the other side of Lake Okanagan, about 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) away. He didn\u2019t think it would be possible for the flames to jump the lake, but they did.</p><p>\u201cSure enough, it started raining pine cones and tree bark,\u201d he said. A fire quickly started behind his house and there were \u201chuge plumes of smoke just carrying embers across the lake.\u201d Ramsay said he turned on a water sprinkler and he and his family packed up to flee Thursday night as trees were burning, wondering if they\u2019d see their home again.</p><p>By Saturday, Ramsay, his wife, two children, two cats and a dog had driven to North Vancouver to stay with his sister. Ramsay heard his house had not burned but didn\u2019t know for sure.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s definitely some anxiety around it. Where we\u2019re going to stay, what we\u2019re going to do when we get back, if it\u2019s not there,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m an artist. I have a lot of my paintings there. The more important thing obviously is all of us are safe. But we\u2019ve worked hard our whole lives to have this home.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Haigh reported from Norwich, Connecticut.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-2450568b1db8152ad8f39b8197df321b20230821</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:690D-TGV1-JC5B-G1H5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1078\"/><timeReceived>11:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 21, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Georgia Tech scientists and researchers are watching closely.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wildfires themselves aren't uncommon. But whatis different and, at times, dangerous is the number of particles in the air.</p><p>\"It is unusual to experience high concentrations of smoke aerosols within the contiguous U.S. such as what we have been observing recently,\" said Zachary Handlos, meteorologist and senior academic professional in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciencesat Georgia Tech.</p><p>The federal government, via AirNow.gov, updates air quality data in real time. This map from Tuesday shows dangerous levels of fine particulates in the air around Atlanta.</p><p>Fine particulate matter (also known as PM2.5) levels exceeded 55 micrograms per cubic meter of air south of Atlanta. This is the reason for the recent air quality alerts, which indicated that the air quality in metro Atlanta sat in the orange zone Monday and Tuesday, meaning the air has been potentially hazardous for the most at-risk people.</p><p>Older persons, pregnant women, young children, and anyone with preexisting health conditions are among the most vulnerable populations. However, anyone can be affected by poor air quality.</p><p>PM2.5 is fine enough to penetrate deep into the lungs,\" said Talat Odman, principal research engineer and air quality expert from the Georgia Tech School of Civil and Environmental Engineering.</p><p>Both Odman and Handlos say an N95 mask can be a big help in filtering out this particulate matter.</p><p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wildfire smoke is dangerous because it contains higher levels of particles that can irritate the eyes, invade and harm the respiratory system, and worsen existing heart and lung diseases.</p><p>Handlos explained that there's a specific weather pattern helping to create the conditions necessary for all this smoke to travel such far distances.</p><p>\"Within the past few days, a large-scale trough feature in the upper troposphere moved through the eastern U.S., which has led to a shift in upper-level winds out of the Northwest,\" he said.\"This allows for the transport of smoke from Southwestern Canada southeastward all the way into our region.\"</p><p>This same weather pattern has been bringing the smoke from these Canadian wildfires to other cities across the U.S. including Minneapolis, Washington, D.C., and New York. This week has been the first time the smoke has made it so far south.</p><p>We see this same type of atmospheric conditions during other parts of the year in Atlanta.</p><p>\"Remember the freezing temperatures in Atlanta back in December?\" asked Odman. \"Similar to those days when air masses coming from Canada brought extremely cold temperatures here, they are bringing smoke from wildfires in Canada now.\"</p><p>This map from colleagues at the University of Wisconsin shows how wind flow and speed from the jet stream can carry smoke from Canada thousands of miles south toward Atlanta.</p><p>As Handlos explains, the summer heat and climate change are only working to complicate an already tenuous atmospheric environment.</p><p>Aerosols, like the smoke from a wildfire or from synthetic air pollutants, serve as surfaces to which water vapor molecules can attach. These tiny cloud droplets suspend in the air and create the hazy conditions that have been occurring in Atlanta.</p><p>\"With global climate change, regions experiencing an increase in temperature could become more susceptible to increased ozone concentration, a pollutant common in cities, as well as smoke blown in by wildfires, which are expected to occur more frequently,\" said Handlos.</p><p>Warmer regions are also seeing less rainfall, which puts them at greater risk for wildfires, perpetuating the cycle. This means regions with poor air quality may observe even worse air quality as a result.</p><p>Handlos says climate change models only seem to point to an increased probability of heat waves or warmer-than-average conditions. While the current situation is due to the Canadian wildfires, Handlos says wildfires are generally likely to happen more often due to global climate change.</p><p>\"There is an increase in the frequency and severity of fire events throughout the world. We should expect more events like this when smoke from fires in western U.S. and Canada pollute the air in Atlanta,\" Odman concurred.</p><p>But can anything be done to make the situation better? The answer is complicated. Georgia Tech researchers have been working on ways to capture and clean air pollutants and to determine certain days where it may be best to adjust which power plants were operating in specific parts of the state in an effort to control emissions.</p><p>\"There aren't great strategies for eliminating the forest fire haze that reaches Georgia,\" explained Valerie Thomas, the Anderson-Interface Chair of Natural Systems and professor in the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Tech.</p><p>But, she says, air pollution created by cars and trucks in major metropolitan areas like Atlanta is only compounded by conditions like the wildfire smoke we've been seeing.</p><p>\"Staying inside and not driving on days with poor air quality will reduce exposure to air pollution and reduce emissions,\" said Thomas.</p><p>As shared by the New York Times from data supplied by the AirNow.gov, Atlanta still has the worst air quality in the entire country as of Thursday, July 19.

And that finally is a bit of a glimmer of hope for us.\u201d</p><p>Meanwhile, hundreds of fires continued to rage across British Columbia and 35,000 people were under evacuation orders Sunday.</p><p>\u201cIt is still very much dynamic,\u201d said Jerrad Schroeder, a British Columbia Wildfire Service chief. \u201cThere\u2019s still portions of this fire that we just have not prioritized.\u201d</p><p>The provincial government has issued a state of emergency and urged people not to travel for non-essential reasons to the central interior and southeast portions of the province due to \u201csignificant\" wildfire activity.</p><p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the approval of British Columbia\u2019s request for federal assistance and said the government was deploying assets from the Canadian Armed Forces to assist in evacuations. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to be here with whatever support is needed,\u201d he said on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p><p>Canada has seen a record number of wildfires this year that have also caused choking smoke in parts of the U.S. All told, there have been more than 5,700 fires, which have burned more than 137,000 square kilometers (53,000 square miles) from one end of Canada to the other, according to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ciffc.ca/\">Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.</url> There are still more than 1,000 active fires in the country, according to the agency.</p><p>Meanwhile, firefighters were working Sunday to keep blazes at bay near the capital of Canada's Northwest Territories, where forecasters warned that drier and windier weather was coming.</p><p>The break that firefighters defending Yellowknife got from milder weather and a small amount of rain was expected to end, as temperatures were forecast to climb higher. Officials had managed to keep the flames from advancing closer than 15 kilometers (nine miles) to the city, left virtually empty <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/canada-wildfires-northwest-territories-7b8c327876d86a483c8e25df7bc2c566\">when nearly all of its 20,000 residents fled for safety.</url></p><p>That blaze is one of 237 wildfires burning in the Northwest Territories.</p><p>In a Facebook post, Yellowknife officials said they were working with 20 contractors and 75 volunteers to establish wildfire defense lines around the city, such as fire breaks, water sprinklers and cannons, and aircraft dropping fire retardant. A protective line of 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) has been established.</p><p>\u201cWe are not out of the woods yet as many factors can change the status of a fire quickly,\u201d the post said.</p><p>In Hay River, evacuees could be looking at weeks before they can return home, Mayor Kandis Jameson said in a Sunday morning statement to the community's 3,800 residents. Warm, dry weather and steady winds are forecast for the upcoming week, she said.</p><p>In Fort Smith, southeast of Yellowknife and just north of the Alberta border, the town of about 2,600 remained under an evacuation order Sunday. Officials asked residents to stay away and urged anyone who remained behind to leave because a fire burning four kilometers (2.5 miles) away could be pushed toward the community.</p><p>\u201cEvery person that returns requires evacuation assistance if the fire enters the community. Please do not add additional strain to the already taxed support network in the community,\" Fort Smith Protective Services said in a social media post.</p><p>Despite the advances made by firefighters in the Lake Okanagan region, which includes Kelowna, a city of 150,000 people about 90 miles (150 kilometers) north of the U.S. border, fire chief Broland conceded that \"some may be coming back to nothing\u201d when evacuees are allowed to return.</p><p> \u201cSome of you have lost your homes. There\u2019s no question about that,\" he said. \"There are lots of backyards where the fire has come right to your patio furniture. And it\u2019s been stopped there because of the work of the 500 people that are on the ground fighting. \u201d</p><p>In Lake Country, a community north of Kelowna, fire chief Darren Lee said Sunday that crews were moving out of the initial attack stage \u201cinto more sustained action\u201d on a fire near there. He also asked residents whose homes are not near the fire to leave their sprinklers off to save water for the firefighting effort.</p><p>Among those who fled as flames threatened their homes was Todd Ramsay. He recalled sitting on his deck in Kelowna\u2019s North Clifton area watching the fire rage on the other side of Lake Okanagan, about 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) away. He didn't think it would be possible for the flames to jump the lake, but they did.</p><p>\u201cSure enough, it started raining pine cones and tree bark,\" he said. A fire quickly started behind his house and there were \"huge plumes of smoke just carrying embers across the lake.\u201d Ramsay said he turned on a water sprinkler and he and his family packed up to flee Thursday night as trees were burning, wondering if they'd see their home again.</p><p>By Saturday, Ramsay, his wife, two children, two cats and a dog had driven to North Vancouver to stay with his sister. Ramsay heard his house had not burned but didn't know for sure.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s definitely some anxiety around it. Where we\u2019re going to stay, what we\u2019re going to do when we get back, if it\u2019s not there,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m an artist. I have a lot of my paints there. The more important thing obviously is all of us are safe. But we\u2019ve worked hard our whole lives to have this home.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Haigh reported from Norwich, Connecticut.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-2450568b1db8152ad8f39b8197df321b20230820</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6908-D1X1-DYMD-63CT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1007\"/><timeReceived>11:24 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 20, 2023 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But it is riveting, with a subject who's a gift to anyone hoping to make history come alive for readers: a leader who was not only a Ku Klux Klan kingpin but also a sexual deviate, public drunk, family deserter, white supremacist, serial abuser and, possibly, a cannibal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He's D.C. Stephenson and he's vile in such compelling and varied ways that it's hard to believe Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro didn't make an Oscar-winning movie about him in the 1970s.</p><p>The Texas native rose to prominence when he left his first family to move to Indianapolis, where his Grand Dragon-ship established the 97% white Hoosier state as the one with the highest per capita Klan membership. In a few years in the 1920s, he also acquired a yacht, forgot about a child, bought off numerous statewide officials, plotted a presidential run and almost got away with murder.</p><p>It's easy to imagine \"A Fever in the Heartland\" as an Erik Larson-style popular history, following two threads that eventually intertwine. Stephenson would be one thread and the other would be Madge Oberholtzer, who is referred to in the book's subtitle, \"The Ku Klux Klan's Plot to Take Over America, and the Woman Who Stopped Them.\"</p><p>If \"Heartland\" has a flaw, it's that the subtitle exaggerates the agency of Oberholtzer. But Egan's book doesn't overstate her role the way, say, Larson's \"Thunderstruck\" overstated the link between Guglielmo Marconi and murderer Hawley Crippen. Egan lets the characters emerge organically - we don't even meet Oberholtzer until \"Fever\" is half over - and his book, part rise-and-fall story and part courtroom drama, is stronger for it.</p><p>Egan, whose other histories include \"The Worst Hard Time\" (Dust Bowl) and \"The Big Burn\" (devastating forest fire), is a brilliant researcher and lucid writer. He packs \"Fever\" with details. Some are revelatory, such as that the KKK loved Prohibition, campaigning for it and officially considering booze un-American, despite Stephenson's public binges. And some are incidental, such as Walgreens soaring through the 1920s by becoming de facto liquor stores, which \"prescribed\" hooch. Or that female Klan members were given cones to place under their hoods, so their hairdos wouldn't get wrecked.</p><p>\"Fever\" is particularly sharp on how Stephenson recognized that the way to succeed in Indiana and elsewhere was to draw churches to the KKK's side, through messaging and direct payoffs. Indiana Christians were willing to overlook the worst of the Klan even though, as Egan wryly notes, \"instead of love thy neighbor, these Klansmen hated many a neighbor.\"</p><p>Egan is also great at depicting the context of the KKK's rise, with phenomena such as the Harlem Renaissance and the popularity of Jewish songwriters on Tin Pan Alley threatening bigots and with Stephenson unpunished for repeatedly injuring women because they probably \"had it coming.\"</p><p>The author treads lightly on parallels between 1920s Indiana and our present day. But in the closing chapters, it's clear that one reason Egan wrote this book is because the appalling KKK rhetoric sounds so much like what we hear on news channels and in Congress right now.</p><p>Chris Hewitt is a Star Tribune critic and features writer.</p><p>A Fever in the Heartland</p><p>By: Timothy Egan.</p><p>Publisher: Viking, 432 pages, $30.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRIB-MERLIN70380657</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRIB2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67XJ-HTN1-DYRH-900F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8384</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"576\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Star Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN)</publicationName><edition>METRO EDITION</edition><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"04\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>April 2, 2023 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>BOOK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>REVIEW</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLVG</classCode><className>WHITE NATIONALISTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001444</classCode><className>RACE &amp; ETHNICITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001644</classCode><className>SUBSTANCE ABUSE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009IR9</classCode><className>ENTERTAINMENT &amp; ARTS AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST00099LP</classCode><className>CHRISTIANS &amp; CHRISTIANITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DHZP</classCode><className>ACADEMY AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009IR9</classCode><className>ENTERTAINMENT &amp; ARTS AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DHZP</classCode><className>ACADEMY AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>N445300CC</classCode><className>BEER, WINE &amp; LIQUOR STORES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>PE0009X4C</classCode><className>ROBERT DE NIRO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GX560</classCode><className>INDIANAPOLIS, IN, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GS130</classCode><className>INDIANA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The technology aims to reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the planet's surface. This could be achieved by pumping aerosols into the high atmosphere or by whitening clouds. <br/>The Overshoot Commission is talking about solar geoengineering. Not everyone thinks it should[1] <br/>Its proponents say it could be a relatively cheap and fast way to counter extreme heat. But it would only temporarily mask the impact of rising emissions, not tackle the root cause. The regional effects of manipulating the weather are hard to predict and risk worsening climate impacts in some places. <br/>The report acknowledged the technology's potential drawbacks, but refused to take the option off the table. 'It would be imprudent not to investigate or discuss SRM because present evidence suggests the possibility it could complement other approaches,' the Commission wrote. <br/>During a press conference, its president Pascal Lamy said appeals not to discuss solar geoengineering 'feel fickle' and 'not the way to go'. <br/>A fractured debate <br/>Scientists Climate Home News were divided on the wisdom of this approach. <br/>'The report creates a sort of parity between acknowledging the need for emission reductions and elevating technologically uncertain or even dangerous management options,' said Ben Sanderson, a climate scientist at CICERO. 'By expanding research, the idea of SRM gets increasingly normalised, while distracting from real climate mitigation'. <br/>James Haywood, Professor of Atmospheric Science at the University of Exeter, argued the Commission struck a reasonable balance between risks and opportunities. 'Current conventional mitigation efforts are widely acknowledged to be insufficient to maintain global mean climate temperatures below 1.5C,' he said. 'It therefore makes a great deal of sense to research whether SRM proposals could be used to reduce the worst impacts of climate change.' <br/>'No stone unturned' <br/>Hosted by the Paris Peace Forum, the commission comprises 13 global leaders, including former presidents and ministers. <br/>Its president Pascal Lamy said'we have to leave no stone unturned', as the world is on track to exceed the 1.5C goal set by the Paris Agreement. Temperature rises of up to 2.6C can be expected based on current climate plans, according to the UN's global stocktake report released[3] last week. <br/>As efforts to reduce emissions fall short, geoengineering options become increasingly tempting. Most are highly speculative and there are no global rules on what countries or companies can do. <br/>A rogue SRM experiment conducted[4] by a US startup in Mexico's northern state of Baja California led the government to announce a ban on solar geoengineering. <br/>Moratorium calls <br/>The Commission said countries should introduce a moratorium on 'the deployment or large-scale experiments' of SRM. The ban should apply to any activity with 'risk of significant transboundary harm' and should stay in place until the scientific community gains a better understanding of the technology. <br/>Chukwumerije Okereke, professor of Global Climate Governance and Public Policy at Bristol University, argues the moratorium is poorly defined and calls for a total pause on experiments. 'What does large-scale mean? This could lead to rogue researchers making a test at a time when we don't even know the full effects,' he added. 'This is not a position that is ethical, sensible and recognises the dangers.' <br/>G20 leaders strike renewables deal, stall on fossil fuels[5] <br/>Many scientists are concerned[6] SRM could create damage the ozone layer or inequally distribute extreme weather events like droughts or flooding across the world. <br/>There are also questions about how long this technology would be needed and what happens after it is stopped. Ben Sanderson says early modelling indicates that cessation could fast-track severe disruption, with the potential to experience decades' worth of changes in a year. 'We would live in a high-risk world,' he added. <br/>Moral hazard <br/>Central to the geoengineering debate is the so-called moral hazard argument: the idea that researching technologies to remove CO2 or mask its effects undermines support for existing climate policies. <br/>The Commission says the priority is to accelerate emission cuts by replacing fossil fuels and transitioning to clean energy. It also says technologies like SRM and carbon removal should only be seen as additional measures. <br/>Laurence Tubiana, one of the commission's members, tweeted that 'we cannot be fooled by the false promises of simple techno-fix solutions'. <br/>The Climate Overshoot Commission, an independent high-level political group, launched its report on potential approaches to address overshoot Our main takeaway: climate change impacts the most vulnerable &amp; equitably accelerating deep emissions cuts remains the utmost priority 1/5 <br/>\u2014 Laurence Tubiana (@LaurenceTubiana) September 14, 2023[7] <br/>But Carl-Friedrich Schleussner, a scientist at Climate Analytics, believes simply putting the option on the table relieves pressure from the obligation to reduce emissions. 'Giving it a prominent space on the agenda has a negative effect,' he said. <br/>Carbon removal push <br/>Alongside SRM, the Commission pushed for a faster development of carbon dioxide removal (CDR). The term comprises a vast number of methods to remove CO2 from the atmosphere: from natural activities like tree planting to technological ones such as direct air capture. <br/>The report says governments should promote a rapid expansion of 'higher quality CDR at scale' by incentivising innovation, including through subsidies. <br/>UN says more needed 'on all fronts' to meet climate goals[3] <br/>The use of CDR is the subject of much debate in the climate policy world. Activities like tree planting need vast swathes of land and carry the risk of releasing pollutants back into the atmosphere in case of a forest fire. <br/>Direct air capture is energy hungry and expensive at the moment. <br/>The International Energy Agency estimates[8] that removing a ton of carbon dioxide costs between $135 and $135 with DAC today - although this could drop to below $100 by 2030. <br/>According to the IPCC scientists, this is far more expensive[9] than reducing emissions with renewable energy or energy efficiency. <br/>The post Overshoot Commission calls for research into solar geoengineering[10] appeared first on Climate Home News[11]. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.climatechangenews\">https://www.climatechangenews</url> .com/2023/06/12/overshoot-commission-solar-radiation-management/ [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.overshootcommission.org/_files/ugd/0c3b70_bab3b3c1cd394745b387a594c9a68e2b.pdf\">https://www.overshootcommission.org/_files/ugd/0c3b70_bab3b3c1cd394745b387a594c9a68e2b.pdf</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.climatechangenews.com/2023/09/08/un-report-climate-plans-inufficient-global-stocktake/\">https://www.climatechangenews.com/2023/09/08/un-report-climate-plans-inufficient-global-stocktake/</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.climatechangenews.com/2023/01/18/mexico-plans-to-ban-solar-geoengineering-after-rogue-experiment/\">https://www.climatechangenews.com/2023/01/18/mexico-plans-to-ban-solar-geoengineering-after-rogue-experiment/</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.climatechangenews.com/2023/09/09/g20-leaders-strike-renewables-deal-stall-on-fossil-fuels/\">https://www.climatechangenews.com/2023/09/09/g20-leaders-strike-renewables-deal-stall-on-fossil-fuels/</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/41903/one_atmosphere.pdf?sequence=3&amp;isAllowed=y\">https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/41903/one_atmosphere.pdf?sequence=3&amp;isAllowed=y</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/LaurenceTubiana/status/1702263141101346913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">https://twitter.com/LaurenceTubiana/status/1702263141101346913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw</url> [ 8]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/direct-air-capture-2022/executive-summary\">https://www.iea.org/reports/direct-air-capture-2022/executive-summary</url> [ 9]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_SummaryForPolicymakers.pdf\">https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_SummaryForPolicymakers.pdf</url> [ 10]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.climatechangenews.com/2023/09/14/overshoot-commission-calls-for-research-into-solar-geoengineering/\">https://www.climatechangenews.com/2023/09/14/overshoot-commission-calls-for-research-into-solar-geoengineering/</url> [ 11]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.climatechangenews.com\">https://www.climatechangenews.com</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.climatechangenews.com/2023/09/14/overshoot-commission-calls-for-research-into-solar-geoengineering/\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-RTCC120099169471117540925876100203</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RTCC-120099</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:695M-T4T1-JCMN-Y0SC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567517</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1357\"/><timeReceived>5:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

According to news reporting from the University of Science and Technology of China by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Fire emission is a major source of atmospheric nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO2 + NO), accounting for a large part of global NOx emission, which profoundly changes atmosphere physicochemical property and impacts human society.\" </p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from University of Science and Technology of China: \"An effective evaluation of these impacts relies on accurate NOx fire emission estimation. In this article, we developed a full top-down NOx fire emission dataset for northeastern Asia based on the satellite-derived emission coefficient (EC) and fire radiative power (FRP) density. In the dataset, daily NOx fire emissions during 2012-2019 were estimated at 1\u00b0x1\u00b0 resolution across northeastern Asia, which can be used as fundamental input data in driving climate and weather models, and can be applied to investigate the characteristic of fire emission, fire-climate interaction, air pollution and human health effect.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"As a full top-down emission dataset, it can also serve as a reference for other existing emission inventories that are mostly based on bottom-up approaches.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Dataset of top-down nitrogen oxides fire emission estimation in northeastern Asia.

And that finally is a bit of a glimmer of hope for us.\u201d</p><p>Meanwhile, hundreds of fires continued to rage across British Columbia and 35,000 people were under evacuation orders Sunday.</p><p>\u201cIt is still very much dynamic,\u201d said Jerrad Schroeder, a British Columbia Wildfire Service chief. \u201cThere\u2019s still portions of this fire that we just have not prioritized.\u201d</p><p>The provincial government has issued a state of emergency and urged people not to travel for non-essential reasons to the central interior and southeast portions of the province due to \u201csignificant\" wildfire activity.</p><p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the approval of British Columbia\u2019s request for federal assistance and said the government was deploying assets from the Canadian Armed Forces to assist in evacuations. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to be here with whatever support is needed,\u201d he said on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p><p>Canada has seen a record number of wildfires this year that have also caused choking smoke in parts of the U.S. All told, there have been more than 5,700 fires, which have burned more than 137,000 square kilometers (53,000 square miles) from one end of Canada to the other, according to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ciffc.ca/\">Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.</url> There are still more than 1,000 active fires in the country, according to the agency.</p><p>Meanwhile, firefighters were working Sunday to keep blazes at bay near the capital of Canada's Northwest Territories, where forecasters warned that drier and windier weather was coming.</p><p>The break that firefighters defending Yellowknife got from milder weather and a small amount of rain was expected to end, as temperatures were forecast to climb higher. Officials had managed to keep the flames from advancing closer than 15 kilometers (nine miles) to the city, left virtually empty <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/canada-wildfires-northwest-territories-7b8c327876d86a483c8e25df7bc2c566\">when nearly all of its 20,000 residents fled for safety.</url></p><p>That blaze is one of 237 wildfires burning in the Northwest Territories.</p><p>In a Facebook post, Yellowknife officials said they were working with 20 contractors and 75 volunteers to establish wildfire defense lines around the city, such as fire breaks, water sprinklers and cannons, and aircraft dropping fire retardant. A protective line of 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) has been established.</p><p>\u201cWe are not out of the woods yet as many factors can change the status of a fire quickly,\u201d the post said.</p><p>In Hay River, evacuees could be looking at weeks before they can return home, Mayor Kandis Jameson said in a Sunday morning statement to the community's 3,800 residents. Warm, dry weather and steady winds are forecast for the upcoming week, she said.</p><p>In Fort Smith, southeast of Yellowknife and just north of the Alberta border, the town of about 2,600 remained under an evacuation order Sunday. Officials asked residents to stay away and urged anyone who remained behind to leave because a fire burning four kilometers (2.5 miles) away could be pushed toward the community.</p><p>\u201cEvery person that returns requires evacuation assistance if the fire enters the community. Please do not add additional strain to the already taxed support network in the community,\" Fort Smith Protective Services said in a social media post.</p><p>Despite the advances made by firefighters in the Lake Okanagan region, which includes Kelowna, a city of 150,000 people about 90 miles (150 kilometers) north of the U.S. border, fire chief Broland conceded that \"some may be coming back to nothing\u201d when evacuees are allowed to return.</p><p> \u201cSome of you have lost your homes. There\u2019s no question about that,\" he said. \"There are lots of backyards where the fire has come right to your patio furniture. And it\u2019s been stopped there because of the work of the 500 people that are on the ground fighting. \u201d</p><p>In Lake Country, a community north of Kelowna, fire chief Darren Lee said Sunday that crews were moving out of the initial attack stage \u201cinto more sustained action\u201d on a fire near there. He also asked residents whose homes are not near the fire to leave their sprinklers off to save water for the firefighting effort.</p><p>Among those who fled as flames threatened their homes was Todd Ramsay. He recalled sitting on his deck in Kelowna\u2019s North Clifton area watching the fire rage on the other side of Lake Okanagan, about 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) away. He didn't think it would be possible for the flames to jump the lake, but they did.</p><p>\u201cSure enough, it started raining pine cones and tree bark,\" he said. A fire quickly started behind his house and there were \"huge plumes of smoke just carrying embers across the lake.\u201d Ramsay said he turned on a water sprinkler and he and his family packed up to flee Thursday night as trees were burning, wondering if they'd see their home again.</p><p>By Saturday, Ramsay, his wife, two children, two cats and a dog had driven to North Vancouver to stay with his sister. Ramsay heard his house had not burned but didn't know for sure.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s definitely some anxiety around it. Where we\u2019re going to stay, what we\u2019re going to do when we get back, if it\u2019s not there,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m an artist. I have a lot of my paints there. The more important thing obviously is all of us are safe. But we\u2019ve worked hard our whole lives to have this home.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Haigh reported from Norwich, Connecticut.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-2450568b1db8152ad8f39b8197df321b20230820</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6908-D281-DYMD-63P3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1008\"/><timeReceived>11:24 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 20, 2023 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news originating from Hohhot, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Forest fire is one of the most important factors that alter a forest ecosystem's biogeochemical cycle. Large-scale distributed burned areas lose their original vegetation structure and are more impacted by climate change in the vegetation recovery process, thus making it harder to restore their original vegetation structure.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Department of Science and Technology of Inner Mongolia, National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC). <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Inner Mongolia Agricultural University, \"In this study, we used historical Landsat imagery and the LandTrendr algorithm in the Google Earth Engine platform to study and identify post-fire stages in the Great Xing'An Range of Inner Mongolia. Moreover, we categorized different post-fire vegetation recovery trajectories. The usefulness of spectral indices was also evaluated in the study region. We applied the Geodetector model to analyze the driving factors of the burned area vegetation regeneration process. The results show that burn severity and earth-atmosphere hydrological cycle are two main impacting factors in the short term after the fire (e.g. 5-6 years). Other climatical conditions affect vegetation recovery, including prolonged vegetation recovery process, hydrothermal circulation process and topographical conditions, seasonally frozen soil, freeze-thaw processes, and climate events. This study improves understanding of the dynamic successional processes in the burned area and the driving factors.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Also, the outcomes can facilitate and support sustainable forest management of the Great Xing'An Range.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Burned Vegetation Recovery Trajectory and Its Driving Factors Using Satellite Remote-sensing Datasets In the Great Xing'an Forest Region of Inner Mongolia.

'It's draining and, unfortunately, it's not letting up yet.' <br/>About 2,600 people were still in the city \u2014 1,000 of them essential workers, authorities said. <br/>Shane Thompson, the territory's minister of environment and climate change, said the wildfire situation remained critical and the non-emergency personnel who stayed were endangering themselves and others. 'Please get out now,' he said. <br/>Streets were nearly empty and stores shuttered. 'It's a ghost town,' said Kieron Testart, who was going door to door in the nearby First Nation communities of Dettah and NDilo to check on people. <br/>ADVERTISEMENT <br/>Evacuees from Yellowknife, territorial capital of the Northwest Territories, queue up to get gas at Big River Service in Ft.

A 10-kilometer (6-mile) fire line was dug, and firefighters deployed 20 kilometers (12 miles) of hose and a plethora of pumps in the fight to keep the fire at bay. <br/>It is 'the most extensive heavy water operation we've ever seen in the territory,' Westwick said. <br/>The fire, caused by lightning more than a month ago, is about 1,670 square kilometers (644 square miles) and 'not going away anytime soon,' Westwick said. He said the blaze had jumped three different containment lines, fueled by dry weather and dense forests. <br/>Hundreds of kilometers (miles) south of Yellowknife, homes burned in West Kelowna, British Columbia, a city of about 38,000, after a wildfire grew 'exponentially worse' than expected overnight, officials said. <br/>Premier David Eby declared a state of emergency for the province because of the rapidly evolving wildfire situation. <br/>'We are in for an extremely challenging situation in the days ahead,' Eby said at a news conference Friday evening. <br/>He said the decree would give authorities a number of legal tools, including the power to prevent people from traveling into dangerous areas and ensure access to accommodations for evacuees and heavy equipment for fighting the fires. <br/>Officials in West Kelowna already ordered people to evacuate 2,400 properties and alerted an additional 4,800 properties to be ready to leave. The BC Wildfire Service said the fire stretched over 68 square kilometers (26 square miles). <br/>No casualties had been reported, but some first responders became trapped while rescuing people who failed to evacuate, said Jason Brolund, chief of the West Kelowna fire department. <br/>'There were a number of risks taken to save lives and property last night,' Brolund said at a news conference Friday, describing how first responders had to rescue people who jumped into a lake to avoid the flames. 'It didn't have to be that way.' <br/>Bowinn Ma, the province's minister of emergency management, said at a news briefing Friday afternoon that 'we are still faced with great challenges.' <br/>'I was deeply horrified to witness the distressing images emerging from West Kelowna,' she said. 'The past 24 hours have been incredibly challenging for the people across the province.' <br/>ADVERTISEMENT <br/>Canada has seen a record number of wildfires this year \u2014 contributing to choking smoke in parts of the United States \u2014 with more than 5,700 fires burning more than 137,000 square kilometers (53,000 square miles) from one end of Canada to the other, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. <br/>As of Friday morning, more than 1,000 wildfires were burning across the country, over half of them out of control. <br/>About 6,800 people in eight other communities in the Northwest Territories had already evacuated their homes, including the small community of Enterprise, which was largely destroyed. Officials said everyone made it out alive. <br/>A woman whose family evacuated the town of Hay River on Sunday told CBC that their vehicle began to melt as they drove through embers, the front window cracked and the vehicle filled with smoke that made it difficult to see the road ahead. <br/>'I was obviously scared the tire was going to break, our car was going to catch on fire and then it went from just embers to full smoke,' said Lisa Mundy, who was traveling with her husband and their 6-year-old and 18-month-old children. She said they called 911 after they drove into the ditch a couple of times. <br/>She said her son kept saying: 'I don't want to die, mommy.' <br/>___ <br/>Webber reported from Fenton, Michigan. <br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.adn.com/nation-world/2023/08/19/thousands-flee-raging-wildfire-turning-capital-of-canadas-northwest-territories-into-ghost-town/\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-AKDP12273416924602234822587610002</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AKDP-122734</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6903-HD21-JCMN-Y4MW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1086\"/><timeReceived>3:50 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

No new fires have been found on the RRSNF. Contract resources responded to report of smoke in the Powers Ranger District but were unable to locate it.</p><p>The lightning that moved through our surrounding area over the past few days has produced several fires in the Pacific Northwest and northern California. These fires have required the mobilization of many resources. \"The RRSNF is coordinating with our partners to make sure we support the greater need but maintain an initial attack organization capable of meeting the need if we get new starts,\" says Eric Hensel, Fire Aviation Staff Officer.</p><p>Resources that are being shared with partner agencies to assist with initial attack include the following:</p><p>* Two Type 1 helicopters are assisting on fires on the Fremont-Winema National Forest (FWF). One remains assigned to the Crane Fire in Lake County.</p><p>* Type 2 Initial Attack Crew is assisting in the Sky Lakes Wilderness on the FWF.</p><p>* Siskiyou Rappellers staffed two fires in the Mountain Lakes Wilderness on the FWF.</p><p>* Air Attack provided relief in Central Oregon.</p><p>EXTREME fire danger is upon us, and we are in the heart of fire season. The fuels in the forest are very receptive to a fire starting. The grass, leaves, duff and smaller trees can ignite easily with just a spark.</p><p>Always check fire restrictions each time before going out to recreate wherever you go and follow the fire prevention restrictions Report fires or any activity that could result in a fire starting.</p><p>Year-to-date, the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest has responded to 20 fires with a total of 2.3 acres burned. Three of these fires were caused by lightning, and 17 were human-caused.</p><p>USDA is an equal opportunity provider, employer, and lender.

(Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press via AP)  </p><p><br/>YELLOWKNIFE, Northwest Territories \u2014 Residents in the capital of Canada's Northwest Territories rushed to beat a noon Friday deadline to evacuate their homes as one of hundreds of wildfires raging in the territories moved closer to the city of 20,000. <br/>Thousands have fled, driving hundreds of miles to safety or waiting in long lines for emergency flights, as the worst fire season on record in Canada showed no signs of easing. <br/>The fire was within 10 miles of Yellowknife's northern edge Thursday, and officials worried that strong northern winds could push the flames toward the only highway leading away from the fire, which was choked with long caravans of cars. <br/>Still, there remained plenty of time to leave by road or air, Shane Thompson, a government minister for the Territories, told a news conference. He said that without rain the fire might reach the city's outskirts by the weekend. <br/>'We're all tired of the word unprecedented, yet there is no other way to describe this situation in the Northwest Territories,' Premier Caroline Cochrane posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. <br/>Canada has seen a record number of wildfires this year \u2014 contributing to choking smoke in parts of the U.S. \u2014 with more than 5,700 fires burning more than 137,000 square kilometers (53,000 square miles) from one end of Canada to the other, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. <br/>As of Friday morning, more than 1,000 wildfires were burning across the country, over half of them out of control. Hundreds of miles to the south of Yellowknife, residents were ordered to evacuate 2,400 properties in West Kelowna, British Columbia, and another 4,800 properties were on evacuation alert because of the threat from a wildfire burning just a few kilometers (miles) from the city. <br/>ADVERTISEMENT <br/>Vehicles line-up for fuel at Fort Providence, Northwest Territories, on the only road south from Yellowknife, Thursday, Aug. 17, 2023. (Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press via AP)  <br/>Vehicles line-up for fuel at Fort Providence, Northwest Territories on the only road south from Yellowknife, Thursday, Aug. 17, 2023. (Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press via AP)  <br/>The evacuation of Yellowknife was by far the largest this year, said Ken McMullen, president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs and fire chief in Red Deer, Alberta. <br/>'It's one of those events where you need to get people out sooner rather than later' because fire could block the only escape route before ever reaching the community. <br/>Ten planes left Yellowknife with 1,500 passengers on Thursday, said Jennifer Young, director of corporate affairs for the Northwest Territories' Department of Municipal and Community Affairs, adding that the agency hopes 22 flights will leave Friday with 1,800 more passengers. <br/>Yellowknife Mayor Rebecca Alty said that the fire wasn't the only concern. <br/>'With the heavy smoke that will be approaching we encourage all residents to evacuate as soon as possible,' she said. <br/>Alty said some good news is the fire didn't advance as far as originally expected Thursday with crews working hard getting firebreaks in. But 'it is still coming,' she said. <br/>As people fled, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met with his incident response group. He asked ministers to work to ensure communication services remained available and said there would be no tolerance for price gouging on flights or essential goods. <br/>At the Big River Service Station about 300 kilometers (185 miles) south of Yellowknife, the line of vehicles waiting for fuel was 'phenomenal,' employee Linda Croft said. 'You can't see the end of it.' <br/>Resident Angela Canning packed up her camper with important documents, family keepsakes and basic necessities as she prepared to leave with her two dogs, while her husband stayed behind as an essential worker. <br/>'I'm really anxious and I'm scared. I'm emotional. ... I'm in shock,' she said. 'I don't know what I'm coming home to or if I'm coming home. There's just so much unknowns here.' <br/>About 6,800 people in eight other communities in the territory have already been forced to evacuate their homes, including the small community of Enterprise, which was largely destroyed. Officials said everyone made it out alive. <br/>A woman whose family evacuated the town of Hay River on Sunday told CBC that their vehicle began to melt as they drove through embers, the front window cracked and the vehicle filled with smoke that made it difficult to see the road ahead. <br/>'I was obviously scared the tire was going to break, our car was going to catch on fire and then it went from just embers to full smoke,' said Lisa Mundy, who was traveling with her husband and their 6-year-old and 18-month-old children. She said they called 911 after they drove into the ditch a couple of times. <br/>She said her son kept saying: 'I don't want to die, mommy.' <br/>Authorities said the intensive care unit at a Yellowknife hospital would close Friday and in-patient units from Stanton Territorial Hospital could be moved in the coming days. Most long-term care patients were transferred to institutions to the south, the Health and Social Services Authority said on its website. <br/>The evacuation order issued Wednesday night applies to Yellowknife and the neighboring First Nations communities of Ndilo and Dettah. <br/>Indigenous communities have been hit hard by the wildfires, which threaten important cultural activities such as hunting, fishing and gathering native plants. <br/>ADVERTISEMENT <br/>Amy Cardinal Christianson, an Indigenous fire specialist with Parks Canada, has said the wildfires 'are so dangerous and so fast moving' that evacuations increasingly are necessary, posing a challenge in remote communities where there might be one road in, or no roads at all. <br/>Alice Liske left Yellowknife by road with her six kids earlier this week because the air quality was so bad. <br/>She worried about how so many people would flee the city in such a short time. <br/>'Not only that,' she said, 'but when we go back, what will be there for us?' <br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.adn.com/nation-world/2023/08/18/wildfire-nears-capital-of-canadas-northwest-territories-as-fleeing-residents-fill-roads-and-flights/\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-AKDP12273416923774231782587610003</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AKDP-122734</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68YW-K7M1-JCMN-Y43W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1043\"/><timeReceived>4:50 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

The collaboration included his Oregon State College of Forestry colleagues Julia Olszewski, Becky Miller and Micah Schmidt, plus Lisa Ellsworth of the OSU College of Agricultural Sciences and Michael Vernon of Blue Mountains Forest Partners.</p><p>\"Most of the studies that have been published so far suggest mechanical thinning that isn't followed by prescribed fire is not as good for moderating fire severity than thinning combined with prescribed fire,\" Johnston said. \"Some studies have even suggested that thinning without prescribed fire can increase wildfire severity by adding to the buildup of fine fuels on the forest floor.\"</p><p>Mechanical thinning refers to the use of commercial equipment such as a feller-buncher, which cuts and stacks whole trees, or a cut-to-length harvester and forwarder that results in logs of specific lengths being sent to the mill. In the study areas, all trees up to 53 centimeters in diameter at breast height were removed, and hand crews cut down trees too small for commercial use.</p><p>\"Our work shows that mechanical thinning can moderate fire behavior even in the absence of prescribed fire,\" Johnston said. \"That's good news since prescribed fire on national forests has remained flat over the last 20 years because of shortfalls in U.S. Forest Service capacity, a risk-averse agency culture and regulatory constraints on smoke.\"</p><p>Fuels built up for a year or two after thinning and then declined, and litter and duff declined dramatically as a result of thinning, he said. Forest litter refers to any non-living organic matter that's fallen to the ground and yet to undergo much decay; duff is the layer of decayed and decaying organic matter between the litter and the soil.</p><p>\"Although the models show that thinning alone moderates fire behavior for a number of years, prescribed fire is still a key tool for meeting fuel reduction and fire management objectives in the ponderosa pine forests of the southern Blue Mountains and elsewhere,\" Johnston said. \"Prescribed fire will extend the longevity of what the mechanical thinning accomplished when the conifers regenerate significantly and those surface fuels start to rise above desired thresholds.\"</p><p>Across western North America, seasonally dry forests were historically characterized by frequent, low-intensity surface fires that led to the persistence of older trees living in open stands, he said. But starting about 130 years ago, the logging of old, fire-resistant trees, unregulated grazing and a national culture of fire suppression combined to bring much greater tree density, fuel continuity and surface fuel loading.</p><p>\"Those changes along with a warming climate have led to increasingly large, fast-moving, stand-replacing fires that have significant negative impacts on old-growth habitat, water quality and human infrastructure,\" Johnson said. \"Consequently a range of non-governmental organizations, tribal, state and local governments and private landowners are trying to adapt by reducing fuels.\"</p><p>Johnston notes that Congress has taken several steps to increase the pace and scale of fuel reduction treatments on Forest Service lands across the West, including the 2009 authorization of the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program, which funds thinning on high-priority national forest landscapes.</p><p>The southern Blue Mountains, the subject of this research, are one of those high-priority areas, and between 2012 and 2020 more than $17 million has been spent to thin 87,000 hectares in the 220,000-hectare area.</p><p>\"Less than one-fifth of the area treated with mechanical thinning in the southern Blues has also been treated with prescribed fire,\" Johnston said. \"Prescribed fire has been significantly slowed by budget constraints, local opposition to fire use, and restrictions imposed by COVID-19 response measures. But our modeling shows thinning can do a lot on its own in terms of rate of fire spread, flame length and crown fire potential. Investments by Congress in fuel reduction thinning in eastern Oregon are working.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUSRVW-247204635</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUSRVW2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63PX-N9K1-F11P-X4RP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417294</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"797\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Buzz Future LLC Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Eurasia Review</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35455\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 28, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Forest Lands</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTkzOTc4NEQ2MTQwNDg0Q0E0NDNFRkRDRDU1QUE0OEU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

This results in harmful gases and fine particles, such as ash and soot, being present indoors. The fine particles settle out of the air and accumulate on surfaces, but if disturbed, they may be resuspended in the air and inhaled, leading to respiratory issues. Wildfire smoke also contains allergens and irritants, such as pollen, mold spores, and chemicals, which can trigger respiratory symptoms, allergies, and asthma attacks.

Westwick urged residents in other areas to leave by noon Friday.</p><p>\u201cI want to be clear that the city is not in immediate danger and there\u2019s a safe window for residents to leave the city by road and by air,\u201d Shane Thompson, a government minister for the Territories, told a news conference. \u201cWithout rain, it is possible it will reach the city outskirts by the weekend.\u201d</p><p>Evacuating such a large number of people is \u201cgoing to be tough,\u201d but people were cooperating and staying calm, Westwick said.</p><p>Canada has seen a record number of wildfires this year \u2014 contributing to choking smoke in parts of the U.S. \u2014 with more than 5,700 fires burning more than 137,000 square kilometers (53,000 square miles) from one end of Canada to the other, according to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ciffc.ca/\">Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.</url> As of Thursday, 1,053 wildfires were burning across the country, more than half of them out of control.</p><p>In the Northwest Territories alone, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.nt.ca/ecc/en/services/wildfire-update\">268 wildfires</url> have already burned more than 21,000 square kilometers (8,100 square miles).</p><p>Thursday's evacuation of Yellowknife was by far the largest so far this year, said Ken McMullen, president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs and fire chief in Red Deer, Alberta.</p><p>\u201cIt's one of those events where you need to get people out sooner rather than later,\u201d because fire could block the only escape route before ever reaching the community.</p><p>Resident Angela Canning was packing up her camper with important documents, family keepsakes and basic necessities and leaving with her two dogs, while her husband stayed behind as an essential worker.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really anxious and I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m emotional ... I'm in shock,\u201d she told The Canadian Press. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m coming home to or if I\u2019m coming home. There\u2019s just so much unknowns here.\u201d</p><p>At the Big River Service Station about 300 kilometers (185 miles) south of Yellowknife, the line of vehicles waiting for fuel was \u201cphenomenal,\u201d employee Linda Croft said. \u201cYou can't see the end of it.\u201d</p><p>About 6,800 people in eight other communities in the territory have already been forced to evacuate their homes, including the small community of Enterprise, which was largely destroyed.

It needs to be encouraged and allowed to spread. We are not talking about a brush or forest fire. We are not talking about a chemical fire. We are talking about a spiritual resurgence driven by young college students, and it is taking on a life of its own.  </p><p><br/>I touched on the revival at Asbury University in an earlier article, but it deserves a deeper dive into the movement spreading across the country. My writing today is not a story about civil disobedience that we have become used to expecting. This story is about singing, praying, and surrendering oneself to Christ in round-the-clock revivals. This is a truly amazing phenomenon. <br/>The gathering at Asbury University is not the first in the institution's history. On February 3, 1970, a religious service morphed into a revival that lasted 144 hours. The current revival had a simple beginning on February 8th. After a regularly scheduled service, a group of about twenty students lingered and continued to sing and pray for each other. As the hours passed, other students heard the music and payers coming from the hall, and they stopped and joined in. The crowd soon swelled and occupied every one of the 1,500 folding chairs, and people stood around the hall and filled the balconies. They were not just observers but became active worshipers. Over the next two weeks, over 50,000 people will have come to Asbury to be a part of a modern religious phenomenon. <br/>Not to mimic Asbury, but occurring organically, there are similar services at many other colleges around the country, including Samford University, Lee University, and Cedarville University. The core of this movement, both its leadership and target audience, is the Gen Z students who have been present since the beginning. Unlike many of the Gen-Z generation who live on Instagram and TikTok, this group has been turning away the media and keeping the event low-key and low-tech. Tucker Carlson of FOXNews had requested to attend and was asked not to come to Asbury. This is not a political event, and they did not want to distort the serenity of the gathering with the presence of high-profile media personalities. <br/>Professional revivalists and Christian celebrities have been welcomed but have not been given a platform. The student leaders have done nothing to disrupt or corrupt the event. This event has no props. There are no special lights, video presentations, or planned offerings. This is purely between the worshipers and Jesus. <br/>Students who have been interviewed outside of the hall are overcome with emotions. They genuinely feel they have been changed by being a part of the service. It is hard to define a word to describe what is happening. It is not an event, service, revival, or any other term used to describe something planned. This has mushroomed from two dozen kids who went to a service and needed something more. They found it in Kentucky, and the world has taken notice. This Asbury Revival is a movement we can hope is not a one-and-done. <br/>The post A Flame Has Been Lit[1] appeared first on Granite Grok[2]. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://granitegrok.com/blog/2023/02/a-flame-has-been-lit\">https://granitegrok.com/blog/2023/02/a-flame-has-been-lit</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://granitegrok.com\">https://granitegrok.com</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://granitegrok.com/blog/2023/02/a-flame-has-been-lit\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-GRAG136216167741913315825876100099</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRAG-136216</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67N0-VS51-JCMN-Y3TH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484249</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"547\"/><timeReceived>1:45 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Granite Grok</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"02\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>February 26, 2023 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Blog</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Seacoast</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>youth</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009HPZ</classCode><className>STUDENTS &amp; STUDENT LIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D75A</classCode><className>GENERATION Z</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001464</classCode><className>RELIGION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DFHJ</classCode><className>PHOTO &amp; VIDEO SHARING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00099LP</classCode><className>CHRISTIANS &amp; CHRISTIANITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST00096UV</classCode><className>COLLEGE STUDENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DMYZ</classCode><className>EMOTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp; EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000DPIU</classCode><className>SHORT FORM VIDEOS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>ST000CUW5</classCode><className>CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DFHJ</classCode><className>PHOTO &amp; VIDEO SHARING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST00096UV</classCode><className>COLLEGE STUDENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000DPIU</classCode><className>SHORT FORM VIDEOS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

According to news reporting from Kathmandu, Nepal, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"As a basic component of the forest ecosystem, the forest structure refers to the general distribution of plant species of different life forms and sizes. The characterization of forest structure is the key to understanding the vegetation history, present status, and future development trajectory of the forest ecosystems.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include President Chure Terai-madhesh Conservation Development Board; University Grants Commission Nepal. <br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Tribhuvan University: \"The Chure region of Nepal covers about 12.78% of the country's land area and extends east to west along the southern foothills. This biologically rich but geologically fragile region is home to many species and provides many ecosystem services to millions of people. The Chure landscape is severely suffered from anthropogenic disturbances including logging, grazing, fuelwood collection, solid waste disposal, encroachment, forest fire, and excavation of sand, gravel, and boulders. In this study, we aim to characterize the forest ecosystem types outside the protected areas in the Chure region of Nepal and analyze the threat and vulnerability of the landscape from the biodiversity point of view. We sampled 62 sites to study the dominant vegetation type, regeneration status, and major threats to the forest ecosystems. A distribution map of the forest ecosystem types in Chure was prepared. We identified 14 forest ecosystem types in Chure including seven new ones. The newly reported forest ecosystems are Hymenodictyon excelsum Forest, Syzygium cumini Forest, Terminalia anogeissiana Forest, Schima wallichii-Shorea robusta Forest, Pinus roxburghii - Shorea robusta Forest, Pinus roxburghii Forest, and Bamboo thickets.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"We conclude that intensified human activities including forest encroachment and deforestation are mainly responsible for the ecological imbalance in the Chure region. We emphasize an in-depth analysis of biophysical linkage and immediate conservation efforts for the restoration of the Chure landscape in Nepal.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Characterization of Forest Ecosystems in the Chure (Siwalik Hills) Landscape of Nepal Himalaya and Their Conservation Need.

It's a gigafire,\" said Zac Krohn, a division supervisor with the US Forest Service as he briefed the hotshot crew on another steamy day in northern Quebec.</p><p>The firefighters on Saturday took in the instructions, suited up, shouldered axes and chain saws and hiked into burned and barren forests looking for dangerous hotspots still smoldering. </p><p>\"At this point, we're just trying to secure the edge and protect the community,\" said Krohn. There was no taming these wildfires now, they were too vast and too hot, he said.</p><p>Crews know the work will be brutal: They have long days, as much as 16 hours, traveling to new areas detected as hotspots and sometimes hiking hours to get to them. </p><p>Canada is already on pace to have its worst wildfire season in recorded history and the season is little more than half over. </p><p>There are more than 880 fires burning throughout the country and the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre says at least 580 of the current wildfires are \"out of control,\" according to its website.</p><p>And the conflagrations are having an enormous impact on Canada's neighbor, as well: Forecasters predicted around 70 million Americans on Monday would see decreased visibility and poor air quality, including residents of Chicago, Detroit, New York, St. Louis and Cleveland.</p><p>Smoke from the Canadian wildfires had drifted south by Monday evening, blanketing North Georgia, Atlanta and other parts of the southeast, according to the National Weather Service in Atlanta. The smoky conditions could linger in the Atlanta and the North Georgia area through Tuesday and over central and south Georgia possibly until Wednesday, NWS meteorologist Ansley Long told CNN.</p><p>\"It's no understatement to say that the 2023 fire season is and will continue to be record-breaking in a number of ways,\" said Michael Norton, a director general with Canada's Northern Forestry Centre, during a technical briefing earlier this month.</p><p>\"The total area burned now exceeds any year on record since we started measuring and keeping accurate records,\" he said. </p><p>According to data, this weekend the country set yet another record - with nearly 25 million acres consumed, an area nearly the size of Ohio.</p><p>\"When it's the year to burn and the conditions are right, it's just going to continue to burn. The best thing we can do as an incident management team is to focus on protection of people and communities,\" said Matt Rau, an incident commander with the Southwest Area Incident Management Team based in the United States. </p><p>For weeks now, Rau's hotshot crews have been scanning blackened and scarred forests from the air and on the ground trying to assess how best to protect people and property. </p><p>Amid the cliche on everyone's lips - that Canada isn't out of the woods yet - firefighters pitching in from all over the world are taking in the scope of this emergency.</p><p>The wildfires continue to defy history even though an increased number of firefighters and rainfall have managed to at least mitigate some of the damage. But the work is dangerous. On Sunday, Canadian authorities announced a second firefighter had died battling the wildfires.</p><p>Officials cautioned that any rain was like a drop in an otherwise empty bucket, with nearly every region in the grips of some stage of drought.</p><p>Temperatures were hotter than usual during the spring and severe weather and lightning strikes ignited forests already compromised by climate change.</p><p>\"When they burn like this there's no way to even put people in front of it to stop the fire, there's no amount of resources on the ground or from the sky that's going to be able to stop of these fires when they get the momentum,\" said Rau.</p><p>His base of operations is in Lebel-sur-Quevillon, a Quebec town that has already evacuated twice since fire season started.</p><p>International crews from the US, South Korea, South Africa, Portugal and several other countries have pitched in, coordinating with Canadian resources that are already stretched.</p><p>And this weekend the Canadian government called in the military to help battle new blazes in western provinces. Bill Blair, the emergency preparedness minister, tweeted that he had approved a request for federal assistance and the armed forces would be deployed.</p><p>The town of Chibougamau, Quebec, is still on edge after evacuating the entire community of about 7,000 in a matter of hours in June.</p><p>Mayor Manon Cyr, on describing the decision to evacuate, said: \"Strangely, I wasn't scared, I was mad. And then I have to calm down and say, 'Manon, you have a job to do. And that's why I said to my people let's stay calm, let's be patient, keep it Zen.\"</p><p>Residents have been back for weeks, but they know the threat will continue through summer, maybe longer.</p><p>\"Don't be surprised if it continues and, secondly, this is a problem that is going to go on into the future,\" said Rau.</p><p>That also applies to US residents who once again this week will be dealing with air quality alerts, now from wildfires in Canada's west, he said.         </p><p>             CNN's Matthew J.
