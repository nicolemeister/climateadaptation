Put it back in.</p><p>ADRIANA DIAZ: We should open our own lemonade stand after work today.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Yes, I hope he stops by.</p><p>But we are going to begin with some breaking news this morning. We`ve just learned that a top Russian military officer, a General, has been killed in a car explosion outside of his apartment block in Moscow.</p><p>Holly Williams is following this breaking news for us.</p><p>Holly, what do we know at this hour?</p><p>HOLLY WILLIAMS: Good morning, Tony.</p><p>Russian officials are saying that Lieutenant General Yaroslav Moskalik, a senior figure in the General Staff of the Russian military was killed by an explosive device placed inside a car just outside of Moscow, the Russian capital.</p><p>Now, Russian officials say the device was rigged with shrapnel, and Russian media is running video that appears to show a burning vehicle outside of an apartment building.</p><p>Russian officials say they have opened a criminal case into the incident. Russian media is also reporting that the device was detonated remotely as General Moskalik walked past. We cannot confirm those details at this point.</p><p>Now this comes as President Trump`s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is in Moscow for talks aimed at securing a ceasefire in the war in Ukraine. That is his fourth visit to Russia this year -- Adriana.</p><p>ADRIANA DIAZ: Holly, thank you so much for those details, and that isn`t the only breaking news from the region. There were new air strikes overnight in Ukraine that left multiple people dead. An elderly woman and a child are reported to be among the victims.</p><p>Ukraine says Russia fired more than 100 drones at five regions. This despite President Trump`s call for Vladimir Putin to stop the bombing now.</p><p>Ed O`Keefe is at the White House with more.</p><p>Ed, good morning.</p><p>ED O`KEEFE: Adriana, good morning.</p><p>It was a rare rebuke from President Trump after a major Russian attack on Ukraine`s capital, and it comes as he tries to get both sides to the table to secure a peace deal.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>ED O`KEEFE: With bombs dropping on Kyiv yet again this week, President Trump singled out Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday, \"Stop,\" he said, \"Let`s get the peace deal done.\"</p><p>The criticism continued later in an Oval Office meeting with the Prime Minister of Norway.</p><p>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I wasn`t happy with it, and we`re in the midst of talking peace and missiles were fired. And I was not happy with it.</p><p>WILLIAM TAYLOR (Former Ukrainian U.S. Ambassador): Finally President Trump is expressing the frustration that he must feel about President Putin.</p><p>ED O`KEEFE: William Taylor once served as U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine.</p><p>WILLIAM TAYLOR: We`ll see if it`s effective, but it is necessary for President Trump to lean on, put pressure on President Putin to come to the table.</p><p>ED O`KEEFE: Trump`s focus on Russia came after he singled out Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy the day before for comments pushing back on ceding Crimea to Russia that Trump considered inflammatory.</p><p>(PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY speaking in foreign language.)</p><p>ED O`KEEFE: The Ukrainian leader was in South Africa Thursday before cutting his trip short and had previously been in London for meetings on the war, meetings that Secretary of State Marco Rubio decided to skip at the last minute.</p><p>At the White House, President Trump was asked what concessions Russia has offered to get closer to peace.</p><p>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Stopping the war, stopping taking the whole country. Pretty big concession.</p><p>ED O`KEEFE: But he balked at the idea that he is not putting pressure on Putin.</p><p>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You don`t know what pressure I`m putting on Russia. They`re dealing. You have no idea what pressure I`m putting on Russia. We`re putting a lot of pressure.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>ED O`KEEFE: Now President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy are both attending the Pope`s funeral this weekend and Zelenskyy has said he hopes to meet with Trump in Rome, if possible -- Nate.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Ed, thank you.</p><p>Russia`s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov sat down with \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan for an exclusive interview.</p><p>Now, this was before the death of the Russian general we just reported on at the top of the show. Now, this could further complicate the peace talks that Margaret spoke with the Foreign Minister about. Take a listen.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>MARGARET BRENNAN: You have sources say that the U.S. proposal is really just kind of a list of bullet points. Does Russia have the details -- the details you need at this point in terms of a formal --</p><p>SERGEY LAVROV (Russian Foreign Minister): We are -- we are really polite people, and unlike some others, we never discuss in public what is being discussed in negotiations. Otherwise, negotiations are not serious.</p><p>To ask for somebody`s opinion regarding the substance, go to Zelenskyy. He is happy to talk to anybody through media even to President Trump he presents his claims.</p><p>MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he said he hasn`t received a formal proposal, so I was wondering if you have.</p><p>SERGEY LAVROV: We are serious people. We can see the serious proposals, we make serious proposals, and this is a process which is not supposed to be public until the end of it.</p><p>MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. So no deal is imminent?</p><p>SERGEY LAVROV: I didn`t say this.</p><p>MARGARET BRENNAN: The President of the United States said there was a deal with Russia, so I wanted to ask Russia if there was a deal with the United States, so I just want to be clear.</p><p>SERGEY LAVROV: Well, we made our comments on this statement. The negotiations continue, and until the end of the negotiations, we cannot disclose what it is about.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Now this is worth watching in its entirety. You can watch more of Margaret Brennan`s exclusive interview with the Russian Foreign Minister this Sunday on \"Face the Nation.\"</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: But for now -- sorry.</p><p>ADRIANA DIAZ: Go ahead, Tony.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Go ahead.</p><p>ADRIANA DIAZ: We go to the Vatican now where people have one last day to pay their respects to Pope Francis before his funeral tomorrow.</p><p>Here is a live picture from St. Peter`s Basilica. The Vatican says more than 130,000 people have visited the Pope`s coffin including members of the Pope`s own family who came to see him yesterday.</p><p>Seth Doane has been talking to some of the mourners.</p><p>Seth, good morning.</p><p>SETH DOANE: Good morning to you.</p><p>As the world prepares for Francis` funeral, tributes are coming in in many forms. This one stood out because it really embodies a key part of his legacy.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>SETH DOANE: Pope Francis encouraged embracing those on the margins, asking churches to house migrants. This one in Rome doubles as a dormitory at night.</p><p>In the pews at the special prayer service last evening was George Malke (sp?), a 29-year-old engineer and refugee from Syria. Hoping to study, he fled the Civil War, leaving his parents behind.</p><p>What does Pope Francis mean to you inside?</p><p>GEORGE MALKE (Refugee from Syria): Hope and peace.</p><p>SETH DOANE: Malke came to Italy through one of the humanitarian corridors supported by the Catholic aid group, Sant`Egidio, he arrived last May.</p><p>How is it living in Italy?</p><p>GEORGE MALKE: It`s so nice. It gives you a feel like it`s your home.</p><p>SETH DOANE: There are language classes, and the group helps with housing, visas, and finding a job.</p><p>GEORGE MALKE: The people here all are so friendly, maybe because his message to them.</p><p>SETH DOANE: You think Pope Francis` message made a difference here.</p><p>GEORGE MALKE: Yes, yes, of course.</p><p>SETH DOANE: How much do you --</p><p>Mario Marazzitti is among Sant`Egidio founding partners. We asked what it might mean to lose Francis.</p><p>MARIO MARAZZITTI (Sant`Egidio founding partner): I`m worried that the world can be without the powerful moral leadership in a time in which leaders do not seem to be so focused on common good for the whole world. I`m worried that the world can be more alone.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>SETH DOANE: George Malke, that Syrian refugee, told us he, too, hopes to pay his respects to Pope Francis and plans to come tomorrow.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Seth, thank you so much.</p><p>One of the visitors our cameras caught at St. Peter`s Basilica was this nun from an order known as the Little Sisters of Jesus. She was crying near the Pope. They had been friends apparently for decades.</p><p>Our senior correspondent, Norah O`Donnell spoke with one of the other nuns from that very same order. Take a listen.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: Were you able to say your final goodbyes to Pope Francis?</p><p>WOMAN: I was. It struck me because I saw him there, and I realized though that he`s not there. I think we all feel a little lost because when you love someone that you lose, you feel lost. And I know that he -- he is praying for us.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: So, we bring in Norah who has been leading our coverage from Rome all week. She joins us once again.</p><p>Norah, good morning to you.</p><p>Another one of those interviews where you can just feel the presence of so much loss, so much reflection, though, on the life of Pope Francis and it does raise the question I think a lot of people are wondering, how did Pope Francis view the role of women in the Church overall?</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: Well, it`s a good question, and it`s one that I have focused on when covering Pope Francis, you know, days before his death, the Holy Father said when women are in charge, things work.</p><p>Well you know, he did elevate about a dozen women to top roles at the Vatican, but notably in our interview last year, he ruled out the idea of women becoming ordained as priests or deacons.</p><p>You can hear -- I think there`s an alarm going off, in people`s phones now. I do want to mention, too that we met a couple from Miami yesterday at the Basilica of St. Mary Major where the Pope will be buried.</p><p>One of them is Jim Wilhelm (sp?). He was emotional when I talked to him and he said women are the backbone of the Catholic Church. He said without women, our Church would not survive, and I think Pope Francis knew that, that`s why he was close to a number of these nuns.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Norah, the alarm there is a reminder of the tight security. We`ve heard about security from the air, drones looking for anything suspicious because so many mourners are attending and then, we have the funeral tomorrow.</p><p>What can we expect there?</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: Well, first tonight begins the ancient ritual of sealing the coffin by Cardinal Kevin Farrell, the Camerlengo of the Roman Catholic Church. That is the head of the papal funeral on Saturday morning, and that funeral mass begins at 4:00 A.M. Eastern Time, and attending will be 130 foreign delegations including 50 heads of state and 10 monarchs. That includes President Trump and former President Biden.</p><p>The mass will be about two-and-a-half hours long, it will be mostly in Latin. It will be led by this man, Cardinal Re. He is the Dean of the College of Cardinals, and then we will see a procession to the Basilica of St. Mary Major where the Vatican says a group of the poor and needy will be waiting outside to say a final farewell to him.</p><p>And of course as you know, Tony, the Holy Father dedicated most of his papacy to the poor -- Tony.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: As he would have wanted it. Norah, thank you so much. Really appreciate your coverage all week and it will continue.</p><p>Norah and our CBS News team will bring you The Funeral of Pope Francis tomorrow morning in a CBS News Special Report. Our coverage begins at 4:00 A.M. Eastern, 1:00 A.M. Pacific here on CBS and streaming on CBS News 24/7, also Paramount+.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Here in the U.S., we are learning more about how a devastating wildfire began in New Jersey. A 19-year-old has been arrested and is facing arson charges. The fire has burned more than 15,000 acres and is about 50 percent contained.</p><p>Christina Fan from CBS News New York reports.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>CHRISTINA FAN: Smoke billowed into the air Thursday as crews in Southern New Jersey worked to halt the spread of this massive inferno.</p><p>BILL DONNELLY (New Jersey Forest Fire Service Chief): A lot of smoke has to do with the interior burning.

You can see all of the green through today and into tomorrow lifting into the great lakes and the northeast and it looks like it`s going to be a pretty soggy Friday night into Saturday morning, lots of rain for portions of New England, and rain against for Ocean County, New Jersey which will help continuing to try to douse that blaze in Ocean County.</p><p>We`ve got some more rain expected for the Central Plains this weekend, but it is next week that we are already tracking a pronounced, possibly multi- day severe weather threat. This will produce heavy rain and the risk for severe thunderstorms.</p><p>Look at all the moisture lifting into the Midwest. This is on Monday.

It was the first time they mourned one who came from the same continent they did.</p><p>Like Francisca Benten (sp?) who is originally from Colombia.</p><p>(FRANCISCA BENTEN speaking in foreign language.)</p><p>MANUEL BOJORQUEZ: So, it was a shock --</p><p>(FRANCISCA BENTEN speaking in foreign language.)</p><p>MANUEL BOJORQUEZ: Because you had just seen him for Easter.</p><p>(FRANCISCA BENTEN speaking in foreign language.)</p><p>FRANCISCA BENTEN (Local parishioner): Yes.</p><p>(MANUEL BOJORQUEZ: speaking in foreign language.)</p><p>MANUEL BOJORQUEZ: A huge shock for you.

That`s Colorado quarterback, Shadeur Sanders. He will still be available when the Draft continues tonight.</p><p>So, let`s look at the highlights from round one.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>MAN: With the first pick in the 2025 NFL draft, the Tennessee Titans select Cameron Ward.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: For the University of Miami`s Cam Ward --</p><p>SPORTSCASTER: Ward --</p><p>NATE BURLESON: No college team wanted him coming out of high school as a zero star recruit.</p><p>CAMERON WARD (Tennessee Titans): I`m ready. That`s what I`ve been dreaming for, it was the opportunity to play in the National Football League.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: But Thursday night, the onetime NFL longshot defied the odds. The quarterback is now looking to reverse the lowly Titans` fortunes as the number one overall pick.</p><p>CAMERON WARD: I knew I would go pro on something.

We</p><p>SHADEUR SANDERS (Deion Sanders` son): We all didn`t expect this. Tomorrow is the day. We`re going to be happy regardless.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>NATE BURLESON: So that was a shocker that Shadeur Sanders was not selected in the first round. But like he said, it`s a new day, a new night of draft picks. I`m sure he`ll go tonight.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: And guys get this stuff very wrong, a zero star recruit goes number one. But on Shadeur Sanders, \"The New York Times\" Athletic which does their sports coverage, they`ve got some analysis here that says there`s concerns about dad`s shadow with Shadeur and also that he might be difficult to coach.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: That`s so odd to me, because his dad has been coaching him since he was a child, so unless this is a coach from one of those staffs, how do you know that he is un-coachable? And if you`re an anonymous guy putting narratives out there, I would love for you to put your eliminate on it and give proof of it.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Yes.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: So, I don`t understand how that happened, but I guarantee, Shadeur will have a long, successful career.</p><p>ADRIANA DIAZ: Maybe the thought he is difficult to coach, because he might have dad also an ear, and coaches might be worried about competing with dad.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: I think it`s a benefit to have Deion Sanders as your fathers and coach.</p><p>ADRIANA DIAZ: Agree.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Dan Pompei of \"The Athletic\" can get the hate mail.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Hey, Dan, sit down with me.

The remains of Gary Farris were discovered in 2018 on their 10-acre Georgia farm. But at her sentencing, Melody Farris made a stunning accusation, and we mean stunning.</p><p>Correspondent Peter Van Sant spoke with her in an exclusive interview.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>PETER VAN SANT: In July, 2018, Detective Daniel Hayes of the Cherokee County Sheriff`s Office was summoned to an unusual crime scene: A body found in the ashes of a burn pile.</p><p>DANIEL HAYES (Cherokee County Sheriff`s Office detective): I had never personally responded to a call like that.</p><p>PETER VAN SANT: The victim was identified as 58-year-old Gary Farris. Forensics would later show he`d been shot prior to being left there.</p><p>Investigators learned Gary was a wealthy Atlanta attorney, married to Melody Farris for 38 years. They`d raised four children together.</p><p>Was the Farris family a happy family?</p><p>DANIEL HAYES: No. A lot of bickering, a lot of fights over money, a lot of jealousy.</p><p>PETER VAN SANT: Melody doesn`t deny the family drama.</p><p>MELODY FARRIS: It has been called the Farris Wheel, and it was, but it was our Farris Wheel, it was our life.</p><p>PETER VAN SANT: Investigators learned Melody had been having an affair. Son, Scott says it had been going on for years.</p><p>SCOTT FARRIS: She thought she was smart enough to hide it from everybody, but we all found out. We all knew.</p><p>PETER VAN SANT: Including Gary.</p><p>Scott says his mother spent lavishly on her affair. Hayes says Gary warned Melody he`d had enough.</p><p>DANIEL HAYES: We found text messages where he confronted her and said you know, your spending is done. We`ve got to get a handle on this.</p><p>PETER VAN SANT: About a year after Gary died, Melody was charged with his murder.</p><p>MAN: We the jury --</p><p>PETER VAN SANT: Found guilty and facing life in prison, she shocked many in the courtroom at her sentencing --</p><p>MELODY FARRIS: I want the world to know who did this. I know Scott killed his father.</p><p>It`s the perfect murder. You kill your Daddy, you set your mother up, she goes to prison, you get everything.</p><p>SCOTT FARRIS: I absolutely had nothing to do with my father`s death and it was 100 percent Melody Farris who murdered my father. That is the truth.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>ADRIANA DIAZ: Peter Van Sant joins us now.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: What?</p><p>ADRIANA DIAZ: We`ve been talking about this case during this -- we were like what? How did that happen? Who was that?</p><p>So, Peter, where do we begin?</p><p>I mean, she had -- Melody, had she ever mentioned anything about her son being involved before that stunning accusation?</p><p>PETER VAN SANT: No. In fact, Melody told me during the course of the interview that her mother, Scott`s grandmother, had told her -- by the way the grandmother today is conveniently dead -- had told her that she believes Scott was the killer and she wanted Melody to fall on the sword, to take the blame for this killing to protect Scott.</p><p>Well, after she was convicted apparently she felt that promise had expired, and it was during the sentencing hearing that she dramatically says, uh-uh, not me, it`s him.</p><p>ADRIANA DIAZ: My child.</p><p>PETER VAN SANT: And it was stunning in that courtroom. You could see the entire family physically reacting to this accusation.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Do investigators think it`s a credible accusation on any level?</p><p>PETER VAN SANT: They do not. There was an extensive investigation that lasted about a year. Detective Hayes, the lead investigator on this, told me that the evidence always took them back to Melody.</p><p>And what they do know, based on their timeline as to when Gary Farris died, the only person on the farm that day was Melody.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Where do the Farris siblings stand on all of this?</p><p>PETER VAN SANT: This is a tough thing because it`s created some division in the family. There`s four children, three of them including Scott, believe that their mother is the killer. And Amanda, the youngest, she testified at trial that she believes her mother is innocent.</p><p>Since the conviction she hasn`t spoken to us.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Wow. So, what`s next?</p><p>PETER VAN SANT: Well, she has been sentenced to life with the possibility of parole in 30 years. She`ll be 94 at that point.</p><p>ADRIANA DIAZ: Oh my gosh.</p><p>PETER VAN SANT: But she says, this fight is not over. She will not rest until she is freed and her son, Scott, is led off in chains.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Oh, my.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: My goodness. Shocking.</p><p>PETER VAN SANT: Trust me, during the course of this story, I go after her on this.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Wow.</p><p>ADRIANA DIAZ: Well, we want to see it, Peter. So, we will all tuning in.</p><p>PETER VAN SANT: It is really surprising.</p><p>ADRIANA DIAZ: It is, right, we will be tuning into your report, \"The Farris Wheel,\" on \"48 Hours\" tomorrow at 10/9 Central here on CBS and on Paramount+.</p><p>We`ll be right back.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: That is so shocking.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Yes, it is.</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Now, to our \"Kindness 101\" series where Steve Hartman and his children share stories built around kindness and character as well and the people who embody and have mastered those qualities.</p><p>Today`s lesson: Resilience. We all need a little bit of that. We are going to revisit the story of a young man born without hands and without feet who nonetheless dreamed of becoming a pilot.</p><p>Despite those many obstacles, Zach Anglin never took no for an answer.</p><p>STEVE HARTMAN: Hello, you know Meryl.</p><p>MERYL HARTMAN: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our lesson on resilience.</p><p>STEVE HARTMAN: Emmett, how are you going to define resilience?</p><p>EMMETT HARTMAN: I`m going to say resilience is the ability to bounce back from failure.</p><p>STEVE HARTMAN: That`s good, or I might say it`s like embracing failure.</p><p>MERYL HARTMAN: But who wants to fail?</p><p>STEVE HARTMAN: Well, no one really, but when you do fail, you need to look at it not so much as a roadblock, but more like a stepping stone to success. It will make more sense when you see the story.</p><p>This is one pulled from our library of stories past filed under resilience.</p><p>Although born without hands or feet, 25-year-old Zach Anglin says the only limbs he ever longed for were wings, always wanted to be a pilot.</p><p>Unfortunately, no quad amputee had ever become a commercial pilot.</p><p>ZACH ANGLIN (Quadruple amputee): Obviously nothing worth having comes easy.</p><p>PATTY ANGLIN (Zach Anglin`s mother): From the time he was born he was a disciplined and determined child.</p><p>STEVE HARTMAN: Adoptive parents Harold and Patty say there was no talking him out of it. So when Zach turned 18, he applied to a flight school that said no.</p><p>ZACH ANGLIN: There`s nothing we can really do for you, we`re sorry.</p><p>STEVE HARTMAN: The second one said the same.</p><p>ZACH ANGLIN: Like, here we go again.</p><p>STEVE HARTMAN: As did the third.</p><p>ZACH ANGLIN: The same response.</p><p>STEVE HARTMAN: And so it went, more than a dozen times over.</p><p>You`re not hearing what they`re saying.</p><p>ZACH ANGLIN: I`m not. Selective hearing. My wife will tell you, I`m a little bit hard headed.</p><p>STEVE HARTMAN: Which is why this hard-headed husband and soft-hearted father applied to one more school, the Spartan College of Aeronautics in Tulsa, Oklahoma. They said yes, although Zach`s struggle was just getting started.</p><p>He still needed approval from the Federal Aviation Administration to take the lessons, but the FAA repeatedly and in no uncertain terms denied his request.</p><p>And after the fifth rejection letter, Zach finally gave up.</p><p>ZACH ANGLIN: I was like, this is not for me. This is impossible to do.</p><p>And so my mom was over my shoulder at this point, right, and then she`s like -- you`re not done yet.</p><p>PATTY ANGLIN: I said, you can never succeed until you`ve learned to fail.</p><p>STEVE HARTMAN: And Patty says her son obviously hadn`t failed enough.</p><p>So Zach kept at it until finally they cleared him for one takeoff and when Zach was begin the opportunity to show his potential, it became clear as blue sky that you don`t need hands to have wings.</p><p>Zach graduated from flight school a few years ago and now teaches the same course so many told him he couldn`t even take.</p><p>Why do people need to hear this?</p><p>ZACH ANGLIN: Because my story isn`t just for amputees. We all go through trials and tribulations. The word impossible is an illusion behind the word possible.</p><p>STEVE HARTMAN: And failure, just the turbulence on your journey.</p><p>Zach Anglin joins us now.</p><p>Zach, welcome to \"Kindness 101.\"</p><p>ZACH ANGLIN: Thank you guys for having me.</p><p>MERYL HARTMAN: Are you still flying and teaching?</p><p>ZACH ANGLIN: Yes, ma`am. I am still having a lot of fun doing it. It`s a lot of work, but it`s such a privilege to do so.</p><p>EMMETT HARTMAN: When you failed at something repeatedly, how do you avoid getting down on yourself?</p><p>ZACH ANGLIN: It took a village, and I think I told Steve this some time ago, and that village is my family, my faith, and then the people around me to go ahead and make things possible for myself.</p><p>EMMETT HARTMAN: Do you have any suggestions for how we can be more resilient?</p><p>ZACH ANGLIN: Make a goal. Write it down, you know, say it out loud in the morning. Talk to somebody that`s done it, and just take a little bit of time every day to go ahead and work toward that goal.</p><p>STEVE HARTMAN: Big goals are just little goals piled up.</p><p>ZACH ANGLIN: Yep. Little things lead to big things.</p><p>STEVE HARTMAN: All right, well, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>ZACH ANGLIN: I appreciate you guys, as well. Thank you.</p><p>STEVE HARTMAN: You know, we all fail from time to time, but it doesn`t make us failures, it makes us human. And if you have resilience, eventually those failures will become the wings you fly on.</p><p>We`ll see you next time.</p><p>MERYL HARTMAN: And don`t forget to stay kind.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: That`s beautiful.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Fire you up to get into the weekend.</p><p>ADRIANA DIAZ: Oh my gosh.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: I mean, 12 schools rejected him. FAA says no five times and here he is.</p><p>ADRIANA DIAZ: The self-belief and then the support from the parents also got me.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Yes.</p><p>ADRIANA DIAZ: How his mother was like, you cannot succeed until you learn to fail. You`re not done yet.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Yes.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Oh my gosh.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: How could you ever think of quitting anything when you have that man as an example out in the world?</p><p>ADRIANA DIAZ: Yes.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Exactly. And to Steve Hartman`s kids, you`re not quitting \"Kindness 101.\" I need you to do this well into your 30s.</p><p>ADRIANA DIAZ: Yes, exactly.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Because we just love seeing you.</p><p>ADRIANA DIAZ: It is so great to see them growing up.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Even as you age a little bit.</p><p>ADRIANA DIAZ: I know.

They are all woven, looped. They`re not gentle on the skin.</p><p>This is a really soft -- feel this -- microfiber.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Oh.</p><p>ELIZABETH WERNER: So these are long fibers that are then shaved. Soft and absorbent. But watch this -- I`m going to dip that in warm water.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: I see you`ve got some makeup on right there.</p><p>ELIZABETH WERNER: That`s right. Here`s my hand. Without any cleanser --</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Whoa.</p><p>ELIZABETH WERNER: I`m going to be able to use just this cloth. Look at the magic. What? Now, at home the other day when I left here --</p><p>NATE BURLESON: What?</p><p>ELIZABETH WERNER: I still, every time I use it I can`t believe it. I use this every single day. So, I`m at home, I get home with all my T.V. makeup. Literally no cleanser, just water, using this towel, you can get rid of all of the makeup, the dirt, the sunscreen, whatever is on your skin that you want off.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Yes.</p><p>ELIZABETH WERNER: If you have a cleanser you love, you can use it, but here is what you don`t need. Let`s show them.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: These right here.</p><p>ELIZABETH WERNER: No more of these wipes, they`re expensive.

We brush our teeth every day. That`s great. But then we go to the dentist for the deep clean.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: That is true.</p><p>ELIZABETH WERNER: Same with the skin. We`re going to wash our face every day, but a lot of people will go for what`s called microdermabrasion to get the dead skin --</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Yes.</p><p>ELIZABETH WERNER: -- and all of the stuff out of the pores.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Yes, so it can regenerate and get that glow.</p><p>ELIZABETH WERNER: Yes.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Right.</p><p>ELIZABETH WERNER: So they go to Dr. Lancer in Beverly Hills, he`s the -- you know, for famous people and regular people, very -- every visit, hundreds or thousands.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Yes.</p><p>ELIZABETH WERNER: He`s developed a tool where we can do microdermabrasion at home.

You feel a little suction there?</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Yes.</p><p>ELIZABETH WERNER: So, as you`re moving this -- you see that dead skin that`s coming off already. Look at that. Look at that.</p><p>It`s going to remove the dead skin, the stuff in the pores, the oil, the dirt, revealing that gorgeous glow underneath.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: I need this.</p><p>ELIZABETH WERNER: Now you know, when you go to a doctor`s office how much you spend for these?

This is a really small -- feel that power there?</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Ooh.</p><p>ELIZABETH WERNER: Yes.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: So, this is a hair tool that first will dry the hair, but it comes with a button when you push that button, you can take that tip off, and look at this.</p><p>This is a multi-styling tool.

We will be right back.</p><p>(LOCAL WEATHER)</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: You know that sound. It is iconic. It was shaped or it did the 1960s. Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass, the legendary jazz trumpeter is celebrating some major milestones this year.

That year, he outsold The Beatles, The Stones, and Sinatra.</p><p>HERB ALPERT: Sometimes I was even a little embarrassed by it all.</p><p>(Clip from \"The Beat of the Brass\"/CBS)</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: In 1968 while filming the CBS special \"The Beat of the Brass,\" its director approached him.</p><p>HERB ALPERT: And he said, why don`t you try to sing a song because I`m tired of photographing you with the trumpet in your mouth all the time.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Yes.</p><p>HERB ALPERT: You know, I was lucky, I have a good friend, his name is Burt Bacharach.</p><p>(Clip from \"This Guy`s in Love With You\"/Herb Alpert/A&amp;M Records)</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Bacharach gave him this song --</p><p>(Clip from \"This Guy`s in Love With You\"/Herb Alpert/A&amp;M Records)</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Soon after the special aired, it became his first number one.</p><p>But by 1969, Alpert was facing a personal crisis.</p><p>The words you used I think were \"The trumpet is my enemy.\"</p><p>HERB ALPERT: I said it.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Did you say it?</p><p>HERB ALPERT: You`re darn right I said it.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Why did you feel that way?</p><p>HERB ALPERT: Well, I was going through a divorce, and I started losing my confidence. I was stuttering through the trumpet.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Yes.</p><p>HERB ALPERT: I couldn`t get the first note out right.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Alpert reached out to a teacher in New York named Carmine Caruso.</p><p>HERB ALPERT: He was called the troubleshooter.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Yes.</p><p>HERB ALPERT: I said, Carmine, what am I doing wrong? He says, man, are you kidding? This trumpet is a piece of plumbing, you know, just a series of pipes. He says the instrument comes from deep inside you.</p><p>So, that was like a major aha.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Alpert`s label, A&amp;M Records, had signed the band, Sergio Mendes &amp; Brasil 66.</p><p>(Clip from \"Mas Que Nada\"/A&amp;M Records)</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: And he was falling in love with their singer, Lani Hall.</p><p>Married for 52 years now, they`re still performing together.</p><p>His instincts as a record executive weren`t always as successful.</p><p>HERB ALPERT: I mean, I turned down \"Louie, Louie.\"</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: But you also signed The Carpenters --</p><p>HERB ALPERT: Well, that evened it out.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: It was Alpert who gave them \"Close to You.\" He`d recorded the song himself as a follow up to \"This Guy`s In Love With You.\" But his engineer wasn`t impressed.</p><p>HERB ALPERT: He said, I don`t think it sound so good singing this thing. So I put it in the drawer. I lost my confidence.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: The Carpenters made it a monster hit for A&amp;M, the label he co-founded with the late, Jerry Moss.</p><p>HERB ALPERT: Over lunch he said, you know, if we`re going to be partners, I want to be 50 percent of everything you do.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Yes.</p><p>HERB ALPERT: And I remember like looking at him for about ten seconds thinking to myself, don`t blow this one, man. This is a good guy.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Yes.</p><p>HERB ALPERT: I put my hand out and said that`s it, we`re partners.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Yes.</p><p>HERB ALPERT: We never signed anything, from `62 to when we sold this company in 1990, we had no official agreement. I did that on trust with him, and --</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: You miss him.</p><p>HERB ALPERT: It touches me to think about him.</p><p>(Clip from \"Rise\"/A&amp;M Records)</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Herb Alpert says music has to touch him, that happened with his 1979 smash \"Rise.\"</p><p>HERB ALPERT: That feeling in the back of my neck when I was listening to the playback, I was like \"wow.\"</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: That is a great feeling when you have that thing on the back of your neck.</p><p>HERB ALPERT: Yes, but I wait for that feeling and that`s what happened to me, you know, getting back to the Tijuana Brass sound now.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Does it feel fresh again?</p><p>HERB ALPERT: It feels fresh for me. I try to be as authentic as I can when I play.</p><p>I am Playing in the moment of my life, it`s a hard place to get to, but that`s the place I`m always looking for.</p><p>(Applause)</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: This man is absolutely beloved by anybody who grew up with his music, which includes me. I got -- you know, I posted a clip of his birthday, at the end of last month and there are literally hundreds of comments of people who said \"I adore this man.\"</p><p>You know, one of the most beloved people in music and an incredible career as a musician and as a record executive.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: And as a businessman.

There was no Tijuana Brass except in name until this album blew up and he suddenly was like, I`ve got to go on the road.</p><p>And he thought it was going to be a side gig.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Oh, my.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: And it became his life.</p><p>ADRIANA DIAZ: He is also so human. He talked about a couple of times with you where he lost his confidence despite being so incredible.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Yes, and that part fascinated me, because I couldn`t imagine somebody as successful as him suddenly thinking I`ve lost it.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Yes.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: That concept of the trumpet just being a set of pipes and the music coming from within --</p><p>ADRIANA DIAZ: Yes.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Yes.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: -- did you find that in musicians commonly?</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: I think, what was interesting to me was that he hadn`t understood that yet.</p><p>ADRIANA DIAZ: Right? Yes.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: I was like, didn`t you know that? He goes, no, I`d been playing trumpet since I was about eight years old. I had studied music. That had never, never dawned on me.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Fascinating.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Amazing. Anthony, thank you so much. We love it.</p><p>We`ll be right back.

Brad Little signed <url normalizedValue=\"https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2025/legislation/h0037/\">House Bill 37 into law on Wednesday.</url></p><p>Both chambers of the Idaho Legislature widely approved the bill, with only three Republican state lawmakers joining all 15 Democratic lawmakers to oppose it. The Senate passed the bill on a 28-7 vote last week, a month after the House passed it on a 58-11 vote.</p><p>The bill takes effect July 1, 2026. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://idahocapitalsun.com/010625statelegistlatureps176/\"> Idaho Gov.

But the firing squad isn't the primary death penalty method in any of those states, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Since 2023, Idaho has allowed firing squads as a backup execution method, behind lethal injection.</p><p>Renovating Idaho's execution chamber to allow for firing squads will likely cost more than the $750,000 lawmakers previously appropriated, lawmakers say. But bill sponsor Rep. Bruce Skaug, a Republican from Nampa, has said any extra funds would come from money already in the Idaho Department of Correction budget.</p><p>Idaho governor signs bill to increase state's grocery tax credit </p><p>Sponsored by House Majority Leader Jason Monks, R-Meridian, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://idahocapitalsun.com/briefs/idaho-gov-brad-little-signs-bill-to-increase-grocery-tax-credit/\">signed into law by Little on Thursday, </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2025/legislation/H0231/\">House Bill 231 increases the tax credit most Idahoans receive on groceries from $120 to $155. </url></p><p>#8216;I love the signal we send to Idaho families every year when we deliver even more tax relief while taking care of the needs of a growing state,#8217; Little said in a written statement. #8216;As we continue to deliver historic tax relief, we must ensure our budget balances as the Idaho Constitution requires.#8217;</p><p>To pay for the expanded grocery tax credit, House Bill 231 reduces state revenue by $50 million per year. The grocery tax law is written so it took effect retroactively Jan. 1. That means Idahoans will be able to receive the full credit when they file their taxes next year.</p><p>Gov. Little signs into law anti-SLAPP bill</p><p>Sponsored by Sen. Brian Lenney, R-Nampa, and signed into law by Little on Monday, <url normalizedValue=\"https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2025/legislation/S1001/\">House Bill 1001 aims to protect free speech and curtail frivolous lawsuits.

We believe in science. We care about our communities. We leave nobody behind,\" Inslee said.</p><p>He contrasted Washington's pandemic response with that of other states and noted, \"If we'd had the same fatality rate as Mississippi, we would have lost 18,000 Washingtonians. That's a lot of folks.\"</p><p>Despite his accomplishments, Inslee also addressed criticisms of his COVID-19 policies. He acknowledged that some residents remain disgruntled with his handling of school closures and mandates. However, he defended his decisions.</p><p>\"First off, the frustrations people (feel) are real and deep,\" Inslee said. \"This is an incredibly difficult thing for people. And frankly, it was incredibly difficult for me because we made decisions to save lives. I knew very shortly, within hours, that I was going to be called upon to make life-and-death decisions. And that those decisions would be very difficult because we were going to have to change normal patterns of living. That was the only way, particularly before we had a vaccine.\"</p><p>Reflecting on his legacy, Inslee pointed to several key achievements during his tenure, including the Climate Commitment Act, which he believes will have a lasting impact on future generations.</p><p>\"If you think in the long scope of history ... I do believe that's how my generation of leaders will be judged,\" he said. \"If we do not succeed on [climate action], they're not going to have a Washington state that you will recognize in major ways. You're not going to have a healthy forest. You're not going to have salmon in the rivers. You're not going to have snow in the mountains. You're not going to have skiing in Snoqualmie Pass. You're not going to have irrigated agriculture that is successful. Your kids won't be able to go to school and breathe in August because of the forest fire smoke. So, I do believe 50 years from now, that's how all of us will be judged.\"</p><p>He said that Washington is leading the way with environmental work.</p><p>\"I think our state has done, well, I know our state has done as well or better than any other state in the country and perhaps any other place in the world, except maybe Norway,\" Inslee said. \"I'm very proud of our state.</p><p>When asked about criticisms surrounding Washington's emissions targets and progress, Inslee asserted confidence in the state's trajectory.</p><p>\"The act is working big time ... I can say that people have embraced this vision and in a democracy that's really important. The second thing I will say is that we are seeing the success stories of this initiative all over the State of Washington,\" Inslee said.</p><p>He said he believes Washington can achieve its ambitious climate goals, citing advancements in clean energy technology.</p><p>Inslee also acknowledged some ongoing challenges, particularly homelessness, pointing out that despite increased housing commitments, \"we still have unmet needs.\" He underscored the importance of continuous investment as part of a broader strategy to address these issues.</p><p>The discussion inevitably turned to economic issues, including the state's tax policy and rising budgets. Inslee defended his approach.</p><p>\"The people want it... If we're going to tackle mental health and get people's mental health, if we're going to solve McCleary, if we're going to help build more housing, you're going to need more revenues.\"</p><p>He emphasized that voters have affirmed his fiscal policies by granting him three consecutive terms in office.</p><p>Inslee took the time to praise his wife, Trudy Inslee, for her integral role during his time in office.</p><p>\"No decision was made in the state of Washington unless she and I thoroughly talked about it,\" he said, highlighting her contributions, particularly in areas like youth homelessness and gun safety.</p><p>In conclusion, Inslee offered parting advice to incoming Governor Bob Ferguson, urging him to \"enjoy this incredible opportunity to help Washingtonians.\"</p><p>___ (c)2024 the Columbia Basin Herald, Wash.

According to news reporting out of Kavala, Greece, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Understanding the potential effects of climate change on forest fire behavior and the resulting release of combustion products is critical for effective mitigation strategies in Greece.\" </p><p><br/> The news editors obtained a quote from the research from Democritus University of Thrace: \"This study utilizes data from the MAGICC 2.4 (Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas-Induced Climate Change) climate model and the SCENGEN 2.4 (SCENarioGENerator) database to assess these impacts. By manipulating various model parameters such as climate sensitivity, scenario, time period, and global climate models (GCMs) within the SCENGEN 2.4 database, we analyzed climatic trends affecting forest fire generation and evolution. The results reveal complex and nuanced findings, indicating a need for further investigation. Case studies are conducted using the FARSITE 4 (Fire Area Simulator) model, incorporating meteorological changes derived from climate trends. Simulations of two fires in East Attica, accounting for different fuel and meteorological conditions, demonstrate an increase in the rate of combustion product release.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"This underscores the influence of changing meteorological parameters on forest fire dynamics and highlights the importance of proactive measures to mitigate future risks. Our findings emphasize the urgency of addressing climate change impacts on wildfire behavior to safeguard environmental and public health in Greece.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Effect of Climate Evolution on the Dynamics of the Wildfires in Greece.

According to news reporting out of Ioannina, Greece, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"For thousands of years forest fires played the role of a regulator in the ecosystem. Forest fires contributed to the ecological balance by destroying old and diseased plant material; but in the modern era fires are a major problem that tests the endurance not only of government agencies around the world, but also have an effect on climate change.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include European Union. <br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from University of Ioannina: \"Forest fires have become more intense, more destructive, and more deadly; these are known as megafires. They can cause major economic and ecological problems, especially in the summer months (dry season). However, humanity has developed a tool that can predict fire events, to detect them in time, but also to predict their duration. This tool is artificial intelligence, specifically, machine learning, which is one part of AI. Consequently, this paper briefly mentions several methods of machine learning as used in predicting forest fires and in early detection, submitting an overall review of current models. Our main overall objective is to venture into a new field: predicting the duration of ongoing forest fires. Our contribution offers a new way to manage forest fires, using accessible open data, available from the Hellenic Fire Service.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"In particular, we imported over 72,000 data from a 10-year period (2014-2023) using machine learning techniques. The experimental and validation results are more than encouraging, with Random Forest achieving the lowest value for the error range (8-13%), meaning it was 87-92% accurate on the prediction of forest fire duration. Finally, some future directions in which to extend this research are presented.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Predicting the Duration of Forest Fires Using Machine Learning Methods.

If these are, as Latour fears, \"end times,\" literature can help readers learn how to survive, cope and keep hope alive.</p><h>A common enemy</h><p>With the pace and tone of a thriller, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.georgerstewart.com/\">George R. Stewart</url>'s 1948 novel, \"Fire,\" follows a California forest fire from the moment it ignites until it is extinguished several days later. </p><p>Stewart's biographer, Donald M. Scott, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/760871/fire-by-george-r-stewart-introduction-by-emma-rothschild/\">described \"Fire\"</url> as \"the first novel about fire ecology,\" and the environmental impact of fires is certainly an important part of the work. But \"Fire\" is also a novel that is deeply interested in how people come together in the face of disaster.</p><p>Stewart was so committed to creating a realistic representation of a burning forest that he visited fires with a forest ranger as part of his research for the book.  His burning scenes are graphic and engage with the practicalities of firefighting, as well as its human cost.</p><p>But the novel also celebrates kinship, with characters forming deep bonds as they work together to beat back the blaze. This sense of a shared experience is vital.</p><p>One of the story's central figures, the veteran forest ranger Bart Bartley, imagines the fire as an enemy, \"Evil, malignant, and scheming.\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.publish.csiro.au/book/6835/\">Fire historians Tom Griffiths and Christine Hansen</url>, who have worked with fire-affected communities, affirm Bartley's depiction, noting how fire \"makes its victims feel hunted down and its survivors toyed with.\" </p><p>Yet in grappling with this \"evil\" force, Bartley feels \"great human love\" for those working alongside him.</p><h>Renewal and regrowth</h><p>Stewart's work is also striking for its focus on renewal.</p><p>After the flames are conquered, the novel's narrator surveys the damage. At first he sees a landscape that's \"fatally scorched.\" But his despondency gives way to a more optimistic interpretation: \"In the next few years the still-standing older trees might re-seed the ground beneath them.\" </p><p>The novel, which also examines events from the perspective of animals, ends with an extraordinary vision of hope:</p><p>\"Smoke and cloud had vanished. Through the rain-washed air the sun shone brightly, and along the crest of the range the highest peaks were dazzling-white with snow. Moist and clean, the north-west wind from the ocean blew steadily across the long ridges, and from high-swinging cones, opened by the fiery heat, the winged seeds drifted downward to the earth.\"</p><p>Emphasizing that fire is a natural phenomenon, Stewart focuses on regrowth. He reminds readers that burning has an ecologically important role and that what seems like an apocalyptic present can soon transform into a regenerative future.</p><h>Living in the Pyrocene</h><p>The historian Stephen J. Pyne has called our fire-prone age the <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/california-wildfires-signal-the-arrival-of-a-planetary-fire-age-125972\">Pyrocene</url>. So it's no surprise that more writers are weaving wildfires into their stories.  </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://amitavghosh.com/\">Amitav Ghosh</url>'s novel \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374719418/gunisland/\">Gun Island</url>\" features a wildfire in its early chapters. But Ghosh isn't content to let his fiction speak for itself; his 2016 nonfiction work \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/G/bo22265507.html\">The Great Derangement</url>\" is an exhortation for contemporary writers to incorporate representations of natural disasters into their work to reflect the way that disaster now impinges upon everyday life.</p><p>The Australian writer and Booker Prize winner <url normalizedValue=\"https://thebookerprizes.com/the-booker-library/authors/richard-flanagan\">Richard Flanagan</url>'s 2020 novel, \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/oct/16/the-living-sea-of-waking-dreams-by-richard-flanagan-review-a-wrenching-response-to-a-devastated-world\">The Living Sea of Waking Dreams</url>,\" responds to this challenge.  </p><p>Unlike Stewart's novel, fire is not front and center of the work, which Flanagan has described as a \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/oct/16/the-living-sea-of-waking-dreams-by-richard-flanagan-review-a-wrenching-response-to-a-devastated-world\">rising scream</url>.\" When the story, which is set in Australia, begins, bushfires rage, and it seems as if they'll be central to the plot. However, they simply smolder away in the background - just as they do in real life for many of those who aren't directly affected by fire. Yet.  </p><p>The novel's true focus, it turns out, is on the overwhelming experience of living in a world where natural disaster succeeds natural disaster. It follows the protagonist, Anna, who seeks relief from her mother's terminal illness by scrolling through social media feeds. She finds herself inundated with endless images of climate emergencies. Her doomscrolling leaves her depressed: \"She no longer knew if the fires were already over even though they hadn't yet really begun.\" </p><p>Through the glow of her smartphone, Anna sees \"Photos of ember blizzards. Smoke so thick you couldn't see across a road. Four thousand people ... gathered on a beach with the firefighters forming a cordon around to protect them.\"</p><p>In other scenes, she views image after image of animals injured in wildfires. For Anna, \"Summer was frightening. Smoke was frightening ... Choking was frightening.  Today was frightening. Tomorrow was terrifying, if we made it that far.\"  </p><p>However, like Stewart, Flanagan points to hope: Anna eventually connects with another character, Lisa, whose interest in environmental history and Indigenous fire practices offers an alternative to the isolating terror evoked by social media.</p><p>Flanagan ends the novel by rejecting both individualism and apocalyptic sensationalism.</p><p>The discovery of an endangered chick transforms the story from one of misery to one of hope. Lisa, who finds the tiny bird, suddenly sees the world not as hopelessly burning but as \"extraordinarily alive.\" When the novel ends, she is \"not downcast nor defeated,\" but inspired to connect more closely with the land and its inhabitants.</p><p>Human stories don't have to end with disaster and death. Instead, catastrophes can signal the beginning of something new, and reading about them can highlight regrowth and recovery in the midst of despair. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Grace Moore received funding from the Australian Research Council for her work on fire between 2013 and 2017 as part of project number CE110001011.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CONUSA-247545</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CONUSA2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DXB-VHM3-RSYN-W3K6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463575</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1105\"/><timeReceived>2:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Conversation - United States</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"6137\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"01\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>January 17, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

According to news reporting originating from Nanchong, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Planning the analyses of the spatial distribution and driving factors of forest fires and regionalizing fire risks is an important part of forest fire management.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China; Innovation Team Funds of China West Normal University. <br/> The news editors obtained a quote from the research from China West Normal University: \"Based on the Landsat-8 active fire dataset of the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture from 2014 to 2021, this paper proposes an optimal parameter logistic regression (OPLR) model, conducts forest fire risk zoning research under the optimal spatial analysis scale and model parameters, and establishes a forest fire risk prediction model. The results showed that the spatial unit of the optimal spatial analysis scale in the study area was 5 km and that the prediction accuracy of the OPLR was about 81%. The climate was the main driving factor of forest fires, while temperature had the greatest influence on the probability of forest fires.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"According to the forest fire prediction model, mapping the fire risk zoning, in which the medium- and high-risk area was 6021.13 km2, accounted for 9.99% of the study area. The results contribute to a better understanding of forest fire management based on the local environmental characteristics of the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture and provide a reference for related forest fire prevention and control management.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Forest Fire Driving Factors and Fire Risk Zoning Based on an Optimal Parameter Logistic Regression Model: A Case Study of the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, China.

The fire burned in both Waterford Township, Camden County, and Shamong Township, Burlington County.</p><p>No one was injured, and the cause remains under investigation. Forest Fire Service staff was still on the scene as of Thursday morning and will continue to monitor \"areas of concern\" until there is significant rain.</p><p>Officials say smoke may be visible for a while, and motorists should be aware of the hazard.</p><p>A nearly four-mile stretch of Jackson Road that was closed as firefighters battled the blaze reopened Wednesday night. However, Goshen Campground within the park will remain closed through Sunday. Burnt Mill, Goshen Pond, and Sleeper Creek trails will all remain closed until the State Park Service and Forest Fire Service clear them for reopening.</p><p>To fight the blaze, fire service crews used back-burning, a technique that uses deliberately set fires to contain fires by burning fuel the wildfire needs to expand.</p><p>The fire came during the height of wildfire season, which runs from mid-March through mid-May. It broke out the day after state officials sent a notice that there was an elevated risk for the spread of wildfires. In addition, the National Weather Service's Mount Holly office issued a special statement about the elevated risk for wildfires throughout the state.</p><p>The entire state is at high risk of fires because of low relative humidity, a buildup of dead wood on forest floors, and a lack of recent rain.</p><p>Officials say wildfire season has been expanding, and the blazes are a growing threat, especially as they near homes and businesses. The County Line Wildfire, while considered a major fire, was relatively small compared to some fires in recent years.</p><p>Last year, the Jimmy's Waterhole Fire tore through 3,859 acres of heavily forested South Jersey in Manchester Township, Ocean County, threatening scores of buildings before being brought under control. And a wildfire in 2022 grew to nearly 15,000 acres, the state's biggest since 2007. That fire also started in Wharton State Forest, forcing the closure of major recreation areas within the 1.1 million-acre Pinelands National Reserve.</p><p>Fires are, however, a natural part of the pine forest cycle.

According to news reporting originating from Patna, India, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"This work aims to address two major issues in forest fire management: accurate real-time forecast and end-to-end secured data delivery between validated entities. To do so, we introduce BSEIFFS, a secured and intelligent forest fire prediction architecture realized through the convergence of Blockchain technology, mist computing, edge computing and machine learning paradigms.\" </p><p><br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from the National Institute of Technology, \"The pro-posed architecture renders Blockchain-backed security and Support Vector Regression based wildfire prediction at the edge by offloading the execution overheads to containerized cloud applications. Two algorithms namely Uncorrelated Data Transmission (UDT) algorithm and Blockchain based Audit Trail validation (BAT) algorithm are proposed to reduce number of repetitive packet transmissions and rendering a lightweight Blockchain based identity validation scheme at the edge respectively. The prediction model is trained using real-world meteorological data and tested on a steel manufacturing facility where controlled combustion and quenching processes closely resemble fire and rain scenarios. Apart from the Google Cloud Platform, tools such as IBM NodeRed, Siemens IBA PDA softwares are used to implement the BSEIFFS architecture. Extensive experimentation and comparative evaluation are performed with relevant baseline approaches. BSEIFFS achieves a prediction accuracy of 98.61%, ROC AUC score of 0.9668 with 0.1127 as false positive rate. The BSEIFFS SVR predictor with rbf kernel (MAE = 1.840, RMSE = 5.728) performs better than similar baseline approaches. The proposed UDT algorithm causes 82.02% reduction in packet transmissions through the network. BSEIFFS also achieves atleast 44.84% lesser energy consumption, 11.91% higher throughput and 71.91% lesser roundtrip time in comparison with baseline approaches.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"BSEIFFS can massively extend the benefits of the imminent B5G/6G technologies to perform fine-grained and faster computations.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Bseiffs: Blockchain-secured Edge-intelligent Forest Fire Surveillance.

The global impact of land use changes on drought features and associated exposures to droughts, however, remains largely unknown. In this study, the changes of drought features are estimated by using the model simulations with and without land use change. We show that historical land use changes since 1850, mainly deforestation and crop expansion, has increased the drought frequency, duration, and severity over half of the global land area. Regions with greater activity tend to experience stronger exacerbation of drought events. Owing to their increasing frequency and prolonged duration, populations, croplands and forests are increasingly exposed to drought events, which poses serious potential impacts on human health, agriculture, and forest ecosystems. The enhanced drought events could be substantially alleviated by potential reforestation activity. Our results provide useful information for land-management-related policy-making.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Historical land use changes such as deforestation and crop expansion have increased the frequency, duration, and severity of droughts across more than half of the global land area since 1850, and more strongly in regions with greater activity, according to an analysis of climate model ensembles.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>Droughts refer to a period of abnormally dry weather that persists long enough to cause a serious hydrological imbalance1. Droughts can adversely impact various components of natural systems and economic sectors, including but not limited to the deterioration of the ecological environment and wildlife habitat2, reductions of crop yield3,4, water resources5 and hydropower generation6, as well as increasing risk of forest fires7,8. The latter can further undermine the ability of carbon uptake of terrestrial ecosystems and result in more emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, exacerbating climate change9,10.</p><p>Human activities and the resultant global warming have been identified as the main causes of the increasing frequency and intensity of drought events11, 12\u201313. The observed change, however, is the response of drought to all anthropogenic activities. One such activity is the land use and land cover change (LULCC), which manifests primarily as the expansion of croplands and pasturelands at the expense of natural forested and non-forested lands throughout history. Despite the dominant role of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the global climate, LULCC has been reported to have a greater impact than GHGs do on the regional hydrological cycle14. Biophysically, forests can boost evapotranspiration (ET), and thereby increasing precipitation (P) locally and in downwind regions15,16. Conversely, deforestation usually leads to reductions in P17.</p><p>While the important role of LULCC in modifying surface temperature18 and water resources19,20 has been recognized, how LULCC impacts drought characteristics is far from clear. Multiple reasons are responsible for this gap. First, there are no direct observational records of LULCC impact, as our observed signal is the climate response to the total anthropogenic and natural forcing agents, which is further complicated by internal variability from interannual to multidecadal timescales. It is nearly impossible to separate the impact of LULCC from pure observations alone. Second, in the limited observational studies, the impact of LULCC is usually quantified by comparing P observed at two adjacent land types, assuming the same background climate at both locations17,21. By equating the difference from observations made at the same time to changes of land use over time, these studies imply a space-for-time approach. A similar approach is to compare the hydroclimate conditions before and after LULCC at a fixed site22. The main limitation of this kind of study is that the results reveal direct effects of LULCC only, but miss the indirect effects arising from changes in circulation and climate feedback, as these effects were canceled out in the comparison. Besides, the changes in the mean state of P do not necessarily reflect the changes in the extreme climatic events, as changes in variability alone (e.g., longer dry spells) without changes in the mean state can substantially increase the occurrence of extreme hydrological events23, 24\u201325. Third, most published studies only considered the P deficit when analyzing LULCC-induced droughts26,27, neglecting the crucial role of temperature, ET, or potential evapotranspiration (PET), which have been shown to be equally important as P in modifying water balance24,28,29. Lastly, the potential impact of LULCC-induced drought on human society and agriculture (e.g., exposure) is rarely measured. Drought events impact human society mainly by affecting human health30, crop yield4, and natural ecosystem31. An estimation of exposure change could provide more information to evaluate drought impact and help to reduce the exposure of populations and croplands to drought risks32.</p><p>A global assessment of LULCC-induced changes on drought is still lacking, as most previous studies are focusing on regional scales, such as the Amazon or a river basin33, 34\u201335. However, the LULCC impact has been reported to be location dependent18,36. It is, therefore, not known whether the conclusions drawn at the regional scale are applicable to other regions. In addition, reforestation and forest-protection programs have been pledged worldwide (e.g., the Bonn Challenge) to combat water stress, desertification, and ecosystem degradation37. The impact of deforestation/reforestation on droughts, if any, can provide scientific guidance for policymakers planning reforestation projects.</p><p>In this study, we investigate the impact of historical LULCC since 1850 on meteorological drought from the perspective of its frequency, duration, severity, and intensity (see \u201cMethods\u201d section), aiming to bridge these knowledge gaps. To quantify the drought characteristics, the 3-month standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI), which considers roles of both P and PET in determining droughts, is employed in this study38. Our results show that historical LULCC has increased the frequency, duration, severity, and intensity of drought over half of the global land, and the exacerbation of drought events tends to occur in regions with stronger deforestation. The increasing drought frequency and intensity, however, could be substantially alleviated by reforestation and/or avoided deforestation. These findings provide scientific evidence to forest-related policymakers that, in addition to carbon uptake, reforestation can also provide hydrological benefits by alleviating drought events.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Results</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Historical LULCC</emphasis></p><p>Two sets of model simulations are employed in this study. The first simulation is the standard historical simulation (hist), which includes all anthropogenic (e.g., greenhouse gases and aerosols) and natural (solar and volcanic activity) forcings, as well as the evolving LULCC from 1850 to 2014. The second simulation is identical to the hist simulation but with LULCC fixed at the 1850 level (hist-noLu). The LULCC impact was quantified as the difference between the two simulations (hist minus hist-noLu; \u201cMethods\u201d section). Both simulations were run in coupled mode. Thus, the LULCC impact quantified here includes both the direct effects arising from changes in the surface energy balance and the indirect effects arising from climate feedback to LULCC. The period of 1950\u20132014 (65 years) was analyzed in this study. It is noted that historical LULCC does not modify the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide in both simulations; thus, only the biophysical effects related to changes in surface properties (e.g., albedo, aerodynamic roughness, and evapotranspiration efficiency) and associated atmospheric feedbacks are identified here.</p><p>Historical LULCC since 1850 has manifested mainly as the loss of primary and secondary land (psl, both forested and non-forested) and the concomitant expansion of cropland, pasture, and rangeland. Specifically, psl decreased by ~21.3% of the global land area (28.5 Mkm2) in 2014 relative to that in 1850, including roughly 6.6 Mkm2 forest loss. In the meantime, cropland (+6.4%), pasture (+3.5%), and rangeland (+10.7%) expanded extensively by the indicated fractions (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1).Fig. 1</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Historical land use and land cover change.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> Fractional change of psl in 1995\u20132014 relative to 1850. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis> Same as (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>), but for agricultural fields, which are combinations of crops, pastures, and rangelands. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis> Time series of the global land area fractions for each land use type in 1850\u20132014.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Global responses of drought events to LULCC</emphasis></p><p>In this study, drought events are identified based on the SPEI time series of each grid. The SPEI is a standardized index formulated based on P and PET (see \u201cMethods\u201d section), with negative (positive) values indicating surface dryness (wetness). For a given grid, a drought event was identified when the SPEI value was smaller than \u20131 for at least 3 consecutive months. The duration is defined as the number of months of each drought event. Severity is defined as the cumulative summation of the SPEI in absolute values in each month within a drought event. The intensity is defined as the mean severity of each month, which is estimated by dividing the severity by the duration. The frequency at each grid is the total number of drought events within the 65-year period. The drought events were identified at each grid in each model for both simulations. By taking their differences, the impact of LULCC was isolated.</p><p>Figure 2 shows the changes in the drought characteristics due to historical LULCC (model consistency is shown in Supplementary Fig. 2). About half of the global land (without Antarctica) shows increasing drought frequency, longer duration, enhanced severity and intensity in drought events (Fig. 2). Averaged globally, all four characteristics show positive changes, denoting an increase in drought frequency and the exacerbation of drought events. A substantial fraction of such positive changes is contributed by the changes from the deforested areas (grids with psl changes &lt;\u22125%). On the other hand, the reforested areas (grids with psl changes \u22655%) consistently show negative changes, indicating an alleviation of drought events. When spatially aggregated, the distributions also shifted significantly (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.001) in all four aspects of droughts. Taking frequency as an example (Supplementary Fig. 3), only 5% of the global land area has a mean frequency greater than 22 within the 65-year period in the hist-noLu experiment, whereas in the hist experiment, approximately 31% of the global land area has a frequency greater than 22. Similar results are also observed for intensity, duration, and severity, but are less pronounced for the latter two. When the drought events are binned by duration (Supplementary Fig. 4a), the frequency of drought in the hist simulation is higher than that in the hist-noLu simulation across all bins and statistically significant for events lasting 6 months or longer. Similarly, the drought frequency increased for all severity and intensity levels, except for those with a severity between 4 and 5 (Supplementary Fig. 4b, c). These analyses demonstrate that historical LULCC has increased the frequency of drought events at all timescales globally and exacerbated drought events at most severity levels.Fig. 2</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Changes in drought characteristics.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> Spatial patterns of multi-model mean (MMM) changes in drought frequency (left) and domain-averaged bar plot for deforestation grids, grids with no significant LULCC, reforestation grids, and all grids (right), with bars denoting the MMM values and error bars denoting the 95% confidence intervals (CIs). <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>\u2013<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis> Same as (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>), but for duration (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>), severity (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>), and intensity (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>).

Red boxes in (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>) delineate the 9 selected regions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Regional responses of drought events to LULCC</emphasis></p><p>To better evaluate the drought responses to LULCC, a closer examination is performed on a regional scale. 9 regions with substantial increases in the drought frequency are selected here (red boxes in Fig. 2a; the boundaries are listed in Supplementary Table 3). Supplementary Fig. 5 shows the spatially aggregated whisker plots for all four characteristics of the 9 regions. 5 out of these 9 regions, including South America, North Europe, India, Southeast Asia, and Australia, show significant changes in all four characteristics of droughts. Meanwhile, a few regions, such as East Asia, show significant changes only in frequency and limited changes in other aspects.</p><p>Figure 3 displays the joint probability distributions constructed based on duration and intensity for these regions. For each region, a bivariate kernel density is generated based on the MMM values of duration and intensity for all grids within the region. This analysis allows us to observe shifts in the distributions of drought characteristics that are not clearly visible in the mean change. We found that, according to a two-sample Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test, all 9 regions exhibited significant (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.001) shifts in the joint distributions. Specifically, all 9 regions show wider distributions of the drought intensity in the hist simulations, with changes found at both tails of the distributions. The shifts in duration, however, are not obvious in Central and Eastern North America, East Europe, and two Asian regions. Jointly, the distributions of all regions in the hist simulation (red) show a larger spread than those of the hist-noLu simulation (blue). Besides, the distributions in all regions except East Europe and East Asia shifted to the upper-right, indicating that the drought events in these 7 regions are getting both longer-lasting and more intense. At the same time, some regions, such as Central and Eastern North America, South America, and East Asia, also experience shorter and less intense droughts. The above analyses demonstrate that historical LULCC not only increased drought frequency in these regions but also altered the concurrent nature of duration and intensity, despite the negligible changes in the mean value.Fig. 3</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Joint probability distributions with and without LULCC.</emphasis></p><p>Joint probability distributions of drought duration and intensity from hist-noLu (blue) and hist (red) simulations for Central and Eastern North America (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>), South America (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>), North Europe (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>), East Europe (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>), Tropical Africa (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">e</emphasis>), India (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">f</emphasis>), East Asia (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">g</emphasis>), Southeast Asia (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">h</emphasis>), and Australia (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">i</emphasis>).

Regions with stronger deforestation activity (more negative psl fraction changes) tend to have larger increases in drought frequencies. On average, the change of drought frequency increases by 0.27 in response to every 10% loss in the psl fraction. Similar results are also observed for other characteristics -- deforestation generally results in a longer duration and stronger severity and intensity of drought events locally. Specifically, the changes in mean duration, severity, and intensity increase by 0.012 months, 0.035, and 0.003, respectively, in response to every 10% loss in the psl fraction (Fig. 4b\u2013d), demonstrating that deforestation tends to locally increase drought risk and exacerbate drought events.Fig. 4</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Changes in drought characteristics as a function of psl fraction changes.</emphasis></p><p>Changes in drought frequency (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>), duration (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>), severity (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>), and intensity (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>) binned by the fraction changes in primary and secondary land (psl) at intervals of 10%.

The inserted gray bar plot in (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>) is land fractions of each bin relative to the global land (without Antarctica) on a logarithmic scale.</p><p>The next question is how LULCC or deforestation activity increases drought frequency? The drought events in the current study are defined based on the standardized water deficit (P \u2212 PET) of the surface. Supplementary Fig. 6 shows the spatial changes in P, PET, and P \u2212 PET in MMM values. It is seen that all the regions featured with increasing frequency show strong decreases in P \u2212 PET (Supplementary Fig. 6c), with a pattern correlation of \u22120.70 (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.001). In some regions, the negative \u0394(P \u2212 PET) is mainly due to negative \u0394P, such as C.E. North America, whereas in other regions, \u0394PET plays a more dominant role, such as Tropical Africa and India. In general, deforestation tends to reduce P and increase PET, thereby decreasing P \u2212 PET. Such impact is more pronounced with increasing LULCC magnitude. Thus, the increased drought frequency reported here could be partially explained by the shift in the mean P \u2212 PET. It is noted that the mechanisms behind droughts are rather complex and intertwined with many components of the climate system. A lengthened interval between precipitation events without change in the mean value could possibly modify drought frequency and intensity24,25. The detailed mechanisms of drought changes are beyond the scope of this study.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Changes in exposure to droughts</emphasis></p><p>Given the increasing frequency and duration, it is expected that human and terrestrial ecosystems will experience more drought events and, consequently, more disturbances from droughts. In this section, we estimate the exposure of populations, croplands, and forests to drought events (\u201cMethods\u201d section), providing insights and implications for evaluating potential drought impacts on human health, agriculture, and terrestrial ecosystems, as well as the socio-economy.</p><p>Drought events can increase the risk of water-borne, vector-borne diseases, such as Diarrhea, due to the low availability of clean water39, and increase the risk of respiratory diseases through reduced air quality due to increased wildfires, erosion, and associated particulate matter30,40, posing serious health impacts on human society41. Using the gridded population data42 and the simulated response of drought frequency to LULCC, we estimated the population exposure to increasing drought frequency driven by historical LULCC in each grid cell. The results were then aggregated to the country/regional scale and are shown in Fig. 5a. Globally, the population exposure increased by ~11422 million person-months (mpm) per decade due to LULCC. Among the 220 countries/regions analyzed here, 105 countries/regions, which are home to 84% of the world\u2019s total population, show increasing exposure. Specifically, population exposure increased by 4400 mpm decade\u22121 and 2333 mpm decade\u22121 in India and China, respectively, making them the top two countries on the list. Nigeria, Indonesia, Brazil, and the USA also show substantial increases. The decreasing exposures are mainly seen in West Asia and South Europe regions, where the drought frequency mostly decreases in response to LULCC (Figs. 5a and 2a). When normalizing the total exposure by global population, a person experienced extra 1.6 months (~48 days) of drought per decade due to historical LULCC (Fig. 5b). At the country level, Paraguay shows the largest increase per capita, adding 9.2 months of drought per person every decade, which is followed by Uruguay (5.2 months person\u22121 decade\u22121), Gambia (4.2 months person\u22121 decade\u22121), and Nicaragua (4.1 months person\u22121 decade\u22121).Fig. 5</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Changes in exposure to drought events due to historical LULCC.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> Changes in total population exposure in each country per decade (left), along with the Top 10 countries ranked by changes in exposure.

Therefore, it is informative to examine the changes in crop exposure to increasing drought frequency. Altogether, the cropland exposure to droughts increased by 26.6 Mkm2 months decade\u22121, with India (5.5 Mkm2 months decade\u22121) and Brazil (3.2 Mkm2 months decade\u22121) leading the increases, followed by Nigeria, Argentina, China, and Australia (Fig. 5c).</p><p>Another ecosystem that is sensitive to drought disturbances is the forest. Drought events can severely reduce carbon uptake31,52 and increase the risk of forest fires8,53, both of which can increase the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere and further amplify global warming. Globally, the forest exposure increases by 28.5 Mkm2 months decade\u22121 (Fig. 5d), with the largest increases found in Russia (5.4 Mkm2 months decade\u22121) and Brazil (5.2 Mkm2 months decade\u22121). Forests in the USA, China, Indonesia, and Congo (Kinshasa) are also increasingly exposed to drought events.</p><p>In addition to the total exposure changes, we also analyzed the relative changes in exposure, in which the total exposure changes were scaled by the total exposure in the hist-noLu simulation (Fig. 6). The global mean relative increases in exposure are 13.6%, 14.3%, and 6.5% for population, crop, and forests, respectively. Overall, the countries in South America and tropical Africa are more sensitive to historical LULCC than the countries in other regions. Paraguay has the highest relative change in all three respects. Uruguay, Argentina, Nigeria, Thailand, and Australia also show high relative changes in exposure.Fig. 6</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Relative changes in exposure to drought events due to historical LULCC.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> Relative changes in total population exposure in each country per decade (left), along with the Top 10 countries ranked by relative changes in exposure.

Some countries only had moderate LULCC activity, but experienced much larger increases in exposure, such as Philippines and Vietnam in total population exposure (Fig. 5a) and Papua New Guinea in total forest exposure (Fig. 5d). On the other hand, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, and Mexico has the 5th, 8th, and 9th largest LULCC among all countries, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 7), but they are not on any of the list, implying an inequality between the LULCC implementers and consequence sufferers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Impact of potential reforestation</emphasis></p><p>The above analyses illustrate that historical LULCC has increased drought risk and exacerbated drought events, especially in the deforested areas. The last question is whether reforestation can alleviate the drought conditions. To answer this question, we estimated the drought characteristics in two sets of model simulations with and without reforestation under the shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) 3-7.0 scenario54 (\u201cMethods\u201d section). The SSP3-7.0 scenario represents a medium-to-high emission pathway for the 21st century, with a global mean temperature rise of ~2.8 K in 2100 relative to that in 202055. Globally, the land area fraction of psl will decrease from 52.3% in 2014 to 47.0% in 2100 under the standard SSP3-7.0 simulation but increase to 54.5% by 2100 for the reforestation simulation (Supplementary Fig. 8). Differences between these two simulations (SSP3-7.0 with reforestation minus the standard SSP3-7.0) isolate the impact of potential reforestation on droughts under a warming climate.</p><p>The impacts of reforestation on drought conditions are shown in Fig. 7 and the model consistencies are shown in Supplementary Fig. 9. Specifically, approximately half of the global land area shows decreasing drought frequency due to reforestation, and statistically significant changes are observed in tropical Africa, Eastern North America and India where large reforestation activities occur (Fig. 7a). On the whole, the global land shows decreasing drought frequency with statistical significance at the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> = 0.05 level, which is largely contributed by reforestation grids (Fig. 7a, bar plot). Similar results are also observed for duration, severity, and intensity (Fig. 7b\u2013d), but are not statistically significant. When binned by duration, severity and intensity, the frequency from reforestation simulations also shows decreases over most timescales and levels (Supplementary Fig. 10). Similar to historical results, the drought conditions tend to be mitigated in reforested regions and exacerbated in deforested regions (Fig. 7 and Supplementary Fig. 11). In summary, reforestation and/or avoided deforestation can substantially lower drought risk and alleviate drought events under a warming climate.Fig. 7</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Changes in drought characteristics due to potential reforestation under the SSP3-7.0 scenario.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> Spatial patterns of multi-model mean (MMM) changes in drought frequency (left) and domain-averaged bar plot for deforestation grids, grids with no significant LULCC, reforestation grids and all grids (right), with bars denoting the MMM values and error bars denoting the 95% confidence intervals (CIs). <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>\u2013<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis> Same as (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>), but for duration (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>), severity (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>), and intensity (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>).

Asterisks in the bar plot indicate significant changes at the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> = 0.05 level.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Discussion</emphasis></p><p>Using the latest coupled model simulations with and without historical LULCC, our study reveals that historical LULCC has increased the SPEI-based drought frequency and exacerbated drought events in duration, severity, and intensity on both global and regional scales. More longer-lasting and more intense drought events are observed in some regions, such as India and South America, owing to historical LULCC. The deterioration of drought events tends to occur in regions with strong deforestation activity. The increasing drought frequency significantly increased the exposure of populations, croplands, and forests to droughts, posing serious potential impacts on human health, agriculture, and forest ecosystems. Further analyses demonstrate that reforestation has the potential to alleviate drought conditions. This provides a scientific foundation and guidance for forest-related policymakers. The spatial patterns in the changes of drought frequency (Fig. 2) and mean P \u2212 PET (Supplementary Fig. 6) reported here are qualitatively consistent with one recent evaluation, in which large-scale idealized deforestation causes reductions in the mean SPEI and thus, a drying surface56. However, the results could not be further compared due to different metrics used. Moreover, different locations and magnitudes of deforestation, as well as different timescales of model integration, all contribute to discrepancies. Compared with the idealized deforestation simulations, our evaluation represents a more realistic LULCC impact and provides more accurate information to local policymakers.</p><p>Several implications could be drawn from this study. First, most policymakers only pay attention to carbon uptake and local temperature cooling57,58 when planting trees to mitigate climate change59. Our results demonstrate that reforestation could also provide hydrological benefits by alleviating drought conditions in climate mitigation, which should be considered in future land management policy-making. Second, the inequality between LULCC performers and sufferers (Fig. 5) indicates a non-negligible role of indirect effects of LULCC arising from changes in circulations and the background climate60,61. To put it differently, a country/region that plans to perform reforestation should consider not only the hydrological effects within its borders but also the effects it may cause in remote countries/regions19. Conversely, the consequence of reforestation within its borders is also subject to the impact of LULCC activity in remote regions. Third, the historical LULCC activities are mainly characterized by deforestation and concomitant crop expansion. However, ironically, this process can simultaneously reduce crop yield and degrade the remaining forests through the biophysical effects of droughts (Fig. 5). To compensate for the loss of crop yield, it is imperative to increase crop yield per unit area with more innovative agricultural technology and sustainable land management policies. Otherwise, we need to clear forests for more cropland, which will further exacerbate the climate.</p><p>Three limitations exist in the current study. First, the magnitude of LULCC-induced forcing is much smaller than that of GHGs and aerosols62. This leads to limited impacts on a global scale (Fig. 2), limited land fractions with significant changes, and model consistency (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 9). Statistically significant changes are only observed in some regions, such as South America and tropical Africa. It is acknowledged that such a low signal-to-noise ratio adds uncertainties to our results. We stress that future LULCC studies should focus more on regional scales where the LULCC signal is significant (e.g., regions with strong LULCC activity). The second issue is associated with irrigation, a water management practice that can change the surface energy budget (including ET), temperature, near-surface humidity, and precipitation63,64. The joint changes in these variables may further modify drought characteristics via changes in P and PET. Among the 11 models used in this study, only the CESM2 model has active irrigation. Therefore, the remaining models that do not consider the irrigation process may under- or overestimate the biophysical effect of LULCC on droughts. Third, current models are still unable to perfectly represent the biophysical effects of forest cover changes, which may bias the simulated effects on ET65,66 and, subsequently, P and P \u2212 PET16. Despite these limitations, our multi-model ensemble study still provides useful information on how LULCC modifies the water cycle biophysically. Future studies with irrigation and more realistic representations of biophysical processes are needed to provide a more complete assessment.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Materials and methods</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CMIP6 model output</emphasis></p><p>Eleven models (one realization per model) participating in both the Climate Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6)67 and Land Use Model Inter-comparison Project (LUMIP)68 are employed in this study. For each model, two experiments are used to quantify the impact of historical LULCC. The first experiment is a standard historical simulation that includes all anthropogenic forcings (e.g., greenhouse gases, aerosols, and LULCC) and natural forcings (e.g., solar and volcanic forcings). The second is the hist-noLu simulation, in which all forcings are identical to those in the historical experiment but with land use fixed at the 1850 level. The LULCC data in all CMIP6 models are prescribed by the Land-Use Harmonization dataset69. It is worth noting that not all models can fully adopt this LULCC data due to different classification schemes for land cover; thus, the LULCC implemented in each model has different levels of complexity, depending on the model's needs and configurations. All simulations were run in fully coupled mode from 1850 to 2014, and the period of 1950\u20132014, 65 years in total, is chosen for analyses in this study. The detailed information of each model is listed in Supplementary Table 1. Notably, the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases in both experiments are identical and are not influenced by historical LULCC. Differences between the two experiments are solely attributed to the biophysical effects of historical LULCC.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Model performance evaluation</emphasis></p><p>CMIP6 models have been widely used in the climate community70. However, it is still necessary to evaluate the performance of the model simulations for the main variables used in this study. We compared some selected variables from the hist simulation against observational data. The variables selected for comparison are those used for estimating P \u2212 PET (see below), such as temperature, humidity, and radiation. The comparison was performed based on 30-year mean values over 1985\u20132014 from observational records and the CMIP6 output (Supplementary Fig. 12). In general, the models can reproduce the observed climatology reasonably well for most of the variables examined here. The correlation coefficients (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">r</emphasis>) between the MMM values and observational values are larger than 0.80 for all the selected variables and larger than 0.95 for temperature and surface radiation. The <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">r</emphasis> between the MMM and the observed P \u2212 PET is close to 0.90. Given this evaluation outcome, it is suitable to utilize these models in our analyses.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Calculation of the standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI)</emphasis></p><p>In this study, we employed the SPEI to identify drought events and assess drought characteristics. The SPEI has the advantages of flexible timescales and the inclusion of the impact of background climate change on drought, which has been widely used in drought analyses12,71, 72, 73\u201374. The SPEI is a standardized time series of surface water balance, defined as P \u2212 PET, in which P is precipitation and PET is the potential evapotranspiration. The latter is the evapotranspiration under the condition without water limitation, which is estimated by the Food and Agricultural Organization Penman\u2013Monteith method75:1where  is in mm day\u22121,  is the slope of the vapor pressure curve (kPa \u00b0C\u22121),  is the surface net radiation (MJ m\u22121 day\u22121),  is the soil heat flux (MJ m\u22121 day\u22121),  is the psychometric constant (kPa \u00b0C\u22121),  is the 2 m air temperature (\u00b0C),  is the surface wind speed (m s\u22121),  is the near-surface saturation vapor pressure (kPa), and  is the actual vapor pressure (kPa).</p><p>For each grid cell in each month, the 3-month cumulative <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PET</emphasis> were first obtained by summing all values of that month and the preceding two months. For example, the cumulative <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> in March 1960 is the summation of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> from January 1960 to March 1960. Then, the water deficit on a monthly scale (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">D</emphasis>) is calculated as follows:2where  is the 3-month cumulative water deficit in month .  are 3-month cumulative <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PET</emphasis>, respectively, in month <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">m</emphasis>. The monthly anomalies of D were then obtained by subtracting the monthly climatology from each month at each grid. Previous analysis indicates that the best fitted probability distribution of hydrological variables varies grid by grid76. Considering the different model simulations from different scenarios used in this study, a nonparametric approach76 is used in this study instead of fitting the data into the log-logistic distribution38. This approach generates comparable standardized indices from different simulations with different background climates, and was applied by Chiang et al.12. The monthly D anomalies of each grid in the hist-noLu simulation are first ranked following Gringorten77:3where <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> is the empirical probability of each D value, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> is the rank, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> is the sample size, which is 778 in this case (65 \u00d7 12\u20132, there are no <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">D</emphasis> values in the first two months). 0.44 and 0.12 are two empirical coefficients. The empirical probability  was then translated into the standardized index (SI) using the standard normal distribution function:4where  is the SPEI that will be used for analysis. For the hist simulations, the monthly D anomalies were ranked against the hist-noLu simulation to obtain the SPEI values. We used the 3-month SPEI in the current analysis because the 3-month SPEI is capable of capturing seasonal drought events. In addition, we also repeated our analysis with the 6-month SPEI (Supplementary Figs. 13 and 14), and the results are essentially similar to those of the 3-month SPEI.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Drought identification, PDF construction, and frequency change</emphasis></p><p>For a given grid, a drought event was identified when the SPEI value was smaller than \u20131 for at least 3 consecutive months. The duration is defined as the number of months of each drought event. Severity is defined as the cumulative sum of the SPEI absolute value during a drought event. The intensity is defined as the mean severity of each month within a drought event, which is estimated by dividing the severity by the duration. The frequency at each grid is the total number of drought events within the 65-year period. The drought events were identified at each grid in each model for both simulations. Then the duration, frequency, severity, and intensity were averaged across all events to obtain the mean value of each grid.</p><p>To compare the drought frequency for hist and hist-noLu simulations in more detail, we showed the drought frequency grouped by duration, severity and intensity, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 4. In the hist-noLu simulation, we first estimated the total number of drought events by aggregating all the drought events in all land grids in each model, in which the drought events of each grid were weighted by grid area. The frequency for each bin is then obtained by dividing the total number of drought events within that bin by the total number of drought events across all the grids. Notably, the frequency in the hist simulation was estimated against the total number of drought events in hist-noLu for comparison. This process was repeated for all the models, and the MMM values are shown.</p><p>The probability distribution functions (PDFs) of each drought feature (Supplementary Fig. 3) were constructed with the spatially aggregated MMM values to examine how historical LULCC has impacted the distribution of each drought characteristic. The PDFs were estimated by fitting a kernel density estimate to the land grids for both the hist and hist-noLu simulations separately. A similar approach was applied to the bivariate distribution constructed from the MMM values of duration and intensity (Fig. 3).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Impact of LULCC on drought</emphasis></p><p>The LULCC impact, denoted as \u0394 or change, was quantified as differences in the same variables between the two simulations in each model. Taking the drought frequency as an example, the impact of LULCC on frequency is defined as:5</p><p>In Equation [5], \u0394 is the change in drought frequency due to the impact of LULCC, and the overbars represent the mean value of 1950\u20132014. The changes in other drought characteristics, such as duration and intensity, as well as other meteorological variables (e.g., P and PET), were estimated similarly by replacing the frequency in Equation [5] with the corresponding variables.</p><p>These differences were computed for each grid cell in each model and then averaged to obtain the multi-model mean (MMM) values, with an equal weighting factor assigned to each model. All model outputs were bilinearly resampled to a common spatial resolution of 0.94\u00b0 \u00d7 1.25\u00b0 in latitude and longitude before data processing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Significance test</emphasis></p><p>A bootstrap technique was used to test whether the MMM values are significantly different from zero at the grid-cell level. The 11 model values were sampled 11 times randomly with replacement to obtain a mean value. The process was repeated 1000 times to construct a 95% confidence interval (CI) (function <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">bootci</emphasis> in MATLAB). The MMM changes are considered significant if zero falls outside the confidence interval. An advantage of this technique is that it does not require the results of the 11 models to be normally distributed. This approach was also applied to the binned frequency in Supplementary Fig. 4 to examine whether the frequency differences between hist and hist-noLu are statistically significant. To test whether the distributions of drought characteristics from hist-noLu and hist simulations are significantly different (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 3), a two-sample Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test was used to determine the statistical significance.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Exposure to drought</emphasis></p><p>To evaluate the potential impact of drought on populations, croplands, and forests due to LULCC activity, the exposure of populations, croplands, and forests to drought events was estimated. Taking population exposure as an example, the exposure () at each grid was estimated as:6</p><p>In Equation [6], N is the total number of months in drought events within the 65-year period, and  is the total population of this grid. To eliminate the change in the population over the 65-year period, the population in 2010 was used in the estimation of exposure. The exposure was estimated separately for the hist and hist-noLu simulations. The impact of LULCC was then obtained by taking the differences between the two simulations (hist minus hist-noLu). The results were divided by 6,500,000 to obtain exposure per decade (million person-months), as shown in Fig. 5. The relative changes in exposure were estimated by scaling the total exposure changes with the exposure in the hist-noLu simulations (Fig. 6). The exposures of cropland and forest are estimated similarly by replacing the population data with areas of cropland and forest in 2010 in each grid. The gridded crop and forest data are from the Land-Use Harmonization 2 (LUH2)69. The gridded results were then aggregated to the country/region level. The 95% CI was estimated with the same bootstrap technique as described above.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Impact of reforestation on drought (SSP3-7.0 data analysis)</emphasis></p><p>To evaluate the impact of LULCC under a warming climate, the shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP3-7.0) simulation from the Scenario Model Intercomparison Project54 and the SSP370-126Lu simulation from the LUMIP project are used. The standard SSP3-7.0 scenario represents a medium-to-high emission path with substantial deforestation and limited climate mitigation policies. Under this scenario, the radiative forcing is approximately 7.0 W m\u22122 at the top of the atmosphere by the end of the 21st century relative to 1850, and the global mean temperature is about 2.8 K warmer than the current level. The simulation covers the period of 2015\u20132100, with all anthropogenic forcings and LULCC. The SSP370-126Lu simulation is identical to the SSP3-7.0, but LULCC is adapted from the SSP1-2.6 scenario. SSP1-2.6 represents the low-emission developing pathway with strong climate mitigation policies and aims to constrain the global mean temperature change below 2 K by 2100 relative to 1850. In this scenario, forests are substantially recovered at the expense of fraction loss in agricultural land (crop, pasture, and rangeland). Consequently, the SSP370-126Lu simulation represents the reforestation version of SSP3-7.0. The land use data is also prescribed by the Land-Use Harmonization dataset69. Again, the concentrations of greenhouse gases in both simulations are the same, and the LULCC impact identified here is also a pure biophysical effect.</p><p>By the time of this study, seven models that archived both SSP3-7.0 and SSP370-126Lu simulations are used for the analysis of future response. The availability of models is listed in Supplementary Table 2. One realization per model is employed. The output of 2036\u20132100 (65-year period) is used for data analyses to keep consistency with the historical analyses. The SPEI values are calculated similarly to those of historical analyses, and the monthly D anomalies of both SSP3-7.0 and SSP370-126Lu were ranked against the hist-noLu simulation to obtain comparable SPEI values as in Equation [3]. Then, the impact of reforestation (e.g., Fig. 7) is estimated as follows:7</p><p>The impact of reforestation on other drought characteristics is estimated similarly by replacing frequency in Equation [7] with duration, severity, and intensity.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>T.T. and J.-J.C. acknowledge the support from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant E366161601 and E466301601).

Great Mississippi Flood</p><p>Fotosearch/Getty Images</p><p>Location: Mississippi River Valley</p><p>Disaster type: Flood</p><p>Death toll: 250 - 500 (estimated)</p><p>Damage cost: $400 million (1927 dollars)</p><p>Presidential Response</p><p>General Photographic Agency/Hulton Archive/Getty Images</p><p>While death toll estimates vary considerably, the 1927 'Great Mississippi Flood' was undoubtedly the worst river flood in American history. Over 27,000 square miles of the country were buried in as much as 30 feet of water, and the flood lasted for multiple months. The damages would cost more than $17 billion in 2025 dollars.</p><p>Like many Presidents of the era, President Calvin Coolidge took little action and decided to pass on responsibility to then-Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover. Coolidge famously refused to visit the region and show support to residents. He emphasized his belief that the federal government should be 'small' and that natural disasters were the responsibility of locals. However, the public reaction to Coolidge's lack of empathy led to the 1928 Flood Control Act, which Coolidge signed.</p><p>9. Sea Islands Hurricane</p><p>American Red Cross / Wikimedia Commons</p><p>Location: South Carolina, Georgia</p><p>Disaster type: Hurricane</p><p>Death toll: 1,000 - 2,000 (estimated)</p><p>Damage cost: $10 million (1893 dollars)</p><p>Presidential Response</p><p>Public Domain / Wikimedia Commons</p><p>Striking the Sea Island area around Savannah, Georgia, on August 27, 1893, the Sea Islands hurricane is considered the 7th deadliest storm in US history. Killing as many as 2,000 people, the storm greatly affected the African American communities in the area and, in some cases, destroyed generations' worth of families. The disaster emphasized racial undertones in the US at the time, and little aid was sent to the affected areas as a result.</p><p>President Grover Cleveland reacted by stating that the federal government wouldn't be sending help for a local disaster. Instead, he maintained his belief that any assistance was the responsibility of the Red Cross and the affected states. The storm only worsened already deep racial wounds in the area.</p><p>8. Hurricane Katrina</p><p>Ethan Miller / Getty Images News via Getty Images</p><p>Location: Gulf Coast with a primary focus on New Orleans, Louisiana</p><p>Disaster type: Hurricane</p><p>Death toll: 1,392</p><p>Damage cost: $125 billion (2005 dollars)</p><p>Presidential Response</p><p>imaginewithme / Getty Images</p><p>One of the most destructive storms to play out in the early days of social media, Hurricane Katrina's widespread destruction led to 24/7 news coverage. Everything in the Gulf Coast area, including tourism, shipping, oil, and other industries, was widely affected, causing tens of billions in damage and lost revenue.</p><p>Unfortunately, President George W. Bush was criticized for not allowing his administration to act quickly enough to help those in need. Residents were stranded on the roofs of their homes in heavily flooded areas, and FEMA could not bring in enough resources to help as quickly as the area needed. Bush would see his approval rankings bottom out after his storm response was widely criticized.</p><p>7. Peshtigo Fire</p><p>Royalbroil / Wikimedia Commons</p><p>Location: Peshtigo, Wisconsin</p><p>Disaster type: Wildfire</p><p>Death toll: 1,500 - 2,500 (estimated)</p><p>Damage cost: $5 million (1871 dollars)</p><p>Presidential response</p><p>Public Domain / Wikimedia Commons</p><p>A large forest fire that began on October 8, 1871, in northern Wisconsin burned over 1.2 million acres. The town of Peshtigo was the most affected area, and as many as 2,500 people died in the aftermath. Famously, the fire occurred on the same day as the Great Chicago Fire.</p><p>President Ulysses S. Grant mused enough support to send in US Army supplies but did little else, as much of the federal government's response focused on Chicago. Survivors of the fire heavily relied on whatever local aid could provide and friends and neighbors who could help. There is little debate that Grant's lack of response showed disinterest in rural areas that were not wealthy or had many votes.</p><p>6. Cheniere Caminada Hurricane</p><p>Public Domain / Wikimedia Commons</p><p>Location: Cheniere Caminada, Louisiana</p><p>Disaster type: Hurricane</p><p>Death toll: 2,000</p><p>Damage cost: $5 million (1893 dollars)</p><p>President Response</p><p>Public Domain / Wikimedia Commons</p><p>Believed to be the third most deadly hurricane ever to have hit the United States, more than 2,000 Americans died from storm surge as the Cheniere Caminada hurricane finally made landfall. During the 10th hurricane of the 1893 season, property was destroyed en masse, along with 60% of the orange crop that was local to the area.</p><p>President Grover Cleveland was once again hindered in his response by the idea that local natural disasters were not yet a federal issue. The Red Cross was the primary support system for affected residents, and Cleveland took little federal action to support the Red Cross.</p><p>5. Johnstown Flood</p><p>Zack Frank / Shutterstock.com</p><p>Location: Johnstown, Pennsylvania</p><p>Disaster type: Flood</p><p>Death toll: 2,209</p><p>Damage cost: $17 million (1889 dollars)</p><p>Presidential Response</p><p>Zack Frank / Shutterstock.com</p><p>In 1889, near Johnstown, Pennsylvania, the collapse of the South Fork Dam enabled more than 20 million tons of water to flood the area in and around Johnstown. Over 2,200 people were killed, and as a result, it made it so that the town rarely existed. Unfortunately, this incident is remembered as a man-made tragedy due to poor construction on the dam itself.</p><p>President Benjamin Harrison was criticized for his response. He was yet another president who believed natural disaster aid should be limited to the state level. Harrison hoped that the Red Cross could handle most of the necessary assistance any survivors would need. As a result, he left those who were already suffering to suffer, as it took a long time to rally private aid to help rebuild.</p><p>4. Okeechobee Hurricane</p><p>Public Domain / Wikimedia Commons</p><p>Location: Florida and Puerto Rico</p><p>Disaster type: Hurricane</p><p>Death toll: 2,823</p><p>Damage cost: $100 million (1928 dollars)</p><p>Presidential Response</p><p>Public Domain / Wikimedia Commons</p><p>Known as the San Felipe Segundo hurricane, the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane is considered one of the most deadly storms in American history. A category five hurricane, an estimated 2,500 Americans were killed, mainly in Florida, when the storm finally made landfall. Winds were said to exceed more than 160 miles per hour and arrived without warning, destroying homes and crops and creating floods all over Florida.</p><p>In response to the disaster, Calvin Coolidge did not consider the federal government a priority for assistance. Instead, he believed the Red Cross and the state of Florida should take the lead, which was his administration's stance. The result is that recovering from the storm took Florida longer than necessary and left many Americans desperate for help, which took months to arrive.</p><p>3. Hurricane Maria</p><p>Photo Spirit / Shutterstock.com</p><p>Location: Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands</p><p>Disaster type: Hurricane</p><p>Death toll: 2,982 (estimated)</p><p>Damage cost: $91.6 billion (2017 dollars)</p><p>Presidential Response</p><p>RaiPhoto / Shutterstock.com</p><p>The most modern natural disaster on this list, the island of Puerto Rico, was devastated in 2017 when Hurricane Maria, a category four storm, hit. The storm almost immediately took power from the whole island. Still, it also destroyed homes and roads and made it incredibly difficult for first responders to access much of the island.</p><p>In response to the damage Puerto Rico suffered, President Donald Trump was heavily criticized for being slow to act. His act of throwing paper towels to those in need of help became more of a meme than it did any actual good. As a result, Congress was forced to act and provide additional aid to the island to restore critical infrastructure like hospitals without support from the president.</p><p>2. San Francisco Earthquake</p><p>Everett Collection / Shutterstock.com</p><p>Location: San Francisco, California</p><p>Disaster type: Earthquake</p><p>Death toll: 3,000 plus (estimated)</p><p>Damage cost: $400 million (1906 dollars)</p><p>Presidential Response</p><p>Everett Collection / Shutterstock.com</p><p>One of the most devastating earthquakes in American history, the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake, is a textbook example of how a president should act. The earthquake itself was recorded as a 7.9-magnitude quake, and when it struck, it all but leveled what historians believe is close to 80% of San Francisco through either buildings collapsing or fires.</p><p>In the quake's aftermath, more than 250,000 San Franciscans were homeless. President Theodore Roosevelt wasted no time decisively acting and sent the US Army to aid local first responders. The $2.5 million in emergency funds he was able to secure from Congress, along with private donations he rallied, would help rebuild San Francisco into the bustling metropolis it is today.</p><p>1. Galveston Hurricane</p><p>Public Domain / Wikimedia</p><p>Location: Galveston, Texas</p><p>Disaster type: Hurricane</p><p>Death toll: 6,000 - 12,000 (estimated)</p><p>Damage cost: $34 million (1900 dollars)</p><p>Presidential Response</p><p>Public Domain / Flickr</p><p>Widely regarded as one of the worst natural disasters ever to hit the United States, the hurricane decimated the city of Galveston with a 15-foot storm surge and up to 145 mph winds. As a result, over 25% of the town's residents in 1900 were wiped out.</p><p>Homes and businesses alike were destroyed, and in the aftermath, President William McKinley was criticized for being slow to act. Instead of taking the reins through the federal government, cleanup and recovery were left to local leaders who were still reeling from the disaster. McKinley was widely criticized for not focusing on domestic issues and keeping his focus on foreign priorities.</p><p>Get Ready To Retire (Sponsored)</p><p>Start by taking a quick retirement quiz from SmartAsset that will match you with up to 3 financial advisors that serve your area and beyond in 5 minutes, or less.</p><p>Each advisor has been vetted by SmartAsset and is held to a fiduciary standard to act in your best interests.</p><p>Here's how it works:</p><p>1.  <url normalizedValue=\"https://247wallst.com/go/smartasset?utm_source=247wallst&amp;utm_campaign=SA_AdvisorPitch1&amp;utm_content=desktop%7C%7C1479835&amp;utm_term=247wallst&amp;utm_medium=eoaCTALink&amp;tpid=1479835&amp;tc=in_content&amp;tv=link\">Answer SmartAsset advisor match quiz</url></p><p>2.

The fire sparked hours after fire crews started to achieve some containment on the Hughes Fire, which spread rapidly Wednesday afternoon in a Los Angeles County suburb.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An\u00a0evacuation warning\u00a0for the brush fire was issued for some residents in Sherman Oaks around 11:40 p.m. Wednesday - the warning has since been lifted, but smoke could be seen in the area near locations including campuses for UCLA and for Mount Saint Mary's University-Los Angeles. Also nearby are the Getty Center, whose spokesperson told the Los Angeles Times it implemented fire protection protocols, as well as pricey real estate valued in the tens of millions of dollars, according to local listings.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Sepulveda Fire has burned roughly 40 acres,\u00a0according to the Los Angeles Fire Department. Firefighters will remain on scene throughout the morning and work to eliminate any remaining hot spots.</p><p>\"Air support and other aggressive actions have been deployed to fight a new fire just east of the 405,\" Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass\u00a0said on social media.</p><p>Fire engines lined the roads below the blaze as water-dropping aircraft operated overhead,\u00a0CNN affiliate KCAL/KCBS reported.</p><p>The fire threat remains critical in Southern California, where thousands of residents were under evacuation orders Wednesday as fire crews battled the out-of-control Hughes Fire near Castaic.</p><p>The fire - impacting both Los Angeles and Ventura counties - had burned more than 10,000 acres and is 14% contained as of Thursday morning,\u00a0according to\u00a0the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. No structures have been reported damaged or destroyed, Los Angeles County Fire Department Chief Anthony Marrone said at a Wednesday evening news conference.</p><p>The unincorporated community of Castaic is about 15 miles northwest of the city of Santa Clarita and borders the Angeles National Forest. Approximately 31,000 residents in the area are under evacuation orders, while 23,000 are under evacuation warnings, according to Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna.</p><p>\"We have over 4,000 firefighting personnel assigned to the incident,\" Marrone said, noting the \"robust\" ground and air response to the fire. \"The situation remains dynamic and the fire remains a difficult fire to contain, although we are getting the upper hand,\" Marrone added.</p><p>The Hughes Fire started just before 11 a.m. Wednesday near Castaic Lake, north of where fire crews are working to fully contain the\u00a0Palisades\u00a0and\u00a0Eaton\u00a0Fires that have scorched more than 40,000 acres and left at least 28 dead since they began January 7.</p><p>The fire is \"a completely different beast\" to the Palisades and Eaton Fires, LA County Fire Capt. Sheila Kelliher told CNN's Laura Coates Thursday. Two weeks ago, firefighters faced extreme challenges as powerful winds grounded aerial support.</p><p>Current conditions are more favorable, with calmer winds allowing the fire department's helicopters to carry out water drops throughout the night, Kelliher said.</p><p>When asked about potential water supply issues, Kelliher said that today's crews are fortunate to have direct access to Castaic Lake and other nearby reservoirs for their firefighting efforts.</p><p>Robert Garcia, Angeles National Forest fire chief, said Wednesday, \"The conditions that we're under aren't as severe as what we've been facing over the last week or two, but what you saw (Wednesday) is indicative of the conditions that we're in, in terms of the vegetation.\"</p><p>The area where the fire is burning is known for its dry, grassy hills, fire officials added, making the fire conditions there \"critical,\" according to Garcia.</p><p>\"Certainly, we are not out of the woods yet,\" said Cal Fire Chief Joe Tyler on Wednesday. Evacuees should follow the directions of local law enforcement and first responders as they are asked to evacuate the area, Tyler noted.</p><p>The National Weather Service extended a red flag warning through Friday morning for most of Los Angeles and Ventura counties as Santa Ana winds continue to move through the area, Marrone said.</p><p>The winds are expected to intensify across Southern California, peaking late Wednesday into early Thursday. While forecasts indicate a decrease in strength by Thursday afternoon, conditions will still be strong enough to sustain fire weather concerns through Friday morning.</p><p>\"Dangerous fire weather conditions will persist through Friday as fuels remain extremely dry and ready to burn, with Thursday the period of greatest concern. Any fire that starts can grow fast and out of control,\" the National Weather Service in Los Angeles said.</p><p>Schools and jail evacuated as Hughes Fire poses risks</p><p>A\u00a0county jail\u00a0in Castaic has been partially evacuated, according to a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The jail is just south of the fire area and can hold as many as 4,295 inmates.</p><p>Approximately 470 inmates were evacuated from one of the three facilities on the campus and moved to another part of the detention center, Luna said, adding that the other two facilities are \"structured much better\" than the one that was evacuated.</p><p>\"We do have a plan in place ... to evacuate the rest of the inmates on the entire facility if we absolutely had to,\" Luna said, without providing details.</p><p>Meanwhile, all students who attend Castaic Middle School and Castaic High School were evacuated Wednesday to a Ralph's supermarket parking lot, according to the California Highway Patrol. Students from North Lake Elementary were evacuated to the Castaic Sports Complex,\u00a0the agency said on X.</p><p>The Valencia and Canyon Country campuses of College of the Canyons have been closed as a \"precautionary measure\" because of the Hughes Fire, the college said on its\u00a0website.</p><p>Smoke was visible as far south as the city of Oxnard, about 50 miles southwest of Castaic in Ventura County, city officials\u00a0said on social media\u00a0Wednesday.</p><p>The fire will likely spread toward the south and west, away from where it started, according to data and forecast models from thermal intelligence company Orora Technologies. Castaic is in considerable danger of being affected by spreading flames, the models show.</p><p>Satellite data used by Orora Technologies first detected a hotspot just north of Castaic Lake at 10:45 a.m. Officials with Cal Fire said they first detected a fire at 10:53 a.m.</p><p>The area where the fire started and is currently burning is largely shrub and grassland, with some limited forested areas, additional data from Orora Technologies shows.</p><p>Thick brush in the area is serving as fuel for the rapid fire spread, according to Angeles National Forest spokesperson Dana Dierkes.</p><p>\"We're in fairly steep conditions\" and it's \"incredibly dry,\" Dierkes told CNN affiliate KCAL on Wednesday. \"There are homes in the general vicinity and in the immediate area.\"</p><p>Fire officials previously told KCAL at least 10 firefighting aircraft had been requested for the aerial attack.</p><p>The entirety of Angeles National Forest is\u00a0closed\u00a0to the general public through January 24, according to the US Forest Service.</p><p>This is a developing story and will be updated.</p><p>CNN's Josh Campbell, Artemis Moshtaghian and Isaac Yee contributed to this report.</p><p>The-CNN-Wire</p><p>(TM) &amp; \u00a9 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The fire started near Camp Creek around 3 a.m., likely caused by sparks from a logging train. The fire burned 32,668 acres, including virgin timber, plantations, ranch lands, and logged-off land as well as logging equipment, some businesses, and some homes.</p><p>At the Sept. 17 meeting of the West End Historical Society(WEHS), many who were children at the time shared their memories.</p><p>Tom Rosmond was seven years old at the time and he recalled looking northeast and seeing the fire, \"Cinders were falling like snow,\" Tom shared. \"The evacuation was going on and my Dad was a Navy veteran and knew the Quillayute Air Base Officer in Command. We went out to stay overnight at the base on the Quillayute Prairie,\" Tom added.</p><p>Richard Halverson was six years old and remembered his family loading up everything they could and driving to Chehalis.</p><p>Verlain Sackett said his Dad had used his logging company crew bus to help evacuate people. \"Flames were shooting over the area that is now Tillicum Park,\" Verlain said. He recalled at Maxwell's Cabins (near where Sully's is today) the fire burned the cabins but the Maxwells saved their home. Then the wind changed and the fire died out. The main part of town was spared.</p><p>Adria Fuhrman remembered seeing the embers and the \"feeling\" in the air. Birdie James was a senior in high school in Montesano, \"I remember my dad almost didn't make it home!\"</p><p>\"The impact of the fire had a profound impact on the area,\" Tom said, adding that the salvage of the burnt timber brought a huge influx of logging companies and laborers and led to the \"Boom\" the town experienced in the years after.</p><p>\"I remember seeing a photo of Hyas Creek,\" Verlain said, \"everything was burned.\"</p><p>Tom added that all the streams in the area were greatly affected.</p><p>The next WEHS meeting will be held on Tuesday, Oct. 15 at noon at the Congregational Church on Spartan Avenue. A slide show of the WEHS photo collection will be shared. Lunch is available for purchase for $8.

According to news originating from Beijing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"Large forest fires can cause significant damage to forest ecosystems and threaten human life and property.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Applied Technology Research And Development Program of Heilongjiang Province. <br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Chinese Academy of Sciences: \"Heilongjiang Province is a major forested area in China with the highest number and concentration of lightning-caused forest fires in the country. This study examined the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of forest fires in Heilongjiang Province, as well as the ability of satellite remote sensing to detect these fires using VIIRS 375 m fire point data, ground history forest fire point data, and land cover dataset. The study also investigated the occurrence patterns of lightning-caused forest fires and the factors affecting satellite identification of these fires through case studies. Results show that April has the highest annual number of forest fires, with 77.6% of forest fires being caused by lightning. However, less than 30% of forest fires can be effectively detected by satellites, and lightning-caused forest fires account for less than 15% of all fires. There is a significant negative correlation between the two.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Lightning-caused forest fires are concentrated in the Daxing'an Mountains between May and July, and are difficult to monitor by satellites due to cloud cover and lack of satellite transit. Overall, the trend observed in the number of forest fire pixels that are monitored by satellite remote sensing systems is generally indicative of the trends in the actual number of forest fires. However, lightning-caused forest fires are the primary cause of forest fires in Heilongjiang Province, and satellite remote sensing is relatively weak in monitoring these fires due to weather conditions and the timing of satellite transit.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Forest Fire Patterns and Lightning-Caused Forest Fire Detection in Heilongjiang Province of China Using Satellite Data.

Credit: Communications Earth &amp; Environment (2024). DOI: 10.1038/s43247-024-01808-7 </p><p>A pair of climate scientists at the Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science ETH Zurich, working with a colleague from Stripe Inc., has found evidence suggesting that the only way to prevent the planet from continuing to grow warmer is to use 1000-year carbon sequestration strategies.</p><p>In their paper <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01808-7\">published in the journal Communications Earth &amp; Environment, Cyril Brunner, Reto Knutti and Zeke Hausfather suggest their </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://phys.org/tags/research/\">research has shown that short-term </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://phys.org/tags/carbon/\">carbon </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://phys.org/tags/sequestration/\">sequestration strategies will lead to the release of captured carbon before the planet can recycle the carbon in the </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://phys.org/tags/atmosphere/\">atmosphere naturally.</url></p><p>Prior research has shown that there are many ways to sequester carbon pulled from the atmosphere, though they tend to fall into just two categories\u2014natural and forced. Natural sequestration happens when <url normalizedValue=\"https://phys.org/tags/plants/\">plants pull carbon from the air and hold it until the plant dies. If the plant is long-lived, the carbon could be held for perhaps a hundred years.</url></p><p>Forced sequestration involves things like forcefully injecting CO\u2082 into underground rock formations or covering blocks of it with metal and dropping them into the ocean. Such methods are expected to prevent the carbon from reentering the atmosphere for at least a thousand years.</p><p>In this new effort, the research trio focused on a part of the goal set by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, to store carbon \"durably.\" They note that many schemes developed to meet this goal use the 100-year benchmark as a \"durable\" means of sequestration.</p><p>Suspecting that such a definition is too lax, they ran a reduced-complexity climate model to estimate the likelihood of meeting <url normalizedValue=\"https://phys.org/tags/climate+change/\">climate change goals using such a benchmark. They found that the planet could see additional warming of 1.1C by 2500. This is because much of the carbon that is sequestered in such a way would be released before carbon already in the atmosphere returns naturally to the ground.</url></p><p>The researchers also note that most 100-year efforts are natural based, which leaves them vulnerable. A single forest fire, they point out, can release tons of CO\u2082 back into the air. Because of that, they suggest that only strategies capable of storing carbon for a thousand years be used. Longer-term strategies, they note, have the advantage of holding onto the carbon for roughly the same length of time as it takes for carbon in the atmosphere to naturally make its way back to Earth.</p><p> More information: Cyril Brunner et al, Durability of carbon dioxide removal is critical for Paris climate goals, Communications Earth &amp; Environment (2024). <url normalizedValue=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s43247-024-01808-7\">DOI: 10.1038/s43247-024-01808-7 </url></p><p>Relevant stories</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://phys.org/news/2024-04-mangrove-blue-carbon-higher-microplastic.html#nRlv\">Mangrove blue carbon at higher risk of microplastic pollution </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://phys.org/news/2024-09-ancient-evidence-biomass-vaults-cheap.html#nRlv\">Ancient buried log offers evidence of biomass vaults as cheap way to store climate-warming carbon </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://phys.org/news/2023-11-policy-driven-forest-carbon-sequestration.html#nRlv\">Analyzing policy-driven changes to US forest carbon sequestration </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://phys.org/news/2024-05-taller-communities-productive-sensitive-climate.html#nRlv\">Researchers show taller plant communities are more productive and sensitive to climate warming </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://phys.org/news/2024-07-approach-reforestation-regeneration.html#nRlv\">A mixed approach to reforestation is better than planting or regeneration alone, study finds </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://phys.org/news/2024-03-inconsistencies-earth-soil-carbon.html#nRlv\">Study describes inconsistencies in how different Earth system models predict soil carbon levels </url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-PHYS12336853238008865625216500158</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">Newstex Blogs</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DDG-HHM1-JCMN-Y2XT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567790</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"561\"/><timeReceived>3:00 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

Under a drought watch, conservation is encouraged but a warning enables the DEP to more closely manage water systems by directing water transfers among systems, controlling releases from reservoirs, and modifying the rate of flow in streams and rivers in order to balance ecological protection and needs of water suppliers.</p><p>Since early October, the New Jersey Forest Fire Service has responded to 537 wildfires, which is a more than 1,300% increase in wildfires over the same period last year. Since the start of the year, nearly 1,300 wildfires have burned over 11,000 acres. The average number of fires per year since the year 2000 is 1,071 wildfires and 4,000 acres burned.</p><p>Due to the ongoing dry and warm conditions, mandatory statewide Stage 3 fire restrictions remain in effect. These restrictions prohibit all fires unless they are contained in an elevated stove using only propane, natural gas, or electricity. No wood or charcoal fires are allowed, and the use of kerosene or gas torches of any kind is prohibited while this level of restriction is in place.</p><p>The public is strongly encouraged to follow these tips to reduce water use:</p><p>* At this time of year, it is appropriate to let lawns go dormant for the season.</p><p>* Winterize, and shut off irrigation systems as soon as possible.</p><p>* Only use a watering can to water flowers and shrubs or allow them to go dormant for the season.</p><p>* Use a broom to sweep the sidewalk, rather than a hose.</p><p>* Use a commercial car wash that recycles water, as washing your car at home typically results in more water use.</p><p>* To save water at home, fix leaky faucets and pipes. Consider replacing your toilet with a low-flow version; this can save around 11,000 gallons per year.</p><p>* Upgrade your showerhead to low-flow versions, which can save some 7,700 gallons per year.</p><p>* Upgrade your faucets or install faucet aerators; this can save some 16,000 gallons per year.</p><p>The most up-to-date information about the status of New Jersey's water supplies can be found at dep.nj.gov/drought/ (<url normalizedValue=\"https://dep.nj.gov/drought/\">https://dep.nj.gov/drought/</url>) For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:contentservices@htdigital.in\">contentservices@htdigital.in</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USSTNW-PR4911058</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USSTNW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DF4-36H1-F12F-F05P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">296938</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"517\"/><timeReceived>11:06 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>US State News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 13, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news originating from Melbourne, Australia, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Fire has become a major disturbing factor in boreal forests, and giant forest disturbances play a vital role in regulating the climate under global warming.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China; Tianjin University. <br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from University of Melbourne: \"Therefore, it is essential to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns and main drivers of post-fire vegetation recovery for forest ecological research and post-fire recovery management. However, previous studies have focused on the post-fire forest change within the entire fire perimeter, lacking separate analysis and comparison of the burned zone (BZ) and unburned zone (UNBZ). Here, we propose the utilization of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer land cover type and vegetation index data to monitor vegetation dynamics and explore its drivers after the most serious forest fire in the history of P.R. China in the Greater Hinggan Mountains (GHM). The temporal and spatial patterns of vegetation recovery in the BZ/UNBZ in the GHM were analyzed using the Sen &amp; Mann-Kendall method, Hurst index and coefficient of variation, and their driving mechanisms were explored using GeoDetector and geographically weighted regression. The results showed that there were significant differences in the spatial distribution and fluctuation of vegetation between the BZ and UNBZ, and that the BZ exhibited higher productivity and vigor.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Vegetation recovery was influenced by different dominant factors and changed over time, in which land surface temperature and precipitation dominated all the time, whereas topographic relief and elevation had a more significant contribution to vegetation recovery in the BZ and UNBZ, respectively. This study provides a scientific basis for the protection and management of vegetation in disturbed forested areas, particularly after fires.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Post-fire vegetation dynamic patterns and drivers in Greater Hinggan Mountains: Insights from long-term remote sensing data analysis.

According to news originating from Wuhan, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"Given the limited computing capabilities of UAV terminal equipment, there is a challenge in balancing the accuracy and computational cost when deploying the target detection model for forest fire detection on the UAV.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China; Science And Technology Research Project of The Education Department of Hubei Province. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Hubei University of Technology: \"Additionally, the fire targets photographed by the UAV are small and prone to misdetection and omission during detection. This paper proposes a lightweight, small target detection model, FL-YOLOv7, based on YOLOv7. First, we designed a light module, C3GhostV2, to replace the feature extraction module in YOLOv7. Simultaneously, we used the Ghost module to replace some of the standard convolution layers in the backbone network, accelerating inference speed and reducing model parameters. Secondly, we introduced the Parameter-Free Attention (SimAm) attention mechanism to highlight the features of smoke and fire targets and suppress background interference, improving the model's representation and generalization performance without increasing network parameters. Finally, we incorporated the Adaptive Spatial Feature Fusion (ASFF) module to address the model's weak small target detection capability and use the loss function with dynamically adjustable sample weights (WIoU) to weaken the impact of low-quality or complex samples and improve the model's overall performance.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Experimental results show that FL-YOLOv7 reduces the parameter count by 27% compared to the YOLOv7 model while improving 2.9% m A P 50 s m a l l and 24.4 frames per second in FPS, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our model in small target detection, as well as its real-time and reliability in forest fire scenarios.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: FL-YOLOv7: A Lightweight Small Object Detection Algorithm in Forest Fire Detection.

With the dry weather, and the increased chance for brushfires expected to continue for sometime, NYC Emergency Management Commissioner Zach Iscol called on New Yorkers to report fires when they see them, and to continue conserving water.

Let's give it a try.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The 112 lawmakers after New Year's Day can start submitting bills for their 60-day session, which begins Jan. 21. If history repeats itself, many will squander time and money by prioritizing unimportant matters at the expense of substance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A good start in avoiding this pitfall is to send all bills for specialty license plates to legislative committees that will bury them. That step would set the right tone.</p><p>Real work is waiting to be done. And tackling weighty issues requires commitment and intelligence.</p><p>The Legislature's many backbenchers still want to pass something - anything at all - into law. They often concoct bills for more license plates in hopes of gaining favor with one group or another.</p><p>New Mexico already has more than 40 specialty license plates. They recognize everything from bass fishing to protecting pollinators to decommissioned Route 66. Get your kicks by sporting a license plate about the old highway.</p><p>The appetite for squandering resources to establish more license plates never ends.</p><p>With many significant policy measures awaiting hearings during the final 14 hours of the 2024 legislative session, the House of Representatives cast those bills aside. Instead it made time to approve a bill for license plates featuring Smokey Bear, the cub burned in 1950 in a New Mexico forest fire. The proposal squeaked through, 62-0, after debate that was mostly unintelligible.</p><p>Only a couple of hours remained in the session as senators mulled the bill for Smokey Bear's license plate. With a heroic effort, the Senate beat the clock to nudge the bill through, 41-0.</p><p>Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, in 2023 had vetoed a bill for a Smokey Bear specialty plates. She reversed herself this year, signing the measure into law.</p><p>Smokey Bear's bill blazed a trail at lightning speed. Sen. Jeff Steinborn's proposed constitutional amendment to reform the malfunctioning system of selecting university regents died without receiving a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee.</p><p>Steinborn, D-Las Cruces, crafted an important but bureaucratic proposal. Under existing law, the governor has sole authority to choose regents. The Senate can confirm or reject the nominees, though only one has been voted down in the last decade.</p><p>Steinborn wants to create nominating committees to screen applicants for regent seats. The governor would then choose from the list of names sent to her by the committees.</p><p>My preference is a constitutional amendment to elect regents, especially after scandals at New Mexico State University and Western New Mexico University. Boards of regents at both institutions deserve a grade of F.</p><p>NMSU's regents slept as corruption overtook the men's basketball program. Two players said they were sexually assaulted and hazed by teammates. Even so, the outgoing chancellor rewarded the director of athletics with a hefty raise and contract extension.</p><p>Regents of NMSU eventually agreed to $8 million in payments to settle lawsuits by the aggrieved players.</p><p>Western's regents just agreed to pay university President Joseph Shepard seven figures to give up his office.</p><p>Shepard and the five regents came under fire from news organizations and the state auditor for misspending at least $360,000 on travel and other items. Shepard agreed to resign the presidency Jan. 15.</p><p>In exchange, Western's regents approved a contract paying Shepard a lump sum of $1.909 million. The regents also guaranteed Shepard another $200,000 a year for five years as a professor in the business school.</p><p>People from across the state have called or written me to complain about what's gone on at Western, a university of fewer than 3,600 students in Silver City.</p><p>\"During my career, none of this malfeasance as demonstrated by the WNMU president would have been tolerated,\" wrote Vicki Holmsten, who retired from the faculty of San Juan College in Farmington.</p><p>Frank Chambers of Santa Fe, who taught at Oklahoma State University, wrote: \"That is outrageous and is enabled by regents who have been complicit in the improper spending.\"</p><p>Mary Beckner, also of Santa Fe, called the regents unfit. \"They need to be ousted,\" she said.</p><p>To be gentle, Lujan Grisham chose poorly in selecting Western's Board of Regents. But several readers have questioned whether my pitch to elect two super boards of regents, one for research universities and the other for regional institutions, would hurt education with politics.</p><p>Truth is, politics already pollutes the system. Donors and political supporters of a governor often are appointed as regents.</p><p>Mary Hotvedt, who heads Western's Board of Regents, is a former chairperson of Grant County's Democratic Party. She also was an unsuccessful candidate for the state House of Representatives. Running in a heavily Republican district, Hotvedt took a loss for her team. Appointment to Western's Board of Regents was a consolation prize.</p><p>After Shepard's buyout, those in need of consoling are students, faculty members and state taxpayers.</p><p>Ringside Seat is an opinion column about people, politics and news.

The cause of both the Prospect and Marine Park brushfires remains under investigation.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since Nov. 2, the NYC area has been under a drought watch issued by Mayor Eric Adams. With the dry weather, and the increased chance for brushfires expected to continue for sometime, NYC Emergency Management Commissioner Zach Iscol called on New Yorkers to report fires when they see them, and to continue conserving water. In light of the recent blazes, Mayor Eric Adams banned grilling in NYC parks on Saturday.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"As New York City's historic streak of dry weather creates new safety risks, today, we are taking additional measures to keep New Yorkers safe,\" the mayor said in a press release.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While the fires were an uncommon sight for the borough, the Tri-state area has experienced a significant uptick in wildfires, especially New Jersey, which is currently battling fires covering thousands of acres across the state, according to the New Jersey Forest Fire Service. On Saturday, an 18-year-old NY state parks employee succumbed to his injuries while battling one of the wildfires along the NY-NJ border, NY Daily News reported.</p><p>FDNY putting out the flames./New York Times</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I am deeply saddened by the passing of one of our New York State Parks employees while responding to a wildfire in Orange County yesterday [...] Our State employees are working around the clock to protect our communities and we are keeping them close in our thoughts as they put their lives on the line to stop the spread of these wildfires,\" NY Governor Kathy Hochul said in a statement Sunday.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To city officials, the brushfires are part of a larger trend of extreme weather continuing to unfold. New Yorkers should be prepared for the changes as well as do their part to prevent more of the fires.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"This is the new normal of extreme weather,\" Iscol said at a press conference with Mayor Adams on Friday. \"It's not something that we're expecting, but it's something that we all need to be prepared for.

The fire likely will continue to burn as the dry, warm weather is forecast to continue for the next week.</p><p>Brian Anderson, ranger for the Wallowa Mountains Office, said firefighters are employing a \"mixed suppression strategy\" on the Bear Fire.</p><p>\"Not full suppression, not full monitoring. The objective is to protect values at risk, such as Forest Service infrastructure and private property, while minimizing firefighter risk,\" Anderson said. \"Firefighters are not currently engaged in direct fire perimeter control but are employing helicopter water drops to cool the fire edge and point protection actions to protect values at risk through indirect fire line construction and/or strategic firing as needed.\u201d</p><p>The fire has not prompted any trail or area closures. People planning to travel in that part of the Eagle Cap Wilderness should call the Wallowa Mountains Office at 541-426-5546.</p><p>Under a Forest Service policy in place for more than 30 years, fire managers can monitor, rather than try to extinguish, lightning-caused fires in the Eagle Cap, Oregon's biggest federal wilderness at 360,000 acres.</p><p>Officials typically monitor such fires so long as they don't threaten private property or public safety.</p><p>___ (c)2024 the Baker City Herald (Baker City, Ore.)

Each hamper was worth $25, and they were all donated back to the food bank. The hampers are intended to provide a boost for clients who rely on the food bank's support.</p><p>Major Tony Brushett from The Salvation Army in Yellowknife, explains the importance of this initiative.</p><p>The tradition of giving hampers right after Thanksgiving is meant to help clients get through the early weeks of the tough northern winters when heating costs rise. The hampers are intended to supplement the regular food bank packages.</p><p>\"We are about to hit winter here in another week or two, which means electricity and heating bills go through the roof. People are struggling to pay their bills and eat, so we like to give them that little boost between now and Christmas,\" Major Tony says.</p><p>Despite the tough times many Yellowknife residents have faced since last year's forest fire evacuations, the community's response to this initiative was overwhelmingly positive.</p><p>\"It was amazing how many people came in and said, 'You know, I'll take four hampers',\" Major Tony recalls. \"Somebody came and said, 'I'll take 20 hampers,' which is $500, and they just put that on their grocery bill. Even though we have a lot of folks here who struggle day to day to make ends meet, those who can afford to, certainly do help.\"</p><p>Major Tony believes that the good work of The Salvation Army in Yellowknife throughout the years has made a great impression on residents, which is why they are so generous.</p><p>\"The Salvation Army name is still very good up here; the brand recognition is good. They understand the work we do, and I think that's what makes it so much easier.\"</p><p>The hampers are distributed to clients during their next visit to the food bank. Those who already received their hamper are grateful for the additional support.</p><p>\"It has been a pleasant surprise for them. We've had a lot of positive feedback,\" Major Tony adds.</p><p>Looking ahead, The Salvation Army is focusing its efforts on the annual Kettle Campaign, aiming to raise $45,000. In November, they plan to partner with a local radio station to distribute hampers once again.</p><p>By Juan Romero</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126798176</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D86-SP51-JCBF-S0KM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"425\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"10\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>October 24, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>THE SALVATION ARMY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST0008X9J</classCode><className>FOOD CHARITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N624210GM</classCode><className>FOOD BANKS &amp; SOUP KITCHENS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001463</classCode><className>RELIEF ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009XS5</classCode><className>THANKSGIVING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009Y72</classCode><className>CHRISTMAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000D0FD</classCode><className>FOOD SECURITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST00096SA</classCode><className>BRAND EQUITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000205</classCode><className>BRANDING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N445110MM</classCode><className>GROCERY STORES &amp; SUPERMARKETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST00096SL</classCode><className>AWARENESS MARKETING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST00096SA</classCode><className>BRAND EQUITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000205</classCode><className>BRANDING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GX245</classCode><className>YELLOWKNIFE, NT, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX060</classCode><className>TORONTO, ON, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS172</classCode><className>NORTHWEST TERRITORIES, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GS174</classCode><className>ONTARIO, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

New York Gov.</p><h>Wildfires threaten historic Revolutionary site</h><p> Kathy Hochul commended Vasquez's bravery and dedication to serving and protecting his fellow New Yorkers. The fire, known as the Jennings Creek Fire, broke out on Saturday amid blustery winds and drought conditions in the region.</p><p>It has threatened several structures, including eight in New Jersey's Long Pond Ironworks State Park, a historic 175-acre village where iron was produced during the Revolutionary War. Firefighters have also been battling other wildfires in the area, including the \"Cannonball 3\" fire in Passaic County, which grew to 175 acres but was 75% contained by Sunday afternoon, and the \"Shotgun Fire\" in Jackson Township, which burned 350 acres before being brought under control. The Shotgun Fire was determined to be caused by arson, and a suspect has been charged.</p><p>Air quality alerts remained in effect Sunday in the New York City area due to the fires, with the Air Quality Index reaching \"unhealthy for sensitive groups\" levels. Several brush fires have erupted in New York City in recent days, including one in Brooklyn's Prospect Park that burned at least two acres before being brought under control.

According to news reporting out of Berlin, Germany, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Precise quantification of forest fire impacts is critical for management strategies in support of post-fire mitigation. In this regard, optical remote sensing imagery in combination with spectral unmixing has been widely used to measure fire severity by means of fractional cover of photosynthetic vegetation (PV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), charcoal (CH) and further ground components such as ash, bare soil and rocks.\" </p><p><br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin: \"However, most unmixing analyses have made use of a single post-fire image without accounting for the pre-fire state. We aim to assess fire severity from Sentinel-2 data using a bi-temporal spectral unmixing analysis that provides a quantitative fire impact description and is oriented towards the process of change by including pre-fire and post-fire information. Unmixing was based on Random Forest Regression (RFR) modeling using synthetic training data from a bi-temporal spectral library. We describe fire severity as changes associated with the combustion of photosynthetic vegetation (PV-CH fraction) and dieback of photosynthetic vegetation (PV-NPV fraction). Unburned forest was mapped as stable photosynthetic vegetation (PV-PV fraction). We evaluated our approach on a forest fire that burned in a temperate forest region in eastern Germany in 2018. Independent validation was carried out based on reference fractions obtained from very high-resolution (VHR) imagery such as Plante Scope, SPOT6, orthophotos, aerial photos, and Google Earth. The results underline the effectiveness of our unmixing approach, with Root Mean Squared Errors (RMSE) of 0.072 for PV-CH, 0.09 for PV-NPV, and 0.08 for PV-PV fractions. Most of the errors were caused by spectral similarity between charcoal and shadow effects caused by trees, and the coloring of foliage and NPV in the late phenological season of the post-fire Sentinel-2 image. Based on the two-dimensional feature space of PV-CH and PV-NPV fractions, we calculated two metrics to characterize fire impacts: distance, an indicator of disturbance severity (sum of combustion and dieback), and angle, a measure of disturbance composition (gradient between combustion and dieback). Furthermore, we compared the fraction-based metrics with the difference Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR).\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Since the dNBR is most sensitive to combustion and presence of charcoal, it does not fully characterize fire-related vegetation loss associated with dieback. The bi-temporal fraction-based indices provide more ecologically meaningful information on fire severity, particularly for regions that are less prone to severe wildfires such as Central Europe.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Mapping forest fire severity using bi-temporal unmixing of Sentinel-2 data - Towards a quantitative understanding of fire impacts.

According to news originating from Nanchang, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"In the context of global climate warming, climate change is subtly reshaping the patterns of wildfires. Therefore, it is particularly urgent to conduct in-depth research on climate change, wildfires, and their management strategies.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Open Fund of The Key Laboratory of Mine Environmental Monitoring And Improvement Around Poyang Lake, Ministry of Natural Resources; The Ph.D. Project of East China University of Technology; The Jiangxi Provincial Natural Science Foundation; The Postgraduate Innovation Fund of Jiangxi Province. <br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from East China University of Technology: \"This study relies on detailed fire point data from 2001 to 2020, skillfully incorporating a spatial autocorrelation analysis to uncover the mysteries of spatial heterogeneity, while comprehensively considering the influences of multiple factors such as climate, terrain, vegetation, and socioeconomic conditions. To simulate fire conditions under future climates, we adopted the BCC-CSM2-MR climate model, presetting temperature and precipitation data for two scenarios: a sustainable low-development path and a high-conventional-development path. The core findings of the study include the following: (i) In terms of spatial heterogeneity exploration, global autocorrelation analysis reveals a striking pattern: within the southern forest region, 63 cities exhibiting a low-low correlation are tightly clustered in provinces such as Hubei, Anhui, and Zhejiang, while 48 cities with a high-high correlation are primarily distributed in Guangxi and Guangdong. Local autocorrelation analysis further refines this observation, indicating that 24 high-high correlated cities are highly concentrated in specific areas, 14 low-low correlated cities are located in Hainan, and there are only 3 sparsely distributed cities with a low-high correlation. (ii) During the model construction and validation process, this study innovatively adopted the LR-RF-SVM ensemble model, which demonstrated exceptional performance indicators: an accuracy of 91.97%, an AUC value of 97.09%, an F1 score of 92.13%, a precision of 90.75%, and a recall rate of 93.55%. These figures, significantly outperforming those of the single models SVM and RF, strongly validate the superiority of the ensemble learning approach.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"(iii) Regarding predictions under future climate scenarios, the research findings indicate that, compared to the current fire situation in southern forest areas, the spatial distribution of wildfires will exhibit a noticeable expansion trend. High-risk regions will not only encompass multiple cities in Hunan, Hubei, southern Anhui, all of Jiangxi, and Zhejiang but will also extend northward into southern forest areas that were previously considered low-risk, suggesting a gradual northward spread of fire risk. Notably, despite the relatively lower fire risk in some areas of Fujian Province under the SS585 scenario, overall, the probability of wildfires occurring in 2090 is slightly higher than that in 2030, further highlighting the persistent intensification of forest fire risk due to climate change.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Prediction of Wildfire Occurrence in the Southern Forest Regions of China in the Future Scenario.

According to news reporting originating from Joensuu, Finland, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Boreal forests are one of the most important biomes storing carbon (C).\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Academy of Finland; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme. <br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from University of Eastern Finland: \"Wildfires burn yearly on average more than 1% of the boreal forest, and it is expected that the fire return intervals will shorten due to climate change. Fire is one of the most influential factors affecting soil organic matter quantity and quality, soil C pools, and presumably also the time C resides in the soil (soil C turnover time in years). We compared the potential effects of forest fire through post-fire succession on soil carbon dioxide (CO2) emission rates and soil C turnover time in two fire chronosequences, one with underlying permafrost soil and the other without permafrost. We found that fire had a significant effect on potential soil C turnover times, but surprisingly there was no significant difference in soil C turnover times between the permafrost and non-permafrost areas, although the soil CO2 emissions rates in permafrost areas are approximately three times higher compared to non-permafrost areas. In recently burned areas the potential soil C turnover times were two times longer compared to control areas located in forests burned more than 100 years ago.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The longest potential soil C turnover times were recorded in mineral soil layers (30 cm) of permafrost soils, and the shortest potential soil C turnover times were recorded in humus layers of non-permafrost areas.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Post-fire soil carbon emission rates along boreal forest fire chronosequences in northwest Canada show significantly higher emission potentials from permafrost soils compared to non-permafrost soils.

The State Department of Environmental Conservation Forest Rangers are leading the incident response in cooperation with the Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services, New York State Police, Orange County, New York Army National Guard, and many other State and local partners plus wildland firefighters from New Jersey Forest Fire Service, Colorado and Montana. Response actions in the area will continue in the coming days with a smaller force of state and local experts as final fire control efforts advance.</p><p>\"For two weeks, firefighting crews and staff responded from around the state to battle the Jennings Creek wildfire and today they were successful in fully containing the fire,\" Governor Hochul said. \"From the start, we launched a coordinated response with every available resource to help our first responders complete this mission, and could not have done this without the professional and volunteer crews that worked alongside our partners in New Jersey, and crews from Colorado and Montana. I thank all of them for their hard work, spending time away from their families and working tirelessly every day to keep New Yorkers safe.\"</p><p>As part of the response, the Governor deployed additional State assets including personnel and Army National Guard Black Hawk and Chinook helicopters, as well as State Police Huey helicopters. Combined, these helicopters dumped more than 500,000 gallons of water on the fire over the course of a week. The State also deployed bulldozers and bulldozer operators and other professional staff and volunteers to contain the fire. Since Nov. 10, 427 fire companies nearly all of them volunteers have sent more than 1,300 firefighters and equipment to help. Responders attacked this fire from the ground and in the air. The steady rain and snow in the past two days brought much needed moisture to the region, acting as a blanket to drop the ground temperature and suppress the fire.</p><p>To date, the fire has burned 5,304 acres across New York and New Jersey since Nov. 8. The fire is 100-percent contained and 100-percent controlled. As a result, the State's Incident Management Team, along with volunteer crews have demobilized. Some sections of fire may remain within the deeper forested interior of the park and qualified fire crews from DEC, Parks Forest Rangers and Montana will continue to patrol the perimeter throughout the rain and snow late this week, and proceed with mop-up operations as needed until the fire is completely suppressed.</p><p>While recent rain helped improve dry conditions in many parts of the state, New York still has a statewide burn ban in effect until Nov. 30 due to increased fire risk. This burn ban prohibits the starting of outdoor fires statewide for purposes of brush and debris disposal, as well as uncontained campfires, and open fires used for cooking. Backyard fire pits and contained campfires less than three feet in height and four feet in length, width, or diameter are allowed, as are small, contained cooking fires. Burning garbage or leaves is prohibited year-round in New York State, and several municipalities have burn bans currently in effect.</p><p>Sterling Forest State Park will reopen for hiking and hunting effective Saturday east of Long Meadow Road and north of Route 17A.

Andrew M. Cuomo issued the following release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Governor Kathy Hochul today announced that after 14 days, the Jennings Creek/Sterling Forest State Park wildfire on the New York border is now fully contained. The State Department of Environmental Conservation Forest Rangers are leading the incident response in cooperation with the Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services, New York State Police, Orange County, New York Army National Guard, and many other State and local partners plus wildland firefighters from New Jersey Forest Fire Service, Colorado and Montana. Response actions in the area will continue in the coming days with a smaller force of state and local experts as final fire control efforts advance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"For two weeks, firefighting crews and staff responded from around the state to battle the Jennings Creek wildfire and today they were successful in fully containing the fire,\" Governor Hochul said. \"From the start, we launched a coordinated response with every available resource to help our first responders complete this mission, and could not have done this without the professional and volunteer crews that worked alongside our partners in New Jersey, and crews from Colorado and Montana. I thank all of them for their hard work, spending time away from their families and working tirelessly every day to keep New Yorkers safe.\"</p><p>As part of the response, the Governor deployed additional State assets including personnel and Army National Guard Black Hawk and Chinook helicopters, as well as State Police Huey helicopters. Combined, these helicopters dumped more than 500,000 gallons of water on the fire over the course of a week. The State also deployed bulldozers and bulldozer operators and other professional staff and volunteers to contain the fire. Since Nov. 10, 427 fire companies - nearly all of them volunteers - have sent more than 1,300 firefighters and equipment to help. Responders attacked this fire from the ground and in the air. The steady rain and snow in the past two days brought much needed moisture to the region, acting as a blanket to drop the ground temperature and suppress the fire.</p><p>To date, the fire has burned 5,304 acres across New York and New Jersey since Nov. 8. The fire is 100-percent contained and 100-percent controlled. As a result, the State's Incident Management Team, along with volunteer crews have demobilized. Some sections of fire may remain within the deeper forested interior of the park and qualified fire crews from DEC, Parks Forest Rangers and Montana will continue to patrol the perimeter throughout the rain and snow late this week, and proceed with mop-up operations as needed until the fire is completely suppressed.</p><p>While recent rain helped improve dry conditions in many parts of the state, New York still has a statewide burn ban in effect until Nov. 30 due to increased fire risk. This burn ban prohibits the starting of outdoor fires statewide for purposes of brush and debris disposal, as well as uncontained campfires, and open fires used for cooking. Backyard fire pits and contained campfires less than three feet in height and four feet in length, width, or diameter are allowed, as are small, contained cooking fires. Burning garbage or leaves is prohibited year-round in New York State, and several municipalities have burn bans currently in effect.&amp;#8239;</p><p>Sterling Forest State Park will reopen for hiking and hunting effective Saturday east of Long Meadow Road and north of Route 17A. Trails in the fire zone will remain closed indefinitely.

The fire sparked hours after fire crews started to achieve some containment on the Hughes Fire, which spread rapidly Wednesday afternoon in a Los Angeles County suburb.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An <url normalizedValue=\"https://lafd.org/alert/brush-fire-evacuation-warning-01222025-inc2073\">evacuation warning</url> for the brush fire was issued for some residents in Sherman Oaks around 11:40 p.m. Wednesday - the warning has since been lifted, but smoke could be seen in the area near locations including campuses for UCLA and for Mount Saint Mary's University-Los Angeles. Also nearby are the Getty Center, whose spokesperson told the Los Angeles Times it implemented fire protection protocols, as well as pricey real estate valued in the tens of millions of dollars, according to local listings.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Sepulveda Fire has burned roughly 40 acres, <url normalizedValue=\"https://lafd.org/alert/forward-progress-stopped-evacuation-warning-lifted-brush-fire-sepulveda-fire-01232025-inc2073\">according to the Los Angeles Fire Department</url>. Firefighters will remain on scene throughout the morning and work to eliminate any remaining hot spots.</p><p>\"Air support and other aggressive actions have been deployed to fight a new fire just east of the 405,\" Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/MayorOfLA/status/1882338514517565706\">said on social media</url>.</p><p>Fire engines lined the roads below the blaze as water-dropping aircraft operated overhead, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/sepulveda-fire-sherman-oaks-405-freeway/\">CNN affiliate KCAL/KCBS reported</url>.</p><p>The fire threat remains critical in Southern California, where thousands of residents were under evacuation orders Wednesday as fire crews battled the out-of-control Hughes Fire near Castaic.</p><p>The fire - impacting both Los Angeles and Ventura counties - had burned more than 10,000 acres and is 14% contained as of Thursday morning, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/\">according to</url> the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. No structures have been reported damaged or destroyed, Los Angeles County Fire Department Chief Anthony Marrone said at a Wednesday evening news conference.</p><p>The unincorporated community of Castaic is about 15 miles northwest of the city of Santa Clarita and borders the Angeles National Forest. Approximately 31,000 residents in the area are under evacuation orders, while 23,000 are under evacuation warnings, according to Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna.</p><p>\"We have over 4,000 firefighting personnel assigned to the incident,\" Marrone said, noting the \"robust\" ground and air response to the fire. \"The situation remains dynamic and the fire remains a difficult fire to contain, although we are getting the upper hand,\" Marrone added.</p><p>The Hughes Fire started just before 11 a.m. Wednesday near Castaic Lake, north of where fire crews are working to fully contain the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2025/1/7/palisades-fire\">Palisades</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2025/1/7/eaton-fire\">Eaton</url> Fires that have scorched more than 40,000 acres and left at least 28 dead since they began January 7.</p><p>The fire is \"a completely different beast\" to the Palisades and Eaton Fires, LA County Fire Capt. Sheila Kelliher told CNN's Laura Coates Thursday. Two weeks ago, firefighters faced extreme challenges as powerful winds grounded aerial support.</p><p>Current conditions are more favorable, with calmer winds allowing the fire department's helicopters to carry out water drops throughout the night, Kelliher said.</p><p>When asked about potential water supply issues, Kelliher said that today's crews are fortunate to have direct access to Castaic Lake and other nearby reservoirs for their firefighting efforts.</p><p>Robert Garcia, Angeles National Forest fire chief, said Wednesday, \"The conditions that we're under aren't as severe as what we've been facing over the last week or two, but what you saw (Wednesday) is indicative of the conditions that we're in, in terms of the vegetation.\"</p><p>The area where the fire is burning is known for its dry, grassy hills, fire officials added, making the fire conditions there \"critical,\" according to Garcia.</p><p>\"Certainly, we are not out of the woods yet,\" said Cal Fire Chief Joe Tyler on Wednesday. Evacuees should follow the directions of local law enforcement and first responders as they are asked to evacuate the area, Tyler noted.</p><p>The National Weather Service extended a red flag warning through Friday morning for most of Los Angeles and Ventura counties as Santa Ana winds continue to move through the area, Marrone said.</p><p>The winds are expected to intensify across Southern California, peaking late Wednesday into early Thursday. While forecasts indicate a decrease in strength by Thursday afternoon, conditions will still be strong enough to sustain fire weather concerns through Friday morning.</p><p>\"Dangerous fire weather conditions will persist through Friday as fuels remain extremely dry and ready to burn, with Thursday the period of greatest concern. Any fire that starts can grow fast and out of control,\" the National Weather Service in Los Angeles said.</p><p>Schools and jail evacuated as Hughes Fire poses risks</p><p>A <url normalizedValue=\"https://locator.lacounty.gov/lac/Location/3057019/los-angeles-county-sheriff---north-county-correctional-facility\">county jail</url> in Castaic has been partially evacuated, according to a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The jail is just south of the fire area and can hold as many as 4,295 inmates.</p><p>Approximately 470 inmates were evacuated from one of the three facilities on the campus and moved to another part of the detention center, Luna said, adding that the other two facilities are \"structured much better\" than the one that was evacuated.</p><p>\"We do have a plan in place ... to evacuate the rest of the inmates on the entire facility if we absolutely had to,\" Luna said, without providing details.</p><p>Meanwhile, all students who attend Castaic Middle School and Castaic High School were evacuated Wednesday to a Ralph's supermarket parking lot, according to the California Highway Patrol. Students from North Lake Elementary were evacuated to the Castaic Sports Complex, <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/CHP_Newhall?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1882169851944546671%7Ctwgr%5E85fbacf8f4b0cec73d07301ab28e13a9e9e1e07f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxla.com%2Fnews%2Fcastaic-fire-hughes-fire-erupts-quickly-grows-over-50-acres\">the agency said on X</url>.</p><p>The Valencia and Canyon Country campuses of College of the Canyons have been closed as a \"precautionary measure\" because of the Hughes Fire, the college said on its <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.canyons.edu/administration/pio/news/index.php\">website</url>.</p><p>Smoke was visible as far south as the city of Oxnard, about 50 miles southwest of Castaic in Ventura County, city officials <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/CityofOxnard/status/1882164670183985458\">said on social media </url>Wednesday.</p><p>The fire will likely spread toward the south and west, away from where it started, according to data and forecast models from thermal intelligence company Orora Technologies. Castaic is in considerable danger of being affected by spreading flames, the models show.</p><p>Satellite data used by Orora Technologies first detected a hotspot just north of Castaic Lake at 10:45 a.m. Officials with Cal Fire said they first detected a fire at 10:53 a.m.</p><p>The area where the fire started and is currently burning is largely shrub and grassland, with some limited forested areas, additional data from Orora Technologies shows.</p><p>Thick brush in the area is serving as fuel for the rapid fire spread, according to Angeles National Forest spokesperson Dana Dierkes.</p><p>\"We're in fairly steep conditions\" and it's \"incredibly dry,\" Dierkes told CNN affiliate KCAL on Wednesday. \"There are homes in the general vicinity and in the immediate area.\"</p><p>Fire officials previously told KCAL at least 10 firefighting aircraft had been requested for the aerial attack.</p><p>The entirety of Angeles National Forest is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/angeles#:~:text=Forest%20Closure,25%2D03%2C%20click%20here.\">closed</url> to the general public through January 24, according to the US Forest Service.</p><p>This is a developing story and will be updated.</p><p>CNN's Josh Campbell, Artemis Moshtaghian and Isaac Yee contributed to this report.         </p><p>             By Amanda Musa, Emma Tucker, Robert Shackelford and Hanna Park, CNN         </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

A firefighter was killed battling blazes that stretched from New Jersey into New York over the weekend as historic drought conditions intensified a stranglehold across the Northeast, fueling wildfires and threatening lives and homes.</p><p>New York City has been enveloped in hazy skies from wildfires for days, and an air quality alert was issued for the city and nearby areas of New York State and New Jersey into Monday. The city has not been immune to the wildfires, either   multiple acres burned across Prospect Park in Brooklyn and Highbridge Park in the Bronx over the weekend.</p><p>\"Every New Yorker needs to understand that we now live in a time of extreme weather. Climate change is real - it's here,\" New York City Emergency Management Commissioner Zach Iscol told News12. \"Generally, when you think about climate change, you think of floods, you think about rising sea levels. But the fact is, it manifests itself in a lot of different ways.\"</p><p>The Northeast hasn't seen a \"thorough soaking\" since late September, according to AccuWeather. The dry conditions have increased the risk of wildfires, dried up streams and brought reservoirs to dangerously low levels, AccuWeather warned. In New Jersey, the West Milford wildfire crossed into Orange County, New York, spreading to 2,500 acres of wooded properties with 0% containment, the New Jersey Forest Fire Service said Sunday. Roads were closed and more than two dozen homes, businesses and other structures were imperiled.</p><p>The agency also extended \"condolences to our counterparts at the NY State Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation Department following the tragic line-of-duty loss of one of their team members\" battling a fire burning in both states. Orange County Emergency Services posted a note on social media confirming \"the passing of a dedicated service member we lost today.\"</p><p>Last month was the second driest October on record for the lower 48 states combined. The only time October was drier was more than 70 years ago. Parts of the Northeast could get some rain late Sunday into Monday, but the drought is so deep and severe the rains will have minimal long-term impact. As quickly as firefighters have doused the flames across the region, more fires have sprung up. The New Jersey fire danger dashboard, which ranks fire risk in each county from low to extreme, showed the entire state under extreme conditions. New Jersey and Delaware are coming off their driest October's on record, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p><p>Massachusetts and Connecticut are among other states where drought and fire warnings have been issued. The National Weather Service in Boston warned that a Red Flag Warning was in place Sunday. Fires that start today will spread quickly given extremely dry conditions and gusty southwest winds, the warning said. Connecticut declared a drought advisory and warned that water supplies could become a problem. Martin Heft, chairman of the Connecticut Interagency Drought Workgroup, said his state has had the driest two-month period since recordkeeping began in 1905.</p><p>\"The lack of rain over the past two months has caused exceptionally dry conditions across Connecticut, resulting in numerous wildfires and reduced groundwater levels and streamflows,\" Gov. Ned Lamont said. \"We want to encourage everyone right now to be mindful of their water consumption and take some simple, sensible steps to stretch water supplies.\"</p><p>Contributing: Eduardo Cuevas</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USATDY-usa3009580569</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USATDY2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DD1-K0J1-DXGX-613P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8213</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"580\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 USA Today All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>USA Today</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 11, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>State Parks</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzAxRThENzk5NTQwNDY1MTkxMTgxQTAyRjgwOTE5OEE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

They put Cingranelli literally on the frontlines helping state officials and fire crews figure out where to go and what to do.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">#8216;I actually served as the incident meteorologist for the Hawthorne drive fire,#8217; he said referring to the largest blaze \u2014 127 acres in Berlin \u2014 that lasted for several weeks and claimed the life of one firefighter.</p><p>Using a portable weather station borrowed from the U.S. Forest Service in Vermont, Cingranelli was able to collect real-time data on winds, the dew point, how dry it was and more to help the incident management team figure out where to put firefighters for that day.</p><p>#8216;In addition, several times throughout the day, we would request from the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weather.gov/box\">National Weather Service office up in Boston, what's called a spot forecast,#8217; he said. He would send them the data from his weather station and the NWS would quickly send back an hour-by-hour #8216;very, very detailed look at what they're expecting fire-weather conditions wise.#8217;</url></p><p>A portable weather station, on loan from the U.S. Forest Service in Vermont, was tied into the National Weather Service in Boston.Prediction data from both helped emergency manager deploy firefighters and equipment during a rash of wildfires last fall.

That's really essential to us being successful on the ground, knowing what's going to happen on an hourly basis and when a front is coming through,#8217; said State Forester Chris Martin.</p><p>#8216;Without that, we would be making much less informed decisions.#8217;</p><p>How much longer a collaboration like that may exist is now an open question given the cutbacks, firings and funding decreases the Trump administration has ordered throughout the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA \u2014 the NWS's parent division that itself is within the Commerce Department.</p><p>But it is just the first of a one-two punch that could greatly diminish the ability of Connecticut, and all other states, to prepare for and respond to climate and weather changes, emergencies and disasters and then clean up from the ones that do occur.</p><p>Punch number two comes from the Trump assault on the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA. Funding, personnel, mission and perhaps the entire agency appear to be in jeopardy. While visiting flood-ravaged western North Carolina in January \u2014 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ6LN1_rhqU\">Trump said he was considering getting rid of FEMA.

Turner III, State Emergency Management Director Credit: Department of Emergency Services &amp; Public Protection</p><p>For Bill Turner, Connecticut's emergency services director who attended that meeting, the incoming is from all directions. #8216;The pace is just unsustainable, trying to keep track of all this,#8217; said Turner.</p><p>And, indeed, on Friday he learned that one of FEMA's most popular programs \u2014Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, BRIC, which the state was using or planning to use for about 20 flood mitigation projects to the tune of more than $116 million in f<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25880061-fema-advisory-fema-ends-bric/\">ederal grants, had been cancelled.</url></p><p>Both agencies were explicitly targeted for drastic reductions in Project 2025, with the NWS potentially being privatized \u2014 a move critics say could lead to inconsistencies in weather forecasting around the country and less reliability. Project 2025 also called for FEMA costs to be borne by states far more than they are now, which is typically 75% from FEMA and 25% from the state.</p><p>Since then the NWS has faced cuts that have hampered basic operations such as weather balloon launches in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weather.gov/aly\">Albany, one of three offices alongside Boston and</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weather.gov/okx\"> Long Island, that provide forecast information, warnings and all manner of data to meteorologists in Connecticut.

Those included plans to drastically cut staff and a freeze on many FEMA grant programs used widely by states, including Connecticut, to prevent impacts from climate, weather and other disasters. </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25878815-fema-feb-28-message/\">A memo in late February indicated there would be a review of grant programs, ostensibly in search of diversity, immigrant recipients and climate change purposes. And </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/test/\">on March 18, there was a second executive order from Trump seeking to explore shifting disaster responsibilities from the federal government to states and municipalities.</url></p><p>The grants have remained frozen in defiance of multiple court orders requiring their distribution \u2014 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25879706-ny-v-trump-ruling-re-third-motion-to-enforce/\">the most recent of which came on Friday.

Turner's office manages about $250 million in mostly federal FEMA grants. He said his department is paying out funds to local governments \u2014 even without the guarantee the state will be able to recoup funds that the federal government is legally required to pay. </p><p>About 140 municipalities in the state use federal money to fund local emergency management directors and FEMA money ensures safety around the Millstone Nuclear Power Station, he said. About two-thirds of the 50 positions in Turner's emergency division are federally funded.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25877729-fema-march-20-memo/\">A more recent announcement from DHS classified its many grant programs based on their adherence to the Trump administration's anti-DEI and immigrant dictates \u2014 targeting so-called sanctuary jurisdictions. </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25877730-fema-march-20-classifications/\">They are color-coded green, yellow and red. Connecticut's two biggest preparedness and operations grants, the Homeland Security Grant Program and Emergency Management Performance Grants, were classified red. </url></p><p>#8216;We are working to understand potential impacts to funding. We have asked DHS for their list of what they consider sanctuary jurisdictions, but they have not provided it,#8217; Turner said.</p><p>FEMA did not respond to any of The Connecticut Mirror's questions about whether the state would be penalized due to the state's use of some of the red- and yellow-coded programs or whether FEMA considered any locations in the state #8216;sanctuaries.#8217;</p><p>A spokesman provided a statement attributed to DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin that blamed the Biden administration for what she called #8216;illegal aliens#8217; in the country. The statement said in part: #8216;Secretary Noem has directed FEMA to implement additional controls to ensure that all grant money going out is consistent with law and does not go to fraud, waste or abuse, as in the past.#8217;</p><p>But the BRIC program cancelled on Friday had actually been categorized green and was created during Trump's first term as a way to prevent the kind of damage FEMA usually is tasked with cleaning up.</p><p>When asked to explain the move, a FEMA spokesperson offered this statement: #8216;Under Secretary Noem's leadership, we are ending non-mission critical programs. BRIC was yet another example of a wasteful and ineffective FEMA program. It was more concerned with climate change than helping Americans effected by natural disasters. We are committed to ensuring that Americans in crisis can get the help and resources they need.#8217;</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25880061-fema-advisory-fema-ends-bric/\">A press release said that that any funds that were not distributed would be returned to the federal government. But it was not clear whether that included funds from projects that were underway and had used some the grant money. The spokesperson did not respond to that question. </url></p><p>Either way, Connecticut's loss will be considerable. It will not receive about $53.6 million for six projects for which funds had been awarded. The biggest chunk would have gone to Resilient Bridgeport, a $60 million project to address longstanding flooding issues in the city. FEMA's portion would be about $47.6 million \u2014 none of which has been paid out.</p><p>The second largest project was slated for New Haven, which was to have received more than $25 million, also for flood control. It has received less than $383,000 of that so far. FEMA may seek to take back its remaining funds along with those from several other projects.</p><p>Flood damage on Labored Road, Oxford, on August 19, 2024 after heavy rains caused massive flooding the night before. Most infrastructure damage from the storm is still waiting for funding from FEMA to pay for rebuilding. Credit: Tyler Russell / Connecticut Public</p><p>The state was already nervous about whether some of the recovery funds it is seeking for last year's Naugatuck Valley floods in August and the October fire in Berlin will materialize.</p><p>They've been lucky so far.</p><p>All individual and household assistance that has been requested has been paid \u2014 that's more than $12 million for more than 2,600 people according to FEMA. About two-thirds went to housing assistance with the rest for a variety of other needs. Small business funds have also been paid. The Small Business Administration did not respond to an email requesting additional information.</p><p>But assistance for public infrastructure such as roads and municipal buildings, which typically lag behind other forms of assistance, remains vulnerable. </p><p>A spokesman for FEMA said about $1.2 million had been obligated for 14 of the 171 projects requesting aid. Turner said the estimate of the final total is between $40 and $60 million.</p><p>Turner also said he and others spent some of their time in Washington talking to members of Congress, recognizing that at the very least, the look and operation of FEMA is likely to change, but that the process for figuring that out should include state officials like him.</p><p>#8216;We understand that grants may get reduced, or things may have to be given up in the process,#8217; he said. #8216;At a minimum we need to be able to continue to respond and recover from disasters; prepare for all of the above. But the option of just getting rid of FEMA and dumping it all in the states and locals isn't going to work.#8217;</p><p>He did not dispute that the FEMA process can be slow and cumbersome, noting the state is still working on closing projects and paying people for recovery efforts related to Hurricane Sandy, which occurred in 2012. #8216;That was a big storm, but that just kind of puts into perspective how long this process can take,#8217; he said. #8216;Even people of FEMA agree we need to find a way to speed that process up.#8217;</p><p>The state has had a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/cgabillstatus/cgabillstatus.asp?selBillType=Public+Act&amp;which_year=2013&amp;bill_num=275\">disaster fund on the books since 2013, passed by the legislature in the aftermath of SandyHurricane Irene and the disastrous October snowstorm in 2011. But it's never been funded.</url></p><p>#8216;It's something we are looking at and if the reasons still exist for why it wasn't funded,#8217; said Joanna Wozniak-Brown, the climate and infrastructure policy development coordinator within the Office of Policy and Management.</p><p>In the meantime, Wozniak-Brown notes that the governor's current budget proposes $15 million in immediate disaster recovery funding for small businesses, municipalities and residents. It also provides for a position at every council of governments to deal with storm water and flooding efforts. </p><p>#8216;Then we have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/cgabillstatus/cgabillstatus.asp?selBillType=Bill&amp;which_year=2025&amp;bill_num=9\">the resilience bill that is basically the roadmap to putting all these pieces together and identifying our risks and letting folks know what's in your flood insurance or what's covered in your insurance or not covered in your insurance,#8217; she said.</url></p><p>Wildfire preparation in the governor's resilience bill was also strengthened in the wake of the recent fires.</p><p>Wozniak-Brown said that in the face of as yet unknown consequences of the federal cuts, which could take some time to be felt, the play is to pivot, strategize, create redundancies, and prioritize actions. It's an ongoing process, not a one-time thing, she said.</p><p>#8216;We're just going to keep going until we can't,#8217; she said. #8216;The absence of that is just that we stop, and that's not an option.#8217; </p><p>The Hawthorne Drive fire in Berlin burned for several weeks beginning in October fueled by drought, dry conditions and strong winds. One firefighter died. Credit: DEEP</p><p>Fires</p><p>FEMA is less of an issue for Martin at DEEP \u2014 most of his federal firefighting funds come through the U.S. Forest Service, a division of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, which also covers salaries for about 20% of personnel in his division.</p><p>#8216;The state funding from the forest service we're taking one day at a time,#8217; he said. #8216;I'm on weekly calls with state forestry directors across the country, and no one has not gotten a reimbursement yet.#8217;</p><p>But there is one FEMA grant that has come into play in connection with the Hawthorne fire. It's a Fire Management Assistance Grant, F-MAG, which the state is pursuing for the first time to get reimbursed for the costs associated with the fire.</p><p>#8216;We're actually still in the process of getting all the paperwork to FEMA,#8217; said Berlin Fire Chief John Massirio. That's not an inconsiderable task for a volunteer fire department like Berlin's, not accustomed to keeping track of assets, which in this case included crews and helicopters from Maine, whole units and equipment from New York City and other assistance all the way into Canada as part of the Northeast Forest Fire Protection Compact. </p><p>#8216;It's not a guarantee,#8217; Massirio said of the grant #8212; but there was quite a bit of damaged equipment.</p><p>Martin also has his fingers crossed \u2014 along with the town of New Milford \u2014 on at least one non-FEMA grant.</p><p>Even though New Milford, with the largest land mass and tree canopy in the state, had no wildfires last fall, Mayor Pete Bass figured it would be smart to plan for them. The town has become the first in the state to apply for a Community Wildfire Defense Plan grant. The money, which flows through the Forest Service, would enable them to hire a consultant to develop a plan. Then they could apply for a grant to implement it and purchase equipment.</p><p>The town has a plan for dealing with flooding on Housatonic River, so a fire plan makes sense, Bass said. #8216;This is proper planning to make sure that we can really address issues, especially weather-related ones, in a very efficient manner,#8217; he said. </p><p>The biggest potential pitfall \u2014 the funding for the grant is housed in the Biden Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act \u2014 a funding rollback target for the Trump administration.</p><p>#8216;You're not going to say there's zero risk of a rescission there, but so far, there hasn't been talk of that,#8217; Martin said. #8216;That's definitely a higher risk than some of what we would call traditional funding that dates back decades.#8217;</p><p>Another forest grant program that has Martin worried are funds for urban forestry. The money comes from another Biden-era target \u2014#8212; the Inflation Reduction Act. Martin said they're about halfway through the $3 million allotment.</p><p>A second concern for that grant is that the communities the trees are destined for are the kinds of places the Trump administration is targeting for cuts. #8216;That's where the focus has been, to get more trees in those areas, to cool those locations down,#8217; Martin said. #8216;You don't need trees where the trees already exist. So, yeah, it happens to align perfectly with environmental justice, poverty, economic distress.#8217;</p><p>And then there's the nexus with the weather service. That's an everyday event for Martin's team, not just when there's a critical need like last fall.</p><p>#8216;We do the daily Connecticut wildfire danger \u2014 high, medium, low, that type of thing,#8217; he said. #8216;We're very dependent on NOAA.#8217;</p><p>They're not the only ones.</p><p>The National Weather Service makes the calls for warnings and watches through a national, standardized and free system that anyone has access to.</p><p>Weather</p><p>#8216;There is a very close relationship between NOAA and FEMA, especially the Weather Service and FEMA and the Weather Service and emergency managers,#8217; said meteorologist Tom Di Liberto. He was a couple of weeks short of completing his probationary period as a public affairs spokesman with the National Weather Service when he was laid off along with 800 other probationary employees. But he'd been with NOAA since 2010 in other departments, including the Climate Prediction Center. </p><p>#8216;They're on speed dial. They do briefings before events. When it comes to disaster preparation, it's about the preparation, right?#8217;</p><p>Recent <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-27/us-weather-service-merges-offices-as-staffing-pressure-mounts\">reporting by Bloomberg indicated mergers are in the works to combine the Climate Prediction Center, which provides the longer term climate-driven outlooks including for large factors like El Ni\u00f1o, with the Weather Prediction Center, which provides forecast information that is used locally around the country.</url></p><p>In addition to the two climate centers, the NWS uses information from the National Hurricane Center, which has already faced job eliminations, including in its hurricane hunter group that flies into those storms. Information from all these units \u2014 NOAA-based research, observations, radar and more \u2014 is used to produce models, data and all the other information that help meteorologists predict the weather and make the calls for warnings and watches through a national, standardized and free system. </p><p>Commercial forecast operations like AccuWeather use NOAA for their baseline of information, as do cellphone weather apps, and broadcast weather operations across the country, including local meteorologists in Connecticut.</p><p>If such a system were to become private and for-profit, it raises questions about whether only wealthy communities could afford to get weather information and, more broadly, how consistent that information would be. NOAA sets the criteria for warnings and watches which means, for example, that the many tornado, thunderstorm and flood warnings issued across multiple states because of last week's extreme storms meant exactly the same thing in every area. If the task of issuing warning and watches is divided up among many companies, there are concerns that the criteria would not be uniform nationwide. </p><p>#8216;There's a huge ethical issue,#8217; Di Liberto said. #8216;It's a communications nightmare. Who are you going to trust, right? There's a reason why NOAA produces all the watches and warnings \u2014 it's because you need to have one voice in that sort of situation that people can trust.#8217;</p><p>Di Liberto also worries that the expected additional loss of personnel \u2014 predicted to be about a quarter of the weather service staff \u2014 would mean a loss of the most experienced experts as well as some of the newest people being groomed for the future. </p><p>#8216;You just lost someone's 20, 30 years of experience forecasting for that area, you can't replace that sort of knowledge, You've taken the chunk out at the top and at the bottom,#8217; he said. #8216;You don't have enough people to move around to make anything work.#8217; </p><p>This is especially true in a severe weather situation when everyone's working around the clock.</p><p>An <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/04/01/noaa-commerce-department-contracts-weather-climate\">AXIOS report last week said Trump administration actions at NOAA that had slowed down contract approvals and extensions resulted in a critical situation as severe storms strafed the East Coast A delay in approval of a software contract extension came within hours of compromising access to an array of forecast data.</url></p><p>Cingranelli, the Connecticut emergency department meteorologist, said the NOAA satellites helped him pinpoint hotspots all over the state from the fires last fall. There were 605 fires in 2024, including the outbreak of forest fires in the fall. </p><p>During tropical storms and hurricanes, FEMA will be embedded at the National Hurricane Center and he'll be on calls with them. #8216;They're helping us to figure out, hey, what's the earliest onset of arrival for wind speed, for tropical storm force wind speeds or hurricane force. They have a full surge department that we're looking at storm surge impacts in Long Island Sound,#8217; he said.</p><p>Cingranelli said he likes to always mention a forgotten, if not largely unknown agency, the Northeast River Forecast Center, that's also based in the weather service. #8216;They give us the forecast for all of the rivers across the state, and if there's a significant flooding event, numerous times, I'm getting on the phone with the Northeast River Forecast Center and saying, #8216;hey, this is what we're seeing; does your forecast still align with this?'#8217;</p><p>That could also start to get more difficult because most of the river gauges that do measurements are overseen by the U.S. Geological Service, USGS, also facing cutbacks. Some gauges also have weather stations on them.</p><p>In yet another headache for Turner, USGS said if the state doesn't pick up some of their very high cost, the gauges would be decommissioned.</p><p>#8216;For that price, there's other technology that we could put in their place and just have our own network,#8217; Turner said. He pointed to New York and Pennsylvania, which have something called mesonets, which are a network of industrial grade automated weather monitoring stations, usually in partnership with a university, at a more reasonable cost.</p><p>#8216;Long story short, we're actually in the process of looking at what it would cost us to implement a mesonet here in Connecticut,#8217; Turner said.</p><p>He's also considering putting together a 24/7 watch desk, which many larger states have, instead of the on-call system Connecticut uses, which would be preferable especially if cutbacks at NWS and NOAA mean they can't maintain their 24/7 operation anymore.</p><p>#8216;It's a very fragile house of cards right now, and we need them to continue,#8217; Turner said. #8216;It really could be catastrophic in a lot of ways for our state if they go down that path of stopping the National Weather Service and their functionality.#8217;</p><p>It's not lost on anyone that the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season starts in less than two months. <url normalizedValue=\"https://tropical.colostate.edu/forecasting.html\">Colorado State University, one of the key forecasters, last week predicted above normal activity with nine hurricanes, four of them major.</url></p><p>Also on Turner's plate is better training for firefighters in Connecticut who are not generally familiar with wildfire work, which includes hiking, digging trenches and fire lines, coaxing fire direction and allowing burning in ways that may be unfamiliar to those who generally fight building fires. There's the question of whether to invest in more wildfire equipment, including proper clothing for firefighters \u2014 not the heavy, bulky kind they use for house fires.</p><p>#8216;It's a difficult situation to plan for because it doesn't happen often. Therefore, we don't have a ton of resources in state,#8217; he said. #8216;But at the same time, had the timing been different, where it wasn't the end of the season, where those out-of-state crews from other states or even Canada were not available to help us \u2014 what does that look like?#8217;</p><p>In the meantime, Turner is stuck waiting for FEMA to make decisions on the grants that are his department's lifeline. </p><p>#8216;It's kind of like radio silence,#8217; he said. #8216;When are we going to feel the impacts? It's a terrible climate, just in the sense of uncertainty right now.#8217;</p><p>Even after decisions are made, there's the likelihood they will play out in the courts for a long time. </p><p>#8216;At the end of the day, our work doesn't stop, so we just have to keep going. But it's not a fun environment to be operating in,#8217; he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TCTM10009917544794353106252035081010</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">Newstex Blogs</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FH6-52F3-RSTD-X36P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567843</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4184\"/><timeReceived>9:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

This area is nearly the size of downtown Edmonton. Parks Canada has also established and maintained fire control lines around Jasper since the 1980s to help reduce fire risk to the community.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">- Parks Canada uses prescribed fires and mechanical thinning to lower the risk of wildfires. Since 2018, more than 800 hectares near Jasper has been thinned or cleared to create protective firebreaks. Additionally, since 2003, fire management specialists at Jasper National Park have completed 43 prescribed fires, covering 4,300 hectares.</p><p>- On the evening of Monday, July 22, 2024, the first report of a wildfire northeast of the town of Jasper near the Jasper transfer station was received. Shortly after, three additional wildfires, ignited by lightning, were reported approximately 22 km south of town, which quickly merged into one wildfire. At 8:00 p.m. that evening, an evacuation alert was issued and at 10:00 p.m., an evacuation order was issued for Jasper National Park, including the town of Jasper. Within 48 hours, the wildfire reached town. For more details, visit the official timeline of the Jasper Wildfire web page and the Jasper Wildfire FAQ web page.</p><p>- Despite best efforts, and the deployment of hundreds of firefighters on the ground, the aggressive and fast-moving fire could not be contained before it reached the town.</p><p>- Jasper National Park and the town of Jasper were deeply affected by the wildfire, with total loss to one third of the town's buildings, as well as a loss or damage to a substantial amount of the national park's infrastructure, including staff housing, grounds, utilities buildings, highways and roadways, bridges, docks, trails, day-use areas and facilities, campgrounds, and exhibits and interpretation panels.</p><p>- Following the 2024 Jasper wildfire, the Mayor of Jasper and Superintendent of Jasper National Park both emphasized that all possible prevention measures had been taken. Despite these efforts, extreme heat over 30oC for several days, drought conditions, combined with strong winds and lightning storms, caused the wildfire to spread rapidly.</p><p>Federal Funding Details</p><p>- Parks Canada undertook extraordinary measures to manage, suppress and contain the Jasper wildfire that impacted both the national park and the community, while managing the entire 2024 season as the most expensive wildfire season to date for Parks Canada. The Jasper wildfire alone was the second most expensive wildfire event in Canadian history, with insured damage estimated to be $1.23 billion.</p><p>- The Government of Canada's investment of $133.1 million for Parks Canada is supporting costs incurred in response to the 2024 wildfire season, including the unprecedented wildfire in Jasper National Park. This federal funding will support Parks Canada's 2024 wildfire response as a whole, as well as recovery and rebuilding efforts specific for Jasper National Park, as follows:</p><p>o Up to $45.2 M for Incident Response in Jasper including costs for direct fire suppression costs, deployment of wildfire crews, support resources for fire crews, and costs for suppression services delivered through the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre's Mutual Aid Resource Sharing Agreement.</p><p>o Up to $80.1M for Recovery and Re-entry including costs to provide incident response resources from across the country and temporary accommodation to ensure continued park operations. Significant efforts were undertaken to clear danger trees along roadways, trails, day-use areas and other commercial areas to ensure public safety, contributing to a quick re-opening of many parts of the national park. Funding has also supported Jasper Recovery Coordination Centre (JRCC) costs, repair of key assets and visitor areas, recovery and restoration activities to ensure safe access to the park for staff and visitors and longer-term temporary and interim housing for Jasperites.</p><p>o Up to $7.7M for other fire pressures which includes costs for fighting fires in 2024-25 other than the Jasper wildfire, such as the Wood Buffalo National Park fires that restarted in spring 2024 from the 2023 wildfires and 2024 wildfires in Kootenay National Park.</p><p>- Moving forward, this funding will enable Parks Canada to continue to support housing, offer high quality visitor experiences, address ongoing national park re-opening and visitor safety, boost the park's tourism offer that supports local businesses, and maintain ecological health in Jasper National Park.</p><p>- This funding announcement, combined with $52.5 million in federal funding provided through Budget 2021, brings the total investment committed by the Government of Canada to over $100M over five years to Parks Canada Wildland Fire Fighting to conduct risk reduction, preparedness, and response activities.</p><p>Temporary and Interim Housing</p><p>- The wildfire severely impacted the town of Jasper and the national park. Approximately one third of the Municipality of Jasper's buildings 358 out of 1,113 were destroyed, including homes, businesses, and essential community facilities, built assets and buildings, with approximately 800 housing units lost.</p><p>- Approximately 4.25 hectares of land (which is approximately seven CFL football fields) have been made available by Parks Canada for interim housing in the town. These lands are connected to municipal services and have been ready to receive interim housing since December 6, 2024. Parks Canada has provided the land, in four locations, under a five-year agreement with the Municipality of Jasper. Sites were selected based on the size of the land, access to utilities and proximity to town services.</p><p>- Additional parcels outside the town have been identified for interim housing. Marmot Meadows, adjacent to Whistler Campground, will be the location of a camp-style facility to house over 120 residents, and Wabasso Campground has been identified for the location of a potential contractor camp for rebuild workforce and seasonal staff.</p><p>- With the Municipality of Jasper, Parks Canada will continue to explore additional parcels of land within the town for interim and long-term housing.</p><p>- The Jasper Recovery Coordination Centre has established a dedicated interim housing working group with representatives from all interested and responsible parties to ensure early issue identification, coordination, and open communication. This group prepared and implemented the interim housing program plan that was presented and endorsed by the Jasper-Alberta-Canada Intergovernmental Recovery Committee and submitted to the Alberta Government in September by the Municipality.</p><p>- A framework is in place for the allocation of interim housing for Jasper residents throughout the rebuild and recovery period to address disaster-related housing shortages and support successful recovery. The framework guides priority allocation of interim housing considering community resident \"categories\" including, but not limited to, safety and medical personnel, essential services like grocery, pharmacy and banking, vulnerable individuals, essential operations for both municipal and national park functions, critical services and contractors for rebuilding.</p><p>- Interim housing will begin arriving in mid-February, providing dwellings as follows:</p><p>o 100 duplexes, creating 200 units, slated primarily for within the Jasper townsite. Some units may be located in Marmot Meadows depending on space constraints within town.</p><p>o 120 single dorm-style units at Marmot Meadows, suitable for singles or couples, with shared kitchen and laundry spaces.</p><p>o 4 pre-built units (3-bedroom, 1-bedroom, and studio).</p><p>o 20 two-bedroom prefabricated units for long-term staff housing.</p><p>- Additionally, 70 campsites are reserved for resident interim housing in 2025. Staff accommodations outside of town and previously identified for decommissioning have been reopened for use, and Parks Canada is collaborating with commercial operators outside the town for on-site interim housing solutions.</p><p>Streamlining Processes</p><p>Parks Canada has expedited rebuild efforts by:</p><p>Development and Planning Capacity: Adding 16 planning and development review staff across Parks Canada and the Municipality of Jasper. Since December 2024, this team has hosted over 80 pre-development meetings and responded to over 830 inquiries from lessees and contractors.</p><p>Responsiveness and Communication with Lessees: Engaging the public through four public open houses with hundreds in attendance and with representation from the Insurance Industry and the Canadian Red Cross.</p><p>Demolition and Debris Removal: Streamlining demolition and debris removal permits. As of January 2025, demolition permits have been issued for over 90% of impacted sites. Progress is on track for substantial completion by May 2025 in time for the upcoming construction season. Lessees of the remaining sites are working through insurance processes and personal decisions. Parks Canada continues to provide support.</p><p>Improved Development Policies: Updating land use policies to accelerate rebuilding. Working closely with the Municipality of Jasper to leverage the Housing Accelerator Fund, through the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation, to support rebuilding efforts and to build capacity for housing development.

He said the DNR sent 21 firefighters, three bulldozers and seven engines. Jerome Township Fire Chief Jerry Cole said his department sent 14 firefighters and three vehicles, including a strike truck (a truck with a mini pumper on it) to get the blaze under control.</p><p>While the fire started the morning of Saturday, Oct. 5, it wasn't discovered until Monday, Oct. 7, when firefighters started battling it. Cole said the fire was initially far back and unnoticeable. He suggests the high winds caused it to take off.</p><p>Jerome Township Firefighter Jordan Ortiz first saw the smoke and called Cole, who called the DNR. The DNR reportedly arranged for a plane to check it out.</p><p>Jerome Township and the DNR were joined by firefighters from the cities of Midland and Coleman and the townships of Midland, Mills, Larkin, Hope and Lee townships.</p><p>Also helping the fire crews was ServiceMaster Restoration. ServiceMaster employee Rosella Dice, born and raised in Sanford, took the idea to her bosses about helping the crews with water. The idea expanded to providing coffee and sending checks to two Sanford restaurants where the firefighters could eat.</p><p>\"It was about helping them while they are helping us,\" Dice said.</p><p>Dice along with another employee, Shawn Warren, helped deliver the products. Dice said her bosses were fully on board with the idea. She said they were like, \"Whatever we can do for them.\"</p><p>Cole said, \"I was blown away by their donations. I don't ever think I've seen such an outpouring of generosity in my 51 years with the department.\"</p><p>Cole said after a day of fighting fires, it was nice to sit among other firefighters and enjoy a hot meal.</p><p>Tereasa Nims is a cops and courts reporter with the Midland Daily News.

According to news originating from Hong Kong, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"This study examines the multi-depot location-routing problems of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for urban monitoring (MDLRP-UM). MDLRP-UM arises in various practical applications, including daily police patrols in urban residential areas, forest fire patrols, urban infrastructure status monitoring and data collection, traffic flow monitoring at important intersections, and monitoring of urban temperature and humidity, among others.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Research Grants Council of Hong Kong through NSFC/RGC Joint Research Scheme, Hong Kong Polytechnic University. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Hong Kong Polytechnic University, \"These diverse applications can be modeled as a general mixed-integer quadratically constrained problem (MIQCP), where we jointly plan the service routes of the UAVs, the frequency on each route, and the location of the depots to minimize the total cost. To solve the proposed problem, we decompose it into a master problem and sub-problems. We then propose an iterative algorithm (termed as 'Frequency Time-Frequency Strategy') to solve the sub-problems, which is to find the optimal frequency and corresponding single service time for a given single route. The 'Frequency-Time-Frequency Strategy' is further nested within a tailored adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) based heuristic algorithm to solve the master problem.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed solution method are demonstrated by a series of numerical studies.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Service Network Design for Urban Monitoring.
