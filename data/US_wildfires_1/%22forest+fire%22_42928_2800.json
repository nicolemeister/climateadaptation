But now, that hunger for square footage has diminished, and the region's available office and lab buildings have swelled to an all-time high.</p><p>The county's total vacancy rate climbed to 20.4%, according to a third quarter life science market report by commercial real estate firm Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL). That translates to about 5 million square feet of space waiting to be occupied, out of San Diego\u2019s existing supply of 24.6 million square feet.</p><p>It's nearly double the 10.5% vacancy rate recorded during the same period last year. The amount of available offices and labs has been steadily climbing since 2023, while the demand for these spaces has fallen off sharply.</p><p>The total vacancy rate \u2013 which includes space put up for sublease \u2013 is being driven up by new construction projects\u00a0and a growing\u00a0trend of companies offloading space. For some businesses, these real estate decisions were the result of restructurings or financial troubles.</p><p>Drug giant Takeda Pharmaceuticals, for example, recently moved out of its 163,648-square-foot building off Towne Center Drive after a restructuring shut down its local research and development office. San Diego-based DermTech previously leased an entire 110,000- square-foot office building in Del Mar Heights. But the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in June and sold its assets after struggling to secure more financing.</p><p>Then there was Cue Health, a COVID-19 test maker that grew its funding, personnel and local manufacturing facilities during the pandemic. The company that was once worth $2.3 billion collapsed in May, resulting in the shuttering of its eight facilities across the county.</p><p>It's a stark contrast to the beginning of 2022, when San Diego\u2019s life science vacancy rate hit an all time low of 1%, or 188,000 square feet. The scarcity of available space in San Diego\u2019s life science core had businesses fighting for leases and paying top dollar.</p><p>\u201cSan Diego went through an unprecedented amount of construction as it related to life sciences,\u201d said Taylor DeBerry, senior associate of JLL\u2019s life science group. \u201cSo really, what happened is we just oversubscribed on space and landlords just started building like crazy.\u201d</p><p>DeBerry said the current situation can be traced back to that period of overexuberance. While most businesses were not using their offices during the pandemic, the life science industry had a spike in demand for collaborative spaces.</p><p>\u201cOffice demands plummeted so in order to save their real estate investments, life science real estate investors came in and started converting buildings ... into life sciences,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you really had kind of a perfect storm where you had essentially people moving all of their money from (conventional) office space into life science space.\u201d</p><p>A couple of developments that entered the market in recent months include Vista Sorrento Labs, a 117,000 square-foot building in Sorrento Mesa, and a 60,000-square-foot building off Towne Center Drive in Torrey Pines. The county's vacancy rate doesn't include projects under construction; those are reflected in the availability rate, which is also at a record high of 26.8%.</p><p>A big part of this construction boom stems from record levels of venture capital financing in 2021 that led to unprecedented growth for life science companies.</p><p>During the third quarter of this year, San Diego recorded about 3.8 million square feet of life science space under development. In the third quarter of 2019, there was just under 700,000 square feet in development.</p><p>While San Diego\u2019s life science startups continue to rake in more than $1 billion in venture capital deals each quarter, it\u2019s a steep decline from a few years ago when startups brought in twice as much funding. There are fewer deals being recorded and that money is rarely going to early-stage startups.</p><p>There is still money waiting to be deployed, but investors are not taking risks like they were during the pandemic. This year, high interest rates and the runup to the U.S. presidential election have led investors and companies to tighten their belts.</p><p>Though leasing activity remains tepid, there was a slight increase in demand during the third quarter. The handful of recent leases were under 70,000 square feet and most were for companies growing their footprint.</p><p>For example, Mirador Therapeutics \u2013 a biotech that launched with $400 million \u2013 signed a new 66,000-square-foot lease in Sorrento Mesa. Although some companies have failed this year, DeBerry said the ones moving forward have more promising futures.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s similar to what you\u2019d experience in a forest fire, where the trees get burned but then new sprouts start to grow,\u201d DeBerry said. \u201cSome of the companies that are out there looking for space right now have signed strategic partnership deals with big pharma companies. You\u2019re seeing a lot of that and that's resulting in tenant demand.\u201d</p><p>DeBerry expects that San Diego\u2019s vacancy and availability rates will continue to climb as more projects get delivered, and they won\u2019t come down any time soon. While it's been difficult to attract life science tenants in general, it's been especially challenging for new downtown buildings beyond San Diego's prime biotech neighborhoods.</p><p>The RaDD IQHQ campus on San Diego\u2019s waterfront is a 1.7 million-square-foot project centered on life science labs and offices. The complex also offers retail, dining and green space.</p><p>The Campus at Horton is a 10-acre mixed-use development in the heart of downtown that has plans for life science offices in addition to two 40-story apartment towers and retail.</p><p>Both of these downtown developments are outside San Diego\u2019s traditional biotech cluster and have not announced any life science tenants.</p><p>Experts say tenants have the power in this kind of market and are able to get premium spaces at a cheaper price. The overall asking rent in San Diego County has dropped for the ninth straight quarter, according to JLL.</p><p>\u201cWhenever there is oversupply, you will see the tenant with more power to negotiate,\u201d said Daniel Maldonado, managing director at Unispace Life Sciences. \u201cTenants are flying to high-end spaces because they can find little deals.\u201d</p><p>Maldonado\u2019s firm designs spaces for biotechs and big pharmaceutical companies across the globe. He said the imbalance of supply of life science space and demand from companies right now is not unique to San Diego.</p><p>The country\u2019s other top two life science markets, Boston and San Francisco, are experiencing similar trends. However, Maldonado is optimistic that San Diego will bounce back more quickly over the next year because its vacancy and rental rates are lower than other major markets.</p><p>By comparison, Boston\u2019s total vacancy rate was 28.4% during the third quarter, and average asking rent was $7.17 a square foot per month. San Diego\u2019s average monthly asking rent was $6.02 per square foot.</p><p>\u201cI am really convinced that this short-term problem \u2013 the vacancy rate \u2013 is going to be overpassed by a long-term, growing demand because long-term projections for San Diego\u201d show promising employment growth in life sciences, Maldonado said.</p><p>\u00a92024 The San Diego Union-Tribune.

Several volunteer firefighters were injured in blazes this weekend and these ongoing wildfires have strained state and local resources.</p><p>\"Leaf litter, fine twigs, and dried branches are prime fuel sources for a fire that could get out of control \u2014 when mixed with our current dry conditions, we have a potential recipe for disaster,\" DCNR Secretary Cindy Adams Dunn said. \"I encourage Pennsylvanians to avoid burning on all lands, as it is the best way to protect the people putting their lives in danger to keep our Commonwealth safe from wildfires.\"</p><p>DCNR has paused prescribed burns until further notice. State park and forest visitors with overnight reservations are being notified that campfires will not be allowed until conditions improve.</p><p>Human activity causes 99% of wildfires in Pennsylvania, leading to the destruction of thousands of acres of state and private woodlands each year.</p><p>Wildfires require specific conditions to ignite:</p><p>\u2014An available fuel source \u2014 like dried grass or leaves.</p><p>\u2014Dry conditions \u2014 including low relative humidity.</p><p>\u2014An ignition source \u2014 a way for the fire to start.</p><p>\"Practicing fire prevention outdoors is absolutely critical during these dry conditions,\" State Fire Commissioner Thomas Cook said. \"Careless burning outdoors can put our firefighters lives at risk all across the Commonwealth, so please avoid any open burning anywhere at this time.\"</p><p>No matter where you live, you should stay aware of weather and drought conditions and check for possible municipal or county-level burn bans that may be in effect before any outdoor burning. Always follow the guidance of local emergency officials to help you and your loved ones stay safe.</p><p>\"Wildfires can start quickly and rapidly grow, especially when conditions are dry \u2014 it's important to abide by all burn bans in effect and follow all local official recommendations,\" Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency (PEMA) Director Randy Padfield said. \"People should take every precaution to prevent wildfires and have plans in place if local officials were to issue evacuation orders for a wildfire in their area.\"</p><p>Remember, a single spark can ignite a wildfire, risking your safety and that of others. As Smokey Bear says, \"Only YOU can prevent wildfires!\"</p><p>PA Game Commission agrees</p><p>With much of Pennsylvania abnormally dry, and wildfires impacting many areas, the Pennsylvania Game Commission is temporarily prohibiting the building of fires on state game lands.</p><p>While camping on state game lands is prohibited, regulations allow game lands users to build small fires for cooking or warming purposes. However, the regulation authorizes the Game Commission's executive director to restrict otherwise-permitted activity when the threat of forest fire exists.</p><p>The prohibition on building fires on game lands will be left in place indefinitely until conditions improve.</p><p>\"Taking this one, small step now to address wildfire risk could prevent a larger problem as we get deeper into the heart of hunting season,\" Game Commission Executive Director Steve Smith said. \"Doing what we can to protect wildlife habitat in what might be a hunter's favorite spot benefits both, and might make all the difference.\"</p><p>The Game Commission conducts prescribed burns to improve wildlife habitat on select state game lands, mainly in the spring and early fall, and is temporarily suspending prescribed burns on game lands, as well.</p><p>\"While the Game Commission recognizes the value of prescribed fires under the right conditions, that time is clearly not now,\" said Scott Bearer, Game Commission Chief Land Manager.</p><p>The Pennsylvania Drought Task Force has declared drought conditions in 35 of the state's 67 counties. The state has experienced 100 reported wildfires in the past week, with many more unreported. Several volunteer firefighters were injured in blazes this weekend and these ongoing wildfires have strained state and local resources.</p><p>Nearly 50 Game Commission personnel trained in fire management have been actively involved in suppression activities and structure protection, in partnership with DCNR and the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency.</p><p>North Branch Land Trust welcomes new staff members</p><p>Local non-profit North Branch Land Trust this week welcomed two new staff to its conservation team \u2014 Leah Malarkey, Environmental Education Coordinator; and Caroline Chronowski, Office Administrator.</p><p>Malarkey comes to North Branch with a degree in Early Childhood Education and plenty of experience in Environmental Education. Before joining North Branch, Malarkey had been an educator at Monroe County Conservation District, Camp Kresge, Wildlands Conservancy, and Hillside Farms.</p><p>Outside of her professional life, Malarkey enjoys spending her personal time observing wildlife within nature, creating art using different media forms, and venturing out to new places on the eastern coast with her boyfriend. Malarkey grew up in the suburbs of Luzerne County, but now resides within rural Mountain Top.</p><p>As Environmental Education Coordinator, Malarkey will develop North Branch Land Trust's event series including guided hikes, hands on activities, and naturalist talks. North Branch hopes that the community will embrace this new position by attending events and requesting her expertise in the classroom, at Land Trust Preserves and Sanctuaries, and all public lands in the region. Malarkey will also work with staff to develop educational outreach materials and articles about regional stewardship and appreciating Northeastern Pennsylvania's natural resources.</p><p>Chronowski joined North Branch Land Trust after more than 30 years at Penn State Wilkes Barre where she most recently served as Director of Information Technology. Her background in IT, as well as her leadership and volunteerism throughout the region and passion for the mission led her to the Land Trust. Outside of her professional life, Chronowski enjoys gardening for wildlife with native plants, bird-watching, and exploring local history. Chronowski resides in Falls with her husband George.</p><p>As Office Administrator, Chronowski will play a vital role in supporting the North Branch team and enhancing our conservation operations. She will assist with managing schedules, coordinating events, and ensuring effective communication within and beyond the organization.</p><p>Their dedication and expertise will undoubtedly contribute to North Branch Land Trust's ongoing efforts and initiatives.</p><p>\"North Branch Land Trust is very fortunate to welcome Caroline and Leah to our small but mighty conservation team,\" said Ellen Ferretti, NBLT Executive Director. \"We are all committed to live, work and play in Northeastern Pennsylvania, and to serve as a catalyst for appreciation of the natural beauty and bounty of the area.\"</p><p>\"We are so excited to have both Leah and Caroline onboard,\" said Emma Thompson, Conservation and Stewardship Director. \"They bring unique talents and skill sets to North Branch and we can't wait to showcase their abilities.\"</p><p>\"I am genuinely so excited to work with such a passionate group of people at North Branch, who strive to preserve our natural lands and educate the public on the purpose of conservation,\" Malarkey said. \"I hope to be able to create a greater connection with other local organizations and the public through engaging educational programs.\"</p><p>\"It's thrilling to be sharing my talents in a new way conserving and protecting our beautiful natural landscapes,\" Chronowski said. \"I love to work with both nature and my community, so North Branch Land Trust is a perfect fit.\"</p><p>For more information about North Branch Land Trust and its conservation efforts, visit nblt.org.</p><p>___ (c)2024 The Times Leader (Wilkes-Barre, Pa.)

The Low Divide Fire showed more smoke than yesterday, but growth was not significant. Firefighters continue to make contact and escort backpackers in the area.</p><p>In the morning, smoke from the Eagle Point Fire was observed in the valleys at Hurricane Ridge. It slowly dissipated over the course of the day.</p><p>Fire is an integral part of the forested ecosystems on the Olympic Peninsula; plants and animals here have evolved with fire for thousands of years. Many factors such as weather, topography, and vegetation influence fire behavior and the effects that fires have on natural resources.</p><p>Olympic National Forest Fires</p><p>The Tunnel Creek Fire, located east of the Buckhorn Wilderness in the Olympic National Forest, is now 100% contained. Firefighters will continue to patrol the area. This will be the last update on the fire unless significant changes occur. For additional information, please contact the Olympic National Forest Supervisor's Office at (360) 956-2402.</p><p>Background Information</p><p>All six active fires in Olympic National Park ignited when a series of lightning strikes occurred on the Olympic Peninsula.</p><p>On August 18, Olympic National Park and Olympic National Forest implemented a fire ban including charcoal fires. The move to Stage 2 fire restrictions is due to continued hot and dry conditions that are forecasted to continue at least through the end of October as dry conditions in the region persist. One less spark means one less wildfire.</p><p>Closures</p><p>Obstruction Point Road and the trailhead will be closed until further notice. Olympic National Park Wilderness Information Center (WIC) will be notifying backcountry permit holders who may be impacted by this closure.</p><p>Weather and Fire Behavior</p><p>The upper-level ridge over the area today will move east tonight. A weakening frontal system will pass over the site late Sunday bringing cooler temperatures and the chance for showers. Continued seasonal conditions expected through at least the middle of next week. A return to warmer and drier conditions is expected late next week.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126123156</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:694S-PMH1-DYTH-G008-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"392\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>September 9, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NATIONAL PARK SERVICE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120MM</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; RECREATION DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLYR</classCode><className>PUBLIC LAND MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000956</classCode><className>FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0008XH6</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009T9T</classCode><className>SMOKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DM3Y</classCode><className>FORESTRY WORKERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DBBS</classCode><className>BACKPACKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0009FYF</classCode><className>LIFE FORMS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DM3Y</classCode><className>FORESTRY WORKERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST0009Y84</classCode><className>NORTHWEST USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS163</classCode><className>WASHINGTON, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

According to news reporting from Nanjing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning technique that allows for on-site data collection and processing without sacrificing data privacy and transmission. Heterogeneity is a key challenge in federated settings.\" </p><p><br/> Financial support for this research came from National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC). <br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Nanjing Forestry University, \"Recently, cross-technology communication (CTC) has emerged as a solution for Internet of Things (IoT) heterogeneity, enabling direct communication between different wireless devices without the need for hardware modifications or gateway intervention. For example, a sophisticated WiFi device can serve as a central coordinator for other heterogeneous devices, such as LoRa, ZigBee, Bluetooth, and LTE, leading to more efficient and ubiquitous cross-network information exchange. However, heterogeneous wireless technologies present different data transmission rates and computing resources, making it difficult to achieve high accuracy in predictions due to large amounts of multidimensional data, communication delays, transmission latency, limited processing capacity, and data privacy concerns. In this work, we propose an FL framework based on CTC for heterogeneous IoT applications, called FLCTC. To demonstrate the usability of FLCTC, we implemented FLCTC and a specific solution for forest fire prediction. FLCTC was concretely implemented as a federal deep learning based on long and short-term memory and used for forest fire prediction, addressing the challenge of data characterization in heterogeneous IoT networks. FLCTC promises to improve communication efficiency and prediction accuracy.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Our platform-based evaluation results show that FLCTC is feasible, with a recall of 96% and an accuracy of 88%, offering valuable insights into the use of FL with CTC for heterogeneous IoT applications.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Federated Learning Based On Ctc for Heterogeneous Internet of Things.

According to news originating from Vigo, Spain, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Forest areas or green infrastructure have become a fundamental economic and social factor which has made it possible to generate new sources of employment and to maximize the use of basic resources.\" </p><p><br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from University of Vigo: \"Nevertheless, good conservation of this type of infrastructure is a challenge. This is due to the problems deriving from, on the one hand, the increase of its physical scope and, on the other, poor management or no management at all. The Spanish region of Galicia is a historic place of natural wealth, especially concerning forest resources, wherein 2/3 of its territory is forest area from where more than half of the Spanish wood supply comes. This paper seeks to create a mapping of major forest fire disturbances on the Galician territory over extended periods of time. To achieve this, an automated multitemporal detection process based on vegetation indices and unsupervised learning is developed.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The objective is to obtain data heterogeneity in terms of vegetation state, land use, and image properties, allowing a better understanding of forest land disturbances and improving their management.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: A Novel Methodology For The Automatic Acquisition of Real Forest Fire Datasets Over Long Periods of Time.

Part of his barley crop is sold to Danish brewer Carlsberg.</p><p>His barley production will be 30 percent lower than last year because of the drought, he said.</p><p>And his losses will depend on the autumn's grain prices.</p><p>\"I hope the price will go a little higher so my bottom line is okay. But if the price stays the same my bottom line will be no good.\"</p><p>Jonsson may have to let go of one of his two employees, as in 2018.</p><p>He says his region has until now largely been spared the effects of climate change.</p><p>Higher temperatures have been the most tangible impact.</p><p>\"It's much warmer... I have to look at what I will be planting in my fields in the future,\" says Jonsson, who also grows rye and wheat in a region were grain irrigation is prohibited.</p><p>He may have to start growing crops typically associated with more southern regions.</p><p>\"Maybe some of the things you have in France such as sunflowers or soy or soybeans.

According to news reporting out of Kunming, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"The refracted, reflected, and scattered signals from global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) have been successfully used for remote sensing (RS) of the Earth's surface and atmosphere, demonstrating their potential for sensing the atmosphere, oceans, land surface and cryosphere.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Yunnan Fundamental Research Projects; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Major Scientific And Technological Projects of Yunnan Province: Research on Key Technologies of Ecological Environment Monitoring And Intelligent Management of Natural Resources in Yunnan; Innovative Training Plan Program For College Students of Yunnan Province. <br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Kunming University of Science and Technology: \"As an emerging RS technology, spaceborne GNSS reflectometry (GNSS-R) has been widely used in the field of land RS, with unique advantages such as high spatial and temporal resolution, low observation cost, wide coverage, and all-weather operation. In recent years, the successful launch of several spaceborne GNSS-R satellites has opened new opportunities in this field. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive overview of the breakthrough applications of spaceborne GNSS-R technology in the key areas of soil moisture, soil salinity, vegetation monitoring, soil freezing and thawing, flood detection, inland water bodies, wetland dynamics, forest fire disturbances, and land topography measurements, as well as possible future research directions. In addition, this article also emphasizes the contribution and role of China's recently launched Tianmu-1 constellation (as of 5 January 2024, 23 satellites have been in stable operation in orbit) in the development of spaceborne GNSS-R technology and explores the future development direction and prospects of this technology. By comprehensively analyzing the latest progress and innovative achievements of relevant research, the significant impact of this technology on land RS applications in environmental monitoring, resource management, and disaster warning has been highlighted.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Through a comprehensive summary of these fields, the enormous potential of spaceborne GNSS-R technology in promoting sustainable development and ecological protection has been revealed.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Land Remote Sensing Applications Using Spaceborne GNSS Reflectometry: A Comprehensive Overview.

This reduction on restrictions will allow campfires outside established camping sites.</p><p>Recent rain and cooler weather contributed to this decision a week before the official start of autumn, forest officials said.</p><p>Forest officials asked people to remember fire and stove recommendations:</p><p>\u2022 A shovel and at least a gallon of water should be present at all times. Fires should be drowned and stirred \u2014 then drowned and stirred again \u2014 until cool enough to touch.</p><p>\u2022 Keep campfires and charcoal briquette fires contained in an earthen pit, metal fire ring, or rock ring, with all combustible material removed within a 5-foot radius of the perimeter of the fire ring \u2014 and clear of overhanging material.</p><p>\u2022 Portable cooking stoves and portable fireplaces should have all combustible material removed within a 5-foot radius. Wood burning stoves should be equipped with a chimney at least 5-feet in length and a spark-arresting screen consisting of \u00bc-inch mesh hardware cloth.</p><p>\u2022 Campfires are restricted in the Eagle Cap Wilderness to reduce impacts on lakes. Rules are printed on the back of wilderness permits.</p><p>Separate rules apply within a quarter-mile of the Wild and Scenic portions of the Snake River. Public lands in Idaho administered by the Wallowa-Whitman follow separate Idaho fire restrictions idahofireinfo.com/p/fire-restrictions.html.</p><p>Other restrictions remain in place in the forest:</p><p>\u2022 Chain saws may be operated only between the hours of 8 p.m. and 1 p.m. local time. This prohibition does not apply to personal-use and commercial firewood permit holders operating under the terms of their permit.</p><p>\u2022 Except for motor vehicles, combustion engines may not be used without a spark-arresting device properly installed, maintained, and in effective working order per Forest Service standards.</p><p>\u2022 Traveling off developed forest roads and trails is not allowed, except for the purpose of going to and from a campsite located within 300 feet of the open developed road. All motorized travel on roads closed by gates, barricades, berms, rocks, or logs is prohibited.</p><p>\u2022 No smoking is allowed, except within an enclosed vehicle or building, developed recreation site or while stopped in an area that is cleared of flammable material within at least 3 feet.</p><p>State restrictions</p><p>As of 12:01 a.m. Tuesday, Sept. 17, the Oregon Department of Forestry will drop down to moderate fire danger, due to moderating weather and precipitation, but fire season remains in effect for private, state, county, municipal, and tribal lands protected by the department.</p><p>The Northeast Oregon District includes lands in the following counties: Union, Baker, Umatilla, Wallowa, and small portions of Grant, Morrow, and Malheur counties.</p><p>Burn permits are required for burning debris and barrels. Contact the ODF's La Grande unit at 541-963-3168 to ask about permits.</p><p>Campfires for recreational and/or cooking purposes are allowed.</p><p>Possession of the following firefighting equipment is required: a shovel or other firefighting tool, a minimum of 1 gallon of water, or 2 \u00bd 2-pound or larger fire extinguisher, and a fire watch at least one hour after extinguishing.</p><p>Exploding targets, tracer ammunition or any bullet with a pyrotechnic charge in its base and sky lanterns always are prohibited.</p><p>More information on fire restrictions can be found on the Blue Mountain Interagency Dispatch Center website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bmidc.org\">www.bmidc.org</url>.

According to news reporting from Bitlis Eren University by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Wildfires have long been one of the critical environmental disasters that require a careful monitoring system.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include European Union-nextgenerationeu. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Bitlis Eren University: \"An intelligent system has the potential to both prevent/extinguish the fire and deliver urgent requirements postfire. In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), with the ability to detect missions in high-risk areas, have been gaining increasing interest, particularly in forest fire monitoring. Taking a large-scale area involved in a fire into consideration, a single UAV is often insufficient to accomplish the task of covering the whole disaster zone. This poses the challenge of multi-UAVs optimum path planning with a key focus on limitations such as energy constraints and connectivity. To narrow down this issue, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning approach for multi-UAVs that permits UAVs to extract the required information within the disaster area on time. A target area is partitioned into several identical subareas in terms of size to enable UAVs to perform their patrol duties over the subareas.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"This subarea-based arrangement converts the issue of trajectory planning into allowing UAVs to frequently visit each subarea. Each subarea is initiated with a risk level by creating a fire risk map optimizing the UAV patrol route more precisely. Through a set of simulations conducted with a real trace of the dataset, the performance outcomes confirmed the superiority of the proposed idea.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Trajectory Planning of Swarm UAV Fulfilling Wildfire Reconnaissance.

Less than 24 hours later, Kootenai National Forest fire crews had it contained.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Despite soaking rains that fell just two weeks ago on Friday, Aug. 23, hot, breezy conditions since then in south Lincoln County allowed what an area fire manager said were the accompanying lightning strikes from that weather front to become a small wildfire.</p><p>Three Rivers Ranger District Fire Management Officer Beau Macy said he was somewhat surprised the multitude of lightning strikes that hit the region didn't produce more fires.</p><p>\"The rain was very timely,\" Macy said. \"That weather, more rain than lightning, was abnormal from what we normally get. But that area is one of the drier ones in our district. It's pretty arid for our area.\"</p><p>The fire burned in a steep, brushy area at about 2,800 feet elevation. It's part of the Forest Service's proposed Knotty Pine Project. Work hasn't begun due to litigation by various environmental groups. They argue new roads in the project area would make grizzly bears in the Cabinet-Yaak Ecosystem more vulnerable.</p><p>U.S. District Court judge Dana Christensen agreed in April 2023.</p><p>Macy said the hope is the project would begin at some point.</p><p>\"The area hasn't been cut for some time, it's very brushy and there's not much for wildlife in that area. It's also an area where people live nearby and those are the areas we're trying to thin to reduce the risk of a large fire.\"</p><p>Macy pointed out the Old Highway 2 subdivision is only 1 1/2 miles to the west and the Yaak River Road with other human habitation is one-half mile to the east.</p><p>Macy said in a different year, with drier conditions, the fire could have posed a more significant risk. He also noted that continued hot and dry weather forecast for the next several days should keep people diligent about how they use fire, such as hunter's campsites, or taking care when parking vehicles, smoking, cutting firewood.</p><p>\"This year on this district we've had fewer human-caused fires, but we still urge folks recreating to be careful and make sure camp fires are thoroughly extinguished,\" Macy said. \"There's quite a bit of available fuel out there.\"</p><p>Montana's archery deer and elk seasons begin Saturday.</p><p>As for the Cougar Ridge Fire, a crew of about 15 firefighters worked the blaze along with a water tender, two Type 6 engines and an excavator.</p><p>The fire was above an old, Kelly-humped road that a man operating the excavator used to re-open so the water tender could get up the road.</p><p>A.J. Faur, a 2018 Troy High School graduate, is in his seventh season working fires with Three Rivers. He drove the water tender that carried about 3,500 gallons of water from the nearby Yaak River Campground.</p><p>\"I soaked the Kelly-humped road after the excavator opened it up to firm the road up so it's drivable,\" Faur said.</p><p>The tender allowed other firefighters to lay hose around the fire's perimeter after crews had dug a line.</p><p>Taylor Quinn was the fire boss at the scene. She graduated Libby High School 11 years ago and began working on fire crews right out of school. She became a full-time Forest Service employee a year ago.</p><p>\"We got a hand line dug around it, now we'll get some water on it,\" Quinn said.</p><p>Macy said a helicopter wasn't used on the fire because of it's behavior.</p><p>\"The fire's behavior dictates how we approach it,\" Macy said. \"With it not being very aggressive, a copter wasn't necessary. Any time you put one in the air it's a risk and also very costly. Those are some of the considerations that go into those decisions.\"</p><p>Macy also mentioned the cooperation from an Arkansas engine crew that's spending the summer in the Kootenai.</p><p>\"They come up here for our season and we send a crew down there for theirs in March and April before green up and trees leaf out,\" Macy said.</p><p>___ (c)2024 The Western News (Libby, Mont.)

According to news reporting originating from Kunming, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Wildfire prediction plays a vital role in the management and conservation of forest ecosystems. By providing detailed risk assessments, it contributes to the reduction of fire frequency and severity, safeguards forest resources, supports ecological stability, and ensures human safety.\" </p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Southwest Forestry University: \"This study systematically reviews wildfire prediction literature from 2003 to 2023, emphasizing research trends and collaborative trends. Our findings reveal a significant increase in research activity between 2019 and 2023, primarily driven by the United States Forest Service and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The majority of this research was published in prominent journals such as the International Journal of Wildland Fire, Forest Ecology and Management, Remote Sensing, and Forests. These publications predominantly originate from Europe, the United States, and China. Since 2020, there has been substantial growth in the application of machine learning techniques in predicting forest fires, particularly in estimating fire occurrence probabilities, simulating fire spread, and projecting post-fire environmental impacts. Advanced algorithms, including deep learning and ensemble learning, have shown superior accuracy, suggesting promising directions for future research. Additionally, the integration of machine learning with cellular automata has markedly improved the simulation of fire behavior, enhancing both efficiency and precision. The profound impact of climate change on wildfire prediction also necessitates the inclusion of extensive climate data in predictive models. Beyond conventional studies focusing on fire behavior and occurrence probabilities, forecasting the environmental and ecological consequences of fires has become integral to forest fire management and vital for formulating more effective wildfire strategies.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The study concludes that significant regional disparities in knowledge exist, underscoring the need for improved research capabilities in underrepresented areas. Moreover, there is an urgent requirement to enhance the application of artificial intelligence algorithms, such as machine learning, deep learning, and ensemble learning, and to intensify efforts in identifying and leveraging various wildfire drivers to refine prediction accuracy. The insights generated from this field will profoundly augment our understanding of wildfire prediction, assisting policymakers and practitioners in managing forest resources more sustainably and averting future wildfire calamities.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Research Trends in Wildland Fire Prediction Amidst Climate Change: A Comprehensive Bibliometric Analysis.

According to news reporting originating from VIT-AP University by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Forest fires are caused naturally by lightning, high atmospheric temperatures, and dryness. Forest fires have ramifications for both climatic conditions and anthropogenic ecosystems.\" </p><p><br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from VIT-AP University: \"According to various research studies, there has been a noticeable increase in the frequency of forest fires in India. Between 1 January and 31 March 2022, the country had 136,604 fire points. They activated an alerting system that indicates the location of a forest fire detected using MODIS sensor data from NASA Aqua and Terra satellite images. However, the satellite passes the country only twice and sends the information to the state forest departments. The early detection of forest fires is crucial, as once they reach a certain level, it is hard to control them. Compared with the satellite monitoring and detection of fire incidents, video-based fire detection on the ground identifies the fire at a faster rate. Hence, an unmanned aerial vehicle equipped with a GPS and a high-resolution camera can acquire quality images referencing the fire location.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Further, deep learning frameworks can be applied to efficiently classify forest fires. In this paper, a cheaper UAV with extended MobileNet deep learning capability is proposed to classify forest fires (97.26%) and share the detection of forest fires and the GPS location with the state forest departments for timely action.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Forest Fire Identification in UAV Imagery Using X-MobileNet.

I know it's very frustrating to hear this, but it is the truth,\" he said.</p><p>That means, for example, upping Medicare reimbursements to primary care practitioners means medical specialists don't see as big an increase, Becerra said.</p><p>Becerra joined U.S. Reps. Teresa Leger Fern\u00e1ndez and Melanie Stansbury at the event, where attendees asked about possible solutions such as making it easier for doctors from other countries to practice in the U.S. and incentivizing medical practitioners to act as teachers and mentors.</p><p>Fredrick Sandoval, executive director of the New Mexico-based National Latino Behavioral Health Association, said he'd like to see the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration dramatically increase funding for community-level prevention programs to fight fentanyl use, saying that, across the country, only 1 in 10 Latinos over the age of 12 has access to substance abuse services.He described the fentanyl crisis as a \"forest fire\" that's grown out of control.</p><p>\"You don't have just a little campfire, we have a forest fire,\" Sandoval said. \"The forest fire is our fentanyl issue.\"</p><p>Becerra told attendees that while the issues raised are not new, the federal government has strict limits on what it can do in the realm of health care, which is considered a state responsibility, and the Health and Human Services Department has been a particular target in partisan budgetary battles.</p><p>\"SAMHSA doesn't have a tree that gives it more money, and SAMHSA is only what Congress gives us,\" he said. \"... This year, the Department of Health and Human Services, including SAMHSA, took the biggest cuts in order to satisfy those in Congress ... who have demanded reductions.\"</p><p>Becerra, a former California congressman, said political fighting, funding and legal limits are a frustrating reality.</p><p>\"That's why some of us have called for a different way to do health care, a single-payer system of health care,\" Becerra said to applause.</p><p>Stansbury said countries with single-payer systems and national health care programs have lower costs and better patient outcomes. But, she said, getting to universal health care would be \"extraordinarily challenging.\"</p><p>\"We've got private companies, we've got public entities that are providing health care,\" she said. \"We've got contentious politics in Congress. We're in the middle of a presidential elections year. So how do you fix the problem ... is the most immediate question in front of us.\"</p><p>Limitations aside, Becerra said, Health and Human Services still has a powerful way to effect policy.</p><p>\"Everything we do, we put money on the table,\" he said. \"And we tell the states, 'You want to grab that money? You got to do what we say in order to get that money.' \"</p><p>Becerra pointed to President Joe Biden's proposal to double federal spending on community health centers around the country, the pandemic rollout of free COVID-19 vaccines and ongoing shifts in how Medicaid can be used.</p><p>\"If you think Medicaid is only a dollar that gets used to reimburse a physician or a hospital, you haven't seen what we're doing lately,\" Becerra said. \"... Today we want to use Medicaid in schools. Today we want to help you keep someone housed who otherwise would have deteriorating health if they didn't have a place to live.\"</p><p>Becerra said he knows there's not enough money going toward some needs, especially behavioral health.</p><p>\"When a 10-year-old is thinking about committing suicide ... something's wrong,\" Becerra said.</p><p>As well as taking part in the health care roundtable, Becerra joined U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n and Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller for an event at the under-construction medical sobering center at Albuquerque's Gateway Center.</p><p>Becerra said the sobering center, which is receiving $4.2 million of congressionally directed funding, is an example of a service that can help stop a bad situation from becoming worse.</p><p>Part of the Gibson Health Hub, the center at 5400 Gibson Blvd. SE will serve as a detox clinic while taking pressure off emergency rooms, keeping people out of jail and supporting the community.</p><p>\"[This center] is going to help a lot of families hopefully catch them early to prevent things from getting really bad rather than just trying to remediate,\" he said. \"... These centers are hopefully places to treat and prevent.\"</p><p> Coming next week</p><p>Starting Sunday, The New Mexican will publish a three-part series examining the state of behavioral health care in New Mexico.</p><p>Sunday: An overall look at the system, how we got here and some of its most pernicious problems.</p><p>Monday: Access to crisis services has come a long way in New Mexico, with some communities investing in crisis triage centers and response teams. But when the crisis passes, New Mexicans frequently fall into a purgatory of waitlists than can feel like two steps back.</p><p>Tuesday: Where to from here? State leaders, behavioral health professionals, those who use behavioral health services and their families weigh in on the great and small changes that could improve the system.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWMEX-15811480</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWMEX2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BR7-N9N1-JBSG-1005-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147872</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"913\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Santa Fe New Mexican All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Santa Fe New Mexican</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"04\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>April 5, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>SUBSTANCE ABUSE &amp;

The regulations affected by this update have been previously submitted by Washington and approved by the EPA. In this final rule, the EPA is also notifying the public of corrections and clarifying changes in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) tables that identify the materials incorporated by reference into the Washington SIP. This update affects the materials that are available for public inspection at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and the EPA Regional Office.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DATES: This action is effective August 19, 2024.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ADDRESSES: The SIP materials for which incorporation by reference into 40 CFR part 52 is finalized through this action are available for inspection at the following locations: Environmental Protection Agency, Region 10, 1200 Sixth Avenue, Suite 155, Seattle, WA 98101; and <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.regulations.gov\">www.regulations.gov</url>. To view the materials at the Region 10 Office, the EPA requests that you email the contact listed in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section to schedule your inspection. The Regional Office's official hours of business are Monday through Friday 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., excluding Federal holidays.</p><p>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jeff Hunt, EPA Region 10, 1200 Sixth Avenue--Suite 155, Seattle, WA 98101, at (206) 553-0256, or <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:hunt.jeff@epa.gov\">hunt.jeff@epa.gov</email></p><p>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</p><p>I. Background Each state has a SIP containing the control measures and strategies used to attain and maintain the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). The SIP is extensive, containing such elements as air pollution control regulations, emission inventories, monitoring networks, attainment demonstrations, and enforcement mechanisms.</p><p>Each state must formally adopt the control measures and strategies in the SIP after the public has had an opportunity to comment on them and then submit the proposed SIP revisions to the EPA. Once these control measures and strategies are approved by EPA, and after notice and comment, they are incorporated into the federally approved SIP and are identified in part 52, \"Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans,\" of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR part 52). The full text of the state regulation approved by the EPA is not reproduced in its entirety in 40 CFR part 52 but is \"incorporated by reference.\" This means that the EPA has approved a given state regulation or specified changes to the given regulation with a specific effective date. The public is referred to the location of the full text version should they want to know which measures are contained in a given SIP. The information provided allows the EPA and the public to monitor the extent to which a state implements a SIP to attain and maintain the NAAQS and to take enforcement action for violations of the SIP.</p><p>The SIP is a living document which the state can revise as necessary to address the unique air pollution problems in the state. Therefore, the EPA from time to time must take action on proposed revisions containing new or revised state regulations. A submission from a state can revise one or more rules in their entirety, or portions of rules. The state indicates the changes in the submission (such as by using redline/strikethrough text) and the EPA then takes action on the requested changes. The EPA establishes a docket for its actions using a unique Docket Identification Number, which is listed in each action. These dockets and the complete submission are available for viewing on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.regulations.gov\">www.regulations.gov</url>.</p><p>On May 22, 1997 (62 FR 27968), the EPA revised the procedures for incorporating by reference, into the Code of Federal Regulations, materials approved by the EPA into each SIP. These changes revised the format for the identification of the SIP in 40 CFR part 52, streamlined the mechanisms for announcing the EPA approval of revisions to a SIP, and streamlined the mechanisms for the EPA's updating of the IBR information contained for each SIP in 40 CFR part 52. The revised procedures also called for the EPA to maintain \"SIP Compilations\" that contain the federally approved regulations and source-specific permits submitted by each state agency.</p><p>The EPA generally updates these SIP Compilations every few years. Under the revised procedures, the EPA must periodically publish an informational document in the rules section of the Federal Register notifying the public that updates have been made to a SIP Compilation for a particular state. The EPA began applying the 1997 revised procedures to the Washington SIP on March 20, 2013 ((78 FR 17108). The EPA subsequently published updates to the IBR materials for Washington on December 8, 2014 (79 FR 72548), April 12, 2016 (70 FR 21470), February 8, 2019 (84 FR 2738), and August 3, 2021 (86 FR 41716).</p><p>A.

HOLC provides legislative drafting services to the committees and Members of the House of Representatives on a nonpartisan, impartial, and confidential basis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Recent recognition of Wade's service to Congress includes the 2024 Democracy Award for Lifetime Achievement by Congressional Staff and exceptional leadership and contributions, including through the development of the Comparative Print Suite for the U.S. House of Representatives.</p><p>Describe your background.</p><p>I am from Roanoke, Virginia. During my youth I was active in sports, Scouting, and the YMCA. I earned a B.S. in forestry (industrial forestry operations with cooperative education certificate) from Virginia Tech in 1980. At Tech, I was active in Alpha Phi Omega. APO is the coed national service fraternity affiliated with Scouting. I met my wife in APO. We've been married for 41 years and have two married sons and two grandchildren. I am an Eagle Scout and have served as an adult leader in Scouting, both as cubmaster and scoutmaster.</p><p>What is your academic/professional history?</p><p>After Virginia Tech, I went to the University of Virginia School of Law and earned a J.D. in 1983. I joined the Office of the Legislative Counsel, U.S. House of Representatives in the fall of 1983, where I am presently employed. The Office is a non-partisan, career office responsible for drafting legislation for the House, its committees, members, and leadership. After completing training, during which I drafted federal law generally, I worked with foreign affairs legislation. Due to needs of the Office, in 1986, I moved into the areas of Native American issues (including health care and land claims), federal land issues (including natural resources, water reclamation and irrigation, public lands, and forestry), and intelligence, and later picked up parts of veteran's affairs. In 1996, I changed to the tax team, again due to the needs of the Office. As a member of the team, I drafted in all areas of federal tax law, specializing in pensions, health care, bonds, and excise taxes. Alongside of tax, I have worked in public debt, ERISA, health care, and social security.</p><p>I earned a graduate certificate in spiritual direction studies from Washington Theological Union in 2013 and a certificate in spiritual formation from the Avila Institute in 2015.</p><p>In 2016, I was appointed the 8th Legislative Counsel of the House of Representatives, effective August 1. During my time as the head of the Office, there has been significant change in both the House and the Office, including a 45% increase in the number of attorneys and a significant increase in demand for draft legislation. The Office now has some 90 personnel, including 68 attorneys. Some of the changes include improving the recruiting system and modifying the training methodology for new attorneys and transitioning the Office to a new Sharepoint site and digital leave management system.</p><p>I have also been fortunate to be able to work with other institutions in the legislative branch, especially through participation in the Congressional Data Task Force. This includes:</p><p>Partnering with the Clerk of the House and the Government Publishing Office to develop and update the Comparative Print Suite, a software tool that provides on-demand comparisons of how a bill changes law, how amendments change a bill, bill-to-bill differences, and a bill viewer; and</p><p>Working to provide educational opportunities concerning the legislative process and drafting software applications.</p><p>How would you describe your job to other people?</p><p>My official job title is Legislative Counsel of the House of Representatives. The fun way to describe my job is that I am responsible for producing paper for the House. This is a throwback to my forestry days where the job of a procurement forester is to ensure that the mill never runs out of timber.</p><p>Additionally, I meet with members and staffs of parliaments around the world to discuss and share ideas for improvements in legislative process and drafting. These opportunities include working through the House Democratic Initiative, the National Democratic Institute, and the International Republican Institute. I am an associate member of the Commonwealth Association of Legislative Counsel and a frequent speaker and contributor to webinars on improving legislative drafting organized by Bssola Tech, an international leader in this arena.</p><p>What is your role in the development of Congress.gov?</p><p>I do not think of this as a role, but I brought to the attention of Congress.gov various research and document needs that are useful to drafters. They developed features to meet those needs. It is interesting to me that most of my draft files are on Congress.gov in the form of bills and resolutions.</p><p>What is your favorite feature of Congress.gov?</p><p>Well, there are two features that I use a lot. Whenever a drafting request requires beginning with a public version of a bill or resolution (introduced, reported, passed, etc.), we begin with the version that is posted on Congress.gov in the XML format. So, the download feature that allows me to save this version on my computer system is a big hit for me. In addition, I use the tables of public laws and appropriations a lot. I will get to these either from links on the website or from searches and filters.</p><p>What is the most interesting fact you've learned about the legislative process while working for Congress?</p><p>Ha. The legislative process happens. Sometimes it is textbook. Sometimes it is a bit convoluted. Sometimes a bill is conferenced before it is introduced. But, the formal steps are acknowledged, even if it is by discharge or unanimous consent. So, it is important to know the ideal path to how a bill becomes law so that you can place a question in the context of this ideal.</p><p>What's something most of your co-workers do not know about you?</p><p>During high school and college, I was a member of forest fire fighting teams.

According to news reporting out of Hitachi, Japan, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"The early detection and rapid extinguishing of forest fires are effective in reducing their spread.\" </p><p><br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Ibaraki University: \"Based on the MODIS Thermal Anomaly (MOD14) algorithm, we propose an early stage fire detection method from low-spatial-resolution but high-temporal-resolution images, observed by the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard the geostationary meteorological satellite Himawari-8. In order to not miss early stage forest fire pixels with low temperature, we omit the potential fire pixel detection from the MOD14 algorithm and parameterize four contextual conditions included in the MOD14 algorithm as features. The proposed method detects fire pixels from forest areas using a random forest classifier taking these contextual parameters, nine AHI band values, solar zenith angle, and five meteorological values as inputs. To evaluate the proposed method, we trained the random forest classifier using an early stage forest fire data set generated by a time-reversal approach with MOD14 products and time-series AHI images in Australia. The results demonstrate that the proposed method with all parameters can detect fire pixels with about 90% precision and recall, and that the contribution of contextual parameters is particularly significant in the random forest classifier.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The proposed method is applicable to other geostationary and polar-orbiting satellite sensors, and it is expected to be used as an effective method for forest fire detection.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Early Stage Forest Fire Detection from Himawari-8 AHI Images Using a Modified MOD14 Algorithm Combined with Machine Learning.

She remembers having to wear a mask at school when the 2018 Camp Fire (the most destructive wildfire in California's history) raged more than 200 miles away from her home.</url></p><p>'I realized that if I could pull this off, the results could be quite impactful in terms of how many lives we can save and how much we can help the environment,' she told  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.timeforkids.com/g56/kid-heroes-for-the-planet-g3-g5-8/\">TIME for Kids.</url></p><p>According to the  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nifc.gov/nicc\">National Interagency Coordination Center, more than 39,000 wildfires have taken place in 2024, burning more than 1.3 billion acres. Major fires can destroy communities, and their smoke can drift hundreds of miles, causing adverse health effects to those exposed. Predicting where fires may break out can help people get out of harm's way and direct firefighters to hot spots for earlier suppression.</url></p><p>In the wake of her achievement, Kosaraju was invited to a panel at the 2022 NASA imaginAviation event.

It also exposed the yawning gaps in forest fire management in Northeast region which accounts for more than fifty per cent of forest fires in India. The Indian Air Force deployed two helicopters equipped with Bambi buckets for spraying water to bring the raging fire in the district and adjoining areas under control following an SOS by the Mizoram government. It is heartening to know that no casualty has been reported from the affected areas. </p><p>The prevailing COVID-19 pandemic situation will make providing shelter and rehabilitation to affected people a challenging task. According to \"India State of Forest Report, 2019\" Mizoram accounts for the highest 29.91 per cent of its forest cover spreading over an area of 5423 sq. km is \"extremely fire prone\" and 38.46 per cent forest cover (7009 sq. km) is \"very highly fire prone\" and 24.64 per cent forest cover (4481 sq. km) is highly fire-prone.\" The state is virtually sitting on a volcano of forest fires with nearly 93 per cent of its total forest cover being extremely and highly fire prone while only 5.35 per cent of its forest over is \"moderately prone to fire\" and just 1.64 per cent forest cover is \"less fire prone.\" This calls for making the forest fire management the topmost priority in the list of disaster management in the state. However, the vulnerability estimates in the India State of Forest Report and the Mizoram State Disaster Management Plan, 2020 do not match with each other. In the State Disaster Management Plan, only 0.4 per cent area (93.2sq. km) has been identified under \"very high\" vulnerability class while 48.4 per cent (10,068sq. km) has been classed as moderately vulnerable and vulnerability of 37.2 per cent (7735sq. km) are stated to be high. The vulnerability estimates are critical component in management of forest fire and existence of two sets of estimates give rise to questions on effectiveness of the management plans including preparedness to avert a disaster. Investigations will reveal as to what caused the outbreak of devastating forest fire in Lunglei district. The disaster management plan states that forest fires in Mizoram occur in the dry season from November to May, \"mainly caused by shifting cultivation and the negligence of fire line creation.\" It also states that \"most of the forest areas in Mizoram are covered by the mixture of Tropical dry deciduous and evergreen vegetation. The leaf litter, dry herb due to loss of moisture tend to burn during dry season. Besides, it has been noticed that for want of new generation of herb for wild animal, hunters used to fire the leaf litter under the forest cover.\" Villagers preferring abandoned shifting patches for repetition of shifting cultivation has also been identified as one of the main causes of forest fire in the management plan. The National Action Plan on Forest Fires, 2018 formulated by the Ministry of Environment and Forest aims at reducing incidences of forest fire by informing, enabling, empowering, and incentivising the communities living on the fringe of forest areas to work in tandem with state forest departments. The vulnerability of forest fire being quite high Mizoram qualifies to get higher allocations under the centrally-funded Forest Fire Prevention and Management Scheme, 2017 to achieve the objectives of the national action plan. Judicious utilization of such fund and timely submission of utilization certificates has to be ensured by the state government and departments concerned to enable the Central government to release the allocated fund on time. Forest fires results in release of carbon-di-oxide stored in trees and vegetation for hundreds of years and thus adding to rise in atmospheric pollution and global warming. Loss of such permanent carbon sinks contributes adversely affecting the carbon sequestration. Forest fires in picturesque Dzokou valley along Nagaland-Manipur inter-state boundaries that raged for days together brought to the fore the huge challenges faced by the state and central agencies in controlling forest fires in the region. As 95 per cent of forest fires are caused by human beings, early detection of fire lines in the forest are essential to contain its spread and quickly dousing before it causes destroys forest cover and adversely affect the environment. Forest Survey of India disseminates satellite-based forest fire alerts to all states and Union Territories. A key recommendation included in a joint report by the Ministry of Environment and Forest and the World Bank titled \"Strengthening Forest Fire Management in India\" underlines the need for giving the communities a voice in the decision-making process for effective community involvement in forest fire management. Quick dissemination of the satellited-based forest alerts to the community can avert delay in controlling the fire but will require a robust mechanism to be put in place.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SENTIL-0056000849</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SENTIL2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62JH-D5H1-JB5M-W25G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438973</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"830\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Omega Printers &amp;

This is the first time Pacific Partnership and Pacific Angel joined forces.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The event marked the culmination of joint efforts to enhance disaster response capabilities and strengthen ties between the United States and Vietnam. As the largest annual multilateral disaster relief preparedness mission in the Indo-Pacific, the U.S. Navy's Pacific Partnership joined forces for the first time with the U.S. Air Force's Pacific Angel to execute a series of humanitarian response exercises.</p><p>This year's mission, hosted in Quang Ngai from Aug. 19-31, brought together approximately 200 participants from Australia, Chile, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Vietnam, all working toward a common goal.</p><p>\"United in purpose and spirit, we set out to continue building on the strong ties between our countries,\" said Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet Executive Director and Director of Staff Anjanette Knappenberger, reflecting on the missions' impact. \"Our partnerships and friendships with Vietnam continue to strengthen through each Pacific Partnership and Pacific Angel mission and activity, which enhances our ability to work together and understand one another in case we are ever called upon to provide humanitarian assistance or disaster relief.\"</p><p>U.S. and Vietnamese officials exchanged best practices and lessons learned on critical issues like forest fire prevention, coastal erosion, and natural disaster management. A site survey of the Nghia An anti-erosion embankment offered a hands-on opportunity to assess and discuss real-world challenges and opportunities to strengthen coastal community resilience and international cooperation.</p><p>Medical professionals conducted 40 subject matter expert exchanges and training sessions at various hospitals and medical centers in Quang Ngai, covering topics such as advanced life support, infection control, nursing, surgery, trauma, public health, neurology and endocrinology. These engagements reached more than 180 health care professionals and nearly 100 Vietnamese patients. The team also successfully conducted numerous surgeries.</p><p>\"It has truly been an honor to be in Vietnam, working alongside the professionals in Quang Ngai, learning from one another, and creating connections with patients, students, fellow citizens, and one another,\" said U.S. Navy Capt. Daniel Keeler, PP24-2 mission commander, as the mission wrapped up. \"Many thanks for your commitment to the 20th iteration of Pacific Partnership and the 16th iteration of Pacific Angel.\"</p><p>Construction efforts were another cornerstone of the mission, with renovations and repairs enhancing local facilities including Tinh Minh Kindergarten, Nghia Lo Medical Station, Tinh Khe Elementary School, and Tinh Khe Medical Station. These projects not only improved infrastructure but also bolstered the resilience of community sites in disaster preparedness, highlighting the spirit of Pacific Partnership and Pacific Angel by building local community resolve and benefiting the local people.</p><p>Community engagement added a cultural dimension to the mission. Through a series of cultural exchange programs, English-language dialogues, sporting events, and band performances, mission personnel met with approximately 800 students, teachers, and administrators throughout Quang Ngai.</p><p>\"We are extremely grateful for the opportunity given to us to work within Quang Ngai and Quang Nam provinces as part of Pacific Angel 24-3,\" said U.S. Air Force Maj. Bradley Emmett, PA24-3 mission commander, summing up the sentiment of the mission. \"We also appreciate each province's willingness to host engagements, such as Pacific Angel, and truly appreciate the kindness and coordination of these provinces' community partners and leaders who ensured this mission was a success.\"</p><p>The completion of PP24-2 and PA24-3 represents a significant milestone in U.S.-Vietnam relations, coming nearly a year after the two countries upgraded to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. This mission is a testament to the enduring strength and dynamism of the U.S.-Vietnam relationship, as both nations work together toward shared goals.Quang Ngai's participation in this multinational mission underscores the province's commitment to global partnerships and disaster preparedness.</p><p>&amp;#8203;For more information on Pacific Partnership and Pacific Angel, visit:<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.clwp.navy.mil/Pacific-Partnership\">www.clwp.navy.mil/Pacific-Partnership</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pacaf.af.mil\">https://www.pacaf.af.mil</url>.

By actively eliminating sources of fuel that exacerbate forest fire risks through a controlled and prescribed burning program, the Forest Fire Service reduces risk to New Jersey residents, visitors and the environment, Commissioner Shawn M. LaTourette said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Peak wildfire season in New Jersey begins in late March and continues through early May, depending on rainfall and weather.</p><p>It may surprise some New Jerseyans to know that there were more than 900 wildfires last year, Commissioner LaTourette said. Proactive forest management, including prescribed burning, is vital to protecting public safety and helps to ensure that we protect the long-term health and success of our forests. By reducing forest fire fuels through strategic prescribed burning, our Forest Fire Service protects New Jersey communities and ecosystems and helps to avoid catastrophic releases of carbon during wildfires that would contribute to climate change.</p><p>Recent events in Colorado, Montana and California have underscored the importance of managing our wildland environments as they interconnect with human development, said Greg McLaughlin, State Firewarden and Chief of the Forest Fire Service. We encourage homeowners to visit njwildfire.org to learn how to take steps make their properties safe from wildfire.</p><p>To keep the public informed about prescribed burning in their communities, this year the Forest Fire Service will launch an online tool at njwildfire.org that displays a map where the Forest Fire Service plans to conduct prescribed burns during the next five days.</p><p>There are multiple benefits to prescribed burning, which is a safe, effective and efficient means of managing the buildup of forest fuels. Prescribed burns improve habitat for plants and animals, reduce the presence of damaging insects and ticks, and recycle nutrients into the soil. In addition, prescribed burning is an important part of the states carbon defense strategy. Allowing experts to choose the intensity, timing and interval of fire across the landscape may help prevent a larger uncontrolled wildfire, which would contribute to significant carbon loss.</p><p>Typically, most prescribed burns take place between February and early April. However, depending on the management objective for a particular area, a prescribed burn may be implemented in the summer or fall. The Prescribed Burn Act, which Governor Phil Murphy signed into law in August 2018, authorized the Forest Fire Service to use prescribed burning as a tool to meet a wider range of management objectives designed to improve forest health and biodiversity. For example, prescribed burning can be an effective tool in managing the spread of nonnative invasive species or to manage grasslands for threatened or endangered bird species.</p><p>This year, the Forest Fire Service intends to treat 25,000 acres with prescribed fire. Meeting this goal will depend on favorable weather conditions. Most of the Forest Fire Services burns will occur on state-owned property such as state forests, parks and Wildlife Management Areas, but the Forest Fire Service also assists private landowners, nonprofit organizations, and county and municipal governments to meet their management objectives through prescribed burning.</p><p>Several climatological and environmental conditions, all of which influence a burns intensity and severity, are considered when conducting prescribed burns to accomplish various resource and ecological objectives, such as reducing hazard fuels and managing habitats. Hazard fuels include excess leaves, pine needles, grasses and groundcover which may act as ladder fuels, allowing fire to reach the tree canopy. Further, the Forest Fire Service and Division of Air Quality work together to assess wind speed, humidity and temperature and determine the best days to conduct prescribed burning.</p><p>In addition to the new online tool, which may be viewed at njwildfire.org, the Forest Fire Service posts their daily prescribed burn schedule on their Facebook page. Residents can also sign up for text or email notifications of prescribed burns by following this link.</p><p>Keeping the public informed of when prescribed burns are taking place is critical to keeping our firefighters safe when working along roadways, avoiding impacts from smoke and in helping to minimize reports of wildfires, said John Cecil, Director of the Division of Parks and Forestry. The Forest Fire Service works closely with DEPs Air Quality Program ensuring that prescribed burns do not occur on poor air quality days.</p><p>Motorists are reminded to use caution when approaching areas where prescribed burns are taking place, to pay attention to reduced speed limits and to be alert to the presence of Forest Fire Service trucks and personnel that may be working alongside roadways.</p><p>Nationally recognized for forest fuels management and prevention, New Jersey has been home to numerous studies conducted by the U.S. Forest Service, some of which focused on the effect prescribed fire has on tick populations and carbon storage. Scientists have also traveled to the Garden State from the University of Edinburgh in Scotland to study ember or firebrand production from a wildfire.</p><p>In 2021, the Forest Fire Service completed prescribed burns on 11,796 acres of state-owned lands, 4,915 acres of other government-owned land and 1,225 acres of privately owned property, for a total of 17,936 acres.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125008934</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64RR-PT61-DYTH-G4K0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"965\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"02\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>February 9, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This is the first time Pacific Partnership and Pacific Angel joined forces.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The event marked the culmination of joint efforts to enhance disaster response capabilities and strengthen ties between the United States and Vietnam. As the largest annual multilateral disaster relief preparedness mission in the Indo-Pacific, the U.S. Navy's Pacific Partnership joined forces for the first time with the U.S. Air Force's Pacific Angel to execute a series of humanitarian response exercises.</p><p>This year's mission, hosted in Quang Ngai from Aug. 19-31, brought together approximately 200 participants from Australia, Chile, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Vietnam, all working toward a common goal.</p><p>\"United in purpose and spirit, we set out to continue building on the strong ties between our countries,\" said Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet Executive Director and Director of Staff Anjanette Knappenberger, reflecting on the missions' impact. \"Our partnerships and friendships with Vietnam continue to strengthen through each Pacific Partnership and Pacific Angel mission and activity, which enhances our ability to work together and understand one another in case we are ever called upon to provide humanitarian assistance or disaster relief.\"</p><p>U.S. and Vietnamese officials exchanged best practices and lessons learned on critical issues like forest fire prevention, coastal erosion, and natural disaster management. A site survey of the Nghia An anti-erosion embankment offered a hands-on opportunity to assess and discuss real-world challenges and opportunities to strengthen coastal community resilience and international cooperation.</p><p>Medical professionals conducted 40 subject matter expert exchanges and training sessions at various hospitals and medical centers in Quang Ngai, covering topics such as advanced life support, infection control, nursing, surgery, trauma, public health, neurology and endocrinology. These engagements reached more than 180 health care professionals and nearly 100 Vietnamese patients. The team also successfully conducted numerous surgeries.</p><p>\"It has truly been an honor to be in Vietnam, working alongside the professionals in Quang Ngai, learning from one another, and creating connections with patients, students, fellow citizens, and one another,\" said U.S. Navy Capt. Daniel Keeler, PP24-2 mission commander, as the mission wrapped up. \"Many thanks for your commitment to the 20th iteration of Pacific Partnership and the 16th iteration of Pacific Angel.\"</p><p>Construction efforts were another cornerstone of the mission, with renovations and repairs enhancing local facilities including Tinh Minh Kindergarten, Nghia Lo Medical Station, Tinh Khe Elementary School, and Tinh Khe Medical Station. These projects not only improved infrastructure but also bolstered the resilience of community sites in disaster preparedness, highlighting the spirit of Pacific Partnership and Pacific Angel by building local community resolve and benefiting the local people.</p><p>Community engagement added a cultural dimension to the mission. Through a series of cultural exchange programs, English-language dialogues, sporting events, and band performances, mission personnel met with approximately 800 students, teachers, and administrators throughout Quang Ngai.</p><p>\"We are extremely grateful for the opportunity given to us to work within Quang Ngai and Quang Nam provinces as part of Pacific Angel 24-3,\" said U.S. Air Force Maj. Bradley Emmett, PA24-3 mission commander, summing up the sentiment of the mission. \"We also appreciate each province's willingness to host engagements, such as Pacific Angel, and truly appreciate the kindness and coordination of these provinces' community partners and leaders who ensured this mission was a success.\"</p><p>The completion of PP24-2 and PA24-3 represents a significant milestone in U.S.-Vietnam relations, coming nearly a year after the two countries upgraded to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. This mission is a testament to the enduring strength and dynamism of the U.S.-Vietnam relationship, as both nations work together toward shared goals.Quang Ngai's participation in this multinational mission underscores the province's commitment to global partnerships and disaster preparedness.</p><p>For more information on Pacific Partnership and Pacific Angel, visit:<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.clwp.navy.mil/Pacific-Partnership\">www.clwp.navy.mil/Pacific-Partnership</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pacaf.af.mil\">https://www.pacaf.af.mil</url>.</p><p>***</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pacom.mil/Media/News/News-Article-View/Article/3893544/building-bridges-and-bolstering-resilience-pacific-partnership-and-pacific-ange/\">https://www.pacom.mil/Media/News/News-Article-View/Article/3893544/building-bridges-and-bolstering-resilience-pacific-partnership-and-pacific-ange/</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-8800237 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8800237</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CWJ-WJK1-JC11-10MX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"810\"/><timeReceived>5:47 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"09\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>September 3, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

One new fire was detected on the High Cascades Ranger District yesterday-the Boundary Fire-which is 1/2 acre in size. The fire has been lined and is in the mop up phase. In addition to our regular staffing of firefighting resources, the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest has 12 additional engines, two 20-person initial attack crews, one dozer and two falling modules available for fire response.</p><p>The Siskiyou Rappel crew is also available for the season at this time. Having finished their certifications on June 10, 2023, they immediately rappelled to the Rosebud Fire in the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument and provided water buckets to the Boundary Fire yesterday. An air attack platform and a reconnaissance platform remain available for detection of any new starts on Forest Service, Oregon Department of Forestry, Bureau of Land Management-Medford District and Umpqua National Forest protected lands.</p><p>Please remain vigilant with fire prevention by thoroughly dousing campfires, avoid parking over dry vegetation that could ignite and do not allow your tow chains to drag on pavement.

Those smells are caused by a chemical process known as off-gassing, which is the release of various chemicals from the materials into the atmosphere. While some may like that smell, it's quite toxic.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Unlike cars, where you can get out whenever you want, that's not possible in deep submergence systems like submarines, which are often deployed for up to 120 days at a time without coming up for fresh air.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To keep divers and submariners safe from toxic fumes, the Navy runs off-gas testing as part of a rigorous authorization process for any equipment and materials that personnel might need below the surface.</p><p>The off-gas sampling facility at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center in Keyport, is one of three Navy locations accredited to perform off-gassing testing for deep submergence systems.</p><p>Keyport's facility works specifically with Special Operations Command. Their focus is strictly on non-metallic materials such as wetsuits, hoses, electrical cables and cameras that are taken inside submarines and used by Navy SEALs and other special operators. In a Virginia-class submarine, for example, special operations divers deploy from a lockout trunk, which is a hard tank that floods and deposits the diver and any equipment directly into an undersea environment.</p><p>Dan Seacrist, Keyport's off-gassing facility manager, explained how the toxins from new items affect divers and submariners differently than people who are in contact with them at surface level.</p><p>\"OSHA [Occupational Health and Safety Administration] requirements were designed to where a person in a manufacturing facility would be exposed to [an item] for eight hours, and then he would be not exposed to it for 16 hours ... an unload period,\" Seacrist said. \"The people in the submarine never get an unload period. .... It's 24/7, literally, that your body is absorbing these toxins.\"</p><p>When Special Operations Command requests testing on a piece of clothing or equipment, such as a new underwater breathing apparatus, it will provide the Keyport facility with safety data sheets detailing what chemicals were used to make the item and what the acceptable limit is for of each toxin. Those limits are set by the Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery's undersea medical experts.</p><p>\"What we need to know is how many fumes and what kind of fumes are coming off the materials ... to determine which chemicals are toxic to the body,\" Seacrist said. Common toxic chemicals they find in tested materials include formaldehyde, mercury, ammonia, chlorine and butyl-cellosolve.</p><p>Baking Off Smells</p><p>A lot of materials come into the Keyport facility with a smell, such as clothing that's been in packaging for months and hasn't had a chance to breathe. Before technicians can test those items in pressurization chambers, they're cured to get the smell out.</p><p>\"We let [the item] ventilate with the clean, fresh air. After 24 hours, we smell it again. We do that three times so, 72 hours,\" Seacrist said. \"If it still smells, then we know that we're going to need more aggressive curing to accelerate it.\"</p><p>The next step is to blow hot air onto the items in an enclosed ventilation cabinet to help release the toxic vapors. If that's not enough, they use a convection oven to essentially bake the material at a low temperature for an extended period. That process is also run three times. If the item still smells afterward, a vacuum oven is used to pull the toxins out.</p><p>Seacrist said they may cure and test one single item or an entire swath of material. For example, if a freshly produced wetsuit smells, that means it's off-gassing. The facility might then ask to cure the entire roll of material from which the suit was made.</p><p>Seacrist said it's not just new materials they run tests on; they'll process older materials, too, because they can change over time.</p><p>\"It's like headlights on your car becoming yellow,\" he used as an example. \"What chemical properties are causing it to turn yellow, and what happens after that? We always qualify the new materials, but then we also sometimes look at the degradation over time.\"</p><p>The Off-Gassing Process</p><p>After curing is complete and the smells are gone, items are sent to pressurization chambers to further test for toxic vapor levels. Items that don't have a smell go straight into these chambers.</p><p>The Keyport facility uses various chamber sizes, depending on the amount of material that's being tested. One chamber that Seacrist's team uses is large enough to fit small unmanned underwater vehicles.</p><p>\"It's been painted with new paints, which are non-metallics but go through our curing process,\" Seacrist explained of a UUV they tested. \"The antennas and flight control surfaces are 3D printed now, and the lubricants that they've used all are things that could off-gas or create a toxic environment.\"</p><p>The chamber gets warmed to a specific temperature akin to what the material might be exposed to during transit during the warmest part of the year. Then the team tests the material at different depths.</p><p>\"If it's a painted surface or hard material, then you don't need to take it deep to understand what the chemical release ... [is] going to be,\" Seacrist said. \"If it's something like your jacket or a wetsuit, you would want to compress it deep and then let it relax as it comes to the surface. Then the fumes breathe out of it.\"</p><p>01:22</p><p>Video Player</p><p>00:0000:00 | 00:00Captions / SubtitlesNoneEnglishUse Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.</p><p>Testing at various depths is critical.</p><p>\"With each breath of air that a diver takes at depth [33 feet below], he's inhaling twice as much [air],\" Seacrist explained. \"So now the vapors, or the toxins he's being exposed to, are twice as much at 33 feet three times as much at 60 feet, and it keeps going.\"</p><p>They don't use regular air inside the chambers, either. Instead, a certified gas called \"zero gas\" composed of 79% nitrogen and 21% oxygen is used. Seacrist said it's similar to the mixed gas in divers' SCUBA tanks. It's used for testing so there's no chance that the air inside the chamber is contaminated with environmental hazards, such as forest fire smoke.</p><p>Previous Next 123456 1 of 6</p><p>Seacrist said running one chamber test can take three days because it takes time to reach and sit at certain pressurized depths. Samples are taken at depth in a two-hour span, then again after the items are slowly brought back to surface, where they sit for another 24 hours.</p><p>The air samples are pumped from the chamber into various test tubes, some of which change color. Sorbent test tubes have charcoal created from walnut shells, which are saturated with a chemical that will bind with and absorb toxins.</p><p>From there, the samples are submitted to accredited industrial hygiene labs for analysis. Those labs ship their final reports to the Naval Systems Engineering &amp; Logistics Directorate, which decides whether or not the material is acceptable and can be taken onboard a deep submergence vessel.</p><p>A Focus on Safety</p><p>The deep submergence research program began around 1963 when Adm. Hyman G. Rickover the father of the nuclear Navy authorized an investigation into why the nuclear-powered attack submarine USS Thresher sank during deep-diving tests off the Massachusetts coast in April 1963. The disaster killed all 129 crew members onboard.</p><p>\"At that time, there was no certification process for smaller deep submergence vehicles,\" Seacrist explained. \"So, the Navy created a deep submergence research group qualification and certification process for deep-diving vehicles.\"</p><p>Seacrist was a Special Operations diver for 22 years. He's very aware of how the curing and off-gassing process can protect divers from toxins that cause various issues such as lymphoma, kidney disease and other ailments of the endocrine system.</p><p>\"There would certainly be long-term health effects that we would see, that the [Department of] Veterans [Affairs] would have to deal with later on,\" he said of someone who was affected by the toxic gases. \"It's not like it's going to make your eyes water and you're going to start coughing. ... It's something that's going to show up in your body eight to 10 years later.\"</p><p>Having been a military diver, Seacrist said he enjoys being able to pay it forward to the men and women who have followed in his footsteps.</p><p>\"There was somebody who was watching my back from the civilian side [when I was a diver] ... so now I'm that guy,\" he said. \"I like taking care of the young guys who are out there working for God and country, doing what we never want to know. I'm glad there's somebody doing it.\"</p><p>The Navy Experimental Diving Unit in Panama City, Florida, and the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division in Indiana, are also accredited to perform off-gas testing, as are three commercial companies contracted by the Navy. Depending on what the item is, Naval Sea Systems Command officials will determine what facility's chambers will be used.</p><p>Spotlight: Science and Technology</p><p>Spotlight: Engineering in DOD</p><p>Spotlight: Value of Service</p><p>***</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.defense.gov/News/Feature-Stories/Story/Article/3974412/how-off-gassing-keeps-divers-submariners-safe-from-toxin-releasing-materials/\">https://www.defense.gov/News/Feature-Stories/Story/Article/3974412/how-off-gassing-keeps-divers-submariners-safe-from-toxin-releasing-materials/</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-8935376 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8935376</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DG9-9441-DYG2-R0NH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1561\"/><timeReceived>8:47 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 21, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

LaTourette today announced the State is declaring a Drought Warning and gave an update on the significant increase in wildfires over last year. As New Jersey enters the next stage in severity of water-storage conditions, officials strongly encouraged the public to reduce water use during a virtual press conference.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Firefighters across New Jersey are battling a number of wildfires during a record-breaking dry spell that is affecting the entire Northeast. Since early October, the New Jersey Forest Fire Service has responded to 537 wildfires, a more than 1,300% increase in wildfires over the same period last year. The New Jersey Office of Emergency Management has deployed the State's All-Hazards Incident Management Team to supplement operations. The Jennings Creek wildfire, burning along New Jerseys border with New York, claimed the life of New York State parks system employee Dariel Vasquez as he fought the fire on Saturday.</p><p>Since the start of the year, nearly 1,300 wildfires have burned over 11,000 acres. The average number of fires per year since the year 2000 is 1,071 wildfires and 4,000 acres burned. As a result of the extremely dry conditions, mandatory statewide Stage 3 fire restrictions remain in effect. These restrictions prohibit all fires unless they are contained in an elevated stove using only propane, natural gas, or electricity. No wood or charcoal fires are allowed, and the use of kerosene or gas torches of any kind is prohibited while this level of restriction is in place.</p><p>Commissioner LaTourette today signed an Administrative Order authorizing the Drought Warning designation, which is the next stage of drought after a Water Supply Drought Watch. DEP announced Drought Watch status in mid-October, following a period of prolonged dry conditions. A Drought Warning enables the DEP to more closely manage water systems by directing water transfers among systems, controlling releases from reservoirs, and modifying the rate of flow in streams and rivers in order to balance ecological protection and needs of water suppliers.</p><p>New Jersey is experiencing unprecedented weather conditionsas a result of climate changethat require us to take these precautionary measures now, Governor Murphy said. It can be challenging to adjust our daily habits, but it is imperative that we all work together, heed the guidance to conserve water, and use the utmost caution outdoors to reduce the risk of wildfire as dry conditions continue statewide.</p><p>Climate change is driving our record low precipitation and above-average temperature recorded statewide in September and October, Commissioner LaTourette said. This combination of events has resulted in decreased streamflow and groundwater levels, which harms our available water supplies. Taking these measures now and encouraging reduced water use will help provide some measure of protection from the weather uncertainty we face entering winter.</p><p>Drought Warning Explained</p><p>The goal of a Drought Warning is to preserve and balance available water supplies in an effort to avert more serious water shortages in the future.</p><p>The Administrative Order designating Drought Warning status comes a day after the DEP held a hearing to update water suppliers and the public on water supply conditions, receive their input, and assess all available water supply management options. The state last entered Drought Warning status in October 2016, which persisted in some parts of the state until August 2017. The Administrative Order establishes a formal process for the DEP to work with water suppliers in affected regions to ensure no single water supplier or region faces a significant shortfall if dry weather and high customer demand continue. In consideration and preparation for Drought Warning status, DEP has been consulting with water suppliers to assess conditions, ensure they are fully aware of the situation, and that they are able to work cooperatively with the DEP.</p><p>Water Conservation Guidance</p><p>The public is strongly encouraged to follow these tips to reduce water use:</p><p>At this time of year, it is appropriate to let lawns go dormant for the season.</p><p>Winterize, and shut off irrigation systems as soon as possible.</p><p>Only use a watering can to water flowers and shrubs or allow them to go dormant for the season.</p><p>Use a broom to sweep the sidewalk, rather than a hose.</p><p>Use a commercial car wash that recycles water, as washing your car at home typically results in more water use.</p><p>To save water at home, fix leaky faucets and pipes. Consider replacing your toilet with a low-flow version; this can save around 11,000 gallons per year.</p><p>Upgrade your showerhead to low-flow versions, which can save some 7,700 gallons per year.</p><p>Upgrade your faucets or install faucet aerators; this can save some 16,000 gallons per year.</p><p>Types of Droughts</p><p>There are different types of droughts. Meteorological drought refers to periods of low precipitation and high heat, like New Jersey has been experiencing for two months. A hydrological or water supply drought refers to reductions in water supplies, like reservoirs, streams, and groundwater. DEP is responsible for monitoring and managing water supplies in collaboration with public and private water providers. A water supply drought determination is based upon a lack of precipitation, rapidly declining storage in the combined capacity of major surface water supply reservoirs, and/or severely depleted groundwater levels and stream flows.</p><p>Drought conditions are currently impacting more than half of the United States, with all of New Jersey and Delaware, and large parts of eastern Pennsylvania and southern New York experiencing at least moderate drought conditions, according to the National Drought Mitigation Centers U.S. Drought Monitor.</p><p>The DEP uses specific indicators to gauge the impacts that significantly reduced precipitation has had on water supplies. These include reservoir levels, stream flows, and levels in shallow groundwater sources, known as unconfined aquifers, which are important in the longer-term replenishment of streams and reservoirs.</p><p>Precipitation Deficits and Reservoirs</p><p>The southern half of the state, in particular, has been grappling with below-normal precipitation, with deficits approaching 10 inches below normal over the last three months.</p><p>The DEP organizes the state into six regions in its drought monitoring program, sorting geographic parts of the state based on common water supply sources and watershed boundaries. Historically, these regions may experience varying severity of drought, and the DEP may tailor its approach to suit each regions needs, but in this case, conditions remain markedly dry across the state. These regions are defined using municipal boundaries and details on what municipality is in each region are described here.</p><p>Major reservoir systems are below their normal water levels for this time of year and may need transfers of water through interconnected infrastructure to balance storage.</p><p>The Northeast region is primarily served by 12 reservoirs operated by four water suppliers serving the most densely populated region of the state have dropped to 60 percent capacity, compared to a normal of about 72 percent for this time of year.</p><p>The North Jersey District Water Supply Commissions two reservoirs have dropped to about 54 percent capacity, compared to a normal of about 68 percent for this time of year. The Commission serves portions of Bergen, Essex, Hudson and, Passaic counties, the most densely populated portions of the state.</p><p>The Veolia-NJ system consists of three reservoirs serving Bergen County that have dropped to about 58 percent total capacity, compared to a normal capacity of 63 percent for this time of year.</p><p>The Central region is predominantly served by New Jersey Water Supply Authoritys Raritan Basin reservoirs serving central parts of the state are at 81 percent capacity, compared to their normal storage level of 89 percent for this time of year.</p><p>The Coastal North regions storage is predominantly created from the combined storage in reservoirs operated by New JerseyAmerican Water and the New Jersey Water Supply Authority serving portions of Monmouth and Ocean counties are 62 percent capacity, compared to their normal level of 86 percent for this time of year.</p><p>The remaining portions of the state are not served predominantly by reservoir-backed surface water supplies, but instead have a mix of river-based surface water, or groundwater wells.</p><p>The Northwest region, which encompasses primarily Sussex and Warren counties is experiencing groundwater levels which are extremely dry, while precipitation is severely dry and stream flows are moderately dry.</p><p>The Southwest region -- Burlington, Camden, Gloucester and Salem counties -- relies primarily on groundwater, but is supplemented by surface water. Groundwater in this part of the state is severely dry while precipitation and stream flows are extremely dry.</p><p>In the southern coastal region of the state Atlantic, Cape May and Cumberland counties groundwater is severely dry, while rainfall and streamflow are extremely dry.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126827052</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DDG-DGP1-DYTH-G2G6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1583\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 13, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news reporting originating from Casablanca, Morocco, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Currently there is a public awareness to protect the environment especially forest ecosystems and the forest fire dilemma has become a topic of intense research around the world.\" </p><p><br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Hassan II University: \"In this setting, this study evaluates forest fire susceptibility (FFS) in northern Morocco using three geographic information system (GIS) based on machine learning algorithms: XGBoost (XGB), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). To this effect, a Geographic Information System (GIS) database was developed involving ten independent causal factors (elevation, aspect, slope, distance to roads, distance to residential areas, land cover, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), rainfall, temperature and wind speed) and 345 fire pixels. The 345 pixels were split into two sets for training (70%) and validation (30%) and the spatial relationships between factors affecting FFs and fire pixels was analyzed using XGB, RF, and SVM models to generate the FFS maps. The effectiveness of the models was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic curve, the area under the curve (AUC), and several statistical measures. The results of the three models hinted that XGBoost had the highest performance (AUC = 0.856), followed by RF (AUC) = 0.827), and SVM (AUC = 0.803) in the forecasting of the forest fire.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The resulting FFS maps areas can provide crucial support for the management of Mediterranean forest ecosystems and can enhance the effectiveness of planning and management of forest resources and ecological balances in these areas.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Using Machine Learning Coupled With Remote Sensing For Forest Fire Susceptibility Mapping.

According to news originating from Lethbridge, Canada, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Current permafrost models in Canadian boreal forests are generally of low spatial resolution as they cover regional or continental scales. This study aims to understand the viability of creating a temperature at the top of permafrost (TTOP) model on a local scale in the boreal wetland environment of Whati, Northwest Territories from short-term field-collected temperature data.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Natural Sciences And Engineering Research Council of Canada. <br/> The news editors obtained a quote from the research from University of Lethbridge: \"The model utilizes independent variables of vegetation, topographic position index, and elevation, with the dependent variables being ground surface temperature collected from 60 ground temperature nodes and 1.5 m air temperature collected from 10 temperature stations. In doing this, the study investigates the relationship vegetation and disturbance have on ground temperature and permafrost distribution. The model predicts that 31% of the ground is underlain by permafrost, based on a mean annual temperature at TTOP of &lt;0 \u00b0C. This model shows an accuracy of 62.5% when compared to cryotic assessment sites (CAS). Most inaccuracies, showing the limitations of the TTOP model, came from peat plateaus that had been burned in the most recent forest fire in 2014. These resulted in out-of-equilibrium permafrost and climatic conditions that TTOP cannot handle well. Commonly, permafrost mapping places Whati in the extensive discontinuous zone, estimating that between 50% and 90% of the ground is underlain by permafrost.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The study shows that a climatically driven TTOP model calibrated with CAS can be used to illustrate ground temperature heterogeneity from short-term data in boreal forest wetland environments. However, this approach likely underestimates permafrost extent and is perhaps not the best-suited modelling choice for near-surface permafrost, which is currently out of equilibrium with the current climate.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Modelling permafrost distribution using the temperature at top of permafrost model in the boreal forest environment of Whati, NT.

According to news originating from the University TeknologiMalaysia by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"The Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET) has received significant interest from researchers for several applications.\" </p><p><br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from University TeknologiMalaysia: \"In spite of developing and proposing numerous routing protocols for MANET, there are still routing protocols that are too inefficient in terms of sending data and energy consumption, which limits the lifetime of the network for forest fire monitoring. Therefore, this paper presents the development of a Location Aided Routing (LAR) protocol in forest fire detection. The new routing protocol is named the LAR-Based Reliable Routing Protocol (LARRR), which is used to detect a forest fire based on three criteria: the route length between nodes, the temperature sensing, and the number of packets within node buffers (i.e., route busyness). The performance of the LARRR protocol is evaluated by using widely known evaluation measurements, which are the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), Energy Consumption (EC), End-to-End Delay (E2E Delay), and Routing Overhead (RO). The simulation results show that the proposed LARRR protocol achieves 70% PDR, 403 joules of EC, 2.733 s of E2E delay, and 43.04 RO.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"In addition, the performance of the proposed LARRR protocol outperforms its competitors and is able to detect forest fires efficiently.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Forest Fire Detection Using New Routing Protocol.

(685 Bloomfield Ave.Verona, New Jersey 07044) filed a patent application (PCT/US2022/042322) for \"SEED CONTAINERS FOR ENABLING WATER AND VEGETATION TO PENETRATE A HYDROPHOBIC LAYER AFTER A FOREST FIRE\" on Sep 01, 2022. With publication no. WO/2023/075927, the details related to the patent application was published on May 04, 2023.</p><p>Notably, the patent application was submitted under the International Patent Classification (IPC) system, which is managed by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). Inventor(s): ABELES, Gary E. (685 Bloomfield Ave.Verona, New Jersey 07044) Abstract: A device and method for penetrating a hydrophobic layer caused by a fire and introducing new vegetation into a forest floor includes seeds, seedlings, and/or saplings carried within a plurality of tapered containers, possibly mixed with soil, sand, gravel, fertilizer, SAP granules, and/or water. The containers are inserted into the ground through the hydrophobic layer by dropping or propelling them from an aircraft, or manually pressing on them. One or more holes proximate the bottoms of the containers enable rain water and germinating roots to penetrate into soil beneath the hydrophobic layer.

The weather service said it so far has confirmed at least 18 tornadoes in northern Illinois and northwestern Indiana: six on Sunday and 12 during a frightening stretch Monday night.</p><p>The larger bunch emerged from a derecho, long-lasting windstorms that began in Iowa and rolled east for hours, according to senior meteorologist Brett Borchardt.</p><p>\u201cIt's not unprecedented, but it's very unusual. When we have a line of storms like that, they\u2019re prolific tornado producers,\u201d he said.</p><p>Across the U.S., the storms have led to at least five deaths, including the one in New York. Flooding killed an 88-year-old couple who were in their car near Elsah, Illinois, on Tuesday, and a 76-year-old passenger in a pickup in Rockford, Illinois, on Sunday. A fallen tree killed a 44-year-old woman in Cedar Lake, Indiana, on Monday.</p><p>A cold front is forecast to cause scattered showers and thunderstorms in the East over the next few days but will also provide relief from the heat in the eastern and central United States, according to the weather service. However, excessive heat is forecast for parts of the West and Southeast.</p><p>___</p><p>White reported from Detroit.

Hundreds of thousands of people have lost power and air conditioning during days of sweltering heat.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As much as 11 inches (nearly 28 centimeters) of rain fell overnight into Wednesday on parts of the Ozarks in Arkansas and Missouri, the National Weather Service said.</p><p>Buses and ambulances evacuated 86 people from a nursing home in Yellville, Arkansas, where water rose to about 4 feet (1.2 meters) during flash flooding, Marion County Sheriff Gregg Alexander said. A section of a bridge washed out and a historic courthouse flooded.</p><p>Cities across upstate New York were cleaning up after a storm swept through Tuesday with high winds and spectacular lightning and flying debris that killed one person.</p><p>In the small city of Rome, New York, a tornado ripped off roofs, tipped over vehicles and turned several buildings into piles of rubble.</p><p>Steeples crumbled and roofs were torn apart at First Presbyterian Church and the St. Mary\u2019s Church, both built in the 1800s. Copper sheets from the roof of First Presbyterian were found wrapped around utility poles a quarter mile away.</p><p>The winds were fierce enough to move a multi-ton tourist attraction, a B-52 bomber displayed at Griffiss Business and Technology Park. A mural of a Revolutionary War figure on horseback \u2014 a Rome landmark \u2014 was destroyed, along with the building on which it was painted. All that remained was an image of a horse hoof.</p><p>Speaking outside St. Mary\u2019s, Gov. Kathy Hochul said it was \u201cmiraculous\u201d no one was killed in the city of 31,000. She toured the downtown Wednesday and said 22 buildings were damaged or destroyed. She described seeing trees \u201ccollapsed like toothpicks\u201d and told of mobile homes tipped over with people inside. The governor marveled at narrow escapes, including two children in a medical waiting room who emerged unscathed even though the building was partially \u201cobliterated.\u201d</p><p>A National Weather Service preliminary damage survey released Wednesday night estimated the Rome tornado\u2019s top winds at 135 mph (217 kph) and gave it an EF2 rating, considered \u201csignificant,\u201d on the Enhanced Fujita scale.</p><p>Chiropractor Kingsley Kabari was with a patient in his second-floor office in Rome when his cellphone blared with a tornado alert Tuesday afternoon. By the time he could pick it up to mute it, the storm had arrived, he said, blowing out windows, tearing at the roof of the two-story brick building and sending debris flying.</p><p>\u201cIt was like a bomb dropped on the building with very high-power wind. Things were just flying everywhere \u2014 and this was inside,\u201d he said Wednesday.</p><p>The tornado cut a path between two nursing homes operated by Grand Healthcare, sparing them of the most severe damage but pelting the buildings with powerful winds and heavy rains that knocked out their power, regional vice president Bruce Gendron said.</p><p>He said he was at one of the nursing homes when the storm hit, and staffers moved residents away from the windows in case trees came toppling into the building.</p><p>The facilities' backup generators kicked in, keeping most systems intact until normal power was restored Wednesday afternoon, he said.</p><p>\u201cTo our residents of Rome: Do not be discouraged. This community is resilient and we will build back,\u201d Mayor Jeff Lanigan said.</p><p>A weaker tornado given an initial EF1 rating, with a top estimated wind speed of 110 mph (177 kph), also touched down about 230 miles (370 kilometers) away in Lyme, New Hampshire on Tuesday night, the weather service said. It remained on the ground for about 1.8 miles (2.9 kilometers) and knocked down at least 100 trees, said Jon Palmer, a weather service meteorologist in Gray, Maine.</p><p>About 30 miles (48 kilometers) away in Canastota, storm debris hit and killed an 82-year-old man, village administrator Jeremy Ryan said. Hochul said three homes collapsed and 30 other structures were damaged in the community.</p><p>A thousand miles (1,600 kilometers) away in Flippin, Arkansas, people went door to door to get as many as 40 residents to flee dangerous conditions before floodwaters began to recede.

With more homes cropping up on forested mountainsides on the outskirts of town, the threat of forest fires encroaching into occupied residential areas has also grown.</p><p>To ensure its fire fighters are prepared for such an eventuality, the Waynesville fire department secured a grant to purchase 48 sets of wildland fire gear and light-weight pop-up shelters firefighters can carry when battling forest fires.</p><p>Wildland gear differs from the heavy-duty uniforms firefighters wear when going into house fires, explained Waynesville Assistant Fire Chief Chris Mehaffey.</p><p>\"It's lighter-weight and easier to wear when you're out there raking fire lines and hiking across a mountain,\" Mehaffey said. \"\"It's labor intensive, and you couldn't do it with that heavy structural gear.\"</p><p>The pop-up shelters, akin to a sleeping bag, are made of aluminized-cloth that repel heat.</p><p>\"The idea is if the fire is coming to you so fast you can't escape it, you can crouch down and pull this shelter over you,\" Mehaffey said. \"It's kind of a last ditch effort.\"</p><p>One urban-wildland interface zone in Waynesville's jurisdiction is the mountain above Eagle's Nest and Laurel Ridge. Mehaffey likened the conditions to the populated zone around Gatlinburg, where an infamous forest fire turned deadly several years ago</p><p>\"It's that same kind of steep terrain with houses in between,\" Mehaffey said. \"The fire really likes to run up those steep areas like that, and it's on the south face which is drier.\"</p><p>Mehaffey said the vast majority of Waynesville firefighters are certified in fighting woodland fires, allowing them to assist with the fire in Maggie Valley in the spring. All fire departments in Haywood County abide by an agreement to provide aid for each other.</p><p>The federal grant awarded by FEMA only cost the town a $5,000 match and $2,000 in grant-writing fees.</p><p>\"I appreciate the hard work Chris Mehaffey did to secure it. Those grants are not easy to get,\" said Waynesville Fire Chief Joey Webb.</p><p>___ (c)2022 The Mountaineer (Waynesville, N.C.)

There are 455 personnel currently working on the fire. Fire managers continue directing resources to fires based on threats to property, infrastructure, industry, and areas with the highest probability of success while providing for firefighter and public safety. The fire is being managed by Northwest Incident Management Team #8.</p><p>Yesterday, the No Man Fire (993 acres) remained active on the north and west flanks. Hotshot crews conducted strategic burnout operations in the evening along the western flank. A Type 1 helicopter (K-Max) provided bucket drops during burnout operations to reduce the potential for spot fires. Crews continued to prep and lay hose along roads serving as control lines. On the Horse Heaven Fire (740 ac.), firefighters have completed direct handline on most of the western flank. Crews continued strengthening indirect line along the 920 Road and building additional control lines. On the Fuller Lake (141 ac.) and Bullpup fires (258 ac.), firefighters conducted snag falling operations and installing hose lays along the 300 Road to serve as an indirect control line. Crews scouted for opportunities to establish additional direct and indirect lines. On the Reynolds Butte Fire (302 ac), crews completed handline and continued mop-up operations along the southeast flank. Crews also strengthened control lines along the north, and western flanks. On the Salmon 33 Fire (205 ac.), crews continued to construct and strengthen both direct and indirect control lines along the southern flank.</p><p>Today, crews assigned to the No Man Fire will continue prepping and strengthening direct and indirect control lines along the northwest corner of the fire moving in an easterly direction along the northern flank ahead of potential strategic burnout operations. Other existing roads will continue to be prepped for use as control lines. On the Horse Heaven Creek Fire crews will continue work on handline between Forest Road 3831 and the 920 Road to the northeast, and strengthening indirect lines to the north, east and south. Crews are working on establishing additional contingency lines. The north side of Bullpup Fire (258 ac.) is expected to continue to be active today. Crews will work to maintain and improve the line on the 300 Road. On the Fuller Lake Fire, crews and heavy equipment will continue to prepare the 200 Road to serve as indirect control line. On the Reynolds Butte Fire, resources will continue to mop up along the western flank and improve the line on the southern flank of the fire. On the Salmon 33 Fire, crews are continuing to patrol and improve containment lines. The Lost Bucket Fire was contained on July 29 and continues to show minimal fire activity. The fire is in a patrol status.</p><p>Today's weather forecast will again include smoke and hazy conditions in the valley and sheltered drainages. Temperatures will be in the 70s to mid-80s in the higher elevations and mid-80s to lower 90s in the lower elevations. Winds will remain terrain driven until the afternoon when they become west-northwest 7 to 11 mph with gusts to 16 mph.</p><p>Current forest fire restrictions and danger ratings are- Fire Danger Rating: Very High. Industrial Fire Precaution Levels (IFPLs): 3. Public Use Fire Restrictions (PURs): 3.</p><p>*Rest of the document can be viewed at: (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/umpqua/news-events/?cid=FSEPRD1198956\">https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/umpqua/news-events/?cid=FSEPRD1198956</url>) For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:contentservices@htdigital.in\">contentservices@htdigital.in</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USFDNW-PR4842458</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USFDNW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CP0-N311-F12F-F2F4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">282801</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-08-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"623\"/><timeReceived>9:28 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 HT Media Ltd.

The Homestead Complex includes seven fires totaling 2,670 acres and are10% contained overall. There are 492 personnel currently working on the fire. Fire managers continue directing resources to fires based on threats to property, infrastructure, industry, and areas with the highest probability of success while providing for firefighter and public safety.</p><p>Yesterday, the No Man Fire (993 acres) remained active on the north and west flanks. Crews continued to prep and lay hose along roads serving as control lines. Hotshot crews conducted strategic burnout operations with support from the Douglas Forest Protective Association; they also controlled known hotspots and searched for any others. On the Horse Heaven Fire (740 ac.), firefighters have completed direct hand line on most of the western flank. Crews focused on fortifying indirect line along the 920 Road and continued constructing additional control lines. Indirect line from the 920 Road to Horse Heaven Creek has been completed. On the Fuller Lake (141 ac.) and Bullpup fires (258 ac.), crews continued to install hose lays along the 300 Road to serve as an indirect control line. Crews scouted for opportunities to establish additional direct and indirect lines. On the Reynolds Butte Fire (302 ac), crews strengthened completed control lines along the north, south, and western flanks. Crews also focused on establishing control lines along the eastern flank. On the Salmon Fire (205 ac.), crews continued to construct both direct and indirect control lines along the southern flank. Work to establish an indirect control line along the 3815 Road continued.</p><p>Today, crews assigned to the No Man Fire will continue prepping and strengthening direct and indirect control lines and installing hose lays on the western flank ahead of potential strategic burnout operations. Other existing roads will continue to be prepped for use as control lines. On the Horse Heaven Creek Fire crews will continue work on hand line between Forest Road 3831 and the 920 road to the northeast, and strengthening indirect lines to the north, east and south. The north side of Bullpup Fire (258 ac.) is expected to continue to be active today. Crews will work to maintain and improve the line on the 300 Road. On the Fuller Lake Fire, crews and heavy equipment will continue to prepare the 200 Road to serve as indirect control line. On the Reynolds Butte Fire, resources will continue to mop up along the western flank and improve the line on the southern flank of the fire. On the Salmon 33 Fire, crews are continuing to patrol and improve containment lines. The Lost Bucket Fire was contained on July 29 and continues to show minimal fire activity. The fire is in a patrol status.</p><p>Today's weather forecast includes smoke and hazy conditions in the valley and sheltered drainages. Temperatures will be slightly cooler compared to Monday with highs in the mid-70s to lower 80s at higher elevations and upper 80s in the lower elevations. The air will be drier resulting in lower humidity, and winds will remain terrain driven until the afternoon when they become west-northwest 7 to 11 mph with gusts to 16 mph.</p><p>Current forest fire restrictions and danger ratings are: Fire Danger Rating: Very High. Industrial Fire Precaution Levels (IFPLs): 3. Public Use Fire Restrictions (PURs): 3.</p><p>*Rest of the document can be viewed at: (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/umpqua/news-events/?cid=FSEPRD1198960\">https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/umpqua/news-events/?cid=FSEPRD1198960</url>) For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:contentservices@htdigital.in\">contentservices@htdigital.in</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USFDNW-PR4842460</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USFDNW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CP0-TP41-JDKC-R07F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">282801</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-08-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"652\"/><timeReceived>9:35 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 HT Media Ltd.

During the 2019/20 Australian wildfires, researchers noted a dramatic increase in stratospheric aerosols - tiny particles that affect climate, health, and atmospheric chemistry.</p><p>Smoke-charged vortex elevates aerosols to 35 kilometers</p><p>Using new satellite data and numerical modeling, researchers demonstrated the impact of wildfires through a phenomenon called the smoke-charged vortex (SCV).</p><p>\"The SCV is a powerful, smoke-laden whirlpool that transports wildfire smoke into the middle stratosphere, reaching altitudes of up to 35 kilometers,\" explained Prof. Hang Su from the Institute of Atmospheric Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a corresponding author of the study. \"This process led to at least a doubling of the aerosol burden in the southern hemisphere's middle stratosphere. These aerosols initiated a series of chemical reactions at their surface that impacted ozone concentrations.\"</p><p>The international team found that these wildfire-induced aerosols facilitated heterogeneous chemical reactions in the stratosphere, leading to both ozone depletion and increase at different atmospheric layers.</p><p>While the lower stratosphere experienced significant ozone depletion, the study shows that the increase of smoke aerosol particles in the middle stratosphere enhances the heterogeneous uptake and hydrolysis of N2O5, reducing reactive nitrogen gases like NOx and increasing ozone. In Southern Mid-Latitudes, this interplay buffered approximately 40% (up to 70%) of the ozone depletion observed in the lower stratosphere following the mega-bushfire events.</p><p>Implications of the findings</p><p>\"Our study uncovers an unexpected and crucial mechanism by which absorbing aerosols in wildfire smoke, such as black carbon, can induce and sustain enormous smoke-charged vortices spanning thousands of kilometers, fundamentally changing the stratospheric circulation. The vortices can persist for months, carrying aerosols deeply into the stratosphere and affecting the ozone layer in distinct ways at different altitudes. This highlights the need for continued vigilance and research as climate change progresses,\" said Prof. Yafang Cheng, another leading author from the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry.</p><p>\"We've made a significant step forward in simulating the SCV as a new effective pathway for wildfires to modify stratospheric dynamics and chemistry, especially the ozone layer. I love this study because it once again demonstrates how closely different parts of the Earth system are connected. Smoke from a forest fire can significantly change the wind and circulation tens of kilometers above the ground, allowing the smoke to modify the ozone layer, influencing life on our planet,\" said Dr. Chaoqun Ma, the first author of the study and postdoc researcher in Cheng's team at the MPIC.</p><p>The ozone layer's role in filtering UV radiation is crucial for protecting life on Earth. The Montreal Protocol's success in reducing ozone-depleting substances was monumental. However, the new findings highlight that natural events, exacerbated by climate change, pose additional risks to this fragile atmospheric layer. With the increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires driven by global warming, the formation of SCVs and their impact on the stratosphere could become more common, threatening the ozone layer.</p><p>Research Report:Smoke-charged vortex doubles hemispheric aerosol in the middle stratosphere and buffers ozone depletion</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPCDLY-202407161703112488</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPCDLY2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CGV-9FS1-DYJG-N4F1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">288597</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"580\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Space Daily, Distributed by United Press International</copyright><publicationName>Space Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>July 16, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>wildfires-unveil-new-threats-to-ozone-layer-stability</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008Z00</classCode><className>CHEMISTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008YXD</classCode><className>EARTH &amp;

The increasing rate of wildfires is a steady warning signal that we need swift climate action. (Arnegard Fire Protection District via AP)</p><p>North Dakota is experiencing devastating wildfires which have already caused the evacuations of more than 100 people and two fatalities. It should be painfully obvious how necessary strong climate policy will be in the upcoming presidential election.\u00a0</p><p>Powerful winds over the weekend contributed to the spread of the wildfires through North Dakota, which has been experiencing a drought. The full impact of the fires is still being determined, but the North Dakota Forest Service estimates the fires have encompassed tens of thousands of acres.\u00a0</p><p>The wildfires are expected to continue as the dry weather persists.</p><p>Humans have always had a complicated relationship with fire. We're fascinated and terrified of it, so we've been able to identify both the natural miracles and tragedies wildfires can create.\u00a0</p><p>We know that sometimes wildfires, for instance, can have fantastic ecological benefits, cleaning out ecosystems of dead material and increasing soil fertility. We've even figured out how to mimic those benefits in some places with controlled burning.\u00a0</p><p>But we also know that wildfires are increasing at a dangerously fast rate, and we know the rate isn't natural. In fact, about 90% of wildfires are started by humans, said Stephen Strader, a hazards geographer, meteorologist and associate professor at Villanova University.</p><p>\"They're not started by lightning or natural causes. They're started because a, fireworks, a cigarette thrown out the window, a, you know, believe it or not, a gender reveal party,\" Strader said. \"And what we've seen is that, because we have global climate change and global warming taking hold, what we have is in the months before fires are ignited, that landscape typically dries out very quickly, and it gets very hot, and then that dries out the vegetation, which means it's ready to, it's tender. It'll just go up if there's a flame.\"</p><p>Depressingly enough, what may actually end the increasing wildfires is a lack of natural land to lick up as fuel.\u00a0</p><p>\"Eventually, if we continue to develop like what we have over the last, you know, 60, 70, years, we will move into these areas (Wildland Urban Interfaces),\" Strader said. \"And once we move into one of these WUI areas, and we continue to expand, eventually, there's no more fuel left for the fire. It's all roads and parking lots and buildings. There's not much forest left to get a big forest fire. So that really means that, from a U.S., from an entire U.S. perspective, we expect fires to continue to increase until they hit a point where potentially there's not much fuel left, and the fires will start decreasing.\"</p><p>That's not a happy alternative.\u00a0</p><p>What's especially scary about the wildfires we're facing now, though, is how suddenly and quickly they can destroy surrounding areas.\u00a0</p><p>\"The most important thing is that it's hard to suppress fires because even the firefighters that are on the ground, that are battling these, the fires aren't behaving in the ways that they used to, and that's largely because of the climate change element,\" Strader said. \"Their (firefighters') techniques are not working, and it's largely because fires, when they do occur, if the conditions are right, they will spread extremely fast and burn very quickly. Which means that if you have a fire in your region, you need to make sure that you have a, ready to, ready to get out of there (plan), because it can spread very quickly.\"</p><p>It's deeply troubling, then, when figures in power make statements claiming climate change isn't a serious threat.</p><p>Wildfires are just one small instance of climate change's deadly side effects, but they're a good example to consider when politicians quote colder weather as proof everything is fine.\u00a0</p><p>Republican presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump, for instance, has long projected the false claim that climate change is a hoax.\u00a0</p><p>But if any wildly flaming warning signal should make politicians and their voters at least admit the need for climate policies, it should be the 50-foot wall of fire that raged over North Dakota.\u00a0</p><p>Or the more than one million acres of land burned in California this year.\u00a0</p><p>Or the destroyed town on Maui that burned in the U.S.'s fifth-worst wildfire in history last fall.</p><p>Wildfires are a burning issue that's worth our attention even if they're not burning down our own homes here in Illinois. These natural hazards won't just be someone else's problem for long.\u00a0</p><p>As they occurred naturally, wildfires were a phenomenon attached to rebirth and hope. How sad that we've turned them into something so hopeless.\u00a0</p><p>And how ridiculous that we're still putting leaders in office who we know will ignore the large, flaming red flags.\u00a0</p><p>Please America, bring back hope: keep the fire contained, and keep your denialism out of the White House.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5948679</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D5C-B7D1-DY7P-T36S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1112\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Northern Star: Northern Illinois University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"10\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>October 9, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>META PLATFORMS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002HCP</classCode><className>ADAMS GOLF INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NORTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS516210 MEDIA STREAMING DIST SVCS, SOCIAL NETWORKS, AND OTHER MEDIA NETWORKS AND CONTENT PROVIDERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC7374 COMPUTER PROCESSING &amp;

Prevention will always be the most effective tool we have at our disposal to fight wildfires.\"</p><p>Pennsylvania typically sees its greatest threat of wildfires in the spring and autumn months. The Shapiro Administration reminds Pennsylvanians that 99 percent of our wildfires are caused by people.</p><p>DCNR is encouraging residents to understand the factors that increase the risk of wildfires including:</p><p>\u2014An available fuel source, such as dried grass or leaves.</p><p>\u2014Dry conditions, including low relative humidity.</p><p>\u2014An ignition source to start the fire, such as sparks from automobile, machine exhaust or burning trash.</p><p>\"Most wildfires are preventable, and we are here today to remind Pennsylvanians to be careful with fire, especially debris burning, the number one cause of wildfires in the Commonwealth,\" said State Forester Seth Cassell. \"We ask that Pennsylvanians adhere to Smokey Bear's wildfire prevention message and take a mindful approach to burning trash, building campfires, and in situations where there is a risk of unwanted burning.\"</p><p>Smokey Bear's lore has an interesting bit of history that includes a time where a real bear represented the wildfire prevention message.</p><p>In the spring of 1950, a young bear cub was caught in a forest fire in the in the Capitan Mountains of New Mexico. The bear cub climbed a tree to survive the blaze, but was still badly burned. Firefighters who retrieved him were so moved by his bravery, they named him \"Smokey.\"</p><p>News about this real bear spread across the nation and he was soon given a new home at the national zoo in Washington, D.C. He served as the living symbol of Smokey Bear and played an important role in spreading messages of wildfire prevention.</p><p>Smokey died in 1976 and was returned to New Mexico where he was buried at what is now called Smokey Bear Historical Park.</p><p>North Branch Land Trust to host 3rd annual NEPA Barn Banquet to celebrate local agriculture</p><p>North Branch Land Trust will hold its third Annual NEPA Barn Banquet, a dinner event celebrating Pennsylvania's vibrant agricultural heritage and the Land Trust's dedication to conserving agricultural lands on Tuesday, Sept. 17.</p><p>The NEPA Barn Banquet will offer an unforgettable evening featuring a three-course buffet, expertly designed and prepared by Bank &amp; Vine.</p><p>Attendees will also enjoy the opportunity to win a variety of gifts in both a raffle and live auction.</p><p>Executive Director Ellen Ferretti said, \"This event is more than just a gathering; it reflects North Branch Land Trust's deep-rooted commitment to preserving working lands that sustain our community.\"</p><p>Join NBLT in honoring the past, present, and future of Pennsylvania's agricultural landscape.

Doula services have been found to ease the pregnancy and labor process and improve birth outcomes for both mother and child.</p><p>This change allows certified doulas to enroll as Medicaid providers and enables Medicaid managed care organizations to enter into network agreements with them, allowing them to bill directly for services offered through pregnancy and postpartum.</p><p>\"Pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum periods are exciting but often stressful times for a new parent. Unfortunately, for too many women \u2014 and Black women especially \u2014 having a child can be potentially life-threatening when they do not receive high-quality, accessible, and equitable care,\" said Human Services Secretary Dr. Val Arkoosh. \"We must do more to address the maternal mortality crisis in Pennsylvania, and I am excited to work with my agency colleagues and our community partners on this maternal health strategic plan. The Commonwealth's plan will outline some of the most urgent issues facing pregnant women and will provide tangible steps that we can achieve to help moms, parents, and their families thrive.\"</p><p>The meeting convened subject matter experts from the Shapiro Administration's health agencies, representatives from the Governor's Affinity Commissions, and leadership from other state agencies such as the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs. The goal of this diverse group was to represent their audiences' unique needs with respect to maternal health and to develop collaborative, actionable strategies for the plan.</p><p>\"We are working together to ensure that pregnancy and postpartum are as safe and healthy as possible for all women and their families,\" said Secretary of Health Dr. Debra Bogen. \"We will continue to listen to and learn from Pennsylvanians involved in every facet of maternal health. We are identifying opportunities to act to improve childbirth outcomes so families can thrive.\"</p><p>The maternal health strategic plan will include priorities centering on equity and diversity, with a focus on increasing access to high-quality care, expanding and diversifying the maternal health care workforce, and addressing behavioral health and substance use disorder services and supports.</p><p>\"The Shapiro Administration understands that substance use disorder is a family illness. Developing a much-needed maternal health strategic plan will help to ensure that when mother and baby are impacted by a substance use disorder, they are getting the care they need,\" said DDAP Deputy Secretary Kelly Primus.</p><p>DHS, DOH, DDAP, and PID will launch an online survey and host community events throughout Pennsylvania in September and October to help gather input from Pennsylvanians with lived experience in maternal health. The survey and events will help the departments inform and expand the planned strategies to improve maternal health outcomes across the state.</p><p>\"We are monitoring coverage for services such as doula care, surrogacy benefits and human breast milk storage, and see opportunities to expand coverage for these services in our regulated insurance markets,\" said Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner Michael Humphreys. \"Now is the time to have these conversations and partner with insurers to determine how to bring these important services to all Pennsylvanians.\"</p><p>Reach Bill O'Boyle at 570-991-6118 or on Twitter @TLBillOBoyle.</p><p>___ (c)2024 The Times Leader (Wilkes-Barre, Pa.)

According to news reporting out of Tehran, Iran, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"The present study investigates the effect of climatic parameters, such as air relative humidity and wind speed, on fire spread propagation indexes in the Malekroud Forest, Iran using the FARSITE simulator based on Rothermel's original fire spread equation.\" </p><p><br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Sharif University of Technology: \"Standard fuel models are used to calibrate the vegetation cover. Sorensen (SC) and kappa ( k ) coefficients, as well as the Overestimation Index (OI), are used to estimate the simulation's accuracy. The results confirm that using both ambient condition data and appropriate fuel models is crucial to reaching reasonable results in fire propagation simulations. The values of the Rate of Fire Spread (ROS), Flame Length (FML), and Fire Line Intensity (FLI) are reported for each particular scenario. The simulation results show that the Sorensen and Kappa coefficient for situations most similar to the real fire reached 0.82 and 0.80, respectively. The investigated fire's severity is categorized as low-condition fire behavior.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The simulation shows that fire propagation falls harshly in the case of air relative humidity by more than 72%, and we will not witness natural fire propagation on a large scale.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: A Case Study on the Effects of Weather Conditions on Forest Fire Propagation Parameters in the Malekroud Forest in Guilan, Iran.
