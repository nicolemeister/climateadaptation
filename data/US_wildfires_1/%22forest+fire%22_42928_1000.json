The Company has three divisions: a Platinum Group Element division, a Lithium/Rare Element division, an Antimony-Gold Division as well as an investment in MetalQuest Minings (TSXV:MQM | OTC:MQMIF) high purity Lac Otelnuk Iron Ore Project.</p><p>The PGE Division includes the 100% owned, multi-million-ounce, district-scale River Valley Project, one of North Americas largest undeveloped Platinum Group Element Projects, situated 100 km by road east of Sudbury, Ontario. In addition to River Valley, NAM owns 100% of the Genesis PGE-Cu-Ni Project in Alaska.</p><p>The Companys Lithium Division is one of the largest mineral claim holders in the Winnipeg River Pegmatite Field, where the Company is exploring hard rock lithium and various rare elements such as tantalum, rubidium, and cesium. NAM is developing its lithium division in conjunction with its Farm-in/Joint Venture agreement with Mineral Resources Ltd. (MinRes), one of the worlds largest lithium producers. A minimum budget to maintain the Projects has been approved by Mineral Resources Ltd for May 2025 to April 2026. The Companies agreed to the minimum budget due to current lithium pricing and forest fire dangers in the immediate area</p><p>In April 2024, a $1.5M NSERC Alliance grant was awarded to a collaboration led by the University of Manitoba (Drs. Fayek and Camacho), with academic partners from Lakehead University (Dr. Hollings) and industry partners including New Age Metals and Grid Metals. This research is focused on advancing Canadas critical metals sector, with New Age Metals portion targeting its Bird River lithium properties. Approximately $107,000 of work is planned on New Ages properties in 2025. The early work will include core sampling and field visits starting this summer. The project will likely extend beyond the original 3-year term, due to its delayed start.</p><p>New Age Metals Inc. is supporting a successful $180K Mitacs research grant, awarded in 2023, through its $90K contribution (already accounted for and paid under the Mineral Resources joint venture). This academic partnership with the University of New Brunswick and the University of British Columbia is focused on understanding the origin and controls of lithium pegmatite mineralization in the Cat LakeWinnipeg River field. Fieldwork for the MSc. thesis has been completed, while the post-doctoral phase is ongoing at UNB. This collaboration provides access to top-tier scientific expertise and equipment, significantly reducing analysis costs and adding long-term value to the project.</p><p>NAMs Antimony-Gold division is in Newfoundland and spans over 19,800 hectares consisting of 11 non-contiguous properties. Six of these properties are in St. Albans area, along Canstars Swanger and Little River mineralized trends. The remaining 5 properties are strategically located along the same geological trend as the past-producing Beaver Brook Antimony Mine and in proximity to New Found Golds Queensway South Gold Project. Management has recently completed Phase 1 of the Project, Phase 2 has been initiated, and further news will follow. On July 30th, the Company was pleased to announce that it has received formal approval under Newfoundland and Labradors Junior Exploration Assistance (JEA) Program, including eligibility for the Critical Minerals Assistance (CMA) and Provincial Critical Mineral Assistance (PCMA) streams. The potential rebate total for eligible exploration activities is $71,975.</p><p>On August 6, 2025, New Age Metals announced an additional investment in a 4th critical metal. NAM currently owns approximately 12.79% and holds warrants that, if exercised with todays issued and outstanding shares of MQM, would bring NAM to a 19.05% interest in MetalQuest Mining inc.</p><p>MetalQuest Mining inc. is developing one of North Americas largest iron ore projects, where approximately $120 million has been spent on the project. For more information, please visit MetalQuestMining.com . High-purity iron ore became a critical metal Federally in Canada and in the Provinces of Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador in 2024. In the summer of 2025, MQM has contracted AtkinsRealis, an international engineering company, to complete a GAP Analysis on the Lac Otelnuk Project and its 2015 Feasibility Study.</p><p>Management is currently aggressively seeking new mineral acquisition opportunities on an international scale.

How many? Many and very decisive, in view of the fierce struggle between PP and PSOE for the control of the narrative about the responsibilities in the management of the current \"sixth generation fires\". However, the past does not confirm this hypothesis, although the magnitude of the tragedy is practically unprecedented today. In other words, historical cases are not conclusive.</p><p><br/>For example, Galicia, which is the community with the highest number of forest fires, does not show a clear correlation between this type of catastrophe and a subsequent punishment at the polls. None of the previous popular presidents of the Xunta (Albor, Fraga or Feij\u00f3o) suffered a relevant penalty after an escalation of fires, despite the fact that those of 2011 -with more than 42,000 hectares of forest area burned- or those of 2017, with more than 60,000, were among the most serious.<br/>In contrast, the Galician left, which governed the community during years of major fires (1989, with more than 85,000 hectares of burned forest area, and 2006, with more than 55,000), lost power by the minimum in the immediate elections. It is possible that these outcomes were also influenced by other factors -the secular conservative tendency of Galicia, the dispersion of the left-wing vote, the unequal charisma of the candidates or the electoral system- but there could be a certain correspondence between the magnitude and management of the fires and the subsequent electoral results.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The electoral bill of a fire does not punish all political forces equally in some autonomous regions.</emphasis><br/>The Catalan case is not conclusive either. In 1986, more than 42,000 hectares of wooded area were burned, with the symbolic mountain of Montserrat as one of the epicenters of the disaster. Two years later, in the 1988 elections, CiU repeated its absolute majority, although it lost three seats compared to its 1984 record. More relevant were the fires of 1994, which ravaged mainly Bages and Bergued\u00e0 and burned more than 62,000 hectares of wooded area.<br/>The response of the Generalitat to the fires was highly criticized, especially by an implacable Alejo Vidal-Quadras, who perfectly embodied the popular strategy of exploiting the actions of the adversaries in the face of catastrophes for electoral purposes. And a year later, in the 1995 autonomic elections, Pujol lost his absolute majority. However, the decline of CiU (around five points) was not much greater in the affected areas (in some it was even less), so that other factors of attrition can be considered: the scandals surrounding the \"business sector\" of Converg\u00e8ncia, the advance of two bordering forces (the Catalan PP, to his right, and ERC, to his left) or the economic crisis.<br/>The same could be said of the fires that ravaged Andalusia in 1991, with special incidence in Almeria and Malaga. Three years later, the PSOE lost its absolute majority (losing 17 seats and winning only four more than the PP), but this electoral debacle had many other possible causes: the corruption scandals (with the strident Juan Guerra case at the local level) which affected above all the socialist government of the State (and which led to its replacement in 1996), as well as the economic situation or the internal divisions within the PSOE. And the same pattern could be applied to the Valencian case. In 1994, almost 90,000 hectares of trees were burned and a year later the PSPV lost the Generalitat in a regional elections that meant a turnaround in favor of the PP and gave the victory to the Popular Party in 11 of the 13 communities at stake.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The big fires and their management seem to have a cumulative wearing effect on governments.</emphasis><br/>In fact, the electoral impact of the management of large fires seems to be highly dependent on the political and social context and the respective attrition of each executive. For example, in 2012 the Valencian Community suffered another serious escalation of fires (affecting 26,000 hectares of wooded area and a total of 56,000 hectares of forest land). Three years later, the PP lost the Generalitat and up to 24 seats. But the scenario was already adverse for the PP, besieged by multiple corruption cases and worn out by the management of the crisis, which led to the emergence of new parties, such as Podemos and Ciudadanos.<br/>On the other hand, a traumatic forest fire in Andalusia in 2004, considered then as the \"largest and most devastating\", had hardly any electoral cost for the PSOE. It is true that the Socialists lost five seats in the following elections, but they came from an exceptional result in 2004 and maintained their absolute majority. In fact, in the province affected (Huelva) the socialist setback was even smaller.<br/>The weight of the context can be seen in one of the most dramatic fires in terms of the number of victims: the fire in Guadalajara in July 2005, which left 11 dead. However, and despite the criticism of the Junta's performance and the fact that several high-ranking regional officials were prosecuted, the socialist Barreda retained a solid absolute majority in the 2007 elections and only lost three seats compared to Bono's record result in 2003.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The electoral patterns of the past no longer work in the face of mega-fires of unprecedented scale and consequences.</emphasis><br/>However, in the following elections of 2011 -and in a context of severe socialist erosion due to the adjustment policies of Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero-, the PP of Dolores de Cospedal managed to defeat Barreda by the minimum, although in line with the electoral turnaround that took place in most of the autonomous regions.<br/>For all these reasons, it is worth attributing to the great fires and their always debated management a cumulative effect of attrition, the intensity of which depends on the strength of each executive. The paradox, in a context of irreconcilable blocs such as the current one, is that today the beneficiaries of the attrition could be precisely the deniers of preventive policies in the face of the global \"climate leviathan\".<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-72586018</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GMP-6CX3-RY48-43XB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1006\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 31, 2025 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>politica</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000CYCH</classCode><className>LIBERALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

August has barely begun, but the summer of 2025 is already marked by a cascade of destructive and deadly weather in the northern hemisphere.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Extreme temperatures and precipitation have become more intense and more frequent on a global scale,\" says Sonia Seneviratne, a professor at ETH Zurich and member of the UN-mandated climate science advisory panel, the IPCC.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We are in the midst of climate change,\" Fred Hattermann, a scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), told AFP.  </p><p>\"The risk of extreme events has increased significantly,\" he said, noting that 2024 was the first year in which the planet's average surface temperature was 1.6C above the preindustrial benchmark.  </p><p>That deceptively small jump makes a huge difference.  </p><p>Higher temperatures increase evaporation, so that more water is stored in the atmosphere. This, in turn, increases the risk of heavy rainfall and flooding.  </p><p>50C in the Gulf, Turkey Already in May, temperatures exceeded 50C in the United Arab Emirates. On August 1, the thermometer hit 51.8C, just under the all-time record of 52C.  </p><p>The entire Gulf region is suffocating: the Saudi capital Riyadh recorded temperatures of 44C, while Kuwait frequently hit 50C.  </p><p>As did Iraq, where air conditioning has become vulnerable to chronic power cuts, and water reserves are at their lowest level in years.  </p><p>Turkey saw the 50C threshold exceeded for the first time: the town of Silopi on the border with Iraq and Syria reached 50.5C on July 26.  </p><p>The country has experienced thousands of fires this summer amidst a severe drought.  </p><p>In Asia, meanwhile, Japan broke its all-time temperature record on Wednesday with 41.8C in the city of Isesaki, northwest of Tokyo. The country's iconic cherry trees, emblematic of the archipelago, are blooming earlier than ever because of the heat.  </p><p>Torrential rain On Tuesday, Hong Kong saw the highest rainfall total for August in more than 140 years of record-keeping: 35.5cm in a single day.  </p><p>On mainland China, a week earlier, severe weather killed at least 44 people and left nine missing in rural districts north of Beijing.  </p><p>Meanwhile, 266 people, nearly half of them children, have already lost their lives in Pakistan because of torrential rains sweeping across the country.  </p><p>The 2025 monsoon, which started early, was described as \"unusual\" by authorities. Punjab, Pakistan's most populous province, recorded 73% more rainfall in July than in 2024.  </p><p>Scandinavia swelters People come to Scandinavia to seek cooler climes, but since July Norway, Sweden and Finland have experienced sustained temperatures more typical of the Mediterranean.  </p><p>August 3 marked the end of a 22-day period with temperatures above 30C in Finland: a record.  </p><p>In Rovaniemi, a Finnish city north of the Arctic Circle, temperatures reached 30C, higher than in southern Europe at the same time.  </p><p>Mega-fires Canada is experiencing one of the worst forest fire seasons on record, amplified by drought and above-normal temperatures.  </p><p>Other parts of the world are also burning, from Scotland to Arizona and Greece.  </p><p>According to the European Union's Copernicus weather and climate observatory, total smoke and greenhouse gas emissions since the beginning of summer in the northern hemisphere are among the highest ever recorded.  </p><p>Wildfire rages Winds hampered efforts to put out a wildfire raging yesterday near the Spanish tourist town of Tarifa that prompted evacuations, as the Spanish Government said over 1000 deaths in July were linked to extreme heat.  </p><p>Although fire crews had secured areas near hotels and other tourist accommodation, the fire was still not under control, said officials.  </p><p>The fire broke out Wednesday near La Pena, a wooded area close to a beach outside Tarifa. The south coast town of about 19,000 people is known for strong winds, which draw windsurfers. Spain is experiencing a heatwave with temperatures nearing 40C in many regions. -AFP</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NRTHAD-NRA,NAG,NAO,NAD,NAFDClimate</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NRTHAD2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GFD-9J63-RRP4-V4C4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"662\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 NZME Publishing Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Northern Advocate (New Zealand)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 8, 2025</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC000D9FB</classCode><className>AL MUDON INTERNATIONAL REAL ESTATE CO KSCC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS531110 LESSORS OF RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS &amp;

At first, it's easy to dismiss. But then it gains a twist, builds momentum, and spreads like wildfire. What causes some ideas to die out while others take over the internet?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A new study published in Physical Review Letters offers a fresh explanation. Led by researchers from the University of Vermont and the Santa Fe Institute, the work introduces a mathematical model for \"self-reinforcing cascades,\" processes where the thing being spread, whether a belief, joke, or virus, evolves in real time and gains strength as it spreads.</p><p>Traditionally, scientists have used simple branching models to explain how things like ideas or diseases spread. One person gets infected or hears a rumor, they pass it to two more, each of those passes it to two more, and so on. It's a tree-like pattern in which the thing spreading (virus, belief, meme) stays the same. But this new research takes into account the fact that things don't just spread -- they change as they spread, and that change actually helps them spread further.</p><p>\"We were inspired in part by forest fires,\" says SFI Professor Sid Redner, a co-author on the paper. \"Fires can grow stronger when burning through dense forest, and weaker when crossing open gaps. That same principle applies to information, jokes, or diseases. They can intensify or weaken depending on the conditions.\"</p><p>The model is simple in theory: each time an idea spreads, it has a chance of increasing or decreasing in intensity. If it weakens too much or finds no receptive audience, it dies out. But if it improves, even slightly, it can keep going, triggering large-scale cascades under a wide range of conditions.</p><p>This simple mechanism led to surprisingly complex results. Unlike classical models that require fine-tuned conditions to produce real-world-like patterns, the researchers' self-reinforcing cascade model naturally yielded \"fat-tailed\" distributions, statistical signatures often seen in viral social media posts and outbreaks. These include the observation that most posts or cases fizzle out quickly, but a few become massive, unpredictable hits.</p><p>\"This kind of variability -- where some things go viral while most don't -- has often been explained by assuming the world is always near some critical tipping point,\" says lead author Laurent Hebert-Dufresne, an SFI External Professor and computer scientist at the University of Vermont. \"But our model shows that if the quality of what's spreading can change as it spreads, you don't need to assume a special critical state. The variability just emerges naturally.\"</p><p>The implications extend far beyond theory. Juniper Lovato, study co-author and computer scientist at the University of Vermont, said the work could help researchers better understand belief formation, misinformation, and social contagion.</p><p>\"This gives us a theoretical foundation for exploring how stories and narratives evolve and spread through networks,\" she says. Lovato and SFI External Professor Peter Dodds, a professor of computer science at UVM and Director of the Vermont Complex Systems Institute, will explore this topic in more depth at a December working group at SFI.</p><p>The work aligns with a large project Lovato and Dodds co-lead, funded by the National Science Foundation Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (NSF EPSCoR): Harnessing the Data Revolution for Vermont: The Science of Online Corpora, Knowledge, and Stories (SOCKS). The $20M, five-year project revolves around stories as an essential part of how people comprehend, explain, predict, and seek to navigate the world; a groundbreaking data science effort to better understand and harness the power of stories. The SOCKS project is intended to enable or enhance the study of any large-scale temporal phenomena where people matter, including culture, politics, economics, linguistics, public health, conflict, climate change, and data journalism.</p><p>Next, the team plans to validate the model with real-world data from platforms like Bluesky, which allow researchers to distinguish between pure reposts and modified ones. The work may even circle back to its fiery origin.</p><p>\"I'm excited to return to the forest fire model,\" Redner says. \"What we've learned here gives us new tools to tackle that problem--and maybe others.\"</p><p>Read the paper \"Self-reinforcing cascades: A spreading model for beliefs or products of varying intensity or quality\" in Physical Review Letters, Thursday, August 21, 2025 by Laurent Hebert-Dufresne, Juniper Lovato, Giulio Burgio, James P.

Thousands are without power or have been forced to evacuate their homes, according to officials. The Jones Road wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey, has consumed 8,500 acres and is 10% contained, according to a post by the New Jersey Forest Fire Service on Facebook. Over 3,000 residents have been evacuated as the fire threatens 1,320 structures, according to the Forest Fire Service. Over 25,400 customers in the area near the fire have also lost power, according to Jersey Central Power &amp; Light, JCP&amp;L. The power was cut after the Forest Fire Service \"for the safety of crews battling the fire,\" JCP&amp;L stated in a Facebook post. The cause of the fire is under investigation.

According to the AP website more than 3,200 newspapers have closed since 2005, leaving roughly 5,600 remaining. Nearly 2,000 newsroom jobs were lost in the last year alone. But \u2026.the Forks Forum keeps plugging along.</p><p>An FYI \u2026The Hartford Courant is the oldest US Newspaper in continuous publication. The first edition was in 1764.</p><p>Anyway, this week in 1931 there was a lot happening. The Olympic Loop (the highway south) was opening in a month, there had been a forest fire near Bear Creek that burned about five hundred acres, and another small fire in the Bogachiel area. An oil derrick for the Leslie Oil Company was going in near the mouth of the Hoh River. Contractor S.S. Mullen was busy adding on to the high school and also working on the road near Fairholme, creating an arch that would go over the Port Angeles Western railroad tracks. The Wahlgren Bros. were hauling gravel for the new school addition.</p><p>Hoh area residents were asking for a road and a cable bridge over the Hoh. The superintendent of the Lacy Timber Company had been struck by a Bloedel Donovan logging train breaking his leg in 4 places, he was recovering. Jeff Hudson of La Push had passed, he was just 33 and was well known for wrestling skills and being an all-around athlete. Rango and Pardon my gun were playing at the Olympic Theater, and Forks Co-operative Creamery was advertising Prairie Queen Butter. You could get two heads of lettuce for 8\u00a2. The limit was four at the Shores P.S.Q. Store.</p><p>The first Editor, Benjamin Arndt had a letter welcoming readers and mentioned the \"so called depression\" saying the outlook for Forks was a bright one! Most of the ads had no phone number or address on the ad!</p><p>There has been a lot of news on these pages since 1931, how many pages I don't know, but a bunch, and a lot has changed.</p><p>Here's hoping we can make it to 100! or until next year \u2026</p><p>Christi Baron</p><p>Editor</p><p>Copyright 2025 Forks Forum</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FORFOR-news20250717PXK4745072</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FORFOR2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G8Y-Y8H3-RTTG-C2MJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">475085</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"332\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

Its core business activities center on sustainable forest management, timber harvesting, and the production of wood products. The company''s largest sources of revenue come from its Timberlands segment, which includes the sale of logs and timber, and its Wood Products segment, which manufactures and distributes lumber, engineered wood, and other building materials primarily for residential and commercial construction. Additionally, Weyerhaeuser operates a Real Estate, Energy, and Natural Resources segment, focusing on land sales and renewable energy opportunities. Among its business lines, the Wood Products segment has shown notable growth, driven by strong demand in the housing and construction markets. With a commitment to environmental stewardship, Weyerhaeuser continues to balance profitability with sustainable practices across its extensive land holdings. It is the NYSE's 5th largest Building materials &amp; fixtures company by market capitalisation.</p><p>In FY 2024, the top earner of Revenue was WOOD PRODUCTS [68%] followed by TIMBERLANDS [26.9%] at Rank 2  and REAL ESTATE &amp; ENR [5.1%] at Rank 3. In FY 2024, revenue growth was highest in REAL ESTATE &amp; ENR [7.7%] .</p><p>Weyerhaeuser Company has consistently demonstrated its commitment to sustainable forestry and community development through strategic investments and philanthropic efforts. Recently, Weyerhaeuser made headlines with its land donation for the Row River wildfire substation, exemplifying its leadership in wildfire protection and emergency services partnerships. This initiative underscores Weyerhaeuser's dedication to wildfire mitigation and response infrastructure, crucial in safeguarding forests and nearby communities.</p><p>In West Virginia, Weyerhaeuser's investment strategy is robust, epitomized by a $1 million community investment in Buckhannon. This investment is set to bolster rural economic development and enhance Weyerhaeuser's community grants and support efforts. Highlighting its philanthropic endeavors, Weyerhaeuser's charitable giving focuses on corporate social responsibility, revered by the Buckhannon community for fostering sustainable forestry.</p><p>Through such initiatives, including timberland and forestland donations, Weyerhaeuser maintains a steadfast commitment to land stewardship, enhancing community resilience, and ensuring a sustainable future for generations. Weyerhaeuser's overarching goal remains clear: elevating community development while ensuring the sustainability of critical ecosystems.</p><p>2.2 Independent Ratings and Relative Value Indicators</p><p>+    Fortune 500:</p><p>Weyerhaeuser Company is a new entrant in the Fortune list of Top 500 Global companies by Revenues in 2022, ranked 420.</p><p>+    Just Capital:</p><p>It was ranked 165 in the Just Capital annual list of top 100 ESG stocks for 2022; it was ranked 5 in the Real Estate sector.</p><p>+    Industryweek 1000:</p><p>It is a new entrant in the Industry Week list of the world's largest 1000 manufacturers by Revenues in 2016, ranked 523.</p><p>2.3 Contact Details</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"128\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"496\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Website</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.weyerhaeuser.com\">http://www.weyerhaeuser.com</url></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Physical Address</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">33663 Weyerhaeuser Way South,P.O.

Comprised of mature, highly productive timberlands, the acreage will be well-integrated with existing Weyerhaeuser timberland and mill operations in North Carolina, will expand the company's footprint into attractive markets in southeastern Virginia and will offer substantial alternative value opportunities. The acquisition is expected to deliver immediate and sustained portfolio-leading cash flows within the company's Southern Timberlands business.</p><p>Key attributes of the acquisition:</p><p>Located in strong and growing sawlog and fiber markets in the U.S. South Primarily fee ownership with 81 percent planted pine acreage, strong site productivity and favorable all-weather logging operability Mature planted pine age class expected to produce an average annual harvest of 7.4 tons per acre (or 860,000 tons) over the first five years Expected to deliver an average annual timber free cash flow yield of 5.1 percent over the first five years Significant optionality to capture additional upside from real estate, natural climate solutions and natural resource opportunities \"These are exceptional timberlands, and we're excited and well-positioned to capitalize on this unique off-market opportunity,\" said Devin W.

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply. However, additional mill capacity being added in the U.S.</p><p>Press Release article 10 of 10, Source: WEC, 76 words </p><p>November 13 2024: Weyerhaeuser quarterly dividends steady</p><p>Weyerhaeuser today announced a quarterly dividend of 20.0c per share for Q3/2024; unchanged from the previous quarter (Q2/2024) dividend of 20.0c. The ex-dividend date is Friday, November 29, 2024 and the record date is Friday, November 29, 2024 and it is payable on Friday, December 13. Total dividends per share paid in the 12 months ended November 14 were 79.0c.</p><p>SECTION 5 WEYERHAEUSER 10-Q: 12 CONSEQUENTIAL MANAGEMENT DECISIONS</p><p>Strategic Expansion of Engineered Wood Products Capacity</p><p>Management has committed $500 million to constructing a new TimberStrand facility in Monticello, Arkansas, beginning in 2025, with operations expected by 2027. This investment is projected to expand engineered wood products capacity by 10 million cubic feet, positioning Weyerhaeuser to seize greater market share in the growing housing sector. While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.</p><p>Shareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program</p><p>Following completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.</p><p>Maintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges</p><p>Weyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.</p><p>Strengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility</p><p>The company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.</p><p>Capital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing</p><p>Management refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.</p><p>Focused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency</p><p>Excluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.</p><p>Expansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth</p><p>Weyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.</p><p>Unlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures</p><p>The announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.</p><p>Timberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base</p><p>Management advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.</p><p>Operational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures</p><p>Initiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.</p><p>Proactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities</p><p>Reserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties. By maintaining adequate coverage for contingent liabilities, Weyerhaeuser bolsters its balance sheet resilience. However, potential over-reserving may tie up capital unnecessarily and requires vigilant management assessment.</p><p>Prioritizing Workforce Stability Amid Labor Market Tightness</p><p>Recognizing a 4.1% unemployment rate as a constraint, Weyerhaeuser focused on hiring and talent retention across its segments. Stability in workforce availability ensures operational continuity and supports management's strategic initiatives. However, rising labor costs remain a potential margin-pressure risk-a critical area to monitor for sustained profitability.</p><p>Source: Weyerhaeuser's, 10-Q filing dated July 25, 2025, available at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/106535/000095017025098794/wy-20250630.htm\">https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/106535/000095017025098794/wy-20250630.htm</url> and Weyerhaeuser's website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.weyerhaeuser.com/\">https://investor.weyerhaeuser.com/</url>.</p><p>SECTION 6 TODAY'S BULLISH SIGNALS</p><p>6.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield</p><p>Dividend Yield &gt; 2/3rd Bond Yield:</p><p>The dividend yield of 3.48% is 0.88 times the triple-A bond yield of 3.96%; it is also above the benchmark of 2/3rd set by Benjamin Graham. </p><p>(All figures in %)</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_7\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"480\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"144\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Dividend Yield</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">3.48</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Bond Yield</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">3.96</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Spread</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.48</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>The Dividend Yield of 3.5% is better than the Index average of 1.9%</p><p>- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 3.5%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the S&amp;P 500 Index of 1.9% is 185.1%.

How he gets out of this without it all going pear-shaped like last time, with the beautiful smiles of 'the Celtic family' replaced by foaming-mouthed punters chanting about him being shot in his sleep.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Reports over the weekend that club insiders are concerned he is trying to 'engineer his exit' are no shock. There's a storm coming at Parkhead - the rumble of restless feet heading for the car park with bedsheets spray-painted and biceps braced for some crush barrier chucking - and it stands to reason that certain individuals are working out the best way to position themselves against it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For months now, Rodgers has been insistent on putting heat on his paymasters to bring in players of 'high quality'. Now that the market has closed, in the wake of a shambolic final day to wrap up an all-round catastrophe of a window at the champions, these fresh headlines have the distinct whiff of someone, somewhere inside the building making a move to turn the torchlight on him.</p><p>And this is where Rodgers has to be careful. Super careful. Having lit the touchpaper by demanding investment and laying the blame for an unforgivable Champions League exit to Kairat Almaty at inadequate recruitment, he's been giving the impression of someone backing away from the flame of late.</p><p>Indeed, if he doesn't watch out, he might soon end up accused, himself, of gaslighting a fanbase already on the brink.</p><p>A week ago, he was insisting suggestions of a disconnect between him and the directors couldn't 'be further from the truth'. 'Everyone is connected,' he said. 'Every single guy, from me, to the board, to Dermot (Desmond), we love Celtic, but we want Celtic to be the very, very best.'</p><p>That was ahead of deadline day, where Adam Idah was sold to Swansea - after Rodgers had stated that couldn't happen without a replacement coming in - and Daizen Maeda, who, it turns out, made it clear he wanted away months ago, was informed he couldn't accept an offer agreed with another club and leave.</p><p>Throw Yang Hyun-jun, who saw a move to Birmingham kyboshed, into the mix, and you've now got two players - at least - in and around the first team who don't want to be there. Are these really the actions of an organisation with everyone singing in perfect harmony? That's before we have even discussed the botched attempt to land Kasper Dolberg, Chelsea's David Datro Fofana opting for Charlton and the all-out panic that saw Kelechi Iheanacho brought in the morning after the night before as a result of Sevilla cancelling his contract.</p><p>Getting Iheanacho is the equivalent of spending weeks believing the wrapped parcel under the Christmas tree is a new Nintendo Switch - only to discover it was actually a knitted jumper from your auntie. That doesn't fit. You must smile sweetly and say nice things, presenting a face to the world as it falls apart around you.</p><p>Rodgers went too far during the week, though. Way, way too far.</p><p>'He has great experience and he is right in his peak years,' said the manager. Peak years?</p><p>Iheanacho hasn't played since May. He failed to score in nine La Liga games at Sevilla last term and then managed one in 15 during a disastrous loan spell at Middlesbrough, where his substitution during a game against Leeds was cheered by his own fans.</p><p>The Nigerian may only be 28, but his peak years were long ago.</p><p>Rodgers, though, has placed himself in the dangerous territory of selling shoeshine as sugar here. And this is no environment for that. There is a forest fire of supporter fury in danger of enveloping Celtic and the slightest change of wind direction can have the flames licking anyone's feet.</p><p>When Rodgers agreed to return to Parkhead two years ago, there were many of us who couldn't understand why. Seeing his stay end like this - and it must be ending, because why would he ever agree a new contract? - is no real shock.</p><p>He wanted to rebuild the club as a European force. Well, that's gone for a Burton, particularly with the squad at his disposal, so that leaves just one other main objective to fulfil - being loved again.</p><p>Rodgers was hurt by the venom directed towards him by the Celtic fanbase when he left for Leicester City in 2019. He wanted to make that good.</p><p>At the moment, the rank and file are on his side. Last night's rambling brainrot on the club website - citing FFP rules and blaming media for the chaos of the past month - is not going to ease the pressure on the board in the slightest.</p><p>Rather, the longer CEO Michael 'Mr Invisible' Nicholson hides under the bedsheets waiting for major shareholder Dermot Desmond to tell him it's OK to come out, or hides behind brain-numbing statements attributed to no one, the more fan anger is going to grow.</p><p>At least Rangers sporting director Kevin Thelwell had the good sense to do an in-house interview during the week, addressing most of the key issues causing consternation on the other side of Glasgow, other than why he has committed \u00a310million on a striker in Youssef Chermiti who hardly plays and never scores.</p><p>Celtic don't work that way, though. They batten down the hatches. Hope these storms will pass.</p><p>And maybe the anonymous insider who spoke about unhappiness with Rodgers is waiting, along with others, to see how punters react if the team keeps playing as badly as it has been in recent times.</p><p>As much as the directors remain the main targets of unrest, those pitiful displays against Kairat and the latest in a long line of no-shows in Old Firm derbies in last weekend's goalless draw at Ibrox have, to some observers, instigated a little bit of a temperature change around the manager too.</p><p>He's been getting more flak. His tactics and team selections have been taken apart. The players he spent a combined \u00a340m on last summer often don't get near the starting XI. Yes, fans appreciated his honesty in addressing what Celtic needed during the window, but will they remain in his corner if the football remains as awful as it has been of late?</p><p>He's in a precarious position, too, and it all makes for a fascinating week in prospect.</p><p>Rodgers will be back on media duties. He knows what the main topics of discussion will be and needs to work out where he places himself. What he can't do is carry on looking like a cowed figure trying to sook back in with the board, telling the world that the suits upstairs bleed for the club and that Iheanacho is some kind of masterstroke.</p><p>If he really wants the fragile respect he has won back from the fanbase to sustain, he can't back down and just toe the party line.</p><p>And if that means breaking his promise to stay the full three years and walking away, so be it. He could do that right now and get away with it. If his underperforming team ends up dragged into a title fight with rivals who should be nowhere near them, that might not be the case for long.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCMALS-206582984</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SCMALS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GP0-HJY3-S2RG-J2KF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">419638</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1137\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Associated Newpapers Ltd.

He failed to score in nine La Liga games at Sevilla last term and then managed one in 15 during a disastrous loan spell at Middlesbrough, where his substitution during a game against Leeds was cheered by his own fans.</p><p>The Nigerian may only be 28, but his peak years were long ago.</p><p>Rodgers, though, has placed himself in the dangerous territory of selling shoeshine as sugar here. And this is no environment for that. There is a forest fire of supporter fury in danger of enveloping Celtic and the slightest change of wind direction can have the flames licking anyone's feet.</p><p>When Rodgers agreed to return to Parkhead two years ago, there were many of us who couldn't understand why. Seeing his stay end like this - and it must be ending, because why would he ever agree a new contract? - is no real shock.</p><p>He wanted to rebuild the club as a European force. Well, that's gone for a Burton, particularly with the squad at his disposal, so that leaves just one other main objective to fulfil - being loved again.</p><p>Rodgers was hurt by the venom directed towards him by the Celtic fanbase when he left for Leicester City in 2019. He wanted to make that good.</p><p>At the moment, the rank and file are on his side. Last night's rambling brainrot on the club website - citing FFP rules and blaming media for the chaos of the past month - is not going to ease the pressure on the board in the slightest.</p><p>Rather, the longer CEO Michael 'Mr Invisible' Nicholson hides under the bedsheets waiting for major shareholder Dermot Desmond to tell him it's OK to come out, or hiding behind brain-numbing statements attributed to no one, the more fan anger is going to grow.</p><p>At least Rangers sporting director Kevin Thelwell had the good sense to do an in-house interview during the week, addressing most of the key issues causing consternation on the other side of Glasgow, other than why he has committed \u00a310million on a striker in Youssef Chermiti who hardly plays and never scores.</p><p>Celtic don't work that way, though. They batten down the hatches. Hope these storms will pass.</p><p>And maybe the anonymous insider who spoke about unhappiness with Rodgers is waiting, along with others, to see how punters react if the team keeps playing as badly as it has been in recent times.</p><p>As much as the directors remain the main targets of unrest, those pitiful displays against Kairat and the latest in a long line of no-shows in Old Firm derbies in last weekend's goalless draw at Ibrox have, to some observers, instigated a little bit of a temperature change around the manager too.</p><p>He's been getting more flak. His tactics and team selections have been taken apart. The players he spent a combined \u00a340m on last summer often don't get near the starting XI. Yes, fans appreciated his honesty in addressing what Celtic needed during the window, but will they remain in his corner if the football remains as awful as it has been of late?</p><p>He's in a precarious position, too, and it all makes for a fascinating week in prospect.</p><p>Rodgers will be back on media duties. He knows what the main topics of discussion will be and needs to work out where he places himself. What he can't do is carry on looking like a cowed figure trying to sook back in with the board, telling the world that the suits upstairs bleed for the club and that Iheanacho is some kind of masterstroke.</p><p>If he really wants the fragile respect he has won back from the fanbase to sustain, he can't back down and just toe the party line.</p><p>And if that means breaking his promise to stay the full three years and walking away, so be it. He could do that right now and get away with it. If his underperforming team ends up dragged into a title fight with rivals who should be nowhere near them, that might not be the case for long.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCMALS-206580849</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SCMALS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GP0-HJY3-S2RG-J2DV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">419638</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1137\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Associated Newpapers Ltd.

It too will begin to deliver them as day cases once it has delivered its first 20 procedures.</p><p>HOLEP involves using a laser to help break-up and remove excess prostate tissue enabling easier urination.</p><p>It is considered a significant advance in prostate procedures because it usually improves urination considerably, takes a short time to deliver, and patients can recover from it more quickly, and with less complications, than other common procedures.</p><p>Surgeons at the University Hospitals of Northamptonshire - which runs Northampton and Kettering general hospitals - have been working hard to fully establish and deliver the procedure across both Trusts. Northampton is the first hospital in the East Midlands to deliver the procedure as a day case.</p><p>The operations, which require specially trained consultants, are being delivered at NGH by consultant urologist, Mr Aakash Pai, and at KGH by consultant urologist, Mr Shady Nafie.</p><p>Mr Pai said: \"Benign prostate enlargement affects about half of men over 50, and up to 80% of men over 70.</p><p>\"The symptoms include frequent urination, difficulty starting to pee, a weak stream, and the feeling of incomplete bladder emptying.</p><p>\"This is because the prostate tissue's enlargement puts pressure on the urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder.</p><p>\"While not normally a serious threat to health it can significantly impact on a person's quality of life and if medications don't help surgical procedures can become an option.\"</p><p>Mr Nafie said: \"HOLEP is a high-tech, impressive operation that excels in treating larger prostates with less bleeding, faster recovery, and better outcomes compared to other methods.</p><p>\"It is the new gold standard of treatment for benign prostate enlargement.</p><p>\"I was determined to offer the procedure at Kettering to make it easier for North Northants patients and I made a successful bid to have some specialist training in Cambridge and Germany so that I could bring it here as soon as possible.</p><p>\"We are delighted to be offering the procedure now across both of our hospitals for the benefit of our patients.\"</p><p>Patients say procedure has improved their quality of life</p><p>Patients have said the new procedure is painless, leads to a quick recovery, and has significantly improved their quality of life.</p><p>Retired heating engineer David Leggett, 74, from Northampton, had been suffering from reduced flow and discomfort for some months. He had a procedure to remove stones from his bladder and his surgeon then recommended he go to NGH for a HOLEP procedure to further improve his condition.</p><p>He was one of the first patients to have the procedure as a day case at Northampton General Hospital.</p><p>Mr Leggett, who is married to Susan and has two children and six grandchildren, said: \"I hadn't been to hospital for 73 years so I was quite nervous but the day case team at NGH looked after me very well.</p><p>\"The procedure took a couple of hours and I went home on the same day with a catheter in which was removed a week later.</p><p>\"The difference has been amazing. You could say I previously would have struggled to fill a teacup but now I can put out a forest fire. It has a big difference on my life. I used to worry about being close to a toilet and now I am confident again in going for walks and living life to the full. I am over the moon with the operation. It is a one-stop shop, no side effects and no pain.\"</p><p>Peter Letts, 73, from Wellingborough, had his HOLEP procedure at KGH in June after being admitted to hospital with urinary retention.</p><p>Mr Letts, who is married to Kathleen and has three children and five grandchildren, said: \"I don't remember much about the morning I had it but it was quick and painless. In about a week I was back to normal.</p><p>\"If you get the chance to have this procedure I would say just do it. It can make a big difference very quickly.\"<br/><br/>Procedure reduces the need for follow-up procedures</p><p>The average amount of tissue that is removed for HOLEP is five times the amount removed using conventional procedures, hence there is less need for follow-up procedures if prostate tissue regrows.</p><p>Mr Nafie said: \"Compared to older techniques like TURP and open prostatectomy, HOLEP offers improved outcomes, including less bleeding, shorter catheterization and hospital stays, and a lower risk of a need for a repeat procedure.</p><p>\"It is a significant advancement over previous surgical procedures particularly in its ability to treat larger prostates with reduced complications and shorter recovery times.</p><p>The University Hospitals of Northamptonshire's Group Medical Director, Mr Hemant Nemade, said: \"Essentially this state-of-the-art procedure uses a light beam to peel tissue and hollow out the prostate.</p><p>\"It can remove more prostate tissue than other procedures for prostate enlargement and help address obstruction of the bladder.</p><p>\"At Northampton we have now started to deliver some of our HOLEP procedures as a day case through our excellent day surgery unit and we aim to do this at Kettering too soon.\"</p><p>Source: Kettering General Hospital NHS Foundation Trust</p><p>[Category: Medical Devices, Healthcare, New Offerings]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDPNW-0066990646</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDPNW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GN4-FMM3-RWG9-X4WP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">373676</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1035\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Contify Life Science News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"3936\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 2, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009QFC</classCode><className>MINIMALLY INVASIVE SURGERY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002114</classCode><className>UROLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001657</classCode><className>SURGERY &amp;

Coming from a city core, I was able to exchange manmade towers for natural mountains that touch the sky.</p><p>Having a friend double as an experienced guide was a privilege that wasn't lost on me, either. Hiking and camping, I've found, is a world that is much more accessible when you have a hiking veteran show you the ropes; there are the camping logistics, like what equipment to bring and how to set up camp. Items like bear sprays, or what to do if we saw a bear, were important as well. Other aspects, like the techniques behind starting a fire \u2014 much tougher than one might expect \u2014 or a specific set of campfire clothes that you're alright with getting smokey, are also those unexpected but totally sensible #8216;you don't know what you don't know#8217; tips you learn when you're with someone who has done this before. </p><p>That same friend-turned-guide \u2014 who also convinced me that, yes, altitude sickness is real and no, I can't just waive it aside because I #8216;got this#8217; \u2014 hiked his first trail when he was about 19. Before that, he told me, he didn't have the same level of appreciation for nature that he does now, which has led him to research the very same natural wonders in order to protect them.</p><p>Views from Yosemite National Park. (Photo by Mark Lannaman.)</p><p>In just the few days we spent outdoors, my appreciation for the outdoors and my desire to protect it from ourselves grew, despite previously having considered myself someone who appreciates the outdoors. Everyone should have an innate desire to protect our natural wonders, even if you're not an outdoor enthusiast; most people, I believe, do have this appreciation to varying degrees. However there is a certain feeling that, in my experience, the outdoors can only provide when one has been able to sit in it and truly appreciate it. It's like watching a sport on TV versus watching it in person. </p><p>Later in August, I also visited Ocmulgee Mounds National Historical Park, an ancient site with over 12,000 years of continuous human habitation, according to the National Park Service. While quite different from Yosemite, the reverence and appreciation the National Park Service had for the lands were on full display, from the museum recounting the history of the lands to the maintenance crew taking care of ensuring the mounds.</p><p>Not everyone is as lucky to experience our natural world in the way that I did, whether it be for physical, financial or time-limiting factors; this isn't lost on me, and it highlights why appreciation of the outdoors cannot be born solely from those who experience it in the ways that I have.</p><p>But it's important to remember we're all part of this natural world.</p><p>It's harder to disregard the outdoors when we don't perceive it as the home of animals and bugs and wild plants, but rather our shared group home. Part of the job for conservationists is to get more people, especially first-timers, to the natural beauties around them. Part of my job, I suppose, is to communicate those wonders to the public \u2014 especially when they are endangered \u2014 and to help people make those connections between their daily lives and what is perceived as a separate, natural world.</p><p>We don't need to pretend a walk through a city is the same as a walk through a forest because we're all #8216;one world,#8217; but we would be remiss to not look around and understand our man-made structures, the food we eat, water we drink and dozens of other factors as all relating to the outdoors in intricate ways, not separated by an imaginary wall of nature vs civilization. It's something that, in my time at the Ocmulgee Mounds, I was reminded of when I learned about the ways Native Americans lived with the land.</p><p>It's not lost on me that differing priorities will yield different outcomes for our natural wonders. Just this year, the conservationists advocating for the Okefenokee Swamp c<url normalizedValue=\"https://georgiaconservancy.org/okefenokee-mining/\">apped off a multi-year battle with a mining corporation that sought to mine nearby. Ultimately, the company backtracked its mining plans in the area \u2014 a win for the blackwater swamp, according to many conservationists worried about what the mining would have done to the delicate ecosystem.</url></p><p>Just at the end of August, the USDA sent a notice of intent regarding their goal of repealing the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2001/01/12/01-726/special-areas-roadless-area-conservation\">Roadless Area Conservation Rule enacted by Former President Clinton. The rule protected nearly 59 million acres nationwide, and 63,000 acres in Georgia alone, according to Environment Georgia, which opposes the opening of the protected lands to roads and infrastructure projects.</url></p><p>The USDA, in contrast, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/06/23/secretary-rollins-rescinds-roadless-rule-eliminating-impediment-responsible-forest-management\">called the rule outdated and said opening the lands would allow for responsible timber production and forest fire management.</url></p><p>As society continues to urbanize and grow, more of our natural landscape will fall by the wayside to development. Could we use our existing developed spaces better, with denser zones and fewer empty parking lots? Probably. Is all development an inherently bad thing, either? I'd imagine not. </p><p>It's not my place to say whether the move by the USDA is the right one or not \u2014 and deciding what #8216;right#8217; means is another question that brings us back to differing priorities.</p><p>But regardless of the way we build \u2014 though sustainable should be the goal both financially and environmentally speaking \u2014 it is imperative people don't lose connection with the natural world. We can't afford to see the natural world, the #8216;outside,#8217; as something separate from society. The natural world does not exist as a waiting repository of resources for us to use unsustainably in cities and suburbs. </p><p>The outdoors are inherently valuable, without people assigning it a value due to proximity or the resources it may hold. If we can do our part, either by visiting, advocating, or just being mindful of our connections with the outdoors, we can at the very least give Mother Nature a voice in any decisions we make regarding the way we interact with the outdoors.</p><p>I feel lucky to have seen so many wonders of the world in a span of 30 days. Cliche as it sounds, we are all connected much more than we care to understand at times, even over vast seas and oceans. If we are the #8216;brains#8217; of a personified Mother Nature, the outdoors is the body \u2014 and we'd be wise to take care of our body proactively, and be the stewards that no other species can quite be in the same way.</p><p>Views from Yosemite National Park.

The Minister of Ecological Transition appeared Wednesday in the Senate as part of the string of requests for appearances that the PP recorded in the Senate in full struggle with the PSOE for responsibility in the fire crisis, and that will culminate this week with the citation of the Minister of Interior, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fernando Grande-Marlaska</emphasis>, and the head of Agriculture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Luis Planas</emphasis>, which the people complain that he has been \"absent\" in the management of the disaster.</p><p><br/> Aagesen avoided entering into the clash with the PP over competences and figures, and focused her speech on two axes: the \"emergency\" of climate change; and the work and means that both her Ministry and the Government have made available to<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> 14 autonomous communities</emphasis> throughout the crisis, data with which she tried to refute, without raising her voice, the thesis of Genoa on the lack of involvement of the Executive in the deployment of aid.<br/> The minister warned first of all that \"the moment is still complex\" and that, according to the Copernicus system, between August 1 and 21 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">more than 362,000 hectares have burned in Spain, 140,000 of which </emphasis>in protected natural areas, affecting 395 species at risk. He then defended that since July 1 have been deployed means of the State and that from Ecological Transition have been added \"extraordinary means\" and \"reinforcement\", among which he has listed 11 forest fire brigades the 56 aircraft available to the Government. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"All the means have been available,\"</emphasis> he said.<br/> It must be remembered that the Government, through a report of the Ministry of Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge, revealed at the end of the year that the lack of Budgets would reduce the investment in the fight against fires, and detailed that, in principle, it was foreseen the hiring of 42 aerial means to suffocate the fires, five less than in previous years. However, the aforementioned department corrected this warning and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">raised the number of aircraft to 56</emphasis>, the same figure that Aagesen herself has shown this Wednesday.<br/> The minister also detailed that<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> 252 million</emphasis> have been transferred<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> to the communities</emphasis> of the Recovery and Resilience Plan in fire prevention and took chest that her Ministry has increased the budget in fire prevention by 50% between 2018 and 2025. He also pledged that the Government will provide support to the affected territories for \"restoration\" tasks.<br/> Aagesen put the focus on the challenge of the \"climate emergency\", and demanded the PP \"institutional loyalty\" for the search for \"consensus\", which the Government intends to convey through the pact of State announced by S\u00e1nchez days ago. \"I ask you to participate all together hand in hand,\" he encouraged. \"Climate change is accelerating, and it is time to work together, united\". At this point, and already in the turn of reply, Aagesen also pledged to \"analyze\" the 50 measures against fires announced by Feij\u00f3o, although he warned that there are proposals that \"do not make sense\".  <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The PP demands Budgets</emphasis><br/> The explanations of the minister were not enough for the PP. His spokesman, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Francisco Javier M\u00e1rquez, </emphasis>again lashed out at the \"lack of means\" whose origin has been located in the absence of a draft General State Budget for 2025. And although Aagesen avoided direct reproaches, he also reproached him that from the Government has turned the attack on<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> the autonomous communities of the PP into a \"national sport\"</emphasis>. \"Where is your leadership?\" he questioned.<br/> Marquez reminded Aagesen the regulatory vacuum of the Government to prevent fires, for example regarding the delay in the execution of EU funds earmarked for this item, an accusation of which the minister has defended herself by hiding behind the fact that the implementation of these items corresponds to the autonomous communities. \"The field is abandoned,\" continued the leader of the PP. M\u00e1rquez did not want to close the door completely to the State Pact proposed by the Government, but pointed out that in this context and without the existence of a concrete Budget by the Government, it is nothing more than <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"a wild card to evade responsibilities\".</emphasis><br/> Other parliamentary spokespersons have focused their criticisms on the war of \"bipartisanship\". This was the case of the head of Vox, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00c1ngel Pelayo, </emphasis>who censured that \"every time there is a catastrophe in Spain\", the war of \"competences\" between PSOE and PP begins. The ultra-conservative leader thanked Aagesen for the tone of his intervention, but demanded that he \"assume responsibilities\" for the lack of planning and prevention in the crisis and denied that the origin of what happened was in climate change, but in the lack of \"adequate policies\".<br/> In the same line expressed the spokesman of Junts, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Eduard Pujol, </emphasis>who reproached PP and PSOE the fact that they have taken the fires to a \"boxing ring\". \"They are extremely irresponsible\", <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a \"machine of political disaffection</emphasis>\". The leader was interrupted by the president of the Commission, who demanded him to withdraw the \"insults\" that he had poured against leaders of the two big parties after calling Miguel Tellado a \"hooligan\", a warning that was received with complaints by Pujol.<br/> After the whip of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Margarita Robles</emphasis>, came the sobriety of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Sara Aagesen</emphasis>. The Minister of Ecological Transition appeared this Wednesday in the Senate as part of the string of requests for appearances that the PP registered in the Senate in the midst of the struggle with the PSOE for responsibility in the fire crisis, and which will culminate this week with the summons of the Minister of the Interior, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fernando Grande-Marlaska</emphasis> and the head of Agriculture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Luis Planas</emphasis>, whom the Popular Party criticizes for having been \"absent\" in the management of the disaster. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-72465913</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GKV-9W53-RXXX-84V4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"962\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 27, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Espa\u00f1a</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1F5</classCode><className>NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST00097C9</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS &amp; AUTHORITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N921000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BODIES &amp; OFFICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FY2</classCode><className>ECOLOGY &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001838</classCode><className>WILDERNESS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp; MINISTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DS8M</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC325</classCode><className>SPAIN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Visitors to Mount Vesuvius in Italy will have been turned away from the trails as firefighters battled blazes on the volcano's slopes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And then there are campers in south-west France, where 40% of selected weather stations recorded heat above 40C on Monday, who may have wished they had stayed home.</p><p>Fierce heat is scorching Southern Europe for the second time this summer, breaking temperature records and fuelling wildfires that have forced thousands of people across several countries to flee their homes.</p><p>The heatwave, which has been made longer and stronger by the blanket of fossil fuel pollution that smothers the Earth, has struck during the holiday season when tourist-dependent economies in the Mediterranean and the Balkans are most exposed to variations in weather.</p><p>For locals and visitors alike, the formerly Insta-gram-friendly views now seem apocalyptic. Firefighters are tackling fierce blazes in countries from Portugal to Turkey, and the infernos are known to have killed people in France, Spain, Albania, Montenegro, and Greece.</p><p>Across the continent, black smoke is darkening blood-red skies.</p><p>\"We are being cooked alive,\" Alexandre Favaios, the mayor of Vila Real, in northern Portugal said. \"This cannot continue.\"</p><p>Wildfires in Europe burned more than 400,000 hectares in the first seven months of 2025, according to data published by EU fire scientists on Tuesday. Although it is not the worst the continent has seen for this time of year, the burned area is 87% greater than the average over the last two decades.</p><p>In the coming week, the scientists warned, \"extreme to very extreme conditions\" for fire weather will persist. They project \"particularly severe\" risks in much of southern Europe, as well as high anomalies in parts of the Nordics.</p><p>\"We are at extreme risk of forest fires,\" the Spanish prime minister Pedro S\u00e1n-chez warned this week. \"Please be very cautious.\"</p><p>I have felt the fear that wildfires can instil in an absent-minded tourist. At a Portuguese friend's wedding in 2022, by a lake in the rural centre of the country, a nearby forest fire forced us to head indoors early so helicopters could fill buckets with fresh water to battle the blaze. The next day, as we lounged in the outdoor pool of a holiday home, white soot rained down on us like snow.</p><p>The hot ashes had been lifted up by plumes of smoke that grew redder and redder as the fire came closer. After some fretting among the group, one friend with a newborn baby decided it was time to leave, so we fled to the coast. We drove past locals, mostly retired, who stood outside their homes and watched in horror as flames drew near.</p><p>Wildfires kill hundreds of people around the world each year - a death toll far lower than that from floods, which kill thousands, and from heat-waves, which kill hundreds of thousands. But factor in the smoke and the human cost rises rapidly. The latest research estimates that the air pollution spewed by wildfires kills a staggering 1.5m people globally each year.</p><p>There are economic costs, too. As southern Europe bakes and burns each summer, tourists who cannot travel out of season are starting to abandon traditional holiday destinations in favour of \"coolcations\" farther north that beat the heat.</p><p>Even that strategy will have led to some disappointment this summer. At the start of the month, a heatwave hit cool Nordic countries and sent temperatures north of the Arctic Circle to a staggering 3233C.</p><p>\"Truly unprecedented\" was how one meteorologist described the heatwave.</p><p>The upshot is that flight shame might not be what keeps people from holidaying far from home as the planet heats up.</p><p>Instead, it could be the rising cost of travel as Eu-rope's once-stable climate violently breaks down.</p><p>* <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Guardian</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture 1, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Young swimmers jump into the water from a rock on a breakwater on a hot day in Barcelona, Spain</emphasis>.

The year  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fayn.press/neden-yaniyoruz/\">2021 stands out as the</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://globalvoices.org/2021/08/02/in-turkey-continuing-forest-fires-are-destroying-livelihoods/\">most devastating on record, with approximately 170,000 hectares (1,700 square kilometers) of forest burned, impacting livelihoods and causing widespread displacement. While there have been efforts to</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/iletisim/status/1939958248196431884\">enhance firefighting capabilities, the recurring nature and scale of these disasters raise critical questions about preparedness.</url></p><p>In a  <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/iletisim/status/1939958248196431884\">tweet shared by the Ministry of Communication, Turkey has significantly increased its aerial firefighting capacity, from 73 tons in 2002 to 438 tons by 2025, with a fleet that now includes 27 planes and 105 helicopters.</url></p><p>The average fire detection time has reportedly been cut to just two minutes, thanks to a combination of  <url normalizedValue=\"https://analyticsdrift.com/turkey-to-use-artificial-intelligence-to-fight-wildfires/\">AI-backed systems and 776 fire watch towers; the country is a leader in</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://baykartech.com/en/fighting-forest-fires/\">unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based forest surveillance. The ground force has also seen an increase, with 8,500 new hires, bringing the total professional firefighting force to 25,000, supported by 131,000 registered volunteers. The ground fleet has more than doubled, and 4,796 fire ponds have been constructed.</url></p><p>Despite these reported advancements, the immediate impact on the ground during large-scale, simultaneous fires  <url normalizedValue=\"https://newlinesmag.com/reportage/the-political-machine-feeding-turkeys-wildfires/\">often highlights resource limitations, with images of local residents carrying water in small bottles circulating widely on social media.</url></p><p>Faulty electrical power lines</p><p>A significant point of contention revolves around the the role of electrical power lines in forest fires.

Instead, it attributed the fires to 'high temperatures, low humidity, and strong winds and climate change.'</url></p><p>Given the historical context of electricity-related fires, the company's stance has been met with considerable skepticism and anger.

As of 26 August, an area bigger than Cyprus and higher than the total for any other year on record has been ravaged by blazes, according to data from the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS).</p><p>Researchers warn that the risk of larger, harder-to-control fires will continue to increase if the world continues to burn fossil fuels. These simultaneous blazes are already stretching firefighting resources with more intense events outpacing efforts to adapt.</p><p>These results are concerning. Today, with 1.3\\xB0C of warming, we are seeing new extremes in wildfire behaviour that has pushed firefighters to their limit, says Theodore Keeping, researcher at the Centre for Environmental Policy, Imperial College London.</p><p>But we are heading for up to 3\\xB0C this century unless countries more rapidly transition away from fossil fuels.</p><p>Climate change set the scene for deadly wildfires</p><p>In June and July, hundreds of wildfires broke out in the eastern Mediterranean.</p><p>T\\xFCrkiye was hardest hit with 17 people killed, among them firefighters who died when winds suddenly changed direction, leaving them trapped by the flames. Two people were killed in Cyprus and one in Greece. Across the three countries, more than 80,000 people were forced to evacuate.</p><p>Climate change, researchers say, set the scene for these fires in T\\xFCrkiye, Greece and Cyprus by influencing the weather in the months, weeks and days leading up to them.</p><p>Total rainfall during winter in the region has decreased by around 14 per cent since the pre-industrial era, before humans began burning fossil fuels. This has led to drier conditions in the summer which, combined with intense dry heat, primed plants to burn.</p><p>A week of highly evaporative conditions that cause plants to dry out is now around 18 per cent more intense and 13 times more likely due to climate change, the analysis found.</p><p>Next, researchers looked at the combination of hot, dry and windy conditions that drove the chaotic spread of the fires. Without climate change, similar events would only occur about once every 100 years. But today, with 1.3\\xB0C of warming, they are expected about once every 20 years.</p><p>These fire-prone conditions were overall made about 10 times more likely and 22 per cent more intense by climate change.</p><p>Lastly, they looked at extreme northerly winds known as the Etesian winds. They found an increase in the intensity of high-pressure weather systems, like the one that drove the devastating fires. The findings agree with previous research from the region, which shows that these fire-fanning Etesian winds are becoming stronger.</p><p>Europe's blazes risk overwhelming firefighting efforts</p><p>WWA warns that, with hundreds of wildfires occurring at the same time across Europe, firefighting resources are already strained at 1.3\\xB0C of global warming.</p><p>As of 21 August, the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, which coordinates support during emergencies, had been activated 17 times for wildfires this year, including by Greece, Spain, Bulgaria, Montenegro and Albania over the course of just one week.</p><p>The fire season still has weeks to go in Europe, but it is already the continent's worst ever recorded with more than a million hectares burned, says Dr Clair Barnes, researcher at the Centre for Environmental Policy, Imperial College London.</p><p>Spain and Portugal have been the hardest hit, together making up around two-thirds of the EU's total burnt area this year. A sharp increase occurred between 5 and 19 August according to EFFIS data - a period which overlapped with a 16-day heatwave in the Iberian Peninsula.</p><p>Dr Barnes adds that WWA has already started a rapid analysis on the wildfires in Spain, and are expecting to find the fingerprints of climate change there, too.</p><p>As the climate warms, researchers say more countries across Europe will need to tackle wildfires that stretch resources. In some places, they say there is a risk that extreme fires could overwhelm efforts to adapt.</p><p>In T\\xFCrkiye, Greece and Cyprus, warming of 2.6\\xB0C, which is expected under current global climate policies, would see periods of intense hot, dry and windy conditions become nine times more likely and 25 per cent more intense.</p><p>Dr Bikem Ekberzade, researcher at the Eurasia Institute of Earth Sciences, Istanbul Technical University, explains that wildfires in T\\xFCrkiye peaked unexpectedly in June this year, when the season usually falls within the four weeks from mid-July to mid-August.</p><p>Human ignitions were the primary cause, while meteorological conditions - especially high surface wind speeds - contributed to the rapid spread and severity of the fires.</p><p>When vegetation is dry and winds are strong, a single ignition can rapidly turn into a large, hard-to-control wildfire, Dr Ekberzade adds.</p><p>And in a warming world, with more overlap between urban and wildland areas, larger, more severe and fatal fires could soon become the norm.</p><p>Can Europe adapt to increasing wildfire risks?</p><p>The study highlights the need for forward-looking efforts to decrease the risk of wildfires starting and spreading.</p><p>Currently, strategies in T\\xFCrkiye, Greece and Cyprus focus on fire suppression with large forces of firefighters and fleets of water bombing planes and helicopters. Nearly 650 firefighters from 14 different countries were deployed ahead of fire season in high-risk areas.</p><p>Even with hundreds of pre-deployed firefighters, reinforcements from neighbouring countries, and water-dropping planes, the blazes have been devastating, says Maja Vahlberg, technical advisor at the Red Cross and Red Crescent Climate Centre.</p><p>WWA says that while international deployments like this will still be needed, more focus needs to be placed on preventing fires. That includes efforts like improving community fire risk awareness and strategies to manage fuel for blazes, such as removing or altering vegetation.</p><p>The hard work to implement long-term wildfire management strategies that proactively manage fuel availability and empower communities to prepare for wildfires must continue to help keep people safe, Vahlberg adds.</p><p>Source: Euronews</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GM4-37M3-S4GW-73V5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1097\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 1, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp;

(the) majority of the traplines will be affected in a big way,\" said Ron Spence, a trapper from Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation in northern Manitoba.</p><p>\"I'm sure there's portions of my line that are going to be affected.\"</p><p>Roughly 20,000 square kilometres of land have burned this year, considered Manitoba's worst wildfire season in at least 30 years. It's more than double the area from the second-worst season in the province in 2013.</p><p>For trappers who call the land their office, it's a waiting game until they can see how their traplines, equipment and cabins have fared.\u00a0</p><p>Spence, a councillor in the community, oversees a portion of traplines as vice-president of the Manitoba Trappers Association. Aside from Nisichawayasihk, he looks after other areas dealing with fires and evacuations, including Tataskwayak and O-Pipon-Na-Piwin Cree Nations.\u00a0</p><p>His registered trapline, a \"fair size\" horseshoe shape, runs between Nelson House and South Indian Lake.</p><p>Fires to the west and south have threatened portions of the line and a cabin, and flames and smoke mean it will be a while before he can go in and assess any damage.</p><p>\"No one's been able to get out. We were not allowed,\" Spence said.\u00a0</p><p>In Manitoba, there are roughly 900 registered traplines. Some, like Spence's, have been passed down through generations. He can remember being raised on the land by his grandparents.\u00a0</p><p>For many, trapping is their only source of income, with the season typically running from November to May.</p><p>Traplines can vary in size, with some accessible by foot and snowshoe and running 25 to 30 square kilometres. Others stretch more than 1,000 square kilometres, with multiple cabins along them.</p><p>This wildfire season could result in some operations losing hundreds of thousands of dollars, factoring in the destruction of infrastructure, equipment and vehicles like snowmobiles, said Bill Abercrombie, president of the Alberta Trappers Association.\u00a0</p><p>\"There's been some really extreme losses on some of the traplines out in the bush this year,\" he said.</p><p>\"The fires came so fast and so hot and burned huge areas. I know trappers that have just basically lost everything \u2014 trapping families that have been there ...for generations. It's been a very, very tough year.\"</p><p>Abercrombie expects it will take a big effort to get into some of the remote areas in the fall and winter. Access is dependent on creeks and lakes freezing up and, in some cases, bridges and groomed trails have burned.</p><p>Some trappers may have insurance, said Abercrombie, but many can't afford the high premiums.</p><p>His association offers compensation to members, he added, but it's a small amount compared with what total losses could look like.</p><p>There's also the loss of income.</p><p>Spence catches a variety of animals on his trapline: wolves, fishers, minks, lynxes, beavers and martens. The weasel-like martens, popular with Manitoba trappers, can net $50 to $150 for each animal, with one line catching hundreds.</p><p>The Manitoba government said some traplines are likely to be more affected by the fires than others, but the impact has yet to be fully determined. Many furbearer populations are naturally cyclical and have adapted to fire dependent ecosystems, the province added.</p><p>For Indigenous trappers like Spence, trapping is more than an industry. It's a way of life.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's not just a trapline ... we gather medicine, we hunt,\" he said. \u00a0</p><p>Traplines are also a place where Indigenous youth participate in land-based learning that's important to their culture.\u00a0</p><p>It's part of the reason Grand Chief Garrison Settee with Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak, an advocacy group representing some communities in northern Manitoba, would like to see the development of a First Nations disaster financial assistance program.\u00a0</p><p>He said governments need to engage directly with First Nations leadership to ensure emergency policies reflect Indigenous realities and rights.\u00a0</p><p>\"You're not just losing property ... these spaces are there to sustain our way of life. So we need the province to recognize that the traditional harvesting infrastructure is not optional.\"</p><p>Spence can recall a time in the early '80s when his family cabin on the trapline burned. They received some help from the province, and it helped in the long run, he said.</p><p>It's something he would like to see implemented again.</p><p>He compared the loss many trappers will experience this season to what farmers go through with natural disasters.</p><p>A Manitoba government spokesperson said in an email that \"compensation is not available for losses related to trapping ability or infrastructure on registered traplines, as traplines are considered an opportunity for harvest rather than a guarantee of success.\"</p><p>Alberta has assisted trappers in the past, said Abercrombie, and he expects there could be some compensation this year \u2014 but to what extent is unknown.\u00a0</p><p>\"The reality is it's pretty much up to us to take care of our own problems,\" he said.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 23, 2025.\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-d192d0fe82324a25b67c7796890253e1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GK0-Y7D3-RVPX-T1T4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"896\"/><timeReceived>08:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 23, 2025 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

That land mass is the equivalent to the entire state of Rhode Island.</p><p>The four Alaska panelists all mentioned the wildfires in the Interior this summer.</p><p>\"It's very real to us who are living here and smelling the smoke and seeing the fires summer after summer,\" La Belle-Hamer said.</p><p>She discussed her background with satellite imagery and how fire burn maps can inform what future fires would look like.</p><p>\"There's a huge potential that's not being realized at the University of Alaska Fairbanks,\" La Belle-Hamer said.</p><p>By combining the satellite imagery and fire department training at UAF with the science of what has happened in the boreal forest, \"we're actually so much better together,\" La Belle-Hamer said.</p><p>Edward Alexander, who is co-chair of the Gwich'in Council International, said that if a predicted wind event had actually materialized, \"Fairbanks could have easily been evacuated to Anchorage or to Whitehorse.\"</p><p>As of Aug. 1, there are 187 active fires in Alaska, 10 of which are staffed.</p><p>Morten H\u00f8glund, former Arctic ambassador for Norway, is a co-leader of the Arctic Wildland Fires Initiative along with Alexander. The initiative was launched in 2023 by the Norwegian Chairship of the Arctic Council.</p><p>\"We just came to this issue after 65% of our (Gwich'in) homeland ... burned during my lifetime,\" Alexander said Wednesday. \"It's basically equivalent to four states of Delaware on the upper corner of Alaska there, that have burned.\"</p><p>\"Our area has been slightly warmer than the rest of the Circumpolar Arctic by a couple of degrees,\" Alexander said about the Yukon FlatsNational Wildlife Refuge.</p><p>Not all parts of the globe are warming at the same rate. Alexander noted that the Arctic has warmed four times more than the global average.</p><p>Seeing the effects of widespread smoke and fires in the Yukon, Alexander said that he and H\u00f8glund were concerned about what would happen once the rest of the circumpolar boreal forest reached higher temperatures.</p><p>Lizzy Hahn / ADN From left: Morten H\u00f8glund, Edward Alexander and Nettie La Belle-Hamer participate in a panel on wildfires at the 2025 Arctic Encounter Symposium at the Dena'ina Center on Wednesday, July 30, 2025.</p><p>Wildfires in the Arctic have different results compared to wildfires in the Lower 48. Alexander used Alaska and California as an example. In California, wildfires burn down to the soil. Comparatively, in Alaska, the fires burn to the duff - a surface layer that insulates permafrost.</p><p>Permafrost is defined as soil or sediment that remains below 32 degrees Fahrenheit for two or more years. Permafrost contains large amounts of organic carbon, and as it thaws, the carbon that is trapped within the soil is released as a greenhouse gas.</p><p>The boreal forest, according to Alexander, serves as a protective blanket insulating the permafrost under it. When this blanket burns, the permafrost becomes vulnerable to thawing. Once this blanket is removed, there is no way to prevent or reverse the permafrost from thawing.</p><p>Areas in the Arctic contain permafrost whose carbon, when released, \"could be more than ... a small country's entire emissions,\" according to Alexander.</p><p>Last summer, 1.6 million acres of \"permafrost-rich lands\" in the Yukon FlatsNational Wildlife Refuge were moved to a higher fire protection classification. Instead of letting areas burn in the early season, firefighters will manage the fires more closely under the new classification.</p><p>The Yukon Flats spans 8.6 million acres in total.</p><p>Alexander pointed out that this area is \"affecting our future.\" He said that recent fires have burned so intensely on the Yukon Flats that the \"yedoma is collapsing.\" Yedoma is permafrost that formed in the Pleistocene period, which started roughly 2.6 million years ago.</p><p>According to the Woodwell Climate Research Center, where Alexander is a senior Arctic leader, 20% of the permafrost that is vulnerable to thawing is found in Alaska.</p><p>Boots on the ground</p><p>Alexander and fellow panelist Peter Butteri, a retired Alaska statewide fire planner, both worked as wildland firefighters. By partnering with scientists, Butteri said, firefighters are able to increase their effectiveness. Scientists at UAF like La Belle-Hamer look at various maps of the boreal forest, fire burns, scars and fuel maps to better predict fire activity.</p><p>\"We've got long-term researchers ... providing tools that we use on a daily basis,\" said Butteri.</p><p>Alexander sees an opportunity to use a new type of fire management in the state.</p><p>\"As firefighters, we tend to think of things as a chain saw problem or a Pulaski problem,\" Alexander said. \"You can't solve the circumpolar wildland fire crisis with a chain saw or a Pulaski (ax).\"</p><p>Instead, Alexander pointed to how the Gwich'in traditionally kept large wildfires at bay. The Gwich'in practice involves burning off the \"dead sticks and matter on the top\" in the spring, while the ground is still frozen, Alexander said. These mild fires, as Alexander put it, allow for more biodiversity to return, compared to severe fires that lead to widespread damage.</p><p>\"Mama moose has got protein shakes everywhere she goes,\" Alexander said about the plants that come back after mild fires.</p><p>Similarly to mowing a lawn every two weeks, Alexander said that cultural burnings every two years can be used as preventive maintenance.</p><p>\"If all the world's permafrost thawed, I mean, there's no amount of solar panels, or, you know, zero-emission cars or anything like that, that's going to create food security for humans,\" Alexander said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-6186862</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GMW-V1P3-S93K-T216-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1085\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sun Star: University of Alaska Fairbanks</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 1, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Fairbanks</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>AK</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DQ7E</classCode><className>EARTH OBSERVATION SATELLITES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX000365</classCode><className>CONFERENCES &amp;

CivilSure has partnered with the Master Builders Association North (MBA North) to help contractors mitigate risk through its legal advisory and insurance consulting services.Payton notes that risk has changed in recent years, with climate change influencing weather patterns, and failing municipalities and utilities putting construction projects and timelines at risk. Insurance is part of proactive risk management and should be non-negotiable in the construction sector, he says. </p><p> It should be seen as a survival tool for construction contractors of all sizes. He notes that the consequences of being uninsured include legal liability, reputational damage, financial strain, and loss of business continuity; as well as difficulty in securing tenders without appropriate insurance.However, he says:  The devil s in the detail when it comes to contracts like insurance and guarantee contracts, and if you don't know that devil, it's going to catch you unaware. Our main focus is to drive trust and awareness, and to bring all parties together to the understanding of the multiple risks that are now facing building contractors. &lt;h2&gt;Unexpected risks and liabilities&lt;/h2&gt;Payton says too many contractors find themselves liable for the costs of events they were not prepared   or covered   for. It might rain for seven days in a row and take another few days for the site to dry out before work can resume. Projects can be put at risk by urban flooding, and municipal failures might leave contractors without electricity or water for days or weeks. On top of that, theft and petty theft has increased. There is a lot of new risk in the landscape,  he says.Payton cites the example of the National Veld and Forest Fire Act, which makes landowners liable for damages resulting from veld fires that start on or spread from their land. Contractors can also be held liable, as seen in a case where a worker s discarded cigarette in Matjiesfontein sparked a week-long fire that spread as far as Laingsburg, destroying property and livestock and resulting in significant compensation claims.&lt;!--EMBED:<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bizcommunity.com/article/kogae-rainbows-majority-stake-in-boomgate-a-new-era-for-african-security-infrastructure-402819a\">https://www.bizcommunity.com/article/kogae-rainbows-majority-stake-in-boomgate-a-new-era-for-african-security-infrastructure-402819a</url> :EMBED--&gt;Another potential risk contractors overlook is liability as it pertains to security.  We see this all the time   contractors hire security to protect the site and only when something goes wrong do they learn that they are held liable for the security company's actions. You've got to read your security contract. So we say: send us the security contract for review, to help mitigate your risks. Payton also points out that plant equipment is hired under the custody and control of the contractor; therefore, separate Plant Hired-In insurance is required. Contractors should also be aware of their potential liability if their work damages a fibre cable and causes downtime in nearby businesses. Those businesses are going to hold the contractor responsible for their loss of profits and their reduction in revenue. It's the contractor s problem and they need very specialised insurance to cover them,  he says.While most contractors or principals do take out some form of insurance, these policies may not adequately cover them, Payton says.&lt;h2&gt;Penny wise, pound foolish&lt;/h2&gt;Payton says many contractors don t properly assess their risk and ensure that they have the appropriate cover to mitigate it. Some don't believe in insurance and they don't engage with their risk. Sometimes, they simply look for the cheapest insurance product, not understanding their exposure. In other cases, the employer takes out the insurance with policies designed to cover three parties: the employer, the main contractor, and subcontractors.\"This can result in contractors blindly walking into the employer's insurance without knowing what it covers or doesn't cover, and where it leaves them. They don't have sight of that policy and have no idea what the deductible or the excess is   so they end up with insurance that s very expensive when the cover is needed. Ideally, contractors should send a copy of the policy to CivilSure so we can analyse it and advise the contractor where they are at risk.&lt;!--EMBED:<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bizcommunity.com/article/aiim-partners-in-r1bn-black-women-led-infrastructure-initiative-957394a\">https://www.bizcommunity.com/article/aiim-partners-in-r1bn-black-women-led-infrastructure-initiative-957394a</url> :EMBED--&gt; For example, copper remains one of the most targeted materials on construction sites. It is not unusual for petty thieves to cut and pocket a meter of cable at a time. By the time you need to install 250m, you may find only 100 left. While many insurers do provide cover for copper theft, they usually impose strict conditions, cap the limit for this cover or apply high deductibles.\"Loss that occurs gradually over a period of time is typically not covered. Instead, there usually needs to be an identifiable single event, in line with policy conditions such as proof of 24-hour site security. Ultimately, if the policy conditions are not met, the contractor loses money. People buy insurance and they don't engage their risk, so they often lose out when disaster strikes. He emphasises:  In the world of contracting, if you want to keep your margins alive, you have to be awake. You've got to engage with your risk, and that's where you need more than one mind. This is where we come in. We take that risk upon ourselves. In fact, we engage with our clients by saying: You get your quoting right. You have a look at the site risks. But when it comes to contractual readings, send us a copy of the contract. Let us review what your requirements are. Let the guys who work in risk give you the answers on your risk. We welcome the opportunity to work with the MBA North, to help contractors identify their liabilities and reduce the risks associated with insurance, unfair guarantees and other contracts,  Payton concludes.CivilSure will partner with MBA North in future webinars to inform members about hidden risks and liabilities in contracts and insurance, and advise them on how to proactively reduce their risk.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BIZOTH-1260973</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BIZOTH2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GMS-GDC3-RWW1-9215-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">376648</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1081\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Bizcommunity Publishing SA (Pty) Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Other industries)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13295\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 1, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Master Builders Association</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CivilSure</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Dan Payton</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000442</classCode><className>DAMAGES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;

In it, the ministers are expected to approve the declaration of emergency areas affected by the fires that have taken more than 350,000 hectares in just a few weeks, according to data from the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS, for its acronym in English).</p><p><br/>This figure, together with the fires that had already been declared throughout the year and which total more than 411,000 hectares burned in 252 fires so far in 2025, thus sign what has been the worst year in the history of Spain, surpassing by 104,760 hectares the hectares burned in 2022, which had been the worst year to date. To put the figure in magnitude, of the 1,015,024 hectares burned this year in the European Union, 39.6% belong to Spain.<br/>This is a request that some municipalities and regional governments have been asking the Executive to declare an emergency area so that the measures to be taken to try to minimize the effects can be implemented and work can begin as soon as possible to return to normality.<br/>The Government of Castilla y Le\u00f3n and some municipalities of Ourense have been the first to make this request to the Executive, since they have been the areas that have suffered most from the fire -of the 358,034 hectares that have burned throughout the country, 43.6%, about 156,00, belong to Galicia and 41.7%n 149,000 approximately, to Castilla y Le\u00f3n.<br/>Once approved by the Council of Ministers, the Government will have to present a battery of measures aimed at the affected areas. The law establishes that once a catastrophe zone has been declared, \"the State is responsible for repairing the material damage caused by the natural disaster, as well as for the aid that will be made available to both the companies and the citizens affected\".<br/>Among the measures, direct economic aids, compensation to local administrations, aids to individuals, legal entities or companies; or preferential loan lines subsidized by the Official Credit Institute (ICO) -the latter were used with the Dana and with the Covid-19 pandemic- will be implemented. The aid to be granted to individuals who have been affected could exceed 18,000 Euros per applicant -in the most serious cases- and the aid to legal entities could be around 9,200 Euros per firm. In addition, in the event of the destruction of the dwelling, up to 15,120 euros per household could be allocated for new construction. These are the figures that were established in the last fire with a similar magnitude to this summer's, in 2022.<br/>In addition, there are regions, such as Castilla y Le\u00f3n, which are already working on their own measures with the aim of reactivating normality as soon as possible. In the Castile and Leon region, farmers and livestock farmers will be able to access direct aid of 5,500 euros, said the president of the Junta, Alfonso Fern\u00e1ndez Ma\u00f1ueco.<br/>Thus, in order to protect the viability of the farms, the Government of Catilla y Le\u00f3n will compensate, with a compensation, the burned hectares. 18 euros per burned hectare of pasture will be allocated; 130 euros per hectare of herbaceous crops, and 240 euros for woody crops.<br/>And is that farmers and ranchers are one of the hardest hit by the fires. COAG estimates the losses for the sector at more than 600 million euros; and Agroseguro points out the loss of 19,100 hectares of crops due to the fire.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Feij\u00f3o's proposals</emphasis><br/>The leader of the Popular Party, Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o presented yesterday a comprehensive plan with 50 measures against forest fires that he will submit to the Cortes Generales. Among them, he highlighted a national register of arsonists, which will include people convicted in a final sentence for starting fires, who will have to wear telematic bracelets -this is due to the fact that, according to figures from the Ministry of Interior, in the last two and a half months 41 people have been arrested and another 127 are being investigated for starting fires-.<br/>Feij\u00f3o also included among his proposals the professionalization of Civil Protection workers; an increase in aid and no taxes aimed at fire prevention and extinction; and more support for livestock and the rural world.  The leader of the opposition pointed out that the measures respond to three objectives: agile attention to those affected, recovery of environments and jobs destroyed, and guarantees so that \"a tragedy of these dimensions does not happen again\".<br/>Other more concrete proposals include the provision of decent accommodation for the victims or a greater reinforcement of security in the areas temporarily evacuated to prevent theft, the creation of mobile offices to assist the victims, aid for food and other resources for livestock and the replacement of cattle, and the reinforcement of the coverage of telephone networks.<br/>From the local and regional point of view, the Partido Popular proposes the temporary exemption of rates and taxes for the affected towns and companies, exceptional employment programs for the cleaning of mountains, repair and reconstruction of houses; quick incentives for the reopening of businesses to self-employed and SMEs; exception of regional regulation to guarantee the payment of the CAP next year; activation of the RED Mechanism for the industries or companies especially affected, as a way of support and flexibility.<br/>In addition, they propose 100% aid to local corporations to cover the expenses derived from the reconstruction, to present an Addendum to the Recovery and Resilience Plan of the NextGen Funds with a new Fire component and the activation of the RESTORE mechanism to make the use of structural funds more flexible and direct them to the affected people and companies.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-72404980</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GKM-BNV3-RS0P-X4PM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"958\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 26, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX002064</classCode><className>EPIDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp;

Clear combustible material within 20 feet.<br/>The department also offers a Wildfire Ready Neighbors program, which helps communities prepare for wildfires. Such programs are funded by the Legislature, but lawmakers this year made cuts to the state's wildfire prevention and response.<br/>\"We're going to be OK this summer,\" said Dave Upthegrove, commissioner of public lands. \"But the Legislature needs to come back next year and fill that hole, or else we risk threats to public safety.\"<br/>Lawmakers, state leaders and local fire departments all play a role in mitigating the threat of wildfires throughout Washington.

reopened for recreational activities, but a fire ban remains in place.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Larry Davidson and Bonnie Jones own and operate Taxis River Outfitters in Boiestown, a rural community of Upper Miramichi, about\u00a060 kilometres northeast of Fredericton.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's their full-time jobs and they live at their lodge.</p><p>The fire restrictions haven't affected them too badly, so far, said Davidson.</p><p>But bear hunting season is set to begin Sept.1 and some of the land they normally hunt on remains closed.</p><p/><p>\"We lease some ground from a private landowner and we're still on full restrictions with that,\" he said.</p><p>Davidson finds it reasonable to be taking precautions, given how dry things are, but he's afraid he may lose some clients and income.</p><p>He hoped weekend rain would improve the situation.</p><p>'They're monitoring the forest pretty good'</p><p>Everyone has been doing their part to protect the forest, said Davidson.</p><p>He was in the woods Thursday doing some bear baiting and a few surveillance flights passed overhead.</p><p>\"They're monitoring the forest pretty good,\" he said.</p><p>He'd like to see lots more rain before the end of September, which is when moose hunting season takes place.</p><p>\"That is a big event - a big money raiser for the province, so let's hope that goes through for God sakes.\"</p><p>\"A lot of people depend on this for their livelihood.\"</p><p>The federal fisheries department has also reopened some Miramichi salmon pools, he noted, adding that his lodge doesn't fish at this time of year anyway because the water is usually too low and he is otherwise occupied.</p><p/><p>James Donald runs the online communities Paddling NB and Hiking NB.</p><p>He said he's never seen the water level in the Miramichi so low.</p><p>The woods ban caused Donald to alter some planned excursions, but he found plenty of coastal areas to explore, like hiking Dennis Beach between Alma and Cape Enrage, and kayaking in the Bay of Fundy.\u00a0</p><p>\"If you're creative you can find places to get out in nature without going into the woods,\" he said.</p><p>Former steamboat stops along the St. John/Wolastoq River are awesome launch sites for paddling, added Donald.</p><p>Donald said he felt bad for travellers whose plans for big hikes like the Fundy or Nepisiguit Mi'kmaq trail were upended, but he understood the need.</p><p>\"You might not be the one lighting fires, but the more people out there the more risk of fires just in general.\"</p><p>He and his wife came upon a forest fire on a hillside while hiking the Nepisiguit trail a couple of years ago.</p><p>He estimated it was about 16 metres in diameter.</p><p>They used their dry bags to haul water up from the river to put it out, he recounted, and they reported it to the Department of Natural Resources.</p><p>He guessed it was caused by a discarded cigarette, as there was no campsite around.</p><p>\"If people are getting out, even though the fire ban's on, just be very careful,\" he advised.</p><p>\"Don't light any kind of fire even the little cook stoves and stuff, I'd stay away from.\"</p><p>\"You don't want to be the one to start a fire,\" he said.</p><p>Major fires still a mystery</p><p>It's been about three weeks since the start of the worst two wildfires New Brunswick has seen so far this season, and there is still no official determination of the cause of either of them.</p><p>Speaking to reporters on Aug. 20, fire behaviour specialist Danny Goddard said, \"Our ignitions before, in Irishtown, the Oldfield Road, those were human-caused ignitions.\"</p><p>When prompted to elaborate, however, Goddard was less definitive.</p><p>\"There was no lightning,\" he said. \"I can't really say it was human started, but it definitely wasn't started by lightning.\"</p><p>Natural Resources Minister John Herron acknowledged on Aug. 26 that the public is keen for answers.</p><p>\"I know those are the ones that clearly have the most interest,\" he said, referring to the Oldfield Road and Irishtown area fires.</p><p>The Oldfield Road fire has been the largest so far this season at 1,403\u00a0hectares, but it is now considered under control.</p><p>3 fires out of control</p><p>The three\u00a0still considered out of control are the\u00a0Beaver Lake Stream fire, which has grown to\u00a0456 hectares, and two that were just listed as out of control on Friday -\u00a0fire 310 in the eastern part of the province near Rogersville at 0.1 hectare\u00a0and the Portage fire\u00a0at 0.3\u00a0hectares.</p><p>\"I'm as eager to know about what the cause of the fires was as I think all New Brunswickers are,\" Herron said.</p><p>\"I'm looking forward to sharing all that information with New Brunswickers once that becomes apparent,\" he said.</p><p>\"The folks at EMO [Emergency Measures Organization], our boots on the ground from DNR and the Fire Protection Unit that we have within the Department of Natural Resources,\" are the ones investigating.</p><p>Herron anticipated the work would \"take a bit of time.\"</p><p>89 tickets issued</p><p>CBC\u00a0News requested an update on the investigations from the department Friday.</p><p>A spokesperson for the Department of Public Safety responded by email that the cause of the fires is still under investigation and the department can't comment further.</p><p>Jadesola Emmanuel added that conservation officers have issued 92 warnings and written 89 tickets related to Forest Fires Act violations so far this year.</p><p>The infractions included having a fire on a non-burn day, leaving a fire unattended and an industrial operation not having a permit, said Emmanuel.\u00a0</p><p>Twelve tickets were issued for unauthorized access to Crown land, she said.</p><p>In terms of anything potentially criminal, New Brunswick RCMP spokesperson Matt Leblanc-Smith said the Mounties have not issued any tickets or conducted any investigations related to wildfires in the province this summer.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Authorities from Minnesota to Maine have ordered air quality alerts, according to the Storm Prediction Center.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The impact from the fires isn't as dramatic as the wildfires of 2023 that left New York City blanketed in a moonglow orange.</p><p>But weak winds have left the smoke to linger over the northern United States for days, said Dan Cornish, a forecaster with the National Weather Service in Michigan.</p><p>\"We're definitely seeing prolonged impact. We've had several days of hazy skies,\" Cornish told USA TODAY, adding the horizon outside the weather service office in Gaylord, Michigan, has been a \"milky gray\" for days. \"Unfortunately, that's just going to continue to deteriorate air quality across much of this area.\"</p><p>Storm Prediction Center alert maps show blanket air quality warnings for Michigan, Wisconsin, New York and the New England region.</p><p>Stronger winds aren't expected to displace the smoke until Aug. 6 or Aug. 7 for the Midwest, Cornish said, but conditions in the Northeast probably will improve by the end of the week.</p><p>Authorities recommend limiting outdoor activity in the areas with poor air quality.</p><p>Children, older adults and people suffering from respiratory conditions, including asthma, are particularly vulnerable to the fine particulate matter small enough to be inhaled that is the toxic byproduct of wildfires, environmental officials warned.</p><p>Where are the wildfires in Canada?</p><p>The worst of the blazes affecting the United States are in the provinces of Saskatchewan, Manitoba and western Ontario, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center. Most of the Canadian blazes are sparked by lightning in dry, remote forested areas that are difficult for firefighters to access except by aircraft, Cornish said.</p><p>\"You get a lot of wildfires that can start up in those conditions, and it's a challenge, but that's the nature of it, quite literally,\" Cornish said. \"There's nothing you can do to prevent it.\"</p><p>What cities are the worst off?</p><p>The blazes have catapulted major American and Canadian cities into the most polluted places in the world, according to a global air-quality index maintained by IQAir, a Swiss-based air quality monitoring company.</p><p>Detroit, Minneapolis and Toronto were among the top 11 most polluted cities in the world on the evening of Aug. 4, according to IQAir. New York City and Montreal were among the top 20 most polluted cities, according to the global index.</p><p>Side effects of inhaling</p><p>wildfire smoke</p><p>Wildfire smoke can irritate the eyes, nose and throat and cause the following symptoms:</p><p>Coughing</p><p>Chest tightness</p><p>Shortness of breath</p><p>Dizziness</p><p>Fatigue</p><p>Particulate matter (PM) is one of the main components of wildfire smoke, comprising small particles of solids or liquids suspended in the air, USA TODAY has reported.</p><p>According to Yale Medicine, the particles can be 10 micrometers, PM 10, or as small as 2.5 micrometers, PM 2.5, which can easily pass through a person's usual defense mechanisms and can \"penetrate deep into the lungs, where they can impair lung function, cause illnesses, such as bronchitis, and increase asthma attacks.\"</p><p>According to Yale Medicine, exposure to PM 2.5 particles can cause:</p><p>Heart attack</p><p>Stroke</p><p>Lung cancer</p><p>Decline in cognitive function</p><p>Contributing: Julia Gomez</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>An aerial view shows smoke from Canadian wildfires dimming the city's skyline in Chicago earlier this year.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Scott Olson/Getty Images</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USATDY-usa3122294221</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USATDY2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GF5-KR93-RRKS-B2MX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8213</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"596\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 USA Today All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>USA Today</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 6, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX000125</classCode><className>ASTHMA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N924120QC</classCode><className>OCEANOGRAPHIC &amp;

They've warned that the smoke is hurting relations between the countries and suggested the U.S. could make it an issue in tariff talks.<br/>But what they haven't done is acknowledge the role of climate change - a glaring and shortsighted omission, according to climate scientists. It also ignores the outsized U.S. contribution to heat-trapping gases from burning fossil fuels like coal and gas that cause more intense heat waves and droughts, which in turn set the stage for more destructive wildfires, scientists say.<br/>\"If anything, Canada should be blaming the U.S. for their increased fires,\" said Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Cape Cod, Mass.<br/>'International challenges'<br/>On Tuesday, the Canadian government announced almost $46 million in funding for wildfire prevention and risk-assessment research projects. But Corey Hogan, parliamentary secretary to the federal energy and natural resources minister, said international cooperation is needed.<br/>\"There's no people that want to do more about wildfires than Canadians,\" Hogan said. \"But I think this also underlines the international challenges that are brought on by climate change.   We need to globally tackle this problem.\"<br/>Canada has \"been fighting wildfires in this country at unprecedented rates since 2023,\" when it saw its largest wildfire on record, said Ken McMullen, president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs. This year's first fire started in April, one of the earliest on record, and 2025 is now the second-worst year.<br/>As of Thursday, more than 700 wildfires were burning across the country, two-thirds of them out of control, with more than 28,000 square miles burned in 4,400 wildfires so far this year, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. That's almost five times the surface area that's burned so far in the United States this year. Most wildfires are started by people, sometimes on purpose but mostly by mistake, though McMullen said lightning is the culprit in many of Canada's fires, especially in remote areas.<br/>McMullen said he has no interest in debating the role of climate change, but data show that something has changed. Sloughs and basins have dried up and water that once lapped at people's back doors in Canada's lake communities now is often hundreds of feet away.<br/>\"People can make up their own mind as to why that is,\" he said. \"But something clearly has changed.\"<br/>President Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax - a belief echoed by many in the GOP - and his administration has worked to dismantle and defund federal climate science and data collection, with little pushback from Republicans in Congress.<br/>He has proposed revoking the scientific finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare - the central basis for U.S. climate change action. He has declared a national energy emergency to expedite fossil fuel development, canceled grants for renewable energy projects and ordered the U.S. to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, aimed at limiting long-term global warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above preindustrial levels.<br/>Minnesota state Rep. Elliott Engen, a Republican, said he believes in climate change but now is not the time to discuss it \"because we have folks with asthma who aren't able to go outside the entirety of the summer.\"<br/>\"That's not an immediate fix for my constituents; that sounds like a blame game without a solution being presented,\" Engen said.\u00a0\u00a0The following fields overflowed: REFERENCE = 08-15 A11 Wildfire-Smoke-Politics_A11<br/></pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COLMBN-8606467</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COLMBN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GT6-TFX3-RRNB-34YC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">145264</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"732\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Columbian Publishing Co.

They've warned that the smoke is hurting relations between the countries and suggested the U.S. could make it an issue in tariff talks.<br/>But what they haven't done is acknowledge the role of climate change - a glaring and shortsighted omission, according to climate scientists. It also ignores the outsized U.S. contribution to heat-trapping gases from burning fossil fuels like coal and gas that cause more intense heat waves and droughts, which in turn set the stage for more destructive wildfires, scientists say.<br/>\"If anything, Canada should be blaming the U.S. for their increased fires,\" said Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Cape Cod, Mass.<br/>'International challenges'<br/>On Tuesday, the Canadian government announced almost $46 million in funding for wildfire prevention and risk-assessment research projects. But Corey Hogan, parliamentary secretary to the federal energy and natural resources minister, said international cooperation is needed.<br/>\"There's no people that want to do more about wildfires than Canadians,\" Hogan said. \"But I think this also underlines the international challenges that are brought on by climate change.   We need to globally tackle this problem.\"<br/>Canada has \"been fighting wildfires in this country at unprecedented rates since 2023,\" when it saw its largest wildfire on record, said Ken McMullen, president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs. This year's first fire started in April, one of the earliest on record, and 2025 is now the second-worst year.<br/>As of Thursday, more than 700 wildfires were burning across the country, two-thirds of them out of control, with more than 28,000 square miles burned in 4,400 wildfires so far this year, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. That's almost five times the surface area that's burned so far in the United States this year. Most wildfires are started by people, sometimes on purpose but mostly by mistake, though McMullen said lightning is the culprit in many of Canada's fires, especially in remote areas.<br/>McMullen said he has no interest in debating the role of climate change, but data show that something has changed. Sloughs and basins have dried up and water that once lapped at people's back doors in Canada's lake communities now is often hundreds of feet away.<br/>\"People can make up their own mind as to why that is,\" he said. \"But something clearly has changed.\"<br/>President Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax - a belief echoed by many in the GOP - and his administration has worked to dismantle and defund federal climate science and data collection, with little pushback from Republicans in Congress.<br/>He has proposed revoking the scientific finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare - the central basis for U.S. climate change action. He has declared a national energy emergency to expedite fossil fuel development, canceled grants for renewable energy projects and ordered the U.S. to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, aimed at limiting long-term global warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above preindustrial levels.<br/>Minnesota state Rep. Elliott Engen, a Republican, said he believes in climate change but now is not the time to discuss it \"because we have folks with asthma who aren't able to go outside the entirety of the summer.\"<br/>\"That's not an immediate fix for my constituents; that sounds like a blame game without a solution being presented,\" Engen said.\u00a0\u00a0The following fields overflowed: REFERENCE = 08-15 A11 Wildfire-Smoke-Politics_A11<br/></pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COLMBN-8606201</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COLMBN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GT6-TFX3-RRNB-34VV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">145264</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"732\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Columbian Publishing Co.

Dick Durbin issued the following press release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WASHINGTON - U.S. Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) today reintroduced the Climate Change Resiliency Fund for America Act, which would authorize the U.S. Department of Treasury to issue from $200 million to $1 billion in state and local tax-exempt \"climate bonds\" annually for any American to purchase and contribute to the effort to address the impacts of climate change. Inspired by the national war bond program during World War II, these bonds would fund a new \"Climate Change Resiliency Fund,\" to be administered by the Department of Commerce, for grants to finance climate resilient infrastructure projects to shore up the nation against extreme weather events like flash flooding, tornados, wildfires, and heat waves as these disasters increase in number and intensity across the country.</p><p>\"We're seeing the impacts of climate change in real time as severe floods, uncontrollable wildfires, and extreme temperatures sweep across the country. We must address this existential threat through a coordinated national strategy, and soon,\" said Durbin. \"Today, I'm reintroducing the Climate Change Resiliency Fund for America Act to offer the sale of 'climate bonds' to fund climate resiliency projects in front-line and environmental justice communities that experience disproportionate impacts from the crisis.\"</p><p>In addition to issuing \"climate bonds,\" the Climate Change Resiliency Fund for America Act would create a bipartisan Climate Change Advisory Commission of 11 members appointed by the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the President to establish program requirements and vet and approve the projects financed by the Climate Change Resiliency Fund.</p><p>Climate resiliency projects would be determined by the Commission, and could include projects such as flood control, structural fortification, forest fire prevention, climate-smart agricultural practices, and cooling centers, among others. They also could include improvements to the supply chain and water security.</p><p>Eligible grant recipients include federal agencies and state and local governments, including utilities, tribes, transit groups, nonprofits, coalitions, public authorities, or other organizations as determined by the Secretary of Commerce. Most projects would require a 25 percent nonfederal match, but the Secretary would have authority to waive match requirements in disadvantaged communities. A portion of the fund would be set aside specifically for projects that will not require a match.</p><p>-30-</p><p>(Category: News Release; Media Release; Announcement; Press Briefing; Remarks; Congressional Documents; Court Order; Court Judgement; Judgment; Court Opinion; Federal Government; Local Government; State Government; Speech; Transcript, Notice, Notification) For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:contentservices@htdigital.in\">contentservices@htdigital.in</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USFDNW-PR5125593</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USFDNW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GC6-YR23-RRSD-X403-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">282801</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"493\"/><timeReceived>12:31 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 HT Media Ltd.

The Central Government supplements the efforts of the State Governments and provides requisite logistics and financial support. There are well established institutional mechanisms at the National, State and District levels in the country for taking appropriate preparedness, mitigation and prompt response measures for effective management of natural disasters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Central Government has taken several initiatives to ensure effective mitigation measures in the country to reduce risks during disasters by strengthening the disaster risk reduction system in India. In this direction, important initiatives taken and important projects approved by Central Government are as under: -</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The National Landslide Risk Mitigation project with a total financial outlay of Rs. 1000 crore for its implementation in fifteen (15) States, with Central Share from NDMF of Rs. 900 Crore. These 15 States are Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttarakhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. So far, an amount of Rs. 4.54 crore is released to the State of Uttarakhand.</p><p>Prior to this, in 2019, Government had approved Landslide Risk Mitigation Scheme (LRMS) for four (04) States viz. Sikkim, Mizoram, Nagaland and Uttarakhand with central assistance Rs. 43.91 Crore. The major outcomes of the scheme include landslide mitigation, real time monitoring, awareness programmes and capacity building and training.</p><p>Geological Survey of India (GSI) has established the National Landslide Forecasting Centre (NLFC) at Kolkata to cater to the real-time integration of diverse input data from multiple sources like Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF), National Remote sensing Centre (NRSC) for forecasting and dissemination of the landslide early warning bulletins through dedicated means including Bhusanket web portal and Bhooskhalan mobile app, etc.</p><p>To reduce the risk of landslides, GSI developed a prototype regional Landslide Early Warning System (LEWS) for India in collaboration with the British Geological Survey (BGS). The evaluation and testing of the model in three districts in India viz. Darjeeling and Kalimpong districts of West Bengal and Nilgiri district of Tamil Nadu has been initiated.</p><p>GSI has been providing experimental landslide forecast bulletins in 18 districts in six other states, in collaboration with various stakeholders like Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF), National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) and all concerned State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs). These bulletins have forecast information up to the taluk / sub-divisional level.</p><p>Urban Flood Risk Mitigation Projects in seven (07) cities viz. Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai and Pune at a total financial outlay of Rs. 3075.65 crore. Central Share from NDMF is Rs 2482.62 Crore. So far, an amount of Rs. 709.54 Crore is released to these seven cities.</p><p>National GLOF Risk Management Programme with a total financial outlay of Rs. 150 crore for its implementation in four (04) States viz. Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim and Uttarakhand. Central Share from NDMF is Rs. 135 Crore and so far, an amount of Rs. 27.73 Crore is released.</p><p>Catalytic assistance for twelve (12) drought prone States at a total financial outlay of Rs. 2022.16 crore, out of which, Central share from NDMF is Rs. 1200 crore. These 12 states are Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh.</p><p>Mitigation Project on Lightning Safety at a total financial outlay of Rs. 186.78 crore for ten (10) States viz.

According to news reporting from Prague, Czech Republic, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Wildfires are a growing environmental concern due to rapid population growth, urbanization, and human activities, which contribute to climate change, causing wildfires that damage ecosystems and the environment. Wildfires destroy the vegetation cover, habitat of habitants and cause soil deterioration by changing the soil structure.\" </p><p><br/> Financial support for this research came from Czech University of Life Sciences Prague. <br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague, \"In addition, toxic gases released into the atmosphere during fires threaten the lives of habitants. The effects of the forest fire that occurred on 19th September 2024 around Capilla del Monte in the Punilla Valley were analyzed using spectral indices. Landsat-9 data were used to detect changes in vegetation cover, land surface temperature (LST), and soil moisture by comparing the pre- and post-fire satellite images, while Sentinel-5P TROPOMI satellite data were used to extract the concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) gases. Overall accuracy of the LST was found using a reference data MODIS daily LST, and a positive correlation (r = 0.94) found between the two datasets. In addition, the burned areas were estimated using the dNBR index as well as random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) classification methods. The results showed that vegetation cover increased by 35%, the average soil moisture decreased by approximately 16%, and the average LST increased by 9.5% from October 2023 to November 2024 in the region. The burned area was estimated as 387.9 km using dNBR, while it was 392.4 km by RF and 389.5 km by SVM in the study area.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The study found high NO and CO concentrations after the Punilla Valley fire, threatening inhabitants.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Assessing the environmental impacts of the Capilla del Monte wildfire in Punilla Valley of Argentina using Landsat-9 and Sentinel-5P.

The Roughriders have yet to lose a road game, haven't given up a touchdown in their last two games and have recorded 16 sacks over their last three.</p><p>\"Feels good to be eight and one, you know? Want to leave here nine and one,\" said Roughriders defensive tackle Mike Rose, who was a Stampeder for seven years before he was released and signed with Saskatchewan in February.</p><p>The Roughriders' meagre output on the ground in Regina was a hiccup as Saskatchewan's average 110 rushing yards per game ranks third in the league behind Calgary (115.7) and Winnipeg (112.8).</p><p>\"Establishing the run for every team is important,\" Roughriders quarterback Trevor Harris said. \"It makes everything better. You can stay on the football field, stay ahead of the chains, you can keep your defence off the field and get them rested.\"</p><p>The Roughriders' defence tops the league at an average 69.1 rushing yards against per game, and a league-low 135 rush attempts.\u00a0</p><p>Saskatchewan's 5.9 average yards against on first downs is second only to Calgary's 5.8.</p><p>So springing Calgary running back Dedrick Mills, coming off a season-high 105 yards in his last game, and Saskatchewan counterpart A.J. Ouellette is a subplot Saturday.</p><p>\"Both teams feel like they're at their best if they can run downhill on their opponent, but you decide what's working and you try to call the game to win the game,\" Stampeders head coach and general manager Dave Dickenson said. \"But yeah, it's easier on quarterback play, it certainly is, if you have a running game.</p><p>\"They've got a great scheme and system as far as their run game. Ouellette and their running backs are good players, strong, but can make you miss. I think we've got the same thing with our running backs, so it's going to be a challenge.\"</p><p>Mills, with 660 rushing yards and a league-leading seven touchdowns, and Ouellette (648 yards) are both chasing leader James Butler of the B.C. Lions at 785.</p><p>\"I am ready to come out pounding,\" said Mills, who rushed for 85 yards in Regina.</p><p>If teams are tied in points at the end of the regular season, the greater number of total wins is the first tiebreaker followed by the team with the higher winning percentage in all games played against the other tied clubs.</p><p>So after securing the season series (3-0) against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, the Stampeders want a sweep of their two regular-season games against Saskatchewan to also hold that card come playoff time in November.</p><p>\"When you grow up and you love football as much as I do, as much as some of these guys do, you crave and you look forward to a game as competitive as this because you know how important it is for the standings and how important is for the city and also for our team to prove how good we want to be,\" Coker said.\u00a0</p><p>\"This could potentially be the West final, so we have to take games like this seriously.\"</p><p>Calgary is coming off a bye week after a 28-27 win over the Blue Bombers decided by a Rene Paredes 40-yard field goal on the final play of the game.</p><p>The Roughriders thumped the Hamilton Tiger-Cats 29-9 last week when Harris threw for 307 yards and three touchdowns.</p><p>IN AND OUT</p><p>Calgary's bye week reaped limited benefits. Damien Alford, who has five touchdowns in six games, will play after sitting out a game and three quarters. He injured his hamstring in the first quarter of a 23-21 loss to the Montreal Alouettes on July 24. But the Stampeders will be minus wideouts Tevin Jones (illness) and Dominique Rhymes (quad). Roughriders defensive back Marcus Sayles is said to be a game-time decision.</p><p>KICKING INSURANCE</p><p>The Roughriders signed kicker Campbell Fair this week. Veteran Brett Lauther is 22-for-33 in field goals this season for an average of 66.7, but he will start Saturday.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 22, 2025.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-0a3cd417cd914e33b0eac81903c239d5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GJS-YF23-RTHY-N4TP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"796\"/><timeReceived>06:49 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 22, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The Company has three divisions: a Platinum Group Element division, a Lithium/Rare Element division, an Antimony-Gold Division as well as an investment in <url normalizedValue=\"https://metalquestmining.com\">https://metalquestmining.com</url>/ high purity Lac Otelnuk Iron Ore Project.</p><p>The PGE Division includes the 100% owned, multi-million-ounce, district-scale River Valley Project, one of North America's largest undeveloped Platinum Group Element Projects, situated 100 km by road east of Sudbury, Ontario. In addition to River Valley, NAM owns 100% of the Genesis PGE-Cu-Ni Project in Alaska.</p><p>The Company's Lithium Division is one of the largest mineral claim holders in the Winnipeg River Pegmatite Field, where the Company is exploring hard rock lithium and various rare elements such as tantalum, rubidium, and cesium. NAM is developing its lithium division in conjunction with its Farm-in/Joint Venture agreement with Mineral Resources Ltd. (\"MinRes\"), one of the world's largest lithium producers. A minimum budget to maintain the Projects has been approved by Mineral Resources Ltd for May 2025 to April 2026. The Companies agreed to the minimum budget due to current lithium pricing and forest fire dangers in the immediate area</p><p>In April 2024, a $1.5M NSERC Alliance grant was awarded to a collaboration led by the University of Manitoba (Drs. Fayek and Camacho), with academic partners from Lakehead University (Dr. Hollings) and industry partners including New Age Metals and Grid Metals. This research is focused on advancing Canada's critical metals sector, with New Age Metals' portion targeting its Bird River lithium properties. Approximately $107,000 of work is planned on New Age's properties in 2025. The early work will include core sampling and field visits starting this summer. The project will likely extend beyond the original 3-year term, due to its delayed start.</p><p>New Age Metals Inc. is supporting a successful $180K Mitacs research grant, awarded in 2023, through its $90K contribution (already accounted for and paid under the Mineral Resources joint venture). This academic partnership with the University of New Brunswick and the University of British Columbia is focused on understanding the origin and controls of lithium pegmatite mineralization in the Cat Lake-Winnipeg River field. Fieldwork for the MSc. thesis has been completed, while the post-doctoral phase is ongoing at UNB. This collaboration provides access to top-tier scientific expertise and equipment, significantly reducing analysis costs and adding long-term value to the project.</p><p>NAM's Antimony-Gold division is in Newfoundland and spans over 19,800 hectares consisting of 11 non-contiguous properties. Six of these properties are in St. Alban's area, along Canstar's Swanger and Little River mineralized trends. The remaining 5 properties are strategically located along the same geological trend as the past-producing Beaver Brook Antimony Mine and in proximity to New Found Gold's Queensway South Gold Project. Management has recently completed Phase 1 of the Project, Phase 2 has been initiated, and further news will follow. On July 30th, the Company was pleased to announce that it has received formal approval under Newfoundland and Labrador's Junior Exploration Assistance (JEA) Program, including eligibility for the Critical Minerals Assistance (CMA) and Provincial Critical Mineral Assistance (PCMA) streams. The potential rebate total for eligible exploration activities is $71,975.</p><p>On August 6, 2025, New Age Metals announced an additional investment in a 4th critical metal. NAM currently owns approximately 12.79% and holds warrants that, if exercised with today's issued and outstanding shares of MQM, would bring NAM to a 19.05% interest in MetalQuest Mining inc.</p><p>MetalQuest Mining inc. is developing one of North Americas largest iron ore projects, where approximately $120 million has been spent on the project. For more information, <url normalizedValue=\"https://metalquestmining.com\">https://metalquestmining.com</url>/ . High-purity iron ore became a critical metal Federally in Canada and in the Provinces of Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador in 2024. In the summer of 2025, MQM has contracted AtkinsRealis, an international engineering company, to complete a GAP Analysis on the Lac Otelnuk Project and its 2015 Feasibility Study.</p><p>Management is currently aggressively seeking new mineral acquisition opportunities on an international scale. Our philosophy is to be a project generator with the objective of optioning our projects with major and junior mining companies through to production</p><p>The Company is actively seeking an option/joint venture partner for our and its road-accessible Genesis PGE-Cu-Ni Project in Alaska.</p><p>Investors are invited to visit the New Age Metals website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.newagemetals.com\">www.newagemetals.com</url> where they can review the company and its corporate activities.

Its core business activities center on sustainable forest management, timber harvesting, and the production of wood products. The company''s largest sources of revenue come from its Timberlands segment, which includes the sale of logs and timber, and its Wood Products segment, which manufactures and distributes lumber, engineered wood, and other building materials primarily for residential and commercial construction. Additionally, Weyerhaeuser operates a Real Estate, Energy, and Natural Resources segment, focusing on land sales and renewable energy opportunities. Among its business lines, the Wood Products segment has shown notable growth, driven by strong demand in the housing and construction markets. With a commitment to environmental stewardship, Weyerhaeuser continues to balance profitability with sustainable practices across its extensive land holdings. It is the NYSE's 5th largest Building materials &amp; fixtures company by market capitalisation.</p><p>In FY 2024, the top earner of Revenue was WOOD PRODUCTS [68%] followed by TIMBERLANDS [26.9%] at Rank 2  and REAL ESTATE &amp; ENR [5.1%] at Rank 3. In FY 2024, revenue growth was highest in REAL ESTATE &amp; ENR [7.7%] .</p><p>Weyerhaeuser Company has consistently demonstrated its commitment to sustainable forestry and community development through strategic investments and philanthropic efforts. Recently, Weyerhaeuser made headlines with its land donation for the Row River wildfire substation, exemplifying its leadership in wildfire protection and emergency services partnerships. This initiative underscores Weyerhaeuser's dedication to wildfire mitigation and response infrastructure, crucial in safeguarding forests and nearby communities.</p><p>In West Virginia, Weyerhaeuser's investment strategy is robust, epitomized by a $1 million community investment in Buckhannon. This investment is set to bolster rural economic development and enhance Weyerhaeuser's community grants and support efforts. Highlighting its philanthropic endeavors, Weyerhaeuser's charitable giving focuses on corporate social responsibility, revered by the Buckhannon community for fostering sustainable forestry.</p><p>Through such initiatives, including timberland and forestland donations, Weyerhaeuser maintains a steadfast commitment to land stewardship, enhancing community resilience, and ensuring a sustainable future for generations.

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply. However, additional mill capacity being added in the U.S.</p><p>Press Release article 10 of 10, Source: WEC, 76 words </p><p>November 13 2024: Weyerhaeuser quarterly dividends steady</p><p>Weyerhaeuser today announced a quarterly dividend of 20.0c per share for Q3/2024; unchanged from the previous quarter (Q2/2024) dividend of 20.0c.

Total dividends per share paid in the 12 months ended November 14 were 79.0c.</p><p>SECTION 5 WEYERHAEUSER 10-Q: 12 CONSEQUENTIAL MANAGEMENT DECISIONS</p><p>Strategic Expansion of Engineered Wood Products Capacity</p><p>Management has committed $500 million to constructing a new TimberStrand facility in Monticello, Arkansas, beginning in 2025, with operations expected by 2027. This investment is projected to expand engineered wood products capacity by 10 million cubic feet, positioning Weyerhaeuser to seize greater market share in the growing housing sector. While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.</p><p>Shareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program</p><p>Following completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.</p><p>Maintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges</p><p>Weyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.</p><p>Strengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility</p><p>The company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.</p><p>Capital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing</p><p>Management refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.</p><p>Focused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency</p><p>Excluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.</p><p>Expansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth</p><p>Weyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.</p><p>Unlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures</p><p>The announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.</p><p>Timberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base</p><p>Management advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.</p><p>Operational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures</p><p>Initiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.</p><p>Proactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities</p><p>Reserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties. By maintaining adequate coverage for contingent liabilities, Weyerhaeuser bolsters its balance sheet resilience. However, potential over-reserving may tie up capital unnecessarily and requires vigilant management assessment.</p><p>Prioritizing Workforce Stability Amid Labor Market Tightness</p><p>Recognizing a 4.1% unemployment rate as a constraint, Weyerhaeuser focused on hiring and talent retention across its segments. Stability in workforce availability ensures operational continuity and supports management's strategic initiatives. However, rising labor costs remain a potential margin-pressure risk-a critical area to monitor for sustained profitability.</p><p>Source: Weyerhaeuser's, 10-Q filing dated July 25, 2025, available at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/106535/000095017025098794/wy-20250630.htm\">https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/106535/000095017025098794/wy-20250630.htm</url> and Weyerhaeuser's website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.weyerhaeuser.com/\">https://investor.weyerhaeuser.com/</url>.</p><p>SECTION 6 TODAY'S BEARISH SIGNALS</p><p>Price/Earnings of 63.8 &gt; Building Materials &amp; Fixtures sector (of 24 stocks) avg of 28.6:</p><p>- The price-to-earnings ratio of 63.8 indicates overvaluation compared with sector average of 28.6 and market average of 13.1.</p><p>6.1 Rank in the bottom 23% by Relative Valuation in the NYSE market</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_8\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"280\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"104\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"232\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Description</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Value</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Rank</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">P/E * P/NTA</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">114.86</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">In Bottom 23%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Earnings Yield %</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1.6</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">In Bottom 10%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Price/Earnings</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">63.8</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">In Bottom 4%</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>6.2 Rank in the bottom 21% by Price Performance in the NYSE market</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_9\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"296\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"232\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Description</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Value</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Rank</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Price/MAP50</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.94</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">In Bottom 21%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">PV1000 [1 yr] $</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">785</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">In Bottom 17%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Rel Strength 6 mo</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">15</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">In Bottom 14%</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>6.3 Downtrend</p><p>Beta &lt; 1 combined with price fall.

Much of central and coastal Maine is at VERY HIGH fire danger.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Burn Permit Moratorium Enacted to Reduce Risk</p><p>Augusta, Maine - The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's (DACF) Maine Forest Service (MFS) is urging all residents and visitors to take immediate precautions as wildfire danger remains elevated across the state. Much of central and coastal Maine is at VERY HIGH fire danger.</p><p>Wildfire Activity Snapshot (2025 to Date):</p><p>Year-to-Date: 525 fires, 406.5 acres burned</p><p>August 1-Present: 124 fires, 70.8 acres burned</p><p>Last 7 Days: 70 fires, 55.6 acres burned</p><p>Last 3 Days: 32 fires, 17 acres burned</p><p>Leading Causes for August Fires:</p><p>Campfire-related incidents</p><p>Debris and open burning</p><p>Equipment malfunctions</p><p>Current Active Fires:</p><p>Hardwood Valley Fire (Spencer Bay Township/Roach River): 3 acres. A containment line is being built with heavy equipment.</p><p>Lake Onawa (Elliottsville Township): 4.3 acres. Mop-up operations continue</p><p>Track Road Fire (Baileyville): 30 acres. Containment line around the entire perimeter, mop-up operations continue.</p><p>Acton Fire (Acton): 8 acres. Very rocky conditions, mop up continues, fire department and firefighters will likely be on scene for the next two days.</p><p>Many recent fires have been kept small thanks to quick responses by all levels of Maine's fire services, including MFS, and quick reporting by keen observers. Despite some favorable conditions like higher relative humidity and light winds, fuels remain dry, and the statewide wildfire risk will continue as long as precipitation remains scarce.</p><p>Wildfire Preparedness Actions by MFS</p><p>Burn Permit Moratorium in Effect: The Maine Forest Service has temporarily suspended issuing any new burn permits to reduce the risk from escaped burns, a leading cause of wildfires in Maine. The state's online system is shut down until conditions improve, and local Town Wardens are encouraged to withhold written burn permits until conditions improve.</p><p>Maximized Staffing: Forest Rangers, Forest Ranger pilots, call-when-needed firefighters, and staffed engines are deployed across the state.</p><p>Daily Helitack Coverage: Manned helicopter firefighting and detection flights are being conducted daily in partnership with the Maine Warden Service.</p><p>Aviation Support: MaineArmy National Guard aviation units are available for rapid wildfire response.</p><p>Stakeholder Coordination: Ongoing updates to landowners, Maine's Fire Service, municipalities, and Compact partners.</p><p>Wildfire prevention is a shared responsibility, and our ability to keep Maine safe depends on cooperation at every level - from our partners in local fire departments to every individual enjoying the outdoors. Awareness and caution from the public are just as vital as the work being done on the ground by our trained personnel, MFS Director and State Forester Patty Cormier, Director, Maine Forest Service.</p><p>ATV Riders Urged to Stay Vigilant of Wildfires</p><p>The Maine Forest Service and the Off-Road Vehicle Program urge all ATV riders to prevent sparks from their machines by ensuring exhaust systems and spark arrestors are in good working order, and to properly extinguish all smoking materials and other potential ignition sources. Even a small spark or smoldering cigarette can ignite dry vegetation under current conditions. ATV Riders should remain alert for any signs of smoke or wildfire and take immediate action to report them by calling 9-1-1. Responsible riding practices and early reporting can play a critical role in preventing small fires from becoming major incidents.</p><p>How All of Us Can Help Prevent Wildfires</p><p>Fully extinguish campfires, until they are cold to the touch, and never leave them unattended.</p><p>Avoid all open debris burning until conditions improve.</p><p>Follow local fire restrictions. Check with your local Fire Department, Town Warden, or District Forest Ranger.</p><p>Be cautious with spark-producing equipment and vehicles.</p><p>Report wildfire or smoke immediately by calling 9-1-1.</p><p>For daily wildfire conditions, visit the Maine Forest Service Wildfire Danger Report.</p><p>Supporting Maine's Neighbors</p><p>At the request of the New Brunswick Department of Natural Resources, made through the Northeast Forest Fire Protection Compact, MFS recently deployed an engine and four-person crew to assist with active fires in the province. They are expected to be deployed for up to two weeks and can be recalled if needed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1127291908</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GH4-59B3-RS1X-J1MY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"772\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 14, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In response, our study provides a harmonised dataset with twenty-seven variables and develops an interpretable machine learning-based framework for assessing fire susceptibility across all seven countries of the region. We applied a two-stage process: first, using various feature selection techniques to refine predictors before the modeling phase, and second, utilising the SHAP framework to interpret model predictions. Between these steps, advanced machine learning models were optimised and trained in the H2O environment, demonstrating high predictive accuracy. Our findings revealed eight fire susceptibility clusters. The resulting dataset, susceptibility maps, and detailed interpretative insights serve as a valuable resource for local communities and policy-makers in the region.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>Wildfires are increasingly recognised as a major global challenge, becoming more frequent and severe under the pressures of climate change1, 2, 3\u20134. While regions such as California, Australia, and Mediterranean Europe have historically dominated wildfire research, mounting evidence now points to Central and Eastern Europe \u2013 including the Carpathians \u2013 as a zone of growing vulnerability5, 6, 7\u20138. The unprecedented wildfire season across Europe in 2023 starkly illustrated this shift, with extensive damage reported even in areas previously considered low risk9. Historical events such as the severe 2003 drought that impacted sessile oak (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Quercus petraea</emphasis>) stands in Hungary, and the 2004 windstorm that devastated Norway spruce (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Picea abies</emphasis>) forests in Slovakia, further underscore the susceptibility of the region to extreme environmental disturbances10,11.</p><p>Mountainous landscapes like the Carpathians \u2013 the largest mountain range in Central and Eastern Europe12 \u2013 are especially vulnerable. Their steep terrain, fragmented land ownership, and the complex interactions among climatic, ecological, and socio-economic factors amplify both ignition potential and suppression difficulty. Despite the ecological role that natural fires occasionally play in these ecosystems13, increasing fire frequency and intensity could drastically reduce essential ecosystem services14, threaten biodiversity15,16, and undermine the economic stability of sectors such as forestry, agriculture, and tourism17, 18\u201319. Despite these substantial ecological, economic, and social risks, comprehensive fire risk assessments across the Carpathian region remain scarce and are typically limited to isolated, localised studies7,20,21.</p><p>Machine learning has moved from a niche curiosity to a cornerstone of wildfire research over the past quarter-century22. With access to high-quality data, machine learning models can uncover complex, non-linear relationships between environmental and anthropogenic variables, and produce probabilistic maps of fire susceptibility or ignition risk22. Successful applications have already been reported in diverse geographic contexts \u2013 including China23,24, Ecuador25, Iran26,27, Vietnam28,29, the Mediterranean basin30,31, Italy32, Serbia33,34, and Poland35 \u2013 demonstrating broad applicability. Because no single algorithm universally outperforms others, researchers often explore a variety of techniques and hybrid solutions29. A global review of studies from 2001 to 2021 identified 33 different models used in forest fire susceptibility mapping; notably, 73% of these were employed in only one study36. The most commonly applied methods included Logistic Regression (statistical), Random Forest (machine learning), and the Analytical Hierarchical Process (knowledge-based), with Random Forest generally achieving the highest average accuracy. While some studies focus on a single model in-depth23,32,35, many compare two or more algorithms \u2013 often confirming Random Forest\u2019s superior performance24,30,33,34. Decision-tree based algorithms are widely used across many disciplines, including fire science, due to their intuitive logic and strong performance in both classification and regression tasks. Although often considered borderline \u201cblack box\u201d models, they are valued for their rule-based structure, which segments observations into increasingly homogeneous groups37. These splits aim to maximise predictive power, typically assessed metrics like information entropy or the Gini coefficient38. Increasingly, broader model-to-model comparisons also include Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, Na\u00efve Bayes, and Classification and Regression Trees26, 27, 28\u201329. Across this literature, a consensus emerges: wildfire ignition is fundamentally non-linear, and models that capture this complexity yield the best performance. Ensemble and hybrid machine learning approaches generally outperform simpler statistical and knowledge-based methods36, while deep learning and hybrid architectures typically deliver the highest predictive accuracy, at the expense of interpretability39. Recent studies have further highlighted the increasing importance of integrated remote sensing and deep learning models, emphasizing their applicability beyond wildfire research40, 41\u201342.</p><p>Predictive variables in wildfire modelling typically fall into four well-established categories: climatic conditions, vegetation characteristics, topographic factors, and socio-economic or anthropogenic influences23,43, 44\u201345. Climatic drivers such as temperature, precipitation, wind speed, relative humidity, and air pressure influence the amount and accumulation of combustible forest fuels, the moisture content of the vegetation, and the spread and direction of fires30. Vegetation characteristics, including forest cover density and health, directly affect forest flammability and fire spread46. Topographic parameters such as elevation, slope, aspect, water bodies, and catchment areas determine microclimates, act as natural firebreaks, and affect fuel distribution and moisture content47,48. Anthropogenic activities strongly influence fire regimes in Europe with approximately 97% of wildfires being human-induced49,50. Common proxies for human activity include population density51,52, unemployment rate30,53, GDP per capita24,54, proximity to infrastructure such as roads, railways, and power lines55,56, distance from settlements and croplands49,57,58, land use change59, and even illegal landfill density60. However, the use of varied datasets, inconsistent preprocessing, feature selection strategies, and differing modelling approaches often results in little agreement regarding the most influential predictors for any given region23,24,61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66\u201367. This underscores the inherent complexity and context-dependency of fire prediction models \u2013 and reveals a fundamental challenge: our understanding of how these variables interact within modelling frameworks remains limited36.</p><p>Despite considerable progress, critical gaps continue to limit the operational utility of current models. First, explicit feature selection \u2013 essential for model transparency and performance \u2013 is rarely employed in wildfire studies68,69. Second, model interpretability is often lacking, which hampers stakeholder confidence22,70. Moreover, regional-scale modelling efforts frequently neglect comprehensive cross-border analyses, leading to fragmented and inconsistent risk assessments across politically divided landscapes69, 70, 71\u201372. This further hinders building models that are genuinely transferable across similar geographic contexts.</p><p>To address these gaps, our study provides the first comprehensive, interpretable assessment of vegetation fire susceptibility across the seven countries of the Carpathian region. Specifically, we aim to answer the following questions:</p><p>How accurately can modern interpretable machine learning models predict fire occurrence in this mountain system?</p><p>Which climatic, vegetation, topographic, and socio-economic factors most strongly influence fire risk across multiple spatial scales?</p><p>Can we identify high-risk clusters within the Carpathians?</p><p>To answer these questions, we compiled a harmonised dataset comprising twenty-seven variables, primarily derived from satellite remote sensing and interpolated data products. We applied several distinct feature selection methods and their combinations, then optimised multiple advanced machine learning algorithms. We addressed question 1 by rigorously comparing 44 model-feature set combinations. Interpretability was enhanced though the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-based attribution analysis, enabling multi-scale insights into the influence of individual predictors. Finally, we addressed question 3 by leveraging H3 hierarchical hexagonal geospatial indexing system. Our analysis revealed that anthropogenic and vegetation-related variables were consistently among the most influential across all regions, while topographic factors exhibited unique patterns warranting further investigation. After identifying the best-performing model, we applied it to generate static susceptibility maps for the entire study area. These maps revealed eight spatial clusters exhibiting elevated fire risk. A summary of our research process is presented in Fig. 1.</p><p>Fig. 1</p><p>The main steps of our research process.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Results</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fire occurrence in the study region</emphasis></p><p>First, we collected active fire data identified by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard Terra and Aqua satellites (see Materials). Figure 2, panels a-d provides an overview of the Carpathian Mountains study region, encompassing 39 administrative units distributed across Czechia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Ukraine (see Materials for county details).</p><p>From 2010 to 2020 a total of 5,173 fire incidents were identified, corresponding to a mean of 470 events per year (see Supplementary Table S1). Annual activity peaked in 2012 with 991 fires, while both 2011 (623) and 2015 (581) also exceeded the annual average.</p><p>Marked seasonality was evident: fire numbers rose sharply in early spring and reached a maximum in March. Spatial patterns were equally pronounced. Roughly 78% of all fire incidents were concentrated in Ukrainian and Romanian counties, which together occupy the largest share of the mountain chain. Within the range, fires were most frequent at lower elevations along the outer foothills where settlements and agricultural land dominate; high elevation interior ridges experienced comparatively few events (Fig. 2, panel a).Fig. 2</p><p>Fire and control points in the Carpathians.

After running three complementary feature selection families (filter, wrapper, and embedded), ten reduced predictor sets were compared (Table 1). As described in the Methods section, feature selection was performed on 80% and evaluated on 20% of the training set.</p><p>Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) screening yielded two predictor subsets (Table 1): the permissive set, which includes 23 predictors with VIF values below 10, and the restrictive set, comprising 20 predictors with VIF values below 5. These two sets differ slightly in the number of variables, but both cover a relatively large number of predictors compared to other subsets in the analysis. When examining multicollinearity in these predictor subsets, we found that Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficients for the permissive set ranged from \u2212 0.754 to 0.916, while the restrictive set had values between \u2212 0.709 and 0.604. The restrictive set substantially lowered maximum pairwise correlation, falling within the typical \u00b1 0.7\u20130.75 range often used in similar studies to decide upon multicollinear variables30,33. This set provided a leaner, less collinear input for subsequent RFE-based selection. Both predictor subsets were fed into RFE as uncorrelated sets.</p><p>To boost Recursive Feature Elimination\u2019s (RFE) predictive performance, we used its various adaptations (see Methods). First, we presented the model with correlated (full set of predictors) and uncorrelated (two VIF subsets) predictors. The latter was necessary because collinear variables can distort the assessment of variable importance in Random Forest models73. Second, we introduced the concept of the logical rerank argument as there is no consensus in the literature on which approach proves to be more advantageous for our dataset74,75. Third, for the correlated set, we also introduced a 1% tolerance level allowing the algorithm some leeway to select a smaller, yet nearly as effective, set of features. As a result, RFE generated six alternative predictor sets (Table 1; Fig. 7). The comparison of the six different RFE sets revealed two key insights: (i) recalculating variable importance before each step had minimal impact on the number of variables included in the resulting subsets, except when the feature set with minimally correlating variables was used as an input; (ii) adjusting the tolerance level when filtering the full feature set led to a smaller subset of variables than starting with already prefiltered, non-correlating variables.</p><p>For running the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) algorithm, we identified two key  values, which further determined the predictor subsets used later in the H2O modeling phase (see Methods for details). Using the first, , led to a subset of 25 predictors, while the second, , resulted in a sparser set of 14 variables. Interestingly, as seen in Table 2, this sparser feature set yielded the best performance in the Multiple Logistic Regression (MLR) model.</p><p>Comparing all subsets from the different feature selection processes, the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">cropland</emphasis> variable consistently appeared in every subset, indicating its prominence across all methods. Out of twenty-seven variables, feature selection methods identified optimal subsets ranging from 1 to 25 variables. In terms of performance, RFE consistently yielded the best-performing subsets, except for the subset with only one variable. The hybrid combination of RFE and VIF, specifically the RFE-rVIF-F, was the top performer, selecting 17 variables. The best-performing RFE subsets were followed by Lasso, and VIF subsets, respectively. Table 1 shows a summary of the results for each subset. Further evaluation metrics can be found in Supplementary Table S2 and related runtimes in Supplementary Table S3.</p><p>Table 1</p><p>Summary of the feature selection results for each subset. The best-performing subset, based on test ROC AUC, accuracy, and kappa statistics, is highlighted with a red margin. The specific models used for feature selection are indicated in italics under each feature selection method (LR stands for logistic regression and RF for random Forest). We colour-coded features to represent the following categories: red for anthropogenic, orange for vegetation-related, purple for topographic, and grey for climatic factors. These colours are used consistently to represent the analysed variables throughout the study.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Machine learning models accurately predicted fire occurrence</emphasis></p><p>We selected three tree ensemble models \u2013 Distributed Random Forest (DRF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) \u2013 due to their popularity and efficiency (see Introduction). Additionally, we included Multiple Logistic Regression (MLR) as a benchmark statistical linear model. We trained the models on 80% of the entire dataset and evaluated on the remaining 20% (see Methods). We used every variable subset generated during feature selection \u2013 10 subsets plus the \u201call-in\u201d set \u2013 for every model type and carried out parameter optimisation for each case separately (see Methods). First, we identified the 44 best-performing models (11 feature sets x 4 models). Next, we selected the best of these models and used it for fire probability calculation. We assessed model performance using the cross-validated ROC AUC metric, which ranges between 0 and 1, 0.5 being a random categorisation and 1.0 being a perfect classification of fire and non-fire points.</p><p>We present our comprehensive results in Supplementary Tables S4-S7, showcasing the best results of each model-subset combination. Among the models, MLR demonstrated the weakest performance, with test AUC values ranging from 0.791 to 0.857 (see Supplementary Table S4). In contrast, tree-based models generally achieved better test AUC values. The DRF model, for instance, showed AUC values ranging from 0.652 to 0.940 (Supplementary Table S5), with its best performance using the RFE-rVIF-F feature subset (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> = 17). Similarly, the GBM model had AUC values ranging from 0.662 to 0.937 (Supplementary Table S6), performing best with the same RFE-rVIF-F subset. Although both the DRF-RFE-rVIF-F and GBM-RFE-rVIF-F models delivered slightly lower but still highly accurate results compared to XGBoost-RFE-pVIF-F (see Table 2; Fig. 3), they excelled in maximising the correct identification of positive fire cases (TP) while minimising false positives (FP). These models are particularly well-suited for scenarios where accurate fire prediction is crucial, such as during peak fire seasons when rapid response is essential. Misallocating resources to areas incorrectly identified as high-risk can have serious consequences, including delayed responses to actual fire outbreaks. Therefore, in ecosystems prone to large megafires, such as those in California, we would recommend using one of these algorithms.</p><p>The XGBoost models showed AUC values ranging from 0.616 to 0.941 (Supplementary Table S7), with its best performance using the RFE-pVIF-F feature subset with 19 variables. The XGBoost model excelled in maximising the true negative rate (TN) while minimising the false negatives (FN). Given its performance in differentiating true and false negative fires, this model is well-suited for situations where accurately identifying non-fire areas helps in efficient resource allocation. Considering its performance results - achieving the highest F1 and accuracy scores - and its suitability for avoiding undetected fires, we selected the XGBoost-RFE-pVIF-F model with 19 variables as the best-performing model. This model was further chosen for both SHAP interpretability analysis and susceptibility assessment. Notably, our findings suggest that the optimal feature subset comprises around 17\u201319 features (see Table 2).</p><p>Table 2</p><p>Model evaluation metrics reported on the test dataset for the best-performing models determined by the highest ROC AUC values. True positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN) are reported on the F1-optimal threshold, while maximal evaluation metrics are reported at their optimal thresholds.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"9\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"128\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"64\"/><colspec

calculated SHAP contribution values for both the entire region and specific local areas, as shown in Fig. 4. This approach allowed us to identify the features influencing fire patterns across the entire Carpathian region (panel a), within an individual county (panel b), and at specific coordinates (panel c).</p><p>Fig. 4</p><p>Global and local SHAP plots, providing a detailed visualisation of how features contribute to the model\u2019s predictions. The global plots rank variables by importance based on the average of their absolute SHAP values (y-axis) and show the impact of each feature on the outcome (x-axis) through individual SHAP contribution values for each data point. Feature values are normalised, with red dots representing high values and yellow dots representing low values. SHAP contributions greater than 0 indicate susceptibility to fire, while values below 0 indicate a negative association. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Panel a</emphasis>: Global SHAP Summary Plot for the entire study region using the XGBoost-RFE-pVIF-F model. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Panel b</emphasis>: Global SHAP Summary Plot for Borski county, Serbia, using the same model, showing the top 11 variables. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Panel c</emphasis>: Local SHAP plot showing also scaled feature values on the y-axis for the geographic coordinates N48.0834, E20.2790, near Bek\u00f6lce, Heves county, Hungary. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Panel d</emphasis>: Granularity of the SHAP analysis used in the current study.</p><p>The model\u2019s predictions were significantly influenced by the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">cropland</emphasis> variable, which ranked highest on the y-axis, indicating its status as the most important factor globally. There was a strong correlation between increasing cropland density and the occurrence of fires (see Fig. 4, panel a). This may be attributed to the fact that agricultural lands \u2013 closely associated with human activity \u2013 often host a high density of fire-prone vegetation, thereby contributing to more frequent fires76. However, land cover differences in fire proneness warrants further in-depth investigation, similarly to the Mediterranean Europe77. The influence of human activity was further supported by the observed association between fire occurrence and the presence of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">pastures</emphasis> or grasslands. Specifically, regions with particularly low pasture density tended to be more protected from wildfires, while areas with higher densities had greater exposure to fires, which is in line with previous findings in the Mediterranean region30. However, this trend was less pronounced for pastures than for croplands, as some grazed areas might have been less exposed to fires due to their reduced combustible materials56.</p><p>Another example of anthropogenic influence on fires was the effect of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">slope</emphasis> on fire susceptibility. The model shows that steeper slopes, as opposed to flat terrain, were associated with greater protection from fires. This outcome may be linked to the easier human access to flat regions35 or the quicker spread of fires in these areas, although opinions on the latter vary34,77,78. The case of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">population</emphasis> density and distance from settlements is especially interesting due to the seemingly paradoxical relationship. Our SHAP analysis indicated that high human concentration in a given area was associated with increased fire probability. This is not surprising, given that humans are considered the primary cause of most fires in this ecoregion55. Similarly, one might expect that a larger distance from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">settlements</emphasis> would protect them from fires due to decreased human presence. However, our findings suggest the opposite relationship. This counterintuitive result can be attributed to the low fuel content near settlements, as areas near larger cities and towns are less likely to be covered with contiguous vegetation23. Additionally, the low distance between <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">railway</emphasis> networks and fires reinforced the human influence on fire probability. Although higher <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">unemployment</emphasis> rate had a marginal positive effect on fire occurrence in the global model predictions, this trend may be more pronounced in specific regions. Notably, we found no clear global association between <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">road</emphasis> networks and fire susceptibility.</p><p>High temperatures and low precipitation can facilitate fire ignition56, a finding confirmed by our results as well. Mean annual temperature (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MAT</emphasis>) and monthly mean temperature (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tave_month</emphasis>) were positively associated with fire occurrence. Increasing temperatures can lead to higher evaporation rates and drier vegetation, both of which contribute to the likelihood of fires23,24. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trange_month</emphasis> - the difference between a month\u2019s max and min temperatures \u2013 barely influenced the model but the trend indicates that higher values may still stress vegetation and raise fire risk. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trange_seasonal</emphasis>, the difference over a season, surprisingly linked to lower fire risk, a result that merits further study. Regarding precipitation parameters, increased monthly precipitation (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PPT_month</emphasis>) was associated with a marginal negative effect on fire susceptibility, while seasonal precipitation (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PPT</emphasis>) had an intermediate effect without a clear global pattern. The former effect may arise because higher precipitation increases relative humidity and moistens combustible materials, thereby reducing fire risk23.</p><p>Climatic factors can significantly influence Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NDVI</emphasis>) values, which reflect the overall health of vegetation79,80. Our results demonstrated a strong, consistent negative relationship between NDVI variables (measured from the Terra and Aqua satellites) and fire occurrence. Higher NDVI values, indicating healthier and more robust vegetation, were associated with a lower likelihood of fires. Therefore, lower NDVI values are linked to higher fire susceptibility in two ways: diminished vegetation can raise the risk of fire, while repeated fires can, in turn, drive NDVI values down80. Vegetation health is potentially influenced by the proximity of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">water</emphasis> bodies. Indeed, our results indicated that areas distant from surface water resources are associated with higher fire susceptibility, possibly due to the decreased soil moisture content43.</p><p>Finally, forest coverage \u2013 a categorical variable representing vegetation conditions based on canopy density (see Materials) \u2013 showed that areas with dense forest cover (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">forest_cover1</emphasis>) are less prone to fires compared to other categories. This is consistent with findings from Southern France reported by53. In the Carpathian region, densely forested areas are typically located at higher altitudes (see e.g., Fig. 2, panel a). Consequently, our results indicated that areas at lower <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">elevations</emphasis> tend to be more prone to fires, which is in line with previous reports24,56.</p><p>Fire behaviour can vary significantly across different regions due to local factors such as climate, vegetation composition, topography, and human involvement. One advantage of SHAP is its versatility across various scales, allowing it to be applied to entire study regions, individual counties, and even specific coordinates (see Fig. 4, panel d). This helps to uncover spatial differences and identify patterns. For example, all variables align perfectly with the previous trends in Borski county in Serbia except for the elevation variable, which showed the opposite trend: higher altitudes were associated with increased fire risk (see Fig. 4, panel b). Further investigations are needed to uncover the causes of this trend.</p><p>The local SHAP plot reveals which features are most influential for a specific prediction at given coordinates. For example, the local SHAP plot in Fig. 4, panel c explains the model\u2019s prediction of a vegetation fire near Bek\u00f6lce, Heves county, Hungary, on April 22, 2020. This indicates that high NDVI_A values (healthy vegetation) and low cropland density and PPT values decreased the likelihood of the event being classified as a fire. In contrast, lower elevation, decreased precipitation, and a higher distance from water surfaces had positive contributions, tipping prediction outcome to the fire class. Local media also reported on this fire event, describing a very dry spring period at that time which is reflected in the relationship between our variables. It took a minimum of six hours to extinguish the fire, which resulted in approximately 60 ha of burnt area81.</p><p>To gain deeper insights into the local effects of the examined features on fire susceptibility, we carried out SHAP analysis on a regional basis (see Supplementary Figure S1). The results were then aggregated at the country level to enhance the interpretative power of the SHAP analysis, see Fig. 5. We also sought to identify consistent, monotonic relationships between features and model outputs across countries. To achieve this, we calculated Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient between the scaled values of each variable and their corresponding SHAP values at each point.</p><p>Fig. 5</p><p>Global SHAP Summary Plots for the seven Carpathian countries. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Panel a</emphasis>: Bar chart showing Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficients between the actual (scaled) feature values and their corresponding SHAP contributions, calculated on the overall test fire observations (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 1,035). The values of features with higher absolute correlation coefficients are likely to have monotonic relationship with the model\u2019s output. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Panel b</emphasis>: Global SHAP Summary Plots for each country, with features colour-coded as in Table 1.</p><p>Our SHAP analysis identified the most important variables in each country and showed that anthropogenic factors consistently play a major role in model predictions across all areas (see Fig. 5, panel b). In every country, three to five of the top ten variables were associated with various forms of human activities and showed consistent trends across countries (red background colour on Fig. 5, panel b). The results at the county-scale, shown in Supplementary Figure S1, followed a similar pattern, except for Gorj and Prahova in the Wallachia region of the Southern Carpathians, Romania, where these factors were less influential. Positive correlation coefficients for anthropogenic factors such as proximity to settlements also reinforce their significant impact on the model\u2019s predictions (Fig. 5, panel a).</p><p>Climatic, vegetation, and topographic features also played significant roles among the remaining variables. The role of climatic predictors (grey background colour on Fig. 5, panel b) was evident in all the countries, with rising temperatures contributing to increased fire probabilities, particularly in Ukraine and Romania (see also MAT\u2019s and Tave_month\u2019s high positive correlation coefficients on Fig. 5, panel a). Vegetation-related predictors (orange background colour on Fig. 5, panel b) were prominent across all countries, with Slovakia standing out, where NDVI_T emerged as the most important predictor. As already expected from the global results, NDVI exhibited negative correlation with SHAP contributions (Fig. 5, panel a) indicating lower fire probability in case of healthy vegetation.</p><p>Finally, topographic factors (purple background colour on Fig. 5, panel b) exhibited an intriguing pattern. These factors were notably more influential in the southeastern side of the Carpathians, particularly in Serbia, Romania, Ukraine, and Hungary, compared to the other countries. Elevation, in particular, stood out as a key predictor in Serbia, emphasizing the role of landscape features in fire dynamics. Proximity to surface water also proved important, particularly in Serbia, Romania, and Hungary, alongside other topographic variables. The indirect effect of the water variable could seem significant as fires are more likely to start where there is more dried combustible material.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Widespread fire susceptibility identified in the Carpathian region</emphasis></p><p>We assessed fire susceptibility across the Carpathian region using the best-performing XGBoost model (XGBoost-RFE-pVIF-F). Predictions were generated at a 0.74 km2 resolution, resulting in a spatial grid of 386,885 hexagonal cells covering a total area of 286,295 km2 (see Fig. 6, panel b). Approximately 34% of these cells (133,123 hexagons, equivalent to 98,511 km2) exhibited a predicted fire probability of 0.5 or greater.</p><p>The predicted fire susceptibility was notably higher in lower elevations and the foothills of the Carpathians. According to the SHAP interpretability analysis, these areas are characterised by more combustible vegetation and conditions conductive to increased fire risk, compared to the typically forested or sparsely vegetated higher elevations. Nonetheless, isolated areas of heightened fire susceptibility were also detected in certain mountainous locations.</p><p>To facilitate actionable insights at the administrative scale relevant for fire management82, median hexagon-level probabilities () were calculated for each county (NUTS-2 and 3) (see Fig. 6, panel c and Supplementary Figure S2 for all counties). The overall median probability across all counties was 0.195. Counties surpassing this threshold (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 19) were considered as having elevated fire susceptibility (see Fig. 6, panel c). We employed a spatial clustering approach to rank and group these counties based on contiguity within national borders.</p><p>Specifically, we employed a queen-contiguity neighbour analysis. We converted the resulting adjacency list to an undirected graph to detect connected regions. To delineate clusters at the national level, we removed links between counties located in different countries. Counties without any neighbours were treated as separate clusters. This method identified four multi-county clusters and four single-county clusters (see Fig. 6, panel b with each cluster numbered and visualised). Notably, countries without major contiguous clusters, such as Czechia, contained sub-regional areas warranting closer attention for fire risk management (see Discussion).</p><p>Below we briefly characterise each identified cluster. Median county-level fire susceptibility values () are indicated in brackets.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cluster 1 \u2013 Hungarian Carpathians</emphasis>: N\u00f3gr\u00e1d (0.42), Heves (0.53), and Borsod-Aba\u00faj-Zempl\u00e9n (0.55) counties constitute Hungary\u2019s cluster. Borsod-Aba\u00faj-Zempl\u00e9n, the most vulnerable Hungarian county, displays elevated fire probabilities notably around B\u00fckk National Park to the west, Aggtelek National Park to the north, and the Zempl\u00e9n Landscape Protection Area to the northeast (see Fig. 6, panel a).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Clusters 2 and 7 \u2013 Romanian Carpathians</emphasis>: Romania contains two distinct clusters. The first extends from the southeastern outer arc into the inner Transylvanian Plateau and includes Mure\u0219 (0.21), Bac\u0103u (0.24), Sibiu (0.25), Bra\u0219ov (0.26), Vrancea (0.32), D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba (0.42), and Buz\u0103u (0.63). Notably, Buz\u0103u ranks as the second most fire susceptible county in the entire Carpathian region. The second Romanian cluster consists solely of Mehedin\u021bi (0.52), which, despite lacking any adjacent high-risk neighbour within Romania, forms a cross-border cluster with Serbia\u2019s Cluster 3 across the Danube River.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cluster 3 \u2013 Serbian Carpathians</emphasis>: Brani\u010devski (0.42) and Borski (0.45) counties form a contiguous high-susceptibility area along the Danube gorge. This region overlaps \u0110erdap National Park in Serbia and borders the Iron Gates Natural Park in Romania, highlighting the cross-border nature of the elevated fire risk.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cluster 4 \u2013 Ukrainian Carpathians</emphasis>: Ivano-Frankivsk (0.33), Chernivtsi (0.58), and Lviv (0.77) form Ukraine\u2019s cluster, with Lviv showing the highest median fire susceptibility across the Carpathian region (see Fig. 6, panel a). While Zakarpattia county remains below the overall median susceptibility threshold (see Supplementary Figure S2), a developing elevated susceptibility area seems to be emerging near its border with the Pannonian Basin.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Clusters 5 and 6 \u2013 Polish Carpathians</emphasis>: In Poland, the Subcarpathian (0.22) and Silesian (0.24) regions formed two distinct clusters, separated by Lesser Poland region. Subcarpathian borders Cluster 4 in Ukraine. Elevated fire probabilities were primarily concentrated in the northern outer areas, with smaller, sporadic pockets also present on the inner slopes \u2013 particularly near Gorcza\u0144ski and Tatrza\u0144ski National Parks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cluster 8 \u2013 Slovakian Carpathians</emphasis>: Kosick\u00fd county (0.35) is the only region in Slovakia with a median fire susceptibility above the overall threshold, with elevated values mainly observed in its lowland areas. This cluster can be seen as a continuation of Hungary\u2019s Cluster 1, as it directly borders the Hungarian counties in that group83.</p><p>Taken together, the spatial arrangement of clusters highlights <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">three</emphasis> prominent cross-border convergence zones: (i) Hungary\u2019s Cluster 1 and Slovakia\u2019s Cluster 8, (ii) Serbia\u2019s Cluster 3 and Romania\u2019s Cluster 7, and (iii) Ukraine\u2019s Cluster 4 and Poland\u2019s Cluster 6. These zones form nearly continuous corridors of elevated fire susceptibility spanning national boundaries, emphasizing that fire risk is inherently a regional, rather than purely national, issue. Consequently, proactive cross-border management strategies \u2013 such as integrated early-warning systems, coordinated fuel break planning, and joint rapid response efforts \u2013 are critical for effectively mitigating fire risk throughout the Carpathian region. These considerations are further discussed in the Conclusion section.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Model validation</emphasis></p><p>Finally, to confirm the reliability of our model, we used an independent dataset containing active fire detections from NASA\u2019s FIRMS database, covering the period from January 1, 2021, to May 1, 2025. After selecting high confidence detections (\u2265 80% confidence), we retained 1,235 fire points. First, we compared the geographic coordinates of the negative control points to these fire detections at four-digit precision. There was no spatial overlap verifying that our negative controls were free from contamination by known fire events. Furthermore, the median great circle distance between each negative control point and the nearest recorded fire was approximately 12 km, and the mean distance was around 15 km, reinforcing their validity as genuine non-fire observations.</p><p>Next, we aimed to assess the predictive performance of our best-performing model. For each fire event recorded during the 2021\u20132025 validation period, we extracted the predicted fire probability within the corresponding H3 hexagon and compared it to the probabilities of hexagons without fire events during the same period. We found that the observed fire events occurred in hexagons with significantly higher predicted fire probabilities (Wilcoxon\u2019s rank-sum test <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 2.2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2076, see Fig. 6, panel d).</p><p>Finally, we investigated areas without fire events between 2010 and 2020 (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 382,682) but were flagged by our model as highly vulnerable. All fire-free H3 hexagons from this period were divided into high-risk (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 129,881) and low-risk (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 252,801) groups using a predicted-probability threshold of 0.5. We then overlaid fire occurrences from 2021 to 2025 onto these hexagons. Fires were 5.14 times more frequent in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group (0.69% vs. 0.13%; Fisher\u2019s exact test, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 2.2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2076). These results show that some regions appeared fire-resistant during 2010\u20132020 yet possessed climatic, anthropogenic, vegetational, and topographic characteristics that made them susceptible \u2014 a vulnerability our model successfully predicted based on these factors.</p><p>In sum, these results validate the integrity of the negative controls and demonstrate the robustness and predictive accuracy of the model, highlighting its effectiveness for future fire susceptibility assessments.Fig. 6</p><p>Fire susceptibility in the Carpathian region, in WGS84 projection. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Panel a</emphasis>: Susceptibility maps showing regions of Lviv (Ukraine) and Borsod-Aba\u00faj-Zempl\u00e9n (Hungary), highlighting areas with fire probabilities of 0.5 or higher.

All maps were created by the authors using R version 4.1.2 (R Core Team, 2021; <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.R-project.org/\">https://www.R-project.org/</url>) with the packages <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">h3jsr</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">ggplot2</emphasis>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Discussion</emphasis></p><p>We compiled a standardised dataset and developed a comprehensive interpretable framework to assess fire susceptibility across the seven countries of the Carpathian region. The analysis relied on twenty-seven predictors from various sources, covering climatic, vegetation-related, topographic, and socio-economic factors. To refine our predictor set and improve overall interpretability, we applied both linear (VIF and Lasso) and non-linear (RFE) feature selection methods, as well as their combinations. Among the machine learning models optimised and trained, XGBoost performed best (test ROC AUC = 0.941) when using a combined feature selection approach \u2013 RFE applied to a VIF-filtered set \u2013 resulting in a final model with 19 predictors. We then applied SHAP interpretability framework at multiple scales to explore the influence of each predictor on model decisions. As expected, anthropogenic and vegetation-related variables were the most influential, while topographic predictors showed less impact but warrant further investigation. Finally, the resulting susceptibility maps identified areas with elevated fire risk, revealing eight major fire-prone clusters across the region. Below, we discuss our key findings, bridging both machine learning and environmental science perspectives.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The interpretable machine learning pipeline</emphasis></p><p>In environmental modelling, feature selection serves to reduce computational time, enhance model accuracy, and improve interpretability84. Given our initial set of twenty-seven predictors, evaluating all possible subsets was computationally infeasible, as it constitutes an NP-hard (nondeterministic polynomial) problem85. Therefore, we applied three complementary methods \u2013 VIF, Lasso, and RFE \u2013 and their combinations to isolate the most relevant variables. These methods have been similarly applied in related studies25,33,86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91\u201392. While most existing studies typically employ only one feature selection method93,94, our comprehensive approach explored a wider range of possible outcomes. Notably, none of the feature selection and machine learning methods identified the full set of predictors as the most effective for model performance, highlighting the value of targeted variable selection (see Table 1). The RFE method combined with a permissive VIF-filtered input set performed best, identifying a subset of 19 variables. Notably, except for the MLR, all tree-based algorithms selected subsets derived from RFE as optimal. Interestingly, both DRF and GBM models independently selected the same subset of 17 variables as their best choice (see Table 2). Our findings align with prior research indicating that wrapper methods, such as RFE, often yield smaller and more accurate predictor subsets84. Furthermore, the combination of a low-cost filter method (VIF) with a wrapper approach (RFE) proved highly effective, offering computational efficiency while effectively eliminating irrelevant variables in a two-stage process84,95. Additionally, our results suggest that recalculating variable importance at every iteration in RFE was not necessary \u2013 a practical consideration for future studies.</p><p>Fire predictability is high in the Carpathian region, with model performance comparable to that reported in similar studies23,25,33,34. ROC AUC values for the test sets varied across models (see Results and Supplementary Tables S4-S7). As expected, the weakest performance occurred when using a single-predictor subset \u2013 specifically, the RFE with the restrictive VIF set and rerank T setting. In contrast, the highest predictive accuracy was achieved using RFE-based subsets in the XGBoost-RFE-pVIF-F and DRF-RFE-rVIF-F models (see Table 2).</p><p>Tree-based models consistently outperformed MLR, regardless of the feature selection strategy used (see Supplementary Tables S4-S7). This result aligns with previous studies that compared both model types in similar contexts30,31,33. Beyond fire research, tree-based methods have also demonstrated strong predictive performance across diverse domains. For instance, in financial services, decision trees have been advocated for predicting commercial credit risk, complementing rather than replacing logistic regression96. Their intuitive structure, which closely mirrors human decision-making, makes them particularly appealing and defensible in high-stakes contexts such as loan approvals. In genetics, a comparative study97 applied four models - Logistic Regression, Logic Regression, Classification Trees, and Random Forest \u2013 and found Random Forest to be the most accurate. The authors emphasised not only its superior predictive power but also its capacity to handle high-dimensional datasets effectively. Perhaps the most compelling evidence comes from a large-scale benchmarking study98 that evaluated default implementations of Logistic Regression and Random Forest across 243 real-world binary classification datasets from the OpenML database. These models were tested without hyperparameter tuning, reflecting their widespread use as standard tools by practitioners with limited statistical expertise. The results showed that Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression in 69% of the datasets based on accuracy, and in 72% based on AUC. Even in cases where Logistic Regression performed better, the performance gap was generally small.</p><p>While model performance remains important, there is a growing emphasis in machine learning on interpreting the outputs of complex black box models like XGBoost. This shift, driven by advances in interpretable and explainable AI (XAI), reflects an increasing demand to understand not just what a model predicts, but why. For researchers working with large datasets, especially in sensitive domains such as credit risk assessment, transparency and interpretability are essential for building trust in model decisions99, 100\u2013101. In our study, the SHAP framework enabled detailed interpretation of the factors driving fire predictions, both at the regional and local levels. It revealed notable spatial differences in variable behaviour \u2013 for example, the role of elevation in Borski county, Serbia, diverged from global trends. The SHAP summary plots (see e.g., Fig. 5, panel b) efficiently distill complex interactions into a clear visual format, offering a strong basis for further research. These insights pave the way for future research. For example, it would be valuable to investigate how variable importance shifts over time \u2013 such as, tracking whether NDVI gains predictive strength during peak fire season months.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Human footprints and landscape features shaping fire susceptibility</emphasis></p><p>All socio-economic (anthropogenic) variables in our initial feature set were included in the final model, and two of them \u2013 cropland density and distance from settlements \u2013 consistently ranked among the three most influential predictors (see Fig. 4, panel a). Their prominence confirms the decisive role of human activity in ignitions across the seven countries, echoing previous findings (see also Introduction). A 2021 synthesis for Czechia, Hungary, and Poland (2009\u20132018) attributed the vast majority of wildfires to intentional or accidental human causes102. The same report cited land use change in Romania, stubble burning in Serbia and other socio-economic drivers in Slovakia, although Ukraine was not assessed. In Polish forests, population density, building proximity and infrastructure are likewise key determinants of fire occurrence35.</p><p>Our results reinforce these patterns. Cultivated fields, settlement proximity and high population density emerged as the strongest anthropogenic predictors. Open field burning provides a clear mechanism: in Ukraine, agricultural fires dominated 2001\u20132003 and \u2013 despite their illegality \u2013 remain widespread, with flames easily spreading from croplands into forests103, 104\u2013105. Slovakian forests face similar pressures, with summertime stubble burning during droughts acting as a major ignition source50.</p><p>Vegetation attributes contributed equally to anthropogenic factors in our model. Vegetation-related variables ranked among the top predictors in all countries, except Serbia (see Fig. 5, panel b). Anthropogenic land cover change alters both NDVI and forest cover metrics: cultivated lands show low NDVI, whereas fallows register higher values79. Declining NDVI can also signal low fuel moisture, nutrient deficits, disease or repeated burning46,80. Conversely, high NDVI \u2013 and dense canopy cover \u2013 reflect healthy, more fire-resistant forests, a relationship captured by our model (see Fig. 5, panel b). Altitude further modulates this pattern. In Romania, rising temperatures lengthen the growing season and raise NDVI in high-altitude stands, but depress NDVI in lowland oak forests106. Our susceptibility map mirrors that contrast: the mountain core shows few high probability cells, whereas the foothills and lowlands form a broad belt of elevated susceptibility (see Fig. 6, panel b).</p><p>Topographical variables have a particularly strong influence on fire susceptibility in the southeastern Carpathians. Elevation, slope, and distance from water repeatedly rank among the leading predictors in Serbia, Romania, Hungary, and Ukraine (see Fig. 5, panel b). Topography shapes microclimate, fuel composition, and fire behaviour, as well as affecting solar radiation and water percolation rates26. Slope also affects evapotranspiration more strongly than temperature alone, altering local water balance107. Where surface water networks are sparse \u2013 particularly in Serbia, parts of Hungary and Romania \u2013 distance from streams becomes critical, reflecting the heightened flammability of dry landscapes (see Fig. 5, panel b). Indeed, proximity to water entered the top ten list in 44% of our counties (see Supplementary Figures S1), although it was not influential in Slovakia and Poland.</p><p>Water scarcity is an increasing concern in the identified region, as highlighted by previous studies83,108. The southeastern side of the Carpathians and Moldova have been found to experience the most pronounced climatic water deficits. Trend analysis revealed that these deficits are particularly acute along the West-East and North-South axes, with southeastern Romania facing the highest precipitation shortfalls108. This water deficit is further exacerbated by the lower climatological probability of drought recovery109, especially in the outer southeastern Carpathians. However, long-term hydro-climatic analysis of the region is well beyond the scope of this project but remains an excellent area for future research.</p><p>Due to the combined influence of these factors, fire susceptibility is concentrated in the lowlands and foothills, which cover roughly one-third of the study area and display probabilities \u2265 0.5 (see Fig. 6, panel b). Within this belt we delineated eight clusters using spatial clustering (see Fig. 6, panel b) that closely match the climatic vulnerability zones of83. As highlighted in the mentioned study, the dominance of certain fire-prone regions, particularly in the southern and eastern-facing Carpathians, may lead to misinterpretations of fire susceptibility in other areas. Focusing on smaller subregions can uncover regional characteristics that may not be visible or relevant at larger scales, e.g., in the case of Czechia where we did not identify any cluster.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Limitation and future scope</emphasis></p><p>Despite the study\u2019s broad scope, some constraints should be noted. Although the model was trained with fire records and covariates spanning 2010\u20132020, the final susceptibility map was generated using covariate values sampled at the centroids of each H3 hexagon from March 2020, the peak fire month in the region (see Methods). Anchoring the predictions to this one-month snapshot means the map reflects conditions typical of early spring and may not capture susceptibility during other seasons or atypical fire years. Future work should move beyond this point-in-time snapshot by integrating time-resolved covariates and generating seasonally or even monthly updated, fully gridded maps.</p><p>The model was calibrated with eleven years of MODIS fire detections and collected covariates, ending in 2020. It therefore cannot include the unprecedented 2022\u20132023 fire seasons that swept much of Europe, and any novel patterns from those years remain unmapped. Future work should incorporate a larger time period for capturing model nuances more precisely.</p><p>In the current study, we did not make difference between forest fires and vegetation fires. While focusing only on either forest or vegetation fires could offer a more detailed understanding of fire development, narrowing our dataset to fires occurring exclusively in forested areas would have significantly reduced the size of our training data. Addressing this warrants future research.</p><p>The inclusion of certain predictors such as detailed vegetation composition, additional climatic parameters, and land use and land cover types (accounting for changes over time) could further enhance our dataset but at the time of writing our study, data were unavailable for the entire study area. In future work, the inclusion of temporal characteristics of fires can further contribute to model nuances. Additionally, the already collected dataset may also inherently suffer from additional uncertainties, e.g., occasional omissions or false alarms in fire detections or infrastructure vectors lacking year-specific updates, etc.</p><p>Addressing the above gaps suggests several avenues for refinement and expansion. First, coupling the framework with vegetation dynamics would provide valuable insights into how changes in phenological cycles over time affect fire susceptibility. These temporal signals could then be fed back into the predictive model to improve its accuracy.</p><p>Second, since climate change impacts extend well beyond fires, future work could explore the combination of fire susceptibility with other climate-sensitive hazards, such as floods, landslides, soil erosion, or drought. This multi-hazard integration could support genuinely integrated risk management.</p><p>Third, applying the enhanced workflow to other similar fire-prone region would test model generalisability and highlight region-specific adaptations. Together, these steps can turn the present static snapshot into a dynamic, multi-hazard decision tool tailored to the Carpathians \u2013 and adaptable to vulnerable landscapes elsewhere.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conclusion</emphasis></p><p>This study delivers the first region-wide, interpretable assessment of vegetation fire susceptibility in the Carpathians. Leveraging an ensemble of tree-based learners (DRF, GBM, XGBoost) and SHAP post-hoc explanations, we distilled a twenty-seven-variable database into the nineteen most informative predictors and mapped ignition likelihood at a uniform 0.74 km2 resolution using the H3 hexagonal grid. The model performs on par with similar small-scale studies and reveals that roughly one-third of the mountain chain \u2013 98,511 km2 \u2013 faces elevated (\u2265 0.5) ignition probability, concentrated in eight clusters.</p><p>Across the seven Carpathian countries, human presence and vegetation condition dominate the ignition landscape. High cropland density and the proximity of fields and settlements consistently stood out as the strongest predictors, while vegetation-health proxies \u2013 the MODIS-derived NDVI indices and forest cover classes \u2013 were equally decisive. These findings reinforce earlier work attributing most wildfires in Central and Eastern Europe to direct or indirect human actions and underline land use management as a prime leverage point for mitigation. The role of climatic factors was evident too: warmer, drier periods, declining vegetation vigour, and unpredictable precipitation could, in fact, coincide with higher ignition probabilities, lending to partial support to the climate-fire paradigm. Because a formal attribution of long-term climate change effects would require dedicated temporal experiments beyond this study\u2019s scope, we regard this link as suggestive rather than causal and flag it for future research.</p><p>Our dataset and the eight clusters identified make it possible to unravel the way socio-ecological mechanisms that elevate ignition probability. Because the SHAP-augmented model resolves feature contribution at county and even geographic coordinate-based scale, researchers can combine fine-grained field assessments with complementary interpretability techniques to trace the specific climatic, vegetation, topographic, and anthropogenic triggers operating in each cluster. Such micro-level diagnostics will enable foresters, fire service personnel, and municipal planners to integrate risk information into daily operations \u2013 whether through targeted fuel break placement, outreach campaigns, or joint training exercises \u2013 and to run \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios that reveal presently low risk areas liable to become future hotspots under progressive warming.</p><p>To address the need for actionable insights, we have already proposed targeted policy recommendations110. Since all EU member states now enforce a strict stubble burning ban under Regulations 2021/2115 and 2116111,112, and Ukraine also prohibits open burning through its Code of Administrative Offences (Article 77 \u2212 1) and Criminal Code (Articles 241 and 245)113,114, we recommend a synchronised seasonal moratorium in the high risk hexagons identified by our model. These bans should be supported by well-equipped rapid response inspection teams using satellite alerts and drones, along with subsidies for mechanical residue management to ensure effective and sustainable compliance104.</p><p>Second, our hexagon-level analysis shows that fire likelihood increases sharply where settlements, rails, and \u2013 to a lesser extent \u2013 road corridors intersect areas of low NDVI vegetation. Establishing and regularly maintaining fuel break buffers would help mitigate this compounded risk115. While no EU law mandates such buffers, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) Strategic Plans Regulation (2021/2115, Article 73) and its horizontal counterpart (2021/2116) offer dedicated funding and audit mechanisms to support them. In addition, Decision 1313/2013/EU on the Union Civil Protection Mechanism requires member states to address such measures in their national wildfire prevention plans116,117.</p><p>Third, our findings suggest southeastern Carpathian foothill areas where topographic factors \u2013 such as distance from water surfaces \u2013 correlate with increased fire occurrence. In these zones, restoring riparian buffers, afforesting hillsides with drought-resilient native species, and implementing small-scale water retention measures (e.g., ponds, reservoirs) would help maintain fuel moisture and reduce fire susceptibility118. These actions are now supported by EU law, notably through the Nature Restoration Regulation (in force since 18 August 2024), which sets binding targets for river connectivity, tree planting, and wetland recovery119. Collectively, these instruments provide Carpathian governments with both the legal mandate and financial tools to implement moisture-enhancing landscape measures in the high-risk areas identified by our study.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Materials</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Study area</emphasis></p><p>The Carpathian Mountains comprise a series of mountain chains forming a semicircle across Central and Eastern Europe, extending approximately 1,500 km from 44\u00b0 to 50\u00b0 North latitude and from 17\u00b0 to 27\u00b0 East longitude120. In delimiting our study area, we applied strict geographic criteria that follow the mountain chain itself and intentionally exclude the wider Carpathian macro-region121. Spanning an area of around 210,000 square kilometres, the range crosses seven countries: Czechia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Ukraine122,123.</p><p>Characterised by a temperate continental climate with considerable local variability124, the Carpathians feature elevations predominantly between 750 and 2,500 m120. Vegetation patterns align closely with these altitudinal zones: mixed deciduous forests (pedunculate oak, lime, hornbeam) dominate lower elevations and intra-montane depressions (300\u2013800 m), transitioning to European beech and silver fir in mid-mountain zones (600-1,450 m). Coniferous forests (Norway spruce, stone pine) prevail above 1,500 m, with sparse vegetation, such as mountain pine, dwarf juniper, and green alder, above the timberline125. Notably, the countries encompassing the Carpathians have recently experienced significant social, political, and economic transitions126.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Administrative units</emphasis></p><p>Administrative units within the study area were identified using the European Union\u2019s (EU) Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) classification.

MODIS detects thermal anomalies, representing fires with approximately 1 km spatial resolution. The instrument documentation clarifies that the resulting fire pixels may not necessarily align with the exact fire size or number127,128. We represented these data as point coordinates centred within each pixel to reduce computational load and eliminate the need to standardise variable resolutions86,129, 130, 131\u2013132.</p><p>Data from 2010 to 2020 were organised by year and country. Following common research practice133, only fire occurrences with a confidence value of at least 80% were included. Using spatial vector data from the Global Administrative Areas Database (GADM, version 2.5 with a release date of July 2015) (<url normalizedValue=\"https://gadm.org/index.html\">https://gadm.org/index.html</url>), we identified 5,173 fire points. Most (5,170) were concentrated within single administrative regions, with three points on regional borders attributed to Ukraine\u2019s Lviv region due to its higher incidence of fires. Each identified fire location was coded as 1.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Generation of control points</emphasis></p><p>Using a stratified random sampling method, we generated an equal number of non-fire control points, coded as 0, ensuring their spatial and temporal characteristics matched those of the fire coordinates. To maintain local spatial independence and prevent adjacency to fire pixels, we implemented the Vincenty spherical method134, defining a minimum distance of 5,000 m between fire and non-fire points135.</p><p>Due to a small sample size in the regions of Czechia and Slovakia, we merged the regions of the respective countries and treated them as a single observation area. This consolidation resulted in identifying 129 non-fire points in Czechia and 277 in Slovakia. We generated the non-fire coordinates with 5-digit accuracy, similar to fire coordinates, and handled missing data in the same way as for fire points (see Explanatory variables subsection).</p><p>After data collection and generation, a data frame containing all fire and non-fire points (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 10,346) was created, incorporating fire/non-fire labels, predictor columns (twenty-seven covariates), and additional metadata (e.g., country name, region name). The balanced dataset ensures that the machine learning models accurately categorise points into their respective classes136.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Explanatory variables</emphasis></p><p>A comprehensive dataset of 26 explanatory variables was compiled, categorised into 11 climatic, 3 vegetation, 5 topographic, and 7 socio-economic factors, chosen based on literature relevance and data availability. Table 4 presents a summary of each variable.</p><p>Table 4</p><p>Explanatory variables selected for analysis. Variables are grouped and colour-coded as in Tables 1; Fig. 5.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1. Climate variables</emphasis></p><p>The selection of meteorological variables posed challenges due to limited data availability and data inconsistency. At the time of writing our study, websites hosting meteorological databases such as WorldClim (<url normalizedValue=\"https://worldclim.org\">https://worldclim.org</url>) and CarpatClim (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.carpatclim-eu.org/pages/home/\">http://www.carpatclim-eu.org/pages/home/</url>) lacked adequate data for our predefined timeframe. Additionally, data from various meteorological stations supplied by the European Climate Assessment &amp; Dataset (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ecad.eu\">https://www.ecad.eu</url>) lacked standardised data across countries. Consequently, interpolated climatic data from the ClimateEU software package (<url normalizedValue=\"https://sites.ualberta.ca/~ahamann/data/climateeu.html\">https://sites.ualberta.ca/~ahamann/data/climateeu.html</url>) were utilised137. We selected 4 monthly, 4 seasonal, and 3 annual climatic variables, covering temperature and precipitation patterns.</p><p>During this process, we stored fire coordinates with elevation values in CSV files and loaded them into the ClimateEU software. The software generated climatic data in separate downloadable CSV files, which were then matched temporally to the corresponding fire and control points. Specifically, annual climatic variables were aligned with the corresponding year of each fire and control point; seasonal climatic data were matched to the exact year and season; and monthly data were aligned with the precise year and month associated with each point. As advised144, elevation data accompanied fire and control coordinates to enhance climatic accuracy. Descriptive statistics for the climatic data are provided in Supplementary Table S8.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2. Vegetation variables</emphasis></p><p>Vegetation characteristics were represented by forest/non-forest cover data from the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Research and Application Project (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/dataset/fnf_e.htm\">https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/dataset/fnf_e.htm</url>), utilising the 25 m resolution PALSAR-2 product, version 2, and NDVI values, from NASA MODIS Terra and Aqua satellites (<url normalizedValue=\"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mod13a3v061/\">https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mod13a3v061/</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/myd13a3v061/\">https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/myd13a3v061/</url>).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forest cover</emphasis></p><p>Forest cover was classified according to FAO definition of \u201cforest\u201d, denoting tree-covered land with an area larger than 0.5 ha and a canopy cover exceeding 10%. This results in a categorical variable with four values: 1 meaning a forested area with a canopy cover of 90% or more; 2 meaning a forested area with a canopy cover between 10% and 90%; 3 meaning non-forested area; and 4 meaning watered surface. The forest cover value for each point was extracted using the corresponding spatial raster file. Our dataset revealed 316 fire points in Category 1; 558 in Category 2; and 51 in Category 4; with the majority of coordinates (4,248) falling into Category 3, indicating a predominance (&gt; 82%) of fire occurrences in sparsely forested areas.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NDVI values</emphasis></p><p>In terms of NDVI values, the Terra satellite \u2013 following a morning orbit from North to South \u2013 crosses the Equator at approximately 10:30 am, whereas Aqua, with its afternoon orbit from South to North, reaches the Equator at around 1:30 pm. For data extraction, we used the Application for Extracting and Exploring Analysis Ready Samples (AppEEARS, v3.5) to obtain the MOD13A3 and MYD13A3 Collection 6.1 products, which provide NDVI data at a spatial resolution of 1 km and a monthly temporal resolution. NDVI values range from \u2212 1 to + 1: values close to \u22121 typically indicate water surfaces, values near + 1 suggest dense vegetation, and values around 0 generally represent urbanised areas. In our dataset, NDVI values range from \u2212 0.01 to 0.88 (Terra) and from 0.06 to 0.89 (Aqua), with median values of 0.46 and mean values of 0.47 for both satellites. As with the climatic data, NDVI values were matched temporally to the fire and control points based on the closest date.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3. Topographic variables</emphasis></p><p>Five topographic variables, including elevation, slope, aspect (eastness and northness), and proximity to water bodies, were sourced to understand their influence on fire occurrences.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Elevation</emphasis></p><p>For elevation, we used the reprocessed version of NASA\u2019s Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model, as provided by CGIAR-CSI version 4.1 (based on SRTM 2007) (<url normalizedValue=\"https://srtm.csi.cgiar.org\">https://srtm.csi.cgiar.org</url>). This version, processed by CGIAR-CSI GeoPortal, offers global coverage without data voids and a spatial resolution of 90 m. Elevation values were extracted from the raster layer for each point. Analysis showed a minimum elevation of 14 m and a maximum of 2,256 m, with a median elevation of 255 m, indicating most fire points were located at lower elevations. The mean elevation was 299.6 m, suggesting a right-skewed distribution of fire points.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Slope</emphasis></p><p>For slope and aspect variables, we relied on a standardised and global multivariate product provided by141 which incorporates data from the 250 m Global Multi-resolution Terrain Elevation Data 2010 (GMTED) and the near-global 90 m SRTM 4.1dev (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.earthenv.org/topography\">https://www.earthenv.org/topography</url>). The authors generated a suite of elevation-derived topographic variables across various spatial resolutions. For our purposes, we used slope and aspect data at a 1 km resolution with median aggregation from GMTED sources. Values for each fire and control point were extracted from these raster datasets. The slope data exhibited a highly right-skewed distribution, with most fire events occurring on gentle slopes of less than 5%.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aspect variables</emphasis></p><p>In addition to slope, which reflects the magnitude of elevation change, the aspect provides further insight into the terrain\u2019s orientation \u2013 an important factor in fire susceptibility. Therefore, we used the derived northness and eastness variables, which are transformations of slope and aspect (see141, for calculation details). In the Northern Hemisphere, the value of northness ranges from \u2212 1 (South-facing) to + 1 (North-facing), with 0 indicating an East-West orientation. Similarly, for eastness, the value range is between \u2212 1 (West-facing) and + 1 (East-facing), where 0 represents neither a West nor East-facing direction, but a South-North exposition. Our dataset shows a slight predominance of fires on South- and East-facing slopes, with median values of \u22120.03 and 0.02, respectively.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Distance from water bodies</emphasis></p><p>To assess the proximity of fires to water bodies, we obtained shapefiles of rivers and lakes in the Carpathian region from the DIVA-GIS database (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.diva-gis.org\">https://www.diva-gis.org</url>), along with road and railway infrastructure (see Socio-economic variables subsection). Using great-circle distance calculations, we determined the distance between fire points and the nearest water body. The median was slightly over 2 km, with a mean distance exceeding 2.6 km.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4. Socio-economic variables</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Distance from infrastructural networks</emphasis></p><p>We acquired road and railway infrastructure data from the same DIVA-GIS source as the hydrological data. Great-circle distances were calculated for both types of infrastructure. The median distance to the nearest road was slightly over 2 km, with an average of approximately 2.5 km. For the railway network, the median distance was 4.3 km and the mean was 6.2 km.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Distance from settlements</emphasis></p><p>Settlement data were sourced from the World Settlement Footprint 2019 dataset, developed by the German Aerospace Center (DLR-EOC Geoservice), with a spatial resolution of 10 m (<url normalizedValue=\"https://geoservice.dlr.de/web/maps/eoc:wsf\">https://geoservice.dlr.de/web/maps/eoc:wsf</url>). Using this dataset, we calculated Vincenty spherical distances between each point and the nearest settlement. The results indicated a right-skewed distribution, with a median distance of 750 m and a mean of approximately 935 m, suggesting that most fire occurrences were located close to human settlements.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cropland and pasture densities</emphasis></p><p>We used cropland and pasture density data from the EarthStat database (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.earthstat.org/cropland-pasture-area-2000/\">http://www.earthstat.org/cropland-pasture-area-2000/</url>), which combines inventory data with satellite-derived land cover estimates. The values range from 0 to 100%. While extracting data for fire and non-fire points from the relevant raster tiles, we encountered 32 instances of missing values. These values were substituted with the ones from the nearest raster tiles with non-missing values.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Population density</emphasis></p><p>Population density data, measured in persons per square kilometre, were obtained from the Gridded Population of the World (GPW) version 4.11, hosted by NASA\u2019s Socioeconomic Data and Application Center (SEDAC) (<url normalizedValue=\"https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/gpw-v4-population-density-rev11\">https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/gpw-v4-population-density-rev11</url>). The data were provided in GeoTIFF format at a 1 km resolution. We analysed the datasets for the years 2010, 2015, and 2020 and selected the value closest in time to each fire and control point. The median population density was 66 persons/km2, while the mean reached 147 persons/km2, indicating right-skewed distribution.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unemployment rate</emphasis></p><p>Unemployment rates at the NUTS 2 level were compiled using official reports from the Ukrainian National Statistical Office and Eurostat. These publicly available datasets can be accessed at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ukrstat.gov.ua/operativ/operativ2009/rp/rp_reg/reg_e/arh_rbn_e.htm\">http://www.ukrstat.gov.ua/operativ/operativ2009/rp/rp_reg/reg_e/arh_rbn_e.htm</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/tgs00010/default/table?lang=en\">https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/tgs00010/default/table?lang=en</url>. The statistics pertain to the working population aged 15 and above. Due to data constraints, Ukrainian unemployment rates were taken from 2010 to 2018 and refer to individuals aged 15 to 70. We identified 88 missing values for Serbia between 2010 and 2012. These were supplemented with national-level data obtained from the Serbian Statistical Office (<url normalizedValue=\"https://data.stat.gov.rs/Home/Result/24000100?languageCode=en-US\">https://data.stat.gov.rs/Home/Result/24000100?languageCode=en-US</url>). As with other variables, unemployment rates were matched to the corresponding region and year of the fire and control points. All referenced websites were accessed in August 2022.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methods</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Data Preparation and handling</emphasis></p><p>In a linear world, multicollinearity \u2013 when two or more variables are highly correlated \u2013 is a condition to be avoided, as it makes it difficult to isolate the individual effects of each variable on the dependent outcome145. Our correlation analysis of the original 26 predictors identified significant multicollinearity, particularly among monthly and seasonal climatic variables (see Supplementary Figures S3). To address this, we combined highly correlated predictor pairs (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Tmax_month</emphasis> with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Tmin_month</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Tmax</emphasis> with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Tmin</emphasis>) into two new variables: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Trange_month</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Trange_seasonal</emphasis>, representing monthly and seasonal temperature ranges, respectively. Additionally, we transformed the categorical predictor (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">forest_cover</emphasis>) into dummy variables. Following these adjustments, the final dataset comprised 27 refined predictors suitable for subsequent modelling stages.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Data splitting</emphasis></p><p>Our dataset consists of 10,346 observations, evenly split between 5,173 fire points and 5,173 control (non-fire) points, collected for the period from 2010 to 2020. Initially, we split the data into two main subsets: an 80% training set and a 20% testing set, with the latter reserved exclusively for evaluating the performance of our machine learning models. To ensure unbiased model training and evaluation, the training set was further divided into an 80:20 ratio. The larger subset was utilised during feature selection, which was evaluated on the smaller subset. We applied 10-fold cross-validation during both feature selection and model training stages, an established technique in the field25,33,86, to mitigate overfitting and enhance model reliability. All datasets were scaled separately.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Feature selection approach</emphasis></p><p>Given the complexity and multicollinearity inherent in our initial set of 27 predictors, effective feature selection was crucial to enhance model interpretability and performance. We adopted three distinct feature selection methods representative of the major categories: Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) from filter methods, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) from wrapper methods, and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) from embedded methods. Each method and their combinations provided unique insights into predictor importance and improved the robustness of our feature selection process. We summarized the methods and their resulting feature subsets in Fig. 7.</p><p>Fig. 7</p><p>Summary of feature selection methods and their resulting feature subsets. Specific selection criteria and arguments are also indicated for each method (see text for details). <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> indicates the number of variables in each subset.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Variance inflation factor (VIF)</emphasis></p><p>VIF assesses collinearity among predictors in linear regression models by measuring how much the variance of an estimated regression coefficient increases due to collinearity146. It is calculated by comparing the variance of the coefficient when all variables are included in the model to the variance when only the examined variable is included37. A VIF of 1 indicates that the variable is not correlated with others in the model, and theoretically, its upper range can be infinite. However, there is not a universally agreed-upon threshold for what constitutes a high or low VIF, the rule of thumb is generally around 5 to 10 as acceptable147. These reference values were used to determine the subsets in our analysis using the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">car</emphasis> R package.</p><p>Supplementary Table S9 shows the summary of the VIF calculation process. Starting with all variables, we iteratively removed predictors with the highest VIF (marked with red), recalculating at each step, until achieving subsets with acceptable collinearity thresholds below 10 (permissive set) and 5 (restrictive set) (see Supplementary Figures S4).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Recursive feature elimination (RFE)</emphasis></p><p>RFE iteratively removes the least important predictors based on model performance, gradually refining the subset to an optimal predictor group148. We implemented RFE with Random Forest as the underlying algorithm using the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">caret</emphasis> R package. We ran several variations of the algorithm by including only correlated and also uncorrelated predictors (as determined by the VIF analysis), recalculating variable importance after each iteration (rerank: T and F on Fig. 7), and applying a tolerance level of 1% on the correlated set to achieve balanced model complexity and predictive accuracy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso)</emphasis></p><p>Lasso performs variable selection and regularisation by applying an L1 penalty to regression coefficients, shrinking some coefficients to zero in case of a sufficiently large  value, thus, effectively eliminating less relevant predictors73,149. This regularisation technique is particularly useful to avoid overfitting as the algorithm encourages a sparse model with fewer predictors150. If  is equal to zero, it means all variables are considered without any shrinkage penalty added to the model, so that results are equal to the ones obtained from a simple linear regression model. If  is set to infinite, no variables are considered at all, except the intercept. Thus, choosing the optimal value of  is critical37. We determined two lambda values through 10-fold cross-validation: , which resulted in the maximum cross-validated Receiver Operating Characteristics \u2013 Area Under the Curve (ROC AUC) value, and  which resulted in an AUC which is one standard error from the maximum AUC value. For this, we used the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">glmnet</emphasis> R package. Supplementary Figure S5 shows the obtained  values and the associated number of predictors.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Machine learning model development</emphasis></p><p>We trained and optimised four supervised machine learning algorithms \u2013 Distributed Random Forest (DRF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Multiple Logistic Regression (MLR) \u2013 within the H2O-3 environment (H2O.ai, 2023, R package version 3.44.0.3, <url normalizedValue=\"https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3\">https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3</url>). Each algorithm underwent extensive parameter tuning via a random grid search across hyperparameter combinations on 80% of the entire dataset. ROC AUC was used as the primary stopping metric to halt training when improvements became marginal (&lt; 0.1%) for five consecutive scoring rounds. The maximum runtime per model subset was capped at two hours to ensure computational efficiency.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Model evaluation</emphasis></p><p>Model performance was assessed using several metrics suitable for balanced binary classification problems, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1 score, and ROC AUC. These comprehensive evaluation criteria ensured a holistic understanding of each model\u2019s predictive capabilities.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Distributed random forest (DRF)</emphasis></p><p>DRF is the default Random Forest implementation in H2O, enhancing Breiman\u2019s original Random Forest algorithm with a distributed computing strategy to significantly increase execution speed38. The term \u201cdistributed\u201d highlights the approach of building and reading trees in parallel, distributed across clusters or nodes, with trees stored in memory in a compressed manner. Each node retains its portion of the training data, and the algorithm exchanges necessary information between these predefined nodes151. By constructing multiple trees using random samples of predictors and resampling the training data observations \u2013 a technique known as bagging \u2013 DRF effectively overcomes the high variance and poor prediction accuracy associated with a single decision tree. For optimising DRF, we used the parameters listed in Supplementary Table S5.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gradient boosting machine (GBM)</emphasis></p><p>GBM is a forward-learning ensemble method that combines the strengths of gradient-based optimisation and boosting152. This classifier works by sequentially combining shallow decision trees, known as base or weak learners. In GBM, each tree depends on the previous ones, and new trees are trained on modified versions of the original dataset. This dependency allows each subsequent tree to correct the errors of its predecessors. The term \u201cgradient\u201d in GBM refers to the use of the gradient descent optimisation algorithm, which iteratively adjusts parameters to minimise the cost function153. Specifically, GBM uses gradient descent to minimise the loss function. The learning rate, also known as shrinkage, controls the contribution of each tree to the final model.</p><p>H2O uses a distributed approach to build GBM trees. Each data row is assigned to a tree node, with a temporary vector storing node IDs. H2O scans rows and creates histograms for each node to decide how to split the data. Initially, all rows start at node 0, and decisions are made based on statistical tests of homogeneity. As the tree grows layer by layer, rows are reassigned to new nodes based on conditions set at each level. This method allows rapid parallel processing of large datasets by leveraging multiple CPUs, therefore accelerating model building, although it can potentially increase communication demands for deep trees152. For optimising GBM, we used the parameters listed in Supplementary Table S6.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)</emphasis></p><p>XGBoost builds on the foundation of gradient boosting while enhancing computational speed and model performance154. It introduces several key improvements, such as loss function normalisation, regularisation techniques, and support for both decision trees and linear classifiers. One of its core innovations is the use of Taylor series expansion, which incorporates both the first derivative (gradient) and second derivative (Hessian) of the loss function for more accurate optimisation. To improve performance and prevent overfitting, XGBoost includes additional regularisation terms in its objective function and applies techniques like dropout153. It also uses strategies such as shrinkage (reducing the learning rate) and feature subsampling, where only a subset of features is used to build each tree, further helping to control overfitting. The algorithm\u2019s implementation in H2O is similar to GBM, and for optimisation, the parameters outlined in Supplementary Table S7 were used.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Multiple logistic regression (MLR)</emphasis></p><p>In addition to tree-based models, we also introduced a simpler regression-based method as a benchmark. Logistic Regression, part of the generalized linear models (GLM) suite, can be used in H2O for predicting a binary response variable with multiple predictors. Instead of modeling the response variable directly, Logistic Regression models the probability that the response variable  belongs to one of two categories, such as TRUE (fire occurrence, coded as 1) or FALSE (fire non-occurrence, coded as 0). Mathematically, it is an extension of linear regression based on the logit or log-odds function, the natural logarithm of an odds ratio. Its inverse is the sigmoid or logistic function, which takes any real number and projects it onto the  range, representing the probability of an event occurring. The model was trained using the maximum likelihood estimation to find the optimal coefficients that minimised the difference between the predicted probabilities and the actual binary outcomes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Model interpretability</emphasis></p><p>To interpret our best-performing model, we utilised the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework within H2O. SHAP, grounded in Shapley values from cooperative game theory, quantifies the contribution of each feature to the model\u2019s predictions, offering clear and interpretable insights into both feature importance and the direction of their influence. The Shapley value itself represents the average marginal contribution of a feature value across all possible combinations (coalitions) of features99,155. As the exact computation of Shapley values is highly demanding, SHAP uses efficient approximation techniques to make the process more practical.</p><p>Widely recognised as a model-agnostic post-hoc explanation method, SHAP is rooted in solid mathematical theory. However, it is important to note that it does not imply causation; rather, it identifies which variables influence the model\u2019s decisions and in which direction. In our study, we applied SHAP both globally considering all points across the Carpathian region or in a given county, and locally \u2013 at the level of one coordinate \u2013 allowing us to uncover fine-scale spatial patterns and the varying impact of predictors.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fire susceptibility mapping</emphasis></p><p>One of the primary objectives of our research was to project fire ignition patterns across the Carpathian region. To achieve this, fire susceptibility was visualised using the H3 hierarchical hexagonal geospatial indexing system, with the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">h3jsr</emphasis> R package (<url normalizedValue=\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/h3jsr/index.html\">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/h3jsr/index.html</url>). Originally developed by Uber in 2018, H3 divides the Earth\u2019s surface into hexagonal grids, offering several advantages well beyond its transportation origins (<url normalizedValue=\"https://h3geo.org\">https://h3geo.org</url>)156, 157\u2013158. The hexagonal grid structure ensures that neighbouring cells are equidistant, making adjacent neighbour queries more efficient. Additionally, more relevant for the current study, H3\u2019s icosahedron-based projection minimises spatial distortions when mapped onto the Earth.</p><p>Leveraging our best-performing predictive model, we estimated fire probabilities for hexagonal grid cells (each approximately 0.74 km2). To calculate these probabilities, we used the most recent data available on the central point coordinate of each H3 cell. Specifically, climatic conditions from March 2020, aligning peak fire season, informed this mapping process. The resultant maps highlighted regions of elevated fire probability using spatial clustering, enabling the identification of potential fire risk clusters across all seven Carpathian countries. For this, we used the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">spdep</emphasis> R package.</p><p>Finally, we used predicted probability values for calculating a post-hoc global Moran\u2019s  on the Pearson-standardised residuals (H3 grid, resolution 8, queen contiguity). The value was 0.18 (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 2.2e-16), indicating weak positive spatial autocorrelation. This suggests that using a 5-km buffer during the generation of negative controls did not fully remove spatial autocorrelation. However, the strong validation results (see Results - Model validation) demonstrate that this low level of spatial autocorrelation has minimal impact on model performance. Future research could further mitigate spatial autocorrelation by adding explicit spatial covariates.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><p>[1].Bowman, DMJS.

Yet while the Union Jack was lowered and a new flag rose, true freedom remained elusive. Political sovereignty did not instantly erase Britain's entrenched economic interests or its military footprint in Kenya.</p><h>BATUK as the Shadow of Colonial Rule</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One glaring example of lingering British influence is the British Army Training Unit Kenya (BATUK). Established in 1964 under the guise of a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\"partnership,\"</emphasis>BATUK has allowed the UK to maintain a military presence on Kenyan soil for decades. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Officially it's touted as mutually beneficial - British troops get a rugged training ground and Kenya's army gets support. </p><p>In reality, many Kenyans see BATUK as an instrument of neocolonialism. Its operations have often ridden roughshod over Kenyan sovereignty, leaving a trail of harm to citizens and the environment.</p><h>Decades of Injustice</h><p>Over the years, numerous reports of misconduct by British soldiers in Kenya have surfaced usually with little or no accountability. </p><p>Chief among the allegations are sexual crimes. Amnesty International documented more than 650 cases of rape and sexual assault by UK servicemen between 1965 and 2001, painting a horrifying picture of abuse. </p><p>Yet not one of those cases was ever tried in a Kenyan court. For decades, victims seeking justice were met with indifference. Accused soldiers were simply whisked out of the country or quietly <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\"dealt with\" </emphasis>by the British military if at all.</p><p>The aftermath of this exploitation is visible in the lives of hundreds of children left behind. Towns like Nanyuki the hub of BATUK activities host countless<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> \"BATUK babies,\" </emphasis>children fathered by British soldiers during brief liaisons with local women. </p><p>When their tour ended, the soldiers returned home, often abandoning the mothers and never acknowledging their offspring. Many women recall broken promises of marriage or support. </p><p>Their children grow up facing stigma and hardship, with absent fathers and no assistance from the British side. Kenyan activists and NGOs have long decried this social tragedy, urging the UK to take responsibility for the children of its servicemen.</p><h>The Tragedy of Agnes Wanjiru</h><p>BATUK's record is also stained with blood. </p><p>Perhaps the most notorious incident was the murder of Agnes Wanjiru, a 21-year-old Kenyan woman, in 2012. Wanjiru disappeared after a night out with British soldiers in Nanyuki, and two months later her body was found dumped in a hotel septic tank, bearing stab wounds.\u00a0</p><p>The initial inquiry was handled by British military police and no one was charged, even though evidence hinted that some soldiers knew what happened. </p><p>Years later, a former UK soldier alleged that a colleague had confessed to killing Wanjiru yet still no prosecution followed. Her family, to this day, is fighting for justice.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\"They have power, but they have refused, and it's heartbreaking... Agnes was a human being. Now we are left to seek justice for her with our hearts broken... it's the worst thing,\" </emphasis>said Wanjiru's niece, Esther Njoki. </p><p>Her anguish reflects how Kenyan victims feel powerless when it comes to crimes involving British personnel.</p><h>The Unbroken Chain of Impunity</h><p>Unexploded ordnance left behind by BATUK has also cost Kenyan lives. </p><p>In 1985, a mechanic named Jaffer Mohamed was killed in Nanyuki when a mortar shell, left inside a scrap vehicle used for target practice, detonated as he worked. He left a widow and four children.\u00a0</p><p>Over the years, nomadic pastoralists and curious kids have likewise been maimed or killed by unexploded ordnance. </p><p>In 2002, the UK Ministry of Defence paid about \u00a34.5 million to settle claims by 228 Kenyans injured or bereaved in such incidents, with over 1,000 additional claimants later emerging. Yet accidents continued. </p><p>In 2007 a local worker, Robert Seurei, died after unknowingly handling an explosive device, and in 2015 a 13-year-old boy lost his limbs to a buried bomb. </p><p>Each time, the British Army's response was the same - provide medical aid or token compensation, but ensure no soldier faced criminal consequences in Kenya.</p><h>Lolldaiga Forest Fire\u00a0</h><p>Environmental damage is another part of BATUK's legacy. </p><p>In March 2021, a British training exercise ignited a massive wildfire in the Lolldaiga Hills, an ancient forest conservancy. The blaze consumed roughly 12,000 acres of land, devastating wildlife and the livelihoods of nearby communities.\u00a0</p><p>Amid the chaos, a British soldier posted a flippant message online:<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> \"Two months in Kenya later and we've only got eight days left. Been good, caused a fire, killed an elephant and feel terrible about it but hey-ho, when in Rome.\"\u00a0</emphasis></p><p>Kenyan officials later said no elephants actually died, but the soldier's joke infuriated the public. </p><p>The British Army eventually agreed to compensate around 7,000 locals for their losses (170$ per victim), but for many Kenyans the damage - both to the ecosystem and to their trust - was already done.</p><h>Legacy of Colonialism Lives on</h><p>Through all of this, not a single British soldier has been prosecuted in a Kenyan court. </p><p>Every allegation rape, assault, even murder - has been handled by the British military or resolved behind closed doors. </p><p>To many Kenyans, the message is clear: BATUK operates above the law. The parallels with the colonial era are hard to ignore.\u00a0</p><p>During colonial rule, British authorities could commit abuses with impunity; today, British troops still enjoy a de facto immunity on Kenyan soil. </p><p>Back then, Kenyan land and labor were exploited for the empire's benefit. Now land is used for live-fire drills and local people are treated as second-class citizens in their own country.</p><h>Legal Basis for Impunity: The Defence Cooperation Agreement\u00a0</h><p>One major reason this situation persists is a legal agreement that grants British troops broad immunity from local law. </p><p>The Kenya-UK Defence Cooperation Agreement (DCA), renewed in 2021, effectively places British personnel under UK jurisdiction even while they are in Kenya.\u00a0</p><p>If a British soldier commits an offense on Kenyan soil, they answer to British military courts not Kenyan courts. </p><p>British officials insist this is standard procedure and that they discipline wrongdoing. But Kenyans have seen the reality: investigations happen behind closed doors, evidence vanishes, and Kenyan authorities are kept at arm's length. </p><p>In Wanjiru's case, for example, the British inquiry went nowhere.\u00a0</p><p>Critics call the DCA a blatant affront to sovereignty - how can Kenya be truly independent if foreign soldiers in its territory aren't subject to its laws?</p><h>Parliament Criticizes the Agreement</h><p>Kenya's leaders are beginning to push back. Many MPs opposed the 2021 DCA renewal, and their fears were vindicated in August 2025 when BATUK commanders snubbed a parliamentary summons. </p><p>Outraged, committee chair Nelson Koech declared BATUK a hostile witness and warned that the Defence Agreement could even be revoked. Fellow MP Yusuf Hassan was even more direct:\u00a0</p><p>\"We will dissolve the agreement we have with the British government. You cannot come to a foreign country, commit a crime and then refuse to be held accountable; that is unacceptable.\"</p><p>Such remarks signal that Kenya's patience is nearing its limit.</p><h>The Path to True Sovereignty\u00a0</h><p>Finally, some are questioning whether Kenya needs to host the British military at all.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">#FeatureByCynoMedia</emphasis></emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PULSEK-httpswwwpulselivecokearticlesnewspoliticsbeyondthelawhowbritishsoldiersescapejusticeinkenya2025090415435259539</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PULSEK2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GNC-HHS3-RVWH-444S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">489587</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1255\"/><timeReceived>3:43 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Pulse Africa Holding AG  All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Pulse Kenya</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"64351\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 4, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Kenya, United Kingdom &amp;

I'm Shirija Jodia, Corporate Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations at Strategy. I will be your moderator for strategy's 2025 third quarter earnings webinar. We will start with the call with a 60 minutes presentation, starting first with Andrew Kang, followed by Fong Li and then Michael Saylor. This will be followed by a 30 minutes interactive Q&amp;A session with four Wall street equity analysts and four Bitcoin analysts. Before we proceed, I will read the Safe Harbor Statement. Some of the information we provide in this presentation regarding our future expectations, plans, guidance and prospects may constitute forward looking statements including without limitation our guidance with respect to earnings and our KPIs contained in this presentation.</p><p>Actual results may differ materially from these forward looking statements due to various important factors including fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin and the risk factors discussed in our most recent Quarterly report on Form 10Q filed with the SEC on August 5, 2025 and our current report on Form 8K filed with the SEC on October 6, 2025. We assume no obligation to update these forward looking statements which speak only as of today. With that I will turn the call over to Andrew Kang, the CFO of Strategy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Kang:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you Chirish. I'll start with some highlights for the quarter. We now hold 640,808 bitcoin or over 3% of all bitcoin ever to exist. This reinforces the scale and the dominance of our corporate bitcoin tradition. Treasury Company we have a market cap of $83 billion which positions us among top publicly listed companies in the US and we have four listed preferred securities in the market, STRF, STRK, STRD and STRC with STRC or stretch being the largest US IPO of 2025 so far and all which continue to grow in liquidity and investor interest each and every day.</p><p>We've also raised $19.8 billion in capital year to date to acquire more Bitcoin and our capital markets platform continues to deepen in liquidity and investor interest and we continue to show positive performance in our Bitcoin metrics, all central to generating long term shareholder value. Moving on to EPS results, Turning to our Q3 2025 GAAP financial results, we reported $3.9 billion in operating income, $2.8 billion in net income and earnings of $8.43 per share. That's a transformative improvement year over year reflecting a strong performance in Bitcoin. The fair value treatment we now have on our Bitcoin and disciplined capital raising activities.</p><p>This marks our second consecutive quarter of significant positive GAAP earnings and over $8 billion in positive earnings in the last four quarters. Next slide our results for the first nine months of the year show $12 billion in GAAP operating income in in net income and earnings of $27.80 per share, continuing our record breaking year performance. Moving on to Bitcoin per Share Bitcoin Per Share, as we introduced last quarter measures the accretion of bitcoin on a per share basis by calculating the ratio between the company's bitcoin holdings and and assumed diluted shares outstanding here represented in Satoshis.</p><p>Through October 26, our Bitcoin per share was 41,370 compared to Bitcoin per share 39,716 as of July 31. We are consistently accumulating more Bitcoin per share each quarter, the highest of any bitcoin treasury company, creating direct and measurable value for our shareholders. Next Slide. Since adopting our bitcoin strategy in 2020, we've consistently increased bitcoin per share. We began with 56,598 bitcoin per share in 2020 and as of October 2025 that has grown to 200,197 bitcoin per share, more than a 3.5 tons increase over that period. We've also grown BTC yield year after year through disciplined capital raises and immediate conversion into Bitcoin on our balance sheet, reflecting a 26% BTC yield year to date. This sustained growth reinforces our ability to deliver bitcoin yield to our shareholders through market cycles and by continuously executing on our capital markets and acquisition strategy.</p><p>Next slide. Here we highlight our year to date Bitcoin performance metrics versus our full year 2025 targets. Year to date we've achieved a 26% BTC yield compared to our revised full year target of 30%. Our year to date BTC gain is 116,555 BTC, up from 88,000 at the end of the Q2 reflecting disciplined capital deployment and the strengthening of our bitcoin balance sheet, our BTC gain performance translates into approximately $12.9 billion in BTC dollar gain year to date compared to our $20 billion full year goal. Next slide we now hold 640,808 bitcoin or $71 billion purchased at a total cost of $47 billion or an average $74,000 per bitcoin and we now hold approximately 3.1% of all bitcoin that will ever exist and as in the past, 100% of our Bitcoin remains fully unencumbered.</p><p>This next slide highlights the transformation of our balance sheet over the past year and the continued strength we've seen through the third quarter. Year over year, digital assets grew from just under $7 billion in Q3 of 2024 to just over $73 billion in Q3 of 2025, driven by both additional Bitcoin acquisitions and the adoption of fair value accounting at the beginning of the year. The accounting change alone added approximately $18 billion to our digital assets and $12.7 billion to total equity at the time of adoption. Quarter over quarter, digital assets have continued to climb from $64.4 billion in Q2 to $73.2 billion in Q3 alongside steady growth in total equity on our balance sheet reaching now $58.1 billion at the end of Q3.</p><p>Overall fair value accounting has made our balance sheet more transparent for our investors while execution in introducing innovative digital credit through Our preferred equity IPOs this year has continued to expand shareholder equity and reinforce the company's position as a leading Bitcoin treasury company. Next slide in Q3 we recognized an increase in our Bitcoin holdings from $64.4 billion at the end of Q2 to $73.2 billion at the end of Q3. This increase was made up of $3.9 billion of fair value gain in our Bitcoin holdings, which is due to the change in Bitcoin price between the first and last day of the quarter and also through the addition of $5 billion of new Bitcoin added to our balance sheet in Q3.</p><p>Next slide as of October 24, our enterprise value was $98 billion with a market cap of $83 billion, which are supported by a Bitcoin net asset value of $71 billion or 72% of total enterprise value. Our $8.2 billion of convertible debt is equal to just 11.6% of our total Bitcoin NAV and the $6.6 billion of prefs represent just 9.3% of our Bitcoin holdings. Our annual dividend and interest obligations total $689 million, which is less than 1% of our total Bitcoin, reflecting the efficiency and sustainability of our balance sheet and our capital structure is built to endure volatility provides stability, scalability and long term shareholder confidence.</p><p>Next slide. We continue to have $8.2 billion in total notional debt across our converts, with all but two that remain in the money with a total weighted average maturity of 4.4 years. The total current notional value of our outstanding preferred Equity as of October 24th stands at approximately $6.7 billion, up from 6.3 billion as of July 29th. Next Slide Our total annual interest and dividend obligations are $689 million, which consists of $35 million in interest exp our converts, which is about 42 basis points average cost and we have $522 million in dividend obligations from our cumulative preferreds STRF, STRC and STRK and an additional $125 million related to our non cumulative preferred STR.</p><p>Here we show we have more than sufficient access to liquidity to manage our total annual interest and dividend obligations through our true track record of capital raising activities. Our total annual obligations represent only about 1.7% of total capital raised in the last 12 months and only about 2.6% of total common equity raised in the last 12 months. As a measure of our strong financial performance, our fixed obligations represent only 6.1% of year to date GAAP operating income. Next slide. Finally, we are extremely pleased with the IRS interim guidance that was issued on September 30, which now excludes unrealized gains from our Bitcoin holdings from adjusted financial statement income for purposes of kamti.</p><p>Not only does this important clarification directly benefit strategy, but it also paves the way for other corporations to hold and grow Bitcoin on their balance sheets. We are grateful and appreciative for the support of treasury, irs, Congress and the Administration for aligning on the importance of clarifying the specific rule under Kamti and listing what otherwise would have been an extremely burdensome rule that would have targeted digital assets and for continuing to support the growth and innovation of the digital asset economy. I'll now turn the call over to Fong Li, Strategy's President and CEO.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Phong Le:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, thank you Andrew. I will go through an update on our capital markets activity and then I will review the guidance that we provided for 2025. So first I want to welcome and invite everybody to join us in four months in Las Vegas at the beautiful Wynn Resort for Strategy World 2026 and our fifth annual Bitcoin for Corporations. So hopefully those who are listening or watching this presentation and have been a fan of strategy software or strategy and our Bitcoin strategy can come out and join us. So next slide. Shish. So taking a step back, we used to compare ourselves to other companies that held Bitcoin on their balance sheet and as you know, with over 640,000 Bitcoin and nearly over 3.1% or nearly 3.1% of all the bitcoin ever to be created in the world, we found it best to compare ourselves to the largest corporate Treasuries in the world. You'll see here With $71 billion of Bitcoin on our balance sheet, we're fifth when comparing cash and short term investments and excluding financial services companies. And our aspiration, the next year is to be number two and the next five to ten years to be number one.</p><p>And so how do we do that? Next slide. What we've done in the past in the last two years is raised a significant amount of equity and capital through the Capital Markets. In 2024, we raised $22.6 million and about 27% of that or $6.2 million was from the convertible debt market. Year to date this year we've raised $19.8 billion. And what you can see here is the way we've raised it has changed significantly. We've reduced our convertible debt raises to about 10% and we've increased our raises through preferreds to $6 billion or about 30%. And that was all happened.</p><p>That has all happened this year. It's really just been since the end of January of 2025 that we've launched our preferred strategy. And it's been very successful so far, year to date. As we start to reduce our reliance on convertible notes, our plan is to allow those to equitize over time. And based on the earliest potential equitization dates, you'll see here that by 2029 we'll have no more convertible debt on our balance sheet. And instead what we'll do is we'll start to season the preferred market. You'll see through the course of this year through four IPOs.</p><p>And as Andrew had mentioned, the largest IPO coming three months ago with STRC or stretch, we've been able to raise $6.7 billion through the preferred market. And interestingly, as you look at this, a large portion of that raise has come from the retail market. The initial offering of strike had about 4% access or raises through retail and the latest one structure at about 23% through retail. Next slide. Suresh. So how do we season the market and how do we grow our preferred offerings and raising more capital through our preferred offerings? Three real techniques that you'll see us continue to use.</p><p>First is distribution. Recently in the last month we've seen more brokerages list our Preferreds. Robinhood listed each of our four preferreds in the last month and we've seen significant volume and liquidity through Robinhood and they listed those as the first ever Preferreds on the platform because of demand from other folks that were on Robinhood. We're also going to continue to distribute through wealth management Broker dealers. Rias Morgan Stanley participated in our latest preferred which gave us significant assets to their wealth management channel retail customers. And we'll start to work with different. Banks and financial institutions to explore other types of products, potentially ETF wrappers and structured finance products that have our Preferreds underlying them. We're doing more and more in terms of field marketing, industry conferences, leverage finance events where we seek access to customers and buyers who are interested in credit and debt products. We're also doing more and more teaching. So just feet on the street meeting with financial advisors, brokers, RIAs and family offices. And last is you'll see more digital marketing. You're already seeing us provide some information and advertise some of our preferred, namely Stretch and social media on X.</p><p>We plan to have even greater presence on YouTube, traditional media, potentially channels like Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg. We continue to use our strategy.com website and our strategy app, which if you have not downloaded it, I suggest you do so. And more and more presence on interviews and podcasts. So these are three different ways we'll continue to create distribution and awareness of our credit instruments. The other area of distribution that we are going to look to access with our preferred credit instruments is international expansion. Right? Currently our products are listed on the NASDAQ and are US based products, US dollar based products.</p><p>But there's a significant access to capital that we can get. If we were to as an example, launch a Canadian product on a Canadian exchange in Canadian dollars, launch a European product on a European exchange, Euro or potentially other areas of the world like Asia or Latin America also. And we think by accessing these markets and by providing new products that are similar to our preferred products like Stretch or Stryfe, that we can access even greater pools of capital to provide more funding for us to ultimately buy more Bitcoin. And that's accretive to our shareholders.</p><p>We announced this week on Monday that we have now the first ever published rating of a Bitcoin treasury company by a major credit agency. S and P assigned us a B minus issuer credit rating to strategy. And we think this is a big milestone not just for strategy and for Bitcoin treasury companies, but a big milestone for Bitcoin in and of itself. There's been a lot of discussion around whether we think this is a good rating or not a good rating. I think it's a solid starting rating and I think even more importantly to have a rating, it gives us access to more pools of capital.</p><p>So what does a B minus rating mean by definition? It means that there's a stable outlook and it reflects the expectation that we'll continue to manage our capital structure prudently and that we maintain market access. We're rated under a structure that's a framework that's called non bank financial institutions. That's a framework the S and P uses to rate us. And importantly at this point in time, Bitcoin is. We don't get any credit for the bitcoin on our balance sheet when it comes to our rating. It's deducted from our equity and this drives negative risk adjusted capital.</p><p>So what needs to change for the rating to improve? Well, one, I think it's appropriate at some point in time that Bitcoin be treated differently and as a capital asset at full credit. And that would require the risk adjusted capital or the Basel frameworks to change or for S and P to change how they look at capital, bitcoin as capital. And I think that'll start to happen over time. We see already other banks seeing Bitcoin as potential collateral. We've seen US housing agencies suggest that Bitcoin should be collateral for mortgages. So as that starts to evolve, I think the risk adjusted capital and the Basel frameworks will start to evolve and I think the S and P will evolve in its view on Bitcoin.</p><p>But it's good to have a stake in the ground. I mentioned the potential equitization of our outstanding convertible debt because these are senior to our preferreds and are at the top of our capital structure in terms of seniority. As these start to roll off, that will start to reduce our maturity risk and that should also improve our rating. And finally, what we've been doing for the last five years, we've demonstrated strong access to capital markets. We demonstrated in 2022 the ability to service our debt during a Bitcoin bear market. As we continue to show improve consistent leadership in this area, we'll start to see a better rating too.</p><p>But I'll go to the next slide and this is probably the most important point about getting a rating. Because we are now S and P rated. It gives us access to larger pools of capital than we had before. The unrated credit market is about $2.8 trillion worldwide now. We have access to what we would call a high yield rated. B minus is in the high yield category, which is a market that's about three times the size of the existing market that we're in. And over time, our hope is if Bitcoin was to be treated as true capital on our balance sheet, that we would be considered an investment grade rated company.</p><p>And when we get to that point, we would be able to Access a market that's 11x what it is today. So in summary, on the S and P rating, I think it's a good starting point and it's important that we're rated. And I think an agency like credit agency like S and P validates, our company starts to validate Bitcoin as an asset class and it's a good starting point for us. The other part of S and P. So their index business has also started to embrace crypto. The s and P500 has in successive quarters added Coinbase, then Block, then Robinhood to their index.</p><p>And we now meet all the criteria that's required to be in the S&amp;P 500 index. We're number 131 by market cap of U.S. publicly traded companies. And unlike the NASDAQ 100 that sets its criteria purely by market cap, S and P also has some other criteria. You have the US Company, US listed, which we are and have to have a minimum of $23 billion market cap, which we have, and 250,000 shares traded each month for six months, which we have. You have to have the last quarter with positive earnings. We've had two now and at some of the last four quarters have to have positive earnings, which we also have.</p><p>So now that we meet all the criteria, the question we get often is why are we not included? We don't know exactly. Right. This is a S&amp;P 500 process that they don't publish. Exactly why someone gets added or not. But first of all, we just became eligible in the last quarter and eligibility doesn't mean immediate inclusion. And that's pretty typical. Many other highly successful companies, Tesla and the ones I mentioned here, Bach and Robin, who were not included in their first quarter of eligibility, but we hope to access the index in $13 trillion of capital that tracks the S&amp;P 500 at some point in time. The other big development that's happened really just in the last three months with the passage of the Genius act and with more and more government clarity on regulations related to Bitcoin and related digital assets, is big banks further embracing crypt.</p><p>Morgan Stanley has dropped their restrictions in which wealth clients can now own crypto funds. In fact they can solicit bitcoin backed securities and including Bitcoin backed ETFs. And they are recommending as much as in some cases 5 to 6% of clients portfolios owning Bitcoin. They also underwrote our most recent offering stretch and as I mentioned earlier gave us access to the wealth management channel. Citibank recently launched coverage, the first, I'll call it bulge bracket bank that's launched coverage on our equity and they also provide now price target and they've announced that they're going to launch crypto custody services next year which I think is going to be transformative in terms of major banks now custody, bitcoin and other digital assets.</p><p>Society General, which is a large bank in France, became the first major bank to launch dollar peg stable coins and even banks like JP Morgan now are allowing bitcoin and E as collateral with their banks. And I mentioned that Citi has launched coverage on strategy and they've also given a bitcoin price target which is a major improvement. You'll see here of all the banks that are covering us and all the research analysts that are covering us, there's an average price of Bitcoin for 2025,156 average price at the end of 2026 of $180,000. You'll also see here strong price targets and ratings on all of the banks that are covering strategy.</p><p>So let me move to 2025 guidance and review the guidance that we provided last quarter and talk through some of the additional guidance that we'll provide this quarter. The first piece is I want to. Reaffirm the BTC guidance for 2025. This is all assuming the coin price of $150,000 at year end, which is based off of the consensus targets that I just reviewed. We have a BTC yield target at the end of the year of 30% and a BTC dollar gain target of $20 billion. And we have activities underway to try to achieve those which include capital raises and such as. As for our earnings guidance, I also want to reaffirm what we communicated three months ago, which is an operating income target of $34 billion, a net income target of $24 billion and an EPS target at $80 at the end of this year.</p><p>Again all assuming a bitcoin price of $150,000 stretch which we just launched three months ago. I also want to reaffirm the guidance that we give in on how we think about the dividend rate. If the five day VWAP of the price stretches above $101, we'd recommend a rate decrease or potentially a follow on offering. If the 5 day VWAP is between 95 and $99, we'd recommend a 25 basis point rate increase to get the price to try the price to stretch within our target price range of 99 to 101 dollars. And if the five day VWAP is below 95 dollars at the end of the month, we would recommend a 50 basis point rate increase.</p><p>And so let me show you what we've done so far since we've launched Stretch and what we will update today as far as our five as far as our dividend for the next month. So as you recall, when we launched the product in July, we launched with a 9% dividend rate. We increased that to 10% in August, we increased it further to 10.25% in September. And today we're announcing that effective November 1, we'll increase another 25 basis points our dividend and will be at 10.5% November 1, paid monthly. The last guidance I want to talk. Through is something that's new to this group, which is what we're calling return of capital guidance. And Mike will talk about this a little bit more. But this is a pretty unique feature to all of our preferred equity, which is that the dividends are paid. The dividends that are paid are taxed as a return of capital. And if it's taxed as a return of capital, it means that it's tax deferred until you sell the underlying asset. And so if you hold on to the underlying asset, you can expect that you're paying essentially zero taxes on that.</p><p>That compares to a qualified dividend, which is at a rate of anywhere between 20 and 35% depending on the state you live in and the city that you live in in the US and compare it to an interest income which is what you would pay on something like a money market or a Bank account at 37% to 50. We call these rock dividends. It's a pretty unique feature and one that I think is not as clear and it may be lost on folks, but when you invest in our preferreds for the foreseeable future, you can expect ROC dividends. And so why do we have ROC dividends? It's fairly unique to our company, which is that we have negative taxable earnings and profits, which is a function of the business that we're in and it's a function of our intent to buy and hold Bitcoin and not sell bitcoin where it's negative from a tax perspective and not engage in activities that will result in significantly positive taxable earnings and profits.</p><p>And our guidance here is that we expect that this rock treatment continues for the foreseeable future for 10 years or more. And we can impact that guidance and we can impact our negative E and P with how we run our business. So the summary here is that our preferred dividends are tax free or tax deferred and that we expect that to continue for the foreseeable Future. Could be 10 years, could be more than that. So with that, I want to hand it over to our executive Chairman, Michael Saylor.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Saylor:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Fong, and thanks for joining us today. I'm really excited to talk to you about digital capital and digital credit. So let's go to the first slide. The first point that I want to make is that Bitcoin has emerged as digital capital. What is digital capital? Digital gold capital is a long term store of value. Bitcoin is a store of value. The US Government has embraced Bitcoin as a store of value and that means every major cabinet member. And I'm showing them here. And of course, the decision that America is going to be the bitcoin superpower is an endorsement along with the President's point that you don't ever sell your bitcoin.</p><p>Let's go to the next slide. Wall street has embraced Bitcoin as digital capital. Now you've got 1.5 million Bitcoin held by the spot ETFs, about $170 billion worth. The most successful ETF in the history of Wall street is ibit. And IBIT has explosively grown even in the past few months. The daily liquidity in IBIT is now approaching $4 billion or more a day. Open interest in IBIT has gone to more than $50 billion in open interest. And so this is wildly successful. Next, public companies have embraced Bitcoin as digital capital. We were the first public holder of bitcoin.</p><p>Then there were two, then there were four. About a year ago there were 60. Now there are 200 plus publicly listed companies holding bitcoin. That's more than a million bitcoin and it's about 116 billion in value. I've got a few metrics here on this slide that show just the scale of the bitcoin market. It's a $2.3 trillion market cap. It's $58 billion of daily liquidity, $76 billion in BTC open interest in the derivatives market and is backed by 26 gigawatts of power. That's 26 full on nuclear reactors. The hash rate keeps going up. We're now up to 1100 exahash.</p><p>And you have 30% of all voters in the United States that are registered. Of the registered voters that are crypto holders, the industry crypto is 3.9 trillion and there's 700 million crypto users and of course 300 million bitcoin holders. So this is a global movement at this point. Bitcoin is the capital asset at the center of the entire crypto industry and it is traded on 1,000 exchanges. Next. Now, what do you do with digital gold? Well, what do you do with gold? You issue credit on Gold. For 300 years the Western world ran on gold backed credit.</p><p>Bitcoin is digital gold. What we've realized is that the killer application of digital capital is digital credit. And strategy enables a wide variety of securities based on that digital capital. What you can see here is that the baseline is IBIT. IBIT is digital capital in a ETF wrapper and it's got a 53% annual, a 53% return on average for the past five years. And the volatility is 38% right now. Now what we have done is created four digital credit instruments that strip the volatility and extract or distill the performance out of ibit. So strikes volatility is 28 and it gives you a 9% effective yield and some upside strides.</p><p>Volatility is 16, it gives you a 13% effective yield. Strikes volatility is 14 and we extracted a 9% effective yield. And of course what we're doing is we're extracting a certain type of risk or we're mitigating or stripping off a bunch of risk. We're extracting a yield, we're damping the volatility. And the largest piece or the greatest piece of financial engineering we've performed is Stretch, which has converted that 38% volatility into 8 and extracted that effective yield of 10%. And of course, as you can see, since we damped the volatility, there is sort of a conservation of energy or a conservation of volatility in the thermodynamic universe.</p><p>And so where does the volatility go? It goes to the equity. So the volatility that we strip off of BTC accrues to mstr. And of course the performance and the opportunity that we strip off of BTC also accrues to MSTR so what you see here is a fairly straightforward financial engineering exercise. We are a structured finance company and we are starting with a blob of high energy capital, long duration, highly volatile, high performance. We are engineering out different durations, different volatilities, different risk profiles, different performance profiles. We're even transforming it from the BTC currency into the USD or the different currencies.</p><p>And that is the exercise next. Now this chart shows the economic landscape we work in. Here you see Bitcoin's performance of 53% over five years, almost double the mag7. You can see gold performed 15% a year. It slightly edged out the S and P at 14%. S&amp;P is the conventional cost of capital. Real estate is underperforming the S and P dramatically in this time frame, only up 6% a year. Money market instruments, those short duration treasuries in the US on average have provided 3% performance a year. And mid dated to long Dated bonds are minus three strategies.</p><p>Equity is plus 83. And of course all of our financial engineering is based upon taking advantage of a lower cost of equity and a lower cost of credit and then using that in order to acquire Bitcoin, which then accrues to the benefit of the equity holders. Let's go to the next slide. So let's look at our products. Strike Strike is structured Bitcoin, it's convertible preferred. So it has some upside via the equity component. At 33% of strike is equity. It has some dividend, an 8% dividend at par right now, an effective yield of 9.1%. And then strike pays rock dividends which means they're tax deferred as you step down your basis.</p><p>And so the tax equivalent adjusted yield is 21.6%. How do you get to that? Well you take the cost of strike, you subtract the equity component and then you look at the effective yield of the remainder and then you look at the tax adjusted effective yield and you end up getting to 21.6%. So this is a misunderstood security, but it's got very compelling offers because on one hand it's an indefinite, a perpetual duration call option on the stock and it's also a perpetual dividend. So if you're a very long term investor that wants the best of both worlds, some upside, some income and if you want risk stripped away, well we've got a BTC rating of 5.2 which means that Bitcoin could fall by 80% and you would still be over collateralized.</p><p>You know, if you bought Bitcoin and it fell by 80%. You lose 80% of your money if you buy this. And bitcoin falls by 80%, you still keep your money, right? It's a principal protection. And so down here at the bottom, I've got a table. And you can see, you know, the effective yield of the things that strike competes against are 1 to 4%. And so this is a very unique thing. It's really, it's higher yield, more upside, longer duration than alternative investments. And let's go to the next slide. Stride is our second credit instrument.</p><p>This is long duration high yield credit. The effective yield is 12.5%. That makes the tax equivalent yield nearly 20%, 19.9%. It's still 4.8 times over collateralized. So Bitcoin can still fall by 75%. You're still over collateralized. And it's got a duration of eight years, which is a McCauley duration. But really what you're getting is you're getting the 10% dividend at par, perpetually, forever. If you compare it to the universe it competes against. The effective yield on most high yield corporate bonds is 6% and they're taxable 6.2%. Leverage loans are 6.8%. They're taxable as normal income.</p><p>You know, preferred stock ETF 6.2%, emerging market debt, 5.6%. So the effective yield of stride is double, but the tax equivalent yield of stride is triple. And so you get triple tax equivalent yield with more collateral coverage. This again is a misunderstood instrument. But if you are seeking maximum cash flows, right? And if you trust bitcoin minimally and you trust the company, then this is a very interesting opportunity for you. The next instrument is Strife strf. Well, that's long duration senior credit. It's cumulative and it's got more protections because there are penalties if the company were ever to suspend a dividend.</p><p>And it's also more highly collateralized. The BTC rating is 7.5. So $7.50 of Bitcoin for every dollar of strife outstanding, the effective yield is 9.1% because it trades above par. And the tax equivalent yield is 14.4%. So when you look at this against comparable assets, the effective yield is double, the tax equivalent yield is triple, and the collateral coverage is 2 to 3x more. This has got a duration of 11 years. And so longer duration. What that means is that if interest rates move up or move down, there's going to be more volatility on this.</p><p>If you believe interest rates are going to dive Then this is a great thing. You would like a long duration instrument. If you believe that interest rates are going to go up, then that would be the opposite. You probably wouldn't. Now let's go on to Stretch. Stretch is the highest degree of financial engineering we've engaged in. Because with Stretch, our goal was to strip the volatility. Strip the, compress the duration, convert the BTC into a pure USD yield and then offer that to the investor. So right now stretch is 10.4% effective yield, but that's a tax equivalent yield of 16%.</p><p>It's just slightly under six times over collateralized. And of course it's the lowest volatility. Our goal with Stretch is, you know, we want to give everybody something that's compromised, something that's competitive with the money market, that pays you 10.4% that is tax deferred. If you walk down the street and you say to someone, do you want a convertible bond? Not sure. Do you want a 20 year crypto bond? Not sure. Do you want a crypto junk bond? Not sure. Would you like a bank account to pay you 10% tax deferred? Yeah. Yeah. Everybody wants a bank account that pays them 10% tax deferred.</p><p>Why wouldn't you? And so this is to be clear, it's not a bank account, it's not even a money market. But we are structuring it to compete with that source of funds. That's what we call it Treasury Credit. It's for corporate treasurers, it's for your family Treasury. It's the money, the money that you probably need to spend in the next 12, 24, 36 months. If you didn't need the money for four years or more, I would say you probably ought to go look at buying Bitcoin. If you don't need the money for a decade, you buy Bitcoin coin, it's a better deal.</p><p>But if you need the money in four months or eight months or two years, or you have 30% of your working capital that's stable, that's a Treasury obligation. And right now your options aren't great. So here we're offering 10.4% effective yield, but 16% tax equivalent yield. If you look at bank accounts, they yield nothing. Money markets are 4% in the US so this is four times better, 4x better than the tax equivalent yield of a money market. Now you'll note it's more volatile, right? The money markets managed to get down to less than 1% or about approximately 1% volatility.</p><p>We're still 8% volatility. And I think that's in some part because we're still seasoning. And so we are going to continue to work to get this volatility down below 8 to 7 to 6. We got to 5%, you know, about a week ago. You know, we don't know how low we can get it, but our goal is to make it the least volatile of our credit instruments. Let's go to the next slide. Fong spoke about return of capital. The point that I want to make is, you know, rock dividends have been around. This is settled tax law since 1910.</p><p>You know, return of capital has been around since 1910. You'll find hundreds of companies that have issued dividends that are return of capital. You'll find oil pipelines, natural gas companies, real estate companies, et cetera. We just happen to have a very compelling business model. The treasury business model allows us to have much greater visibility to return of capital than if you were just a REIT or you were a gas pipeline or something. And so the difference really is 0% upfront dividend tax rate versus 20 to 30 or 30 to 55. And if you got your money in a money market and you live in California or New York City, it's a pretty heavy tax load.</p><p>And so presumably New Yorkers or San Francisco dwellers, when they start to look at this, are going to find it to be pretty compelling. The fact that we expect this to continue for the next 10 years means that we're not just announcing that this quarter is a return of capital. We're expecting the next 40 quarters to be return of capital. And I think that's a pretty material thing. Let's go to the next slide. Now, all of those credit instruments have one impact. They amplify our Bitcoin exposure. So right now, strategy has 11% leverage, 21% amplification.</p><p>Okay? Amplification is the leverage that comes from debt plus the improved performance that comes from equity. Our goal, our target as a company is to drive leverage to zero when we equitize the convertible bonds, and if we don't issue any more bonds and we don't intend to, leverage will go from 11% to 9% to 7% to 5% to 3, to 1, to 0. So our leverage is going to 0. Our target for amplification is to drive the amplification to 30%. So we're going to drive amplification up and drive leverage down. And of course, here you can see on this chart, if we run at a 30% amplification, level.</p><p>You know, what naturally happens is your 200,000 satoshis per share become 560,000 satoshis per share over 10 years. That's a BTC factor of 2.8. That means that we actually perform 2.8 times better than an ETF. That is the source of the premium and the equity. That is the value that's being created by the digital treasury model. And of course, the value creation is a function of the amplification. When you increase leverage, you increase risk, but when you increase amplification, you just increase value creation. So if we get to 30% amplification and we may very well go to 35 or 40% amplification because we're doing it with digital credit.</p><p>And digital credit doesn't have the risk profile of debt. Let's go to the next slide. We are at a historic point. We're kind of at an inflection point. We believe our multiple to nav M NAV has been trending down and has been trending down over time. As the Bitcoin asset class matures, as the volatility decreases. The volatility, by the way, is decreasing in part because of the growth of companies like ours. The maturation of the Bitcoin treasury industry, it's decreasing because of the success of iBIT. It's decreasing because the derivatives market onshore has grown dramatically.</p><p>The derivatives market in IBID has gone from 10 billion to 50 billion. And so people are using those derivatives to damp volatility. And that's very good for the asset class. It's very good for the industry. In the near term, it's resulted probably in some pressure on rmnab. But we think that over time, as the credit investors start to understand the appeal of digital credit, they're going to want to buy more and we're going to sell more and issue more credit. And as the equity investors start to appreciate the uniqueness of the Bitcoin treasury model and especially the uniqueness of our company and our ability to issue digital credit worldwide at scale, we think that that's going to drive an appreciation of the equity.</p><p>Next slide. Why am I so enthusiastic about digital credit? Well, there are seven innovations in digital credit that make it better than traditional credit. So I'm going to take you through the seven things. First of all, traditional credit, like a mortgage, well, it's built on a depreciating house or depreciating warehouse or traditional credit, it's built on collateral that's a depreciating asset. A bunch of fiat currency A corporate product, a corporate service, a corporate warehouse, a bunch of hardware, a data center full of Nvidia chips that are depreciating with a four year useful life. That is collateral which is collapsing.</p><p>It makes it hard to pay a higher yield when you have depreciating asset. But our collateral is Bitcoin is digital capital and Bitcoin is an appreciating asset. So whereas $10 billion of warehouses are most valuable the day they're built, $10 billion of Bitcoin is only going to get more valuable, not less valuable. And so that digital capital is the first big innovation. Next, the second innovation is we're replacing traditional risk with digital risk. Traditional risk, it's opaque, it's heterogeneous, it's discrete. You own 8,700 houses or you own, you're exposed to a portfolio of 47 junk bond issuers and maybe they're fine, but then there's a tariff or there's a trade war or there's a competitive change, or maybe there's a strike or maybe an airplane crashes or there's a COVID lockdown.</p><p>Whenever you have these kind of conventional real world issues, you have a discrete explosion of risk. A forest fire, an earthquake, or a change in a political regime, or a change in tax rates, or a change in customs duties. So traditional risk is opaque, it's heterogeneous, it's discrete. On the other hand, digital risk is transparent, it's homogeneous, it's continuous. You can go to our website and we update the risk model every 15 seconds. And so it is completely continuous. We update the price of Bitcoin, we update the volatility of Bitcoin on a continuous basis. We update the BTC ratings, you can plug in your statistics models into them.</p><p>And of course all the risk is based upon your outlook of btc, ARR, BTC volume, BTC price and BTC rating. So digital risk is something where you don't have to wait for a year for a credit rating agency to publish a new report to tell you whether your favorite airline or your favorite restaurant chain is riskier or less risky. With digital risk you can literally plug into the website and you can recalibrate and calculate your risk every 15 seconds on Saturday morning. And that's a big upgrade. Now there's a third innovation in digital credit. Our third innovation is we don't just all credit is not created equal.</p><p>We don't just issue debt. Debt is credit. Bank deposits are credit. When a bank takes your money, they're creating credit and your bank account pays you whatever they pay you. When you put money in a money market, it's credit, of course, junk bonds, sovereign debt, mortgage backed bonds, they're credit, but they're debt and debt and deposits are liabilities. They amplify risk. If there's a run on the bank, people withdraw their deposits. You're going to have a collapse of the entire banking system. When the debt comes due, when your three year note comes due, when you get to month 34, everybody goes crazy and loses their mind because the capital is getting called away from you.</p><p>Right? If you have a bad quarter in the 12th quarter and you've got four year debt, you amplify risk. The equity collapses, people go crazy. What we've done is use preferred equity. It's not debt. Sometimes people think, okay, well it's a liability, it's equity, it's actually counted as preferred equity is equity on the balance sheet, not debt. It's an asset, not a liability. And so therefore it mitigates risk. How does it mitigate risk? Well, I mean, the first obvious way it mitigates risk is when you sell a billion dollars of bonds. You have to pay them back in five years or seven years or three years.</p><p>When you sell a billion dollars of preferred stock, you never pay it back. So there's a billion dollars of refinance risk that just goes away. The second way that it mitigates risk is that the dividends are approved by the board, they're not coupons. You miss $1 million of coupon payments, you're in default. Whereas if you're short a million dollars of a dividend payment, you can suspend a million dollars, you're not in default. So you could think about preferred equity is permanent capital and shock absorbers to the business model of the company. And therefore digital credit based on preferred equity is dramatically better than digital credit or credit that's based upon debt or deposits.</p><p>The fourth innovation is we didn't just issue preferred equity, we issued perpetual preferred equity. Sometimes banks or issuers issue equity which has got a three year life or a five year life, or a refinance option or a call option or a put option that creates some sort of refinance risk or withdrawal risk. But when you have a perpetual equity, it is permanent capital, right? Your bank might have $100 billion. It's overnight money. Someone can take the hundred billion dollars away from them. You have $100 billion of debt at your airline. It's going to be taken away from you in three to five years when we have $100 billion of preferred equity.</p><p>We have it forever. Like forever. Thousand years just goes on and on and on. Perpetual life. When you have permanent capital, you can make indefinite investments. We can buy Bitcoin to hold for 100 years if we have capital for 100 years. When you have a five year junk bond, you can't make a decision that that's going to. The truth is you have to have decisions that are no longer than like two or three years because you have to keep rolling them because of the refinance and the withdrawal risk. So the perpetual life of the instruments is the fourth big innovation.</p><p>The fifth big innovation is that we took these securities public. This is public credit. A lot of times people sell their credit instruments via 144A offerings to a private market. It's like I sold it to 50 investors and they're traded over the counter. Those are illiquid. They're unbranded. Can anybody name the 17th tranche of bank credit sold by one of the large banks in the US? They have CUSIP numbers. They're traded on Bloomberg's between 37 counterparties. And they all know each other. So it's unbranded, it's illiquid, it's local, it's very difficult to buy it. Even if you wanted to buy it, you would need a professional money manager to even find it for you or buy it for you.</p><p>When you do, there would be 300 basis point credits or bid ask spreads, very big spreads. The thing traded last two weeks ago. That's the problem with private credit. Public credit like STRC, it's liquid. I mean, it traded nearly $100 million today in the market. It's branded, it's got a name stretch, it's global. You can buy it if you're in the UK from your retirement account. It's easy to access. You can buy it on Robinhood, you can buy it on Schwab. And so public securities become public brands. And if you're going to buy a credit instrument, what would you rather have? A credit instrument that's traded by 12 funds in Italy that know each other, or would you rather have a credit instrument that's held by tens or hundreds of thousands of investors worldwide that all refer to it by the name stretch.</p><p>And if it ever gets mispriced or it gets undervalued, they're going to leap in and they're going to put lots of money behind it. When we did the IPO stretch, we priced it at 90. We said we're targeting par 100. There were individual investors that bought $250 million of that instrument. 250 million. Right. The value of a public security, a public credit instrument. If someone goes wacky crazy and decides they want to misprice it, there are people that will walk in and they'll buy 50 million or 100 million or 500 million to fix the market, because they can.</p><p>That does not happen in private credit markets. And so public branded global securities are just better. Let's go to the next innovation, digital creation. Ask yourself, how long does it take for a Bank to create $1 billion worth of home mortgages? How long does it take to issue $1,001 million loans? It's very difficult. It's slow, it's expensive, it's labor intensive. So the creation of traditional credit is very hard. The reason that you have banks with 37 floor buildings that have 27,000 people in them is because the creation of credit is expensive and difficult. On the other hand, we can create a million dollars of credit, $10 million of credit, $100 million of credit, or a billion dollars of credit in 60 seconds on any given trading day.</p><p>It's all automated, it's efficient, it's instant. So digital creation makes this completely scalable. Right? We have a very scalable business model. And you can understand why if someone wanted to buy $10 billion of commercial credit backed by airplanes, it's kind of hard to create the airplanes to back to $10 billion. You can't just create the airplanes in 60 seconds. But we can buy $10 billion of Bitcoin to back $10 billion of digital credit. And we can do it contemporaneous with the demand. So that's the sixth advantage of digital credit. Let's go to the last point.</p><p>The last point is traditional credit is taxable, whether it's fully taxable as a debt instrument or it's partially taxable as qualified dividend. Digital credit is tax deferred income. Right? We pay rock dividends. We pay rock dividends because of the business model, because we have digital capital as the underlying asset, because we have a digital treasury company and a digital treasury company business model, we pay rock dividends. And rock dividends are profound competitive advantage for the credit issuer and for the credit investor. Let's go on next slide. Here you can see the value of the Bitcoin treasury model.</p><p>We have created a flywheel. It's a scalable, tax efficient fixed income generator. You issue digital equity and digital credit, that's tax deferred. We pay dividends on that Credit, they're tax deferred. We purchase Bitcoin with those proceeds and we hold it indefinitely. That's tax deferred. Right. So it's a triple tax deferred business model, scalable, new, never been seen in the history of the capital markets. That's why it'll take people a while to get their head around it. But it really is a beautiful instrument once you understand it. Let's go to the next slide. This digital treasury model allows us to create a digital credit factory.</p><p>If you look at the company, what we're doing is we're manufacturing USD yield for credit investors and we're delivering them that yield in the form of rock dividend. So we're generating tax deferred dividend yields in USD and they're giving us capital. We are then buying bitcoin with that capital. So we are funding the crypto economy. So the crypto economy is a 750 million people that are growing by millions every day that believe in pure global finance and they're engaged in everything under the sun and a thousand exchanges. So we fund that economy and they return to us bitcoin.</p><p>And Bitcoin is 121 millionth of all of the capital in that economy. And so the credit investors get their yield, we get our Bitcoin and then we're shipping and delivering BTC yield to the equity investors. So the equity investors want to outperform bitcoin and so the equity investors get amplified BTC exposure, which you can quantify via BTC yield. The credit investors, they get their USD yield. The equity investors, they're getting tax deferred growth. The credit investors get tax deferred dividends. It all creates a very powerful feedback loop. And you know, our long term forecast is Bitcoin outperforms the S and P.</p><p>I expect it'll go up 30% over a year for the next 20 years. So we're generating BTC NAB growth and we're generating operating income and that is tax deferred. And so it's a very powerful business model once you understand it. Let's go to the next slide. If you want to quantify rock dividends a little bit better, you know, if you actually have $100 instrument, $100 credit instrument that pays you 10% in par if you reinvest those dividends every quarter, and it's a taxable dividend or it's a taxable coupon at 37% tax rate. And that's what a bond would be or a money market or a corporate bond or a junk bond, you're going to have $187 at the end of the 10 years.</p><p>If you get that payment in a qualified dividend and you pay a 20% tax rate, you're going to have $221 at the end of the 10 years. So it's 18% more. And of course, if you receive those dividends as rock dividends and reinvest the rock dividends every quarter for 10 years, you're going to end up with $269 at the end of the period. That's 44% more. So clearly rock dividends are compelling for the investor, you know, and they get more compelling as you live in a higher tax jurisdiction. And as the tax rates go up, they get even more compelling.</p><p>Let's go to the next slide. So digital credit opportunities, you know, how do you break this down? Next? This is Stretch versus every other credit instrument in the United States. On average, what you can see is stretch is offering 16.5% tax equivalent yield. The hottest thing in traditional credit is private credit. It's 7.6%, investment grade bonds 4.7, money markets 4.1, commercial paper 3.9. Your bank account, 40 basis points. So what you can see is Stretch is offering more than double anything in the traditional credit market. But it looks sort of like four times better in the U.S.</p><p>let's think about all the digital credit instruments. What you see here is that digital credit is simply superior to conventional credit. Like the worst instrument or the lowest yielding instrument we have. STRF Stripe has got a tax equivalent yield of 14.4. It's double the best thing in the traditional credit market. Stretches. Quadruple stride is five times what you'll get from a money market. And Strike is even higher after you adjust for the equity component. So you can see these numbers are off the charts. And it's going to take a while for credit investors and for the market in general to adjust and digest this.</p><p>But we believe the digital credit is the killer app digital capital. And we believe that the most compelling business model is a digital treasury company built on digital capital issuing digital credit. And this chart shows you why. Now this is the U.S. the U.S. has the highest risk free rates in the Western world. So let's look at the next chart. What I'm showing you here is the Stretch rate. It's our short duration sort of one month adjusting credit instrument versus the one month rate for the US Dollar. And then let's look at the currency in Australia.</p><p>It's 3.5%. Canadian one month rate is 2.7%. Korean won 2.5. European 1.9 and falling. Singapore 1.4 JPY. The yen is 50 basis points and the Swiss franc is negative. So what you might take away from this is that we have an opportunity not just in the U.S. but in the Middle east, in Great Britain, in Australia and Canada and Korea, and everywhere in Europe and Singapore and Japan and in Switzerland. And we're studying each of these markets and we're thinking very hard because we can create a digital credit instrument in great British pounds, or in Canadian or in Euros or in Swiss francs.</p><p>So we create the currency we want, we put the appropriate amount of risk on it, we strip away the duration and then we start selling pure yield. That is the compelling use case. And so are we on a mission? Yeah, we're on a mission. We're on a mission to basically give everybody a bank account that yields 10% or in this case a money market that yields 16.5% tax at Club One. Right. We want to change people's view toward money, change their view toward credit. And, and it's not very complicated to figure out why you might want to do it.</p><p>And I don't think it'll be complicated for people to figure out why they might want to own these instruments. Next slide. So let me just end with an observation. We're in the business of creating digital equity by harnessing digital capital and using the digital capital to create digital credit instruments. So the equity MSTR is digital equity. If you want amplified BTC because you kind of want enhanced exposure to digital capital and you want exposure to digital credit, then you would buy the equity. The price you'll pay is 62 volume. It'll be very volatile. Now the next option you have is Bitcoin.</p><p>And so let's look at that. If what you want is to strip away the counterparty risk and the currency risk, right? And you want a long term store of value, you don't buy the Equity, you buy BTC and that's 42 volume. Now what if you want a mixture of upside and quarterly income, you would buy strike 28 Vol. If you just want to maximize your cash flows, then you would buy SRD 16 volume. And if your idea is you want the highest seniority and the greatest degree of investor protection, then you would go to strife and you get a lower volume 14 Vol.</p><p>And then the final option of course is if you're looking for stability, simplicity and minimal volatility, you go to a Treasury credit Instrument, which is strc, stripe, stretch. And when you put all these things on the same chart, I think it becomes pretty clear what we're doing and why we're doing it. And every one of these instruments is aimed at a different type of investor. We couldn't create the credit without the equity and without the capital. And of course, they're all reflexive, right? The more credit we sell, the better it is for BTC and for the equity.</p><p>And. And as the equity appreciates, that's good for the credit and that's good for btc. And as Bitcoin appreciates, that's good for the credit, that's good for the equity. So it's a very elegant business where we're very blessed and we feel honored to have the opportunity and couldn't be more excited about it. Let's go to the next slide. So what I would say here is, if you're not sure what you want and you've listened to me so far, then you want stretch, right? For those people that aren't sure what they think about Bitcoin or how they feel about the company or digital credit or anything, the simplest idea is 10.5% dividends paid monthly.</p><p>For those who like money. It's just that simple. You like money, you trust the company, but you don't understand anything else. You collect 10.5% dividends, they're tax deferred, they're paid monthly. Tell your friends, and I'll just end with our last slide, which is our principles that I want to remind everybody you know. Our principles are to buy Bitcoin, hold Bitcoin, treat all our investors with respect, prioritize the equity, generate positive yield, innovate with fixed income securities, maintain a healthy, robust balance sheet, promote global adoption of BTC as a Treasury reserve asset. And I want to thank everybody for your time and also for your support.</p><p>We couldn't do it without you. Thank you.</p><h>Questions And Answers</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shirish Jajodia:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Michael. We are now going to proceed to the interactive live Q and A session of our webinar. I would like to invite all of our Q and A guests to come on video, and we look forward to hearing your questions. We'll go one at a time. I'll call your names and you can direct your question to the management team. For the first question, I would like to invite Andrew Hart, a research analyst from btig. Andrew.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Harte:</emphasis></p><p>Hey, team, thanks for having me on. I appreciate all the details in the presentation, as always. So a lot of our investor questions are focused on the company's ability to pay dividends. Especially as the preferred equity strategy continues to grow. Can you just shed some additional color and light on plans to fund those dividends? And then if there was a period where the M Nav compressed or was even below one times, how could that plan potentially change?\u00a0Thanks and appreciate it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Phong Le:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, I can cover this one. And Andrew talked about this a little bit earlier. Right now our dividends and interest on our convertible notes total $689 million. And our primary strategy when our M NAV is above 1 is to fund that through ATM issuances. And just to remind everybody, in the last 12 months we've issued about $27 billion of equity, which means that that's about the $650 million or so is about 2.6% of how much equity we've raised. So we clearly have the ability to raise equity to cover our dividend payments and our interest.</p><p>The big question is what happens when it becomes dilutive to shareholders to issue equity? And when we're below 1x nav, or if we go below 1x nav, what would we do? And there are other things that we've explored and talked about. We could sell equity derivatives, we could sell Bitcoin derivatives and we could sell high basis Bitcoin to cover our dividend needs for our preferreds. What's important when we do those things and we've talked about it, is we want to preserve the rock dividends on our preferreds. So we'd have to do them in ways that are avoid positive tax E and P.</p><p>We wouldn't do things like sell equity or Bitcoin derivatives that would cause our E and P to be above zero. We are able to sell high basis Bitcoin potentially that a loss and cause negative E and P and offset that with other Bitcoin that would cause positive enp. We wouldn't sell the software business. I know there are questions about that because that would cause income and positive E and P. And so we want to preserve the rock dividends, the preferable tax deferred treatment of. So those are some of the things that we would do in that scenario.</p><p>We don't anticipate that scenario, but we do have plans in place.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Harte:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shirish Jajodia:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. For the next question, I'd like to invite Pierre Rochart.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>Hey, thank you for organizing this and thank you for the invitation. It was mentioned that there would be marketing and advertising around the preferreds. What do you anticipate that expense looking like and what the return on investment would be for those efforts.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Phong Le:</emphasis></p><p>I can cover that. You know, we're just starting to get into this. You actually just saw one of our advertisements for those who like money stretch. Right. And so we'll start to experiment with paid advertising on platforms like an Excel or YouTube. I think whatever the expense is, it would be quite minimal compared to the increased inflows that we hope to drive into our preferreds. Right. And I think we've gone through in the past, you know, we're able to raise an incremental billion dollars in a preferred. We immediately turn around, buy Bitcoin, and that's immediately accretive to bitcoin yield and bitcoin per share. I don't expect we're going to spend a ton of money up front all experiment and see what are the right channels and what causes. What causes people to wake up and understand the bitcoin credit machine that we have. And then in addition to just digital marketing, we're out meeting with investors, meeting with potential investors quite a bit now.</p><p>And I think there's just about a feet on the street between Mike, myself, Andrew Sharesh, CJ and the entire team.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Saylor:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, I would just piggyback on that by saying, I just spent a lot of time in the Schwab studios and recording content to go on the Schwab network. I was in Vegas@money 2020. I was in Austin at a credit conference. I'll be in Naples, Palm Beach. Got a big road show throughout the Middle east for a week and a half coming up. So there's a lot of outreach. We get invited to speak at a lot of conferences. We also get invited to speak on television. Right. So, you know, some of the better marketing channels is just go on Bloomberg, go on Fox, go on cnbc.</p><p>And I think that the difference between what we're doing now and what we were doing a year ago is a year ago people said, well, what is bitcoin? Is it going away? And can you sell me on bitcoin? Now we're beyond the bitcoin going away. Everybody's embraced it as digital gold. Now when we go on Bloomberg or Fox or CNBC, we're saying, you know, stretch, it's 10.5% dividends, tax deferred. You might want to check it out. So we have it. By the way, you know how I used to say it takes like, you know, 1,000 hours to understand Bitcoin or 100 hours to, you know, to figure this out.</p><p>It doesn't take that many hours to figure out that something that yields 10.5% tax deferred is better than your existing Money market or bank account. So we've got simpler messages and we're taking them to every channel. We will try tradfi. We don't think we can sell the bitcoin message in 30 seconds to 70 year old, Conservative traditional retirees. But we do think that we can sell stretch in 15 seconds or 30 seconds to military retirees that want to live happily ever after. And we know this anecdotally because it's happening everywhere we go, everybody we talk to.</p><p>It's the simplest product for us to explain. It's hard to sell convertible bonds, it's hard to sell 30 year crypto bonds, it's hard to sell bitcoin to the rank and file. But everybody wants a bank account that pays 10% that you don't have to pay tax on. So, you know, we're going to work every possible marketing channel and in order to get the word out. And the good news there is we're getting an avalanche of requests to speak. Everybody wants to talk to us now, right? So just around the time that everybody wants to interview us, everybody wants to talk to us, we have the simplest message.</p><p>You put it in 30 seconds. And so it's a very exciting time for marketing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shirish Jajodia:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Pierre. For the next question, I'd like to invite Mark Parmer, a research analyst from Benchmark.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mark Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Yes, thanks. And thanks for taking my questions. We have already seen the beginnings of consolidation within the digital asset treasury space. Is there a circumstance under which strategy would step into the market as an acquirer of a bitcoin treasury company that was trading at a materially lower MNAV in a transaction that would be by definition accretive as a means of accelerating its acquisition of bitcoins?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Saylor:</emphasis></p><p>I'll give my opinion and then Fong can chime in. You know, we've done 84 acquisitions of Bitcoin and every one of them was homogeneous, transparent. And you could instantly calculate whether it's accretive or dilutive.</p><p>And they were generally all accretive. And our focus is to do high speed, transparent digital transactions and sell digital credit and buy Bitcoin. We think that it's a big advantage of the company that the business model is so transparent. Predictable. Clear. Because the business model is predictable, that makes it easy for the equity analyst to make their decisions, and it also makes it easy for the credit analyst to assess a credit quality. So generally we don't have any plans to pursue M and A activity, even if it would look to be potentially accretive. It might be, but there's just a Lot of uncertainty.</p><p>And these things tend to stretch out six to nine months or a year. And an idea that looks good when you start might not still be a good idea six months later. And, and it can be very distracting for the management team while you're either integrating or pursuing those things. So our management team is laser like, focused on selling the four credit instruments that we have and then expanding the reach of our digital credit instruments internationally. And of course improving the quality of our balance sheet, equitizing and convertible bonds. Those are all the things that we're very excited about as an operating company.</p><p>The great thing about operating companies, yeah, you have the option sometime in the indefinite future to do something and if you're walking down the street and there's a billion dollars and you can bend over and pick it up for a nickel, you have the option to do it. And I don't think we would ever say we would never, never, never ever. But what we would say is the plan, the strategy, the focus is sell digital credit, improve the balance sheet, buy Bitcoin and communicate that to the credit and the equity investors. Fong, you have anything to add on that?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Phong Le:</emphasis></p><p>No, I don't have anything to add. I would generally agree with what you said. We've been a software company for nearly 30 years or over 30 years, and software technology M and A is very difficult. There's always something hiding behind what you actually think you purchase. And I think that I would say that the same thing is about acquiring Bitcoin, treasury company companies.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mark Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>And just one more question with regard to your intention to tap international markets from a capital raising perspective, is the idea that you would effectively market the same for perpetual preferred instruments that you currently have, but just to different markets around the world, or would you be designing new instruments that were specific to those geographies? Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Saylor:</emphasis></p><p>It'll be the latter. We will design. If we're going into Canada, we would design an instrument that's denominated in Canadian CAD and we would offer it to Canadian investors on a Canadian exchange. So it'll be a native product because if you're the investor there, you don't want to take currency risk.</p><p>And if we go into Europe, we would create a euro denominated instrument and we would offer something that represents everything we've learned from the first four credit instruments. If we could improve it, we would. But primarily the Europeans want a euro currency instrument in Europe and every international investor does. What we've discovered is a lot of European investors, they can buy the American instrument. So if they wanted a US dollar based treasury credit instrument they would buy stretch so they can already get to it. In fact, one of the more pleasant surprises I learned is we accumulated a ton of European and British investors in 2020 because could buy MSTR and they couldn't buy Bitcoin.</p><p>Our digital credit instruments are already global. If you want US dollar credit instruments, then you're already buying them globally. We think the big unlock is that we can create a digital credit in any currency. We can take JPY risk or we can take Euro. We can solve that problem. And there's people that will buy a billion dollars of something if they don't have to take the currency risk and they'll buy nothing if they have to take the currency risk. So our job is to bridge that capital divide. And so when we do it, we'll do it with a native instrument and a native currency on a native exchange.</p><p>That is going to be presumably the most compelling credit instrument in that capital market that anybody's ever seen.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shirish Jajodia:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Mark. For the next question, I would like to invite Natalie Brunel.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you so much for including me. Beyond Bitcoin price action, can you identify two or three very specific challenges that are serving as headwinds for the growth and performance of strategy and even the Bitcoin treasury industry more broadly and what actions can be taken to overcome those?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Saylor:</emphasis></p><p>I think Fong highlighted some of them in the discussion of S and P credit ratings issues. The fact that Bitcoin is not viewed as capital by the traditional credit ratings industry. So I think the view of Bitcoin and the collateral value of Bitcoin and the traditional views under baseline rules, under the rules that govern our banking system, our insurance companies and our credit rating agencies. I think that that's a structural thing. You know, like when FASB didn't allow you to recognize gains, but they made you recognize losses and you had indefinite intangible accounting, that was pretty crippling.</p><p>I think that we fixed that and I think that fixing capital risk rules will be a big one. I think the second is banking acceptance, custody and banks issuing credit on Bitcoin. So we're hearing rumors and we've heard that a number of major banks in the US in the first half of 2026 will start to buy Bitcoin, sell bitcoin, custody Bitcoin and issue credits and margin lines against the native Bitcoin asset. That will be great for them, that will be great for Bitcoin, that will be great for us. That will accelerate adoption. I would say neither of These are things that I would ask for government help for.</p><p>We don't need a law to fix it. What we do need to do is lobby the banks, lobby the insurance companies. Maybe I should replace that word with educate. Educate the banks, educate the insurance companies, educate the credit rating agencies, and then finally educate the traditional fixed income investor, the retiree and the corporate treasurer. Educate them that there actually now is a better option. So I think that's what we need to do in order to grow the industry right now. That's going to be our focus over the next few years.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shirish Jajodia:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Natalie. For the next question, I would like to invite Brian Dobson, research analyst from Clear Street.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brian Dobson:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, so you received a credit rating and I agree that that's a very important first step to opening doors at pension funds and insurance companies. I know it's very early days, but are you already having conversations with those investors and if so, what's the feedback? And then as a second part to. That question, would you have the preferreds and converts rated separately? I mean, I think a lot of investors will probably just infer instrument ratings from the general company rating. But what are your thoughts on that?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Phong Le:</emphasis></p><p>I can start on that. Brian. We had before we received a rating conversations with large institutions, insurance companies, pension funds that said that they could not easily, without significant capital penalties, invest in an unrated instrument and that they were quite interested in the structure of what we provided but just couldn't do it. So that was why we went and pursued a rating with a major rating agency.</p><p>It's one of the reasons. So I do think this opens up doors to some of the categories that you just mentioned before. And I think it's not going to be an avalanche like tomorrow. But as we go out and market and Mike has discussions and I and Andrew all go out in the market and we start talking to these folks, I think their, their thought process will certainly change over time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brian Dobson:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. And then I just wanted to follow. Up on an earlier question about selling into Asia and Europe. Both of those markets represent or have rather unique regulatory hurdles, I guess. How far along are you in those markets?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Phong Le:</emphasis></p><p>We're pretty far along. You're right that that's part of the reason why we need to create products that are very specific. What exchange is it retail focused? Is it institutional focused? Is it regulated? Is it unregulated? What is the tax regime? Look what we've done since the beginning of the year with prefers as we went uphill against a market that wasn't familiar with a big coin back, perpetual preferred with A return of capital tax structure and it took us nine months and we were able to raise $6.5 billion or $6 billion. Right. And because we did that, I think we sort of cornered this market for a good period of time.</p><p>I think our ability to go understand the regulatory structures, the tax structure is, yeah, it's, it's harder than in the US but once we've broken through that, that creates a competitive moat for us to be able to offer products that clearly are superior to what's out there. So we welcome the challenge, I guess, is what I'd say.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brian Dobson:</emphasis></p><p>Great. Excellent. Thanks a lot.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shirish Jajodia:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Brian. For the next question, I would like to invite Adam Livingston.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks so much for having me. Congrats on the great quarter and the credit rating. The Japanese bitcoin Treasury company Metaplanet has recently announced a share buyback program with the intention of being able to strategically deploy buybacks at times that would increase bitcoin per share for the equity holders. Would strategy ever consider adopting a similar program as means to increase bitcoin exposure for shareholders if MSTR ever trades below a 1xmnav long?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Saylor:</emphasis></p><p>You want to start?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Phong Le:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, I'll start with that. I don't think there is anything that we wouldn't do that would create incremental bitcoin yield that increase more bitcoin per share for our shareholders and preserves our ROC dividends for our preferred holders. Right. And so we have an open buyback authorization already. We've done it a long time ago. I think the last buyback we did was 2018 or so. It's not our primary strategy, but it's an option if we were to go down that path. Mike, you want to add anything?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Saylor:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, I would say we're open minded toward a variety of options. Right now our preference is to grow the capital base, but if it was compelling enough, we would look at it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you so much. Appreciate it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shirish Jajodia:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Adam. We have two more questions to go. For the next one I will invite Lance Vetanza, our research analyst from TD Kavan.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lance Vitanza:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks guys. The 30% BTC yield target for 2025, I'm surprised you maintained it given the recent decel in bitcoin accumulation. Getting to 30% would seem to require you to raise at least another couple of billion dollars. And we only have two months left in the year. You're not going to get there on ATMs alone. Are you currently contemplating a big underwritten transaction perhaps in an overseas market? Is that sort of how you get to the 30%?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Phong Le:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, we need to raise roughly $2 billion, you know, in a non dilutive fashion tour of capital. And you've seen us do that at quick pace in a short period of time. We have two months left to go and so we'll be racing and we'll see what we can accomplish. Right. We're always working, always trying new things, developing new things. And this credit factory that Mike talks about, we're very bullish on. Obviously we can't say exactly what we're going to do when, but it's two good months, 60 days right before the holidays.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shirish Jajodia:</emphasis></p><p>Great, thank you. And for the last question, I will invite Ben Workman from Stripe.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, cherish. And thank you guys for taking my question. Over the last 12 months, strategy has been extremely successful at building the capital base and expanding the balance sheet using primarily equity in the IPOs from the preferred markets. And over that 12 months you saw MSTR underperform Bitcoin in a fairly significant manner. Do you guys view the strategic priorities moving forward as focusing more on increasing amplification and less on expanding the balance sheet? And how has this past year informed your go forward strategy and how you might prioritize the prefs over the common equity moving forward? Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Saylor:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, that's an open ended question. So I'll start and then Fong or Andrew may have something to add. Clearly with equity, I would say if you're going to own Bitcoin, you have four year or longer time horizon. If you're going to own amplified Bitcoin, a company that aims to be more volatile than Bitcoin, you can't have a lower time horizon. So you probably need a longer time horizon. So we manage the company such that we think 10 years from now we're going to create an insane amount of shareholder value. And that doesn't mean we're looking for 10 year payoff.</p><p>We're generally thinking if it doesn't return what we expected within four years, we'd be very disappointed. But we never do anything where we demand to get the payback in four months. And so we don't have a four month time horizon or even a year time horizon. And we think that generally, I would say if your time horizon is 12 weeks, you should own the STRC, right? You really should go to the short end of the risk curve and the short end of the duration curve because that one we're trying to strip volatility away. And if your time horizon is 10 years and if you are Bitcoin maxi, then maybe you like the equity or you like Bitcoin the credit instruments, I would say if we wanted to raise the max amount of capital, then we could do two things that we don't do.</p><p>One thing we could do is we could just open up the ATM and we could sell stock at any M nav, any week, all the time. And what you've seen is we don't do that. You know, after the red sweep, when there was a massive enthusiasm, we would sell a billion or two or three billion dollars of stock. Like a billion in a week or two billion in a week. And so you see, we're not shy. When the market is strong and the premiums are high, we would go very hard. But you see a lot of weeks where we sell nothing.</p><p>We could have sold a billion dollars of equity a week. We chose not to sell any equity. If the equity is weak and it's cr, it's almost certain. In fact, it is certain. We're not the ones doing it. We're watching because our view is we only sell into strength and we only sell into strength when we like the premium. So we have actively decided we don't want to maximize capital by selling equity. And then I think the other thing is, just like we could raise a billion dollars of equity in a few days if we wanted to.</p><p>I could also pick up the phone and I could raise a billion dollars overnight in debt. If I just said we wanted to do a pipe deal with a debt investor, I would have 12 firms over the weekend and by Monday morning, we could have raised 2, 3, 4, 5, $6 billion. They would be licking their chops and delighted to give us the capital. They would want to be senior to all the other creditors in the capital structure. And what they would do is they would undermine the creditworthiness of the preferred instruments that we actually want to sell.</p><p>So you could just assume with our 75 billion of capital right now, we've already chosen not to raise 20 billion or 30 billion. We could be $100 billion, but we'd be 100 billion. And the risk profile, the leverage wouldn't be 11%. The leverage would go up. And so we actively decided that we don't want to generate leverage. We're literally on a path to drive leverage down. We're also on a path. We've decided we don't want to do deals that don't have positive BTC yield. But more importantly, we're on a mission. The mission is to create the digital credit market.</p><p>So I think the company has two speeds, well, maybe more than two speeds when we're Coasting, when the credit markets don't offer us anything compelling and the equity markets aren't compelling, we are coasting. And in my mind, I think that that is a $75 billion company growing 30% a year for the next 20 years. So that is an idol. And then for those of you who know me, you know, I believe in the Hippocratic oath, do no harm. And so the risk free rate, the rate the company is going to get, the 30% a year for 20 years if we take no risk.</p><p>So how do you know, what can we do where we feel like it's worthwhile? And of course, if we sell credit, we can take that 30% to 40% or to 50%. But we have an agenda here. The agenda is not, the agenda is not to artfully manage the balance sheet. It's like if you told me, well, you could issue $10 billion of junk five to seven years and roll them every year and roll them every quarter and you could pursue a credit strategy based on debt that gets you a lot more capital and you're continually rolling it.</p><p>And you would do that with 144A offerings. We could like fire up a $2 billion 144A offering next week. And we it. But the point is, we don't want to be the revolutionary company that adopted digital capital, that grew the company with conventional traditional credit. We want to be the revolutionary company that discovered digital capital, that then went on to discover and found the digital credit market. And you know, when you're just rolling a bunch of five to seven year bonds and when you're, you know, when you're opportunistic, then you know, you're careening toward the future with an advantage.</p><p>I want MSTR to stand for monster. We want to create a monster company. We don't want to careen toward the future with an advantage. You know, we don't want to be the talented fighter, you know, that kind of wins and loses and mostly wins and is a little bit sloppy and undisciplined. We want to create the digital credit instruments that are two to four times better than everything in a $300 trillion market. And we want to eat the world, right? And we want to sell $100 billion of them. And after we sell 10 billion, then 20 billion, then 40 billion, then 80 billion, when people go, well, aren't you levered? We want to say, well, you know, actually our leverage is zero.</p><p>Huh? What? Wait, what? We have 30% amplification, but we don't have 100 billion of debt. We have 100 billion of equity that happens to actually amplify the common equity. Let me educate you on a new way to build a company. So I would say you want to boil that down. It's a very disciplined growth strategy. We would rather coast and have a bulletproof balance sheet and a $75 billion company growing 30% a year than to stretch for capital or stretch for some kind of yield, but undermine the balance sheet and take on credit risk because someone says, I'll give you $10 billion tomorrow.</p><p>And it's senior to STRC. We just created volatility and we crumpled the credit of the instrument that is going to provide a comfortable retirement to a billion people. I don't want to be the dude that made a good trade, that made 25 or made $50 billion by trading bitcoin by using cheap corporate money. We don't want to be the company that made 25 or $50 billion or a hail Mary or maybe we lost it by whatever borrowing money, however we can get it to buy bitcoin. We want to be the company that provided a comfortable retirement to a billion people and change the world, right? We want to change the monetary system.</p><p>I want everybody to get up in America and say, I'm not getting paid 10% tax deferred from my bank or from my money market. That's not fair. That's an abomination. I'm going to tell all my friends that I'm going to. I'm so mad about it. I'm going to go tell my hundred people that I know they all need to pull their money out of the money market. They need to buy, stretch. And we want to be in a position where we can accommodate that demand. And so what you have is, is the money that comes easy is always the money that comes with strings attached.</p><p>And I've learned that over 35, 40 years. And I think the people in the bitcoin treasury market, they're learning it now. The easy money is the toxic money. What you really want is you want to create a revolutionary new product that solves a problem for $300 trillion of investors and for billions of people. And you know what? When we sell a billion dollars worth of digital credit, they're giving us the money forever, and we're taking no credit risk. But the quid pro quo is we're giving them 10% tax deferred, right? And so I would rather pay 10% tax deferred and get the money forever than pay 5% deferred and get the Money in the form of a junk bond and pay a taxable 5% coupon.</p><p>Even if you wanted to give it to me and Ben, you can see the obvious reason why the world's full of 50,000 companies that will give you the 5% taxable. How many companies are in the world that will give you 10% gleefully, enthusiastically, as a rock dividend, and then do everything in their power to actually issue more dividends? So for us, the credit is the product, right? The aspiration or the offering is a comfortable retirement to everybody who's a credit investor. That's the offering. If we can do it by selling equity, we will. But when the equity is dilutive, we won't.</p><p>And we won't do debt, because debt is a conventional credit idea. It's a 20th century idea, I think I laid out with my seven differentiators for digital credit. We think that digital credit is an inversion of everybody's value system. Every other credit issuer in the world gets up and says, how do I cripple the credit and pay you the lowest coupon and maximize the advantages to my company? And we get up every day and say, how do we create the greatest credit instrument that pays the highest tax? Tax equivalent cash flows? That's going to be best for the buyer, right? For the.</p><p>For the investor. So that's the answer to your question, hopefully.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shirish Jajodia:</emphasis></p><p>Excellent.

According to news reporting originating from Changsha, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"In the background of high frequency and intensity forest fires driven by future warming and a drying climate, early detection and effective control of fires are extremely important to reduce losses. Meteorological satellite imagery is commonly used for near-real-time forest fire monitoring, thanks to its high temporal resolution.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Scientific Research Fund of Hunan Provincial Education Department; Science And Technology Innovation Platform And Talent Plan Project of Hunan Province; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province; Field Observation And Research Station of Dongting Lake Natural Resource Ecosystem, Ministry of Natural Resources. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Central South University of Forestry and Technology: \"To address the misjudgments and omissions caused by solely relying on changes in infrared band brightness values and a single image in forest fire early discrimination, this paper constructs the angle slope indexes ANIR, AMIR, AMNIR, ANIR, and AMIR based on the reflectance of the red band and near-infrared band, the brightness temperature of the mid-infrared and far-infrared band, the difference between the AMIR and ANIR, and the index difference between time-series images. These indexes integrate the strong inter-band correlations and the reflectance characteristics of visible and short-wave infrared bands to simultaneously monitor smoke and fuel biomass changes in forest fires. We also used the decomposed three-dimensional OTSU (maximum inter-class variance method) algorithm to calculate the segmentation threshold of the sub-regions constructed from the AMNIR data to address the different discrimination thresholds caused by different time and space backgrounds. In this paper, the Himawari-8 satellite imagery was used to detect forest fires based on the angle slope indices thresholds algorithm (ASITR), and the fusion of the decomposed three-dimensional OTSU and ASITR algorithm (FDOA). Results show that, compared with ASITR, the accuracy of FDOA decreased by 3.41% (0.88 vs. 0.85), the omission error decreased by 52.94% (0.17 vs. 0.08), and the overall evaluation increased by 3.53% (0.85 vs.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"0.88). The ASITR has higher accuracy, and the fusion of decomposed three-dimensional OTSU and angle slope indexes can reduce forest fire omission error and improve the overall evaluation.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Forest Fire Discrimination Based on Angle Slope Index and Himawari-8.

DNR staff have been mobilized to 12 different states and provinces, including 20 individuals supporting the ongoing suppression efforts in Canada.</p><p>Three wildland fire engines are currently stationed in Oregon, packaged as part of a larger task force responding to various longer-duration fires, allowing local resources to focus on responding to emerging fires. Six DNR staff are in northern Manitoba, serving in overhead support roles as well as a few assigned to a multi-state agency hand crew. Another DNR engine is responding to fires in northern California.</p><p>Personnel and fire suppression equipment are allocated to these fires through mutual aid agreements outlined by federal firefighting agencies and the Great Lakes Forest Fire Compact, which is comprised of Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota as well as Manitoba and Ontario, Canada. The Compact's main goal is to promote resource sharing throughout the Great Lakes region, including personnel, equipment, information, training and technology.</p><p>A newly formalized and nationally accredited Wisconsin DNR Incident Management Team (IMT Type 3) is also on standby for western fire support. The team has 10 core positions and can be mobilized to assist a local agency by providing a structured approach to incident response, resource allocation and communication.</p><p>Requests for wildland fire support from other agencies are not uncommon. On average, the DNR sends an estimated 60 personnel and equipment annually to support out-of-state fire assignments across the U.S. and Canada. In the past, the DNR has also brought in out-of-state resources to help fight wildfires in Wisconsin during peak fire season.</p><p>The sharing of federal and provincial resources helps all agencies make more efficient use of available resources. Other added values of out-of-state fire assignments include increased training opportunities, leadership and the ability to gain outside experience that can be brought home to enhance Wisconsin's fire management programs.</p><p>The DNR assesses the state's priorities before committing out-of-state resources. With recent widespread rain and green vegetation across the state, wildfire activity has subsided, and there is a minimal fire risk here in Wisconsin. This has allowed the DNR to shift focus and help support national wildfire efforts.</p><p>Nearly 70 active large-scale wildfires are burning over a million acres in the U.S. alone. Much of this wildfire activity is occurring in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona and California and is related to dry lightning strikes in dense wooded areas with remote access.</p><p>The Wisconsin firefighters and engines are slated to be on assignment for two weeks or until the fire severity subsides. Several more Wisconsin resources have been made available and could be assigned to fires in the coming weeks. The DNR anticipates additional mobilizations over the coming weeks as the western fire situation increases and local resources are depleted.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1127262245</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GCG-N3G3-SCFN-33GF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"571\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 29, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
