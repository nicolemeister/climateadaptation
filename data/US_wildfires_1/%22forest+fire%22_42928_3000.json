The Coalition, comprised of over 150 corporate and financial institution partners, is introducing three new restoration sites and expanding six existing projects, increasing investment in areas that have significant potential for positive global impact. This development brings the total number of Priceless Planet Coalition's restoration projects to 22, further solidifying its dedication to restoring vital ecosystems worldwide.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This expansion is a crucial step towards the coalition's goal of funding the restoration of 100 million trees. The addition of these new sites and the enhancement of current projects underscore the coalition's continuous efforts to maximize benefits on climate, communities, and biodiversity.</p><p>The project portfolio of the Priceless Planet Coalition includes diverse geographical representation in the following locations: Asia Pacific (Australia, Cambodia, China, the Philippines, India, and now Thailand as well); Latin America (Brazil, Colombia, Guatemala, and now including High Andes restoration sites in Ecuador and Peru); Europe (France, Portugal, Spain, Scotland); Middle East &amp; Africa (Madagascar, Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Malawi, United Arab Emirates); and North America (Mexico, United States, Canada).</p><p>New Restoration Sites</p><p>The three new sites have been chosen based on their potential for strong positive impacts on climate, biodiversity, and local communities. This expansion reflects the coalition's approach to selecting locations that have strong implementation partners and socially and ecologically appropriate restoration strategies.</p><p>One of the new sites is in the High Andes, where coordinating organizations Global Forest Generation (GFG) and Asociacion de Ecosistemas Andinos (ECOAN) are powering an ambitious restoration initiative, Accion Andina. This initiative will help protect and restore native forest ecosystems across the Andes, including Ecuador and Peru. These ecosystems act as the water towers of South America by absorbing and redistributing moisture and glacial meltwater to feed streams, rivers, and major metropolitan areas, all the way to the Amazon. The absence of healthy, native forests leads to detrimental drought and flood cycles, endangering local economies and prompting migration to urban centers. Accion Andina is committed to working with local communities to restore these ecosystems by planting and restoring trees. In tandem with restoration efforts, the initiative includes community engagement activities such as building water catchment systems, wells, and reservoirs, conducting forest fire prevention and management trainings; distributing clean cookstoves; providing livestock management support; developing irrigation and water infrastructure; and offering literacy programs.</p><p>\"Accion Andina has already planted millions of trees in the high Andes and involved tens of thousands of local people to bring back native forests and water for the continent. We are on a mission to grow this locally-led initiative into a global movement, involving diverse communities, cultures, and sectors all united to protect and restore vital ecosystems for decades to come,\" says Florent Kaiser, Global Forest Generation CEO and Accion Andina co-lead. \"The Priceless Planet Coalition is an essential partner that will help us take continued action towards creating resilient communities and landscapes in this century of change.\"</p><p>Across the globe in the Eastern Himalayas of India, 210 hectares of forest will be restored in partnership with ATREE . According to Conservation International, the Eastern Himalayan region is extraordinarily rich in biodiversity, containing one-twelfth of all species on the planet, while also supporting the livelihoods and survival of nearly a billion people who depend on its natural resources. With over 200 indigenous groups, this region serves as a critical water source to millions both upstream and downstream and is home to species such as the Indian elephant, Bengal tiger, and snow leopard. Despite its ecological importance, this region ranks among the most climate-vulnerable globally. Since 2000, it has lost 9.5% of its green cover, and in 2022 alone, 1.5 million people lost their homes to extreme weather events. The Priceless Planet Coalition's work to fund restoration in the Eastern Himalaya will aim to support the restoration of the region's biodiversity, while mitigating climate change and supporting the local communities.</p><p>\"Co-identifying and co-designing restoration activities with relevant stakeholders in the region will be the primary focus of our work. Biodiversity and ecosystems are inextricably linked with the wellbeing of the people in the Eastern Himalaya and landscape/ecosystem restoration is key to building resilience for nature and people,\" adds Sarala Khaling of ATREE.</p><p>In Thailand, a significant new project is underway within Kaeng Krachan National Park. This initiative aims to restore monoculture agriculture areas and other degraded zones, while also safeguarding conservation areas in community-managed sections of the National Park. By restoring trees and the overall ecosystem, the project will enhance biodiversity and provide benefits to both wildlife and local communities. Covering 165 hectares, this restoration effort will focus on supporting the diverse forest types found within the National Park and the flora and fauna vital to the local ecosystem.</p><p>\"We are thrilled to embark on this Forest Landscape Restoration project in Kaeng Krachan National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site renowned for its exceptional biodiversity. The National Park provides habitat for many endemic and endangered plant and wildlife species, such as Asian elephants, leopards, gaurs and Great Hornbills, and has long been home to local communities and ethnic groups,\" explains Jake Brunner, IUCN Head of Lower Mekong Sub-Region. \"Collaboration will be essential to the success of this project. IUCN will work closely with The Department of National Park, Wildlife and Plant Conservation of the Government of Thailand and local communities, combining cutting-edge science and traditional ecological knowledge to restore degraded areas through approaches such as enrichment planting, community-based agroforestry and riparian rehabilitation.\"</p><p>Expansion of Existing Projects</p><p>The coalition is expanding investment in six of its 19 existing sites across Madagascar, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Malawi. This strategic expansion will build on the coalition's existing partnership, knowledge and learnings, increasing the scope of impact, providing additional funding to maximize climate, biodiversity, and community benefits in these regions. In Colombia, for example, the Musesi restoration project in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountains in partnership with the Colombia Ministry of the Environment is supporting the Indigenous Arhuaco people to restore their sacred lands, ensuring that the project aligns with their cultural and environmental values. According to Conservation International, over 429 Arhuaco families from 14 communities have participated in growing and planting more than 700,000 trees, restoring almost 2,500 acres of land across three watersheds. The community-based approach has fostered technical skills and increased capacity for future restoration efforts. This initiative not only contributes to national and global climate objectives but also strengthens the governance of the Arhuaco community, helping them reclaim their ancestral territory.</p><p>Building on this success, further investment from the Priceless Planet Coalition will allow the Musesi project to restore an additional 2.5 million trees, covering an additional 4,500 acres and ultimately aiming to capture an estimated 64,140 tonnes of CO2, according to Conservation International.</p><p>Uniting in climate action</p><p>The Priceless Planet Coalition, launched by Mastercard with Conservation International and World Resources Institute, unites individuals, businesses and corporate partners in taking climate action by funding the restoration of 100 million trees. The coalition includes more than 150 partners globally, each contributing to funding forest restoration through various donation campaigns, which may include encouraging consumers to donate at points of sale, allowing consumers to use loyalty points linked to payment cards to support tree restoration, or making donations to executing charities of the PPC after consumers engage in certain activities, such as agreeing to receive paperless statements or when making the purchase of specific products.</p><p>As of 2023, the Priceless Planet Coalition has grown to over 150 members who have helped support the planting of millions of trees and more than 600 plant species and create 1.2 million workdays for people around the world.</p><p>\"The impact that the Priceless Planet Coalition has made since its inception is a demonstration of the power of partnerships, of collaboration between non-profits, scientific experts, businesses, consumers, and local communities,\" says Mastercard Chief Sustainability Officer Ellen Jackowski. \"Through this expansion, the coalition is doubling down and enhancing our investment in the places where we are maximizing benefits and achieving lasting impacts on climate, biodiversity, and communities.\"</p><p>The coalition's approach integrates scientific expertise, local community involvement, and strategic partnerships to ensure the success and longevity of its restoration initiatives. Each project employs the Tree Restoration Monitoring Framework, which tracks and measures factors such as ecosystem integrity, socio-economic impact, carbon sequestration estimation, and the number of trees that have been fully restored with 5-year monitoring.</p><p>To learn more about the Priceless Planet Coalition, visit here (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mastercard.us/en-us/vision/corp-responsibility/priceless-planet.html\">https://www.mastercard.us/en-us/vision/corp-responsibility/priceless-planet.html</url>).</p><p>* * *</p><p>About Mastercard (NYSE: MA)</p><p>Mastercard is a global technology company in the payments industry.

It could be more,' he said, as he expressed alarm on the series of wildfires happening in the province, which, he said, are caused by human activities.</p><p>Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) data show that the top causes of wildfires in the province were attributed to hunting wild boar and collecting wild honey.</p><p>'By next year, we may no longer taste honey as we will be collaborating closely with the local government units to ban people from going up in the mountains, particularly during the dry season,' Dabalos added.</p><p>Meanwhile, the provincial government of Ilocos Norte has allocated PHP5 million under its cash-for-work program to benefit residents living in forest fire zone areas.</p><p>'Our governor just signed the release of PHP5 million as a cash-for-work program to residents to discourage them from going up in the mountains to hunt and collect honey,' provincial disaster risk reduction and management officer Marcel Tabjie said Monday.</p><p>Tabije said the residents will be tasked to establish 'fire breaks' in hotspot areas or those near the national greening programs of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).</p><p>Earlier, the Ilocos Norte Fire Fighting Group, composed of personnel of the DENR, Philippine National Police (PNP), BFP, Philippine Marines, and the Philippine Air Force (PAF) was created to prevent wildfires in this province.</p><p>Aside from the conduct of joint patrol and installation of watchtowers, the group also plans to adopt a forest program to replenish those damaged by forest fires.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASEANT-ASEANTRIB2204202400010027</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASEANT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BVY-BDX1-F00C-60V6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434137</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"350\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 ASEAN Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>ASEAN Tribune</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"29734\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"04\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>April 22, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>LAOAG CITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

According to news reporting out of the Department of Natural Resources and Environment by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Following the largest forest fire in Vietnam in 2002, various activities were undertaken to sustain the mangrove forest on peat soil remnants in the Mekong Delta region. These activities included promoting natural regeneration, afforestation, and rapid forest restoration measures, in addition to other protective measures such as rainwater retention to maintain moisture levels for fire prevention.\" </p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Department of Natural Resources and Environment: \"However, two critical challenges emerged: allowing the forest to naturally regenerate would lead to annual forest fires but maintaining a constant water level through year-round water retention would harm biodiversity. The study was conducted in U Minh Thuong National Park to address forest regeneration. After a major forest fire in Vietnam, various measures were taken to promote forest regeneration, including afforestation, silvicultural solutions, and hydrological techniques such as rainwater storage to maintain humidity and prevent future fires. A hand drill was used to collect samples, and a total of 15 plots were set up to survey the growth of the forest at three peat thickness levels. At each of the three collection sites, samples of one kg were collected and labeled according to the site as UTM1, UTM2, and UTM3. The samples were then sent to the laboratory of the Southern Institute of Forestry Science for analysis. There was a relationship between the chemical indicators of peat and the evolution of the Melaleuca forest. Peat thickness and flooding regime significantly influenced the growth of the Melaleuca forest, while another identified relationship was between peat chemical indicators and forest growth. The chemical composition of peat water changed significantly due to the rainy and dry seasons, with nutrient content and pH affecting forest growth. Peat thickness and flooding regime were essential in regulating forest growth.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"These studies highlight the importance of considering multiple factors, such as peat thickness and chemical properties, when developing effective forest restoration strategies. By understanding the relationship between peat thickness, chemical properties, and forest growth, forest managers can develop targeted strategies to promote regeneration while minimizing negative impacts on biodiversity.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Peatmass Change and Water Level Influencing Regenerated Melaleuca Forest after a Fire in U Minh Thuong National Park, Vietnam.

Before asking me for help, I am going to ask you to provide me specific and concrete evidence of your loyalty to Trump,\" end quote.</p><p>The headline this morning in \"The Wall Street Journal\": quote, \"Loyalty is Common Thread as Trump Fills Foreign Policy, Immigration Jobs.\"</p><p>And CNN's own Steven Collinson writing this, this morning, quote, \"Each selection or anticipated pick so far has one thing in common: ultra-loyalty to Trump, especially during his indictment-strewn post- presidency. Each person is known for paying the kind of exaggerated homage in television interviews that the president-elect adores. A sense of betrayal often burned in Trump's first term when members of government prioritized their oath to the Constitution over their fealty to him.\"</p><p>Overnight, CNN learned Trump is likely to pick Marco Rubio as his secretary of state, according to two sources familiar with his thinking. He'll join Governor Kristi Noem for secretary, who's Trump's choice for the secretary of homeland security; Rep. Mike Waltz as national security advisor; Tom Homan, border czar; Stephen Miller, deputy chief of staff for policy; and Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, ambassador to the United Nations.

Joining us now to discuss: Annie Linskey, White House reporter for \"The Wall Street Journal\"; Elliot Williams, CNN legal analyst, former federal prosecutor; Kate Beddingfield, CNN political commentator, former Biden White House communications director; and Doug Heye, Republican strategist, former communications director for the RNC.</p><p>Welcome to all of you. Very nice to have you here.</p><p>Elliot, so, the big -- biggest difference here -- I mean, as we showed, Donald Trump has wanted people loyal to him for his entire life, right? This is not a new thing.</p><p>But there is a difference from the incoming -- the 2017 administration and now, where the people who surround him are unquestioningly loyal to him. When you look at -- he did this fascinating interview I recommend with David Rubenstein about the -- it was presidential history, basically.</p><p>And Rubenstein kept asking him what was your biggest mistake last time? And Trump kept saying, the wrong people. I put the wrong people in there.</p><p>There were a lot of people who held up his impulses, because they felt loyalty to something else. That's not going to be the case this time.</p><p>[06:05:03]</p><p>You worked inside DOJ and all these other agencies. What does that mean?</p><p>ELLIOT WILLIAMS, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Look, it remains to be seen. The former president, the first time around, actually did have a number of competent people and professionals who shared his ideological vision in government, but they didn't last.</p><p>His secretary of state, his chief of staff simply did not make it from -- from doing their jobs. And let's use the example today of Marco Rubio, who is somebody who, by any metric, is eminently qualified, spectacularly qualified to be secretary of state, having served on the Senate Intelligence Committee and Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</p><p>But it will be interesting to see how that plays out, if the excessive loyalty to the president is what wins over, or if the places where he has deviated from the president over the years -- immigration, are you listening -- might -- might be sort of sticking points. Immigration being the really big one. Because it involves the secretary of state.</p><p>HUNT: Right. Well, so, you mentioned immigration being the big one. But you may remember they ran against each other for president back in 2016. Let's take a little walk down memory lane. No pun intended on that word \"little.\" Watch it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUBIO: Have you seen his hands? They're like this. And you know what they say about men with small hands? You can't trust them.</p><p>TRUMP: Look at those hands. Are they small hands? And he referred to my hands: if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you, there's no problem. I guarantee it.</p><p>So, I looked at him. I said, Marco, those hands can hit a golf ball 285 yards.</p><p>I want to show the size of my hands, how I could grab him, how I could grab him.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNT: So, we didn't hear him say \"Little Marco,\" but that was the nickname.</p><p>ANNIE LINSKEY, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": That's the thing. I feel that Trump -- you know, he wants, you know, recent loyalty.</p><p>I mean, if you look at -- at Rubio, the clips you just showed, but also J.D. Vance, who he picked to be his vice president, certainly was no paradigm of loyalty, you know, just you know, a decade ago.</p><p>So, Trump does seem to show a significant, you know, ability for forgiveness for disloyalty.</p><p>And then the other thing about Rubio is he also broke with Trump on a key thing, which was the 2020 election. I mean, he did vote to certify Pennsylvania, Arizona. So, that was another area where -- and he used the rationale for doing that, for breaking with Trump and certifying the election, was how the country looked to foreign governments.</p><p>So, I think Rubio has shown some independence, even if he's, of course, a bearer (ph) -- campaigning for the president.</p><p>HUNT: Well, so Doug, how do you come back from this kind of a thing with Trump, if you are a Marco Rubio? How is it that he is in the inner circle, considering that -- these realities?</p><p>DOUG HEYE, FORMER RNC COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: How did Kamala Harris come back for Joe Biden after she knifed him in the presidential debate?</p><p>Look, we saw the series of clips of people criticizing Donald Trump and people being loyal to Donald Trump. Yes, there's a fealty to Donald Trump. But a lot of this is very normal.</p><p>I would get calls almost every week during the campaign from reporters about Michael Whatley, the RNC chair, because I'm from North Carolina. Every article would say, \"Michael Whatley, a Trump loyalist.\" Never one time did I see \"Jamie Harrison, a Biden loyalist.\"</p><p>Of course, you're loyal to your boss. And if you're in a very difficult political crisis, and you stay loyal to him, you're rewarded for that.</p><p>Bill Clinton still talks about the people who were loyal to him in 1998 through his impeachment. Yes, does Donald Trump come with a higher standard? And are you at risk of a button being pushed and the floor falling out from under you? Absolutely.</p><p>HUNT: I think that --</p><p>HEYE: But a lot of this is very normal.</p><p>HUNT: I get that, but like, what's the difference between Rubio and Pompeo? Right? Pompeo actually served with Trump and has been booted.</p><p>HEYE: The difference is with Donald Trump, Donald Trump doesn't give points. He only takes them away one at a time. And Mike Pompeo lost his points.</p><p>Nikki Haley, who was trying to come back on the campaign trail, Trump very shrewdly never acknowledged her, never allowed her to. And we see that she's on the outside now. Even though, if he had, he might have been able to increase his margin a little bit.</p><p>KATE BEDINGFIELD, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Doug is right that there is a certain -- you know, I'm always loathe to normalize Trump broadly, because I think so much of what he does is abnormal and often dangerous, frankly.</p><p>HEYE: The hand stuff, yes.</p><p>BEDINGFIELD: And -- well, yes. And just, you know, takes our public discourse to just a really low and cheap and kind of gross place.</p><p>But I mean, yes, Doug is right, of course. There is -- it is true. There is an element of loyalty that is baked into how presidents think about who -- who they staff up. That is true for Democrats. That's true for Republicans.</p><p>I mean, the difference with Trump is that he's often asking his loyalists to do things that are wildly -- or at least what we saw in, you know, 2020 -- that are wildly outside of the bounds of the Constitution.</p><p>So, it's -- it's a little different to say, you know, Jamie Harrison is, like, working to put, you know, money in the campaign where Kamala Harris wants it; well, versus Donald Trump is asking, you know, senators to not certify the election and fulfill their -- you know, their constitutional duties.</p><p>[06:10:05]</p><p>So, it's -- it is absolutely true that loyalty is a -- is a component in politics. Of course it is.</p><p>But the question, the fear, the challenge comes when the president is potentially asking these people to do things that run counter to the Constitution of the United States.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HEYE: If Kamala Harris were -- if Kamala Harrs had won, we wouldn't see a series of clips of \"these people who are backing Kamala Harris are now getting these cabinet appointments.\"</p><p>Because we'd say, this is business as usual.</p><p>You're right. Donald Trump asks people to do things that morally, they probably don't want to do. They somehow find a way to get there. Certainly, that had ramifications for January 6th.</p><p>But politicians hire people who are loyal. When you win a campaign, your team comes with you. That's true of a mayor's race, congressional race, presidential.</p><p>BEDINGFIELD: That's true. No question.</p><p>HUNT: Right. Again, I think hitting the nail on the head, right, when the loyalties collide, what are these people asked to do by their boss? And what are they expected to do in those situations?</p><p>All right. Straight ahead here on CNN THIS MORNING, and this plays directly into the conversation we're having. It could be Donald Trump's most important cabinet pick. How the DOJ is bracing for his selection for attorney general.</p><p>Plus, the president-elect's new border czar delivers a warning to Democratic governors hoping to stand in the way of mass deportations. And Senator Rick Scott tries to ride the MAGA momentum in his bid for Senate majority leader. Will it be enough to secure an endorsement from Trump himself?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCOTT: I'm very optimistic. I believe I'm going to win.</p><p>Here's what I bring to the table. I clearly believe in the Trump agenda.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: They've demeaned us. They've demonized us, and censored us, and deplatformed us, and weaponized the power of our own government against us. They've gone after their political opponent, me. It's unbelievable.</p><p>I call it coordinating with the Injustice Department. NO. I thought it would have looked terrible to take Hillary Clinton -- I could have locked her up. She did so many bad things. But wouldn't that be -- wouldn't that be terrible?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNT: As Donald Trump fills out his cabinet picks for a second term, who he wants to lead the Justice Department could be among, if not could be the most consequential choice he makes.</p><p>The department and Special Counsel Jack Smith opened two prosecutions against him under the Biden administration. Trump has vowed to end those cases as soon as he takes office.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUGH HEWITT, RADIO HOST: The day after you take the oath of office, or maybe even the day that you take the oath of office, you're either going to have to pardon yourself or you're going to have to fire Jack Smith. Which one will you do?</p><p>TRUMP (via phone): It's so easy. I would fire him within two seconds.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNT: Now CNN is reporting current Justice Department employees are bracing for possible political retribution in a second term, something Trump and his allies have talked about on the campaign trail.</p><p>Using the DOJ to go after opponents is something Trump has long sought from his attorneys general, going back to Bill Barr during his first term in office.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP (via phone): Unless Bill Barr indicts these people for crimes, the greatest political crime in the history of the country, then we're going to get little satisfaction unless I win and we'll just have to go. Because I won't forget it.</p><p>But these people should be indicted. This is the greatest political crime in the history of our country. And that includes Obama, and it includes Biden. These are people that spied on my campaign.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNT: So, Elliot Williams, there are people inside the Justice Department who are worried about political retribution to the point that the attorney Mark Zaid is recommending that -- that people take a vacation. Just watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZAID, NATIONAL SECURITY ATTORNEY: We're talking about people who have been specifically called out by the former president of the United States.</p><p>And we're not -- we're not rushing to it. I'm not saying sell your home, move overseas, never come back, become an expat. I'm telling certain clients, a small number, that you know what? Take your vacation for inauguration. And let's see what happens in the days or week or two afterwards.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNT: Remarkable. What would you expect?</p><p>WILLIAMS: I would say, the converse is probably better. Which is that it is a nonpartisan, nonpolitical career class of employees that will save government.</p><p>And it is, in fact, not a great idea to resign and step down and start taking vacations, because you're afraid of an incoming president.</p><p>Look, I think a message that's lost in all this -- and frankly, I served in both Republican and Democratic administrations. And there is a shift in policy from administration to administration. That's OK, and quite frankly, that's a good thing. You don't want the government just doing one thing in perpetuity. There are different ways to skin a cat.</p><p>HUNT: They're responding to the voters.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Responding to the voters. That applies even at the Justice Department, as well.</p><p>When you start talking about, No. 1, specifically targeting individuals; retribution against opponents and so on; you start -- and firing employees simply because they disagree with you, that's where you start getting into a very, very dangerous place for the Justice Department or government, generally.</p><p>HUNT: What -- what do you think are the real differences among the candidates that Trump is said to be considering? I mean, are there choices that seem materially stronger, in your view, in terms of the rule of law versus others?</p><p>WILLIAMS: It's hard to say what's actually a serious choice.</p><p>You hear about Mike Davis, the sort of conservative provocateur who, frankly, probably would not make it through Senate confirmation and may end up somewhere else.</p><p>[06:20:00]</p><p>You know, the ideal candidate has at least served in the Justice Department in some capacity and recognizes that, even in a government agency where not everybody is going to agree with you, you can still have a vision and a mission and still carry it out.</p><p>It's -- you know. And -- and I really do believe the important role here is for the career attorneys, not the mid-level political managers or anything like that. It's the people who were here yesterday, will be here today, and will still be here tomorrow, regardless of who's -- who's president.</p><p>HEYE: Remember, this is also reality TV. This is Donald Trump we are talking about. So, as we have these names coming out, the one that everybody is looking at the hardest is the attorney general. Wouldn't surprise me if Trump keeps this going on, tune in next week, and that the A.G. is the one we find out about last.</p><p>HUNT: Entirely possible.</p><p>BEDINGFIELD: There's also just a question for him of, as he looks at his kind of political landscape, what does he want to prioritize? You know, he -- yes, he's going to have a significant majority in the Senate; likely going to have the House. He was given a huge mandate in the election, no question about it.</p><p>So, Donald Trump has the opportunity to look at the -- the landscape here and say, here are the, you know, two or three -- two or three things I want to prioritize coming out of the gate.</p><p>Is that really going to be, like, trying to go after, like, career folks at the Justice Department? Or is he going to spend his political capital on some of the promises he made on immigration or some of the promises he made on the economy?</p><p>I don't know the answer to that, obviously.</p><p>But he has people around him who are politically shrewd, obviously, who are making these decisions. So, you know, I think we can't -- we've got to overlay the broader kind of political landscape on this, too.</p><p>LINSKEY: I would also say, you know, the last, Biden and also Trump in his first term were both investigated, to some extent, by their own DOJs.</p><p>And I think, you know, if you want us to look at a litmus test, I think you can probably be safe to assume that Trump is going to want a head of the Department of Justice who's not going to appoint a special counsel.</p><p>And I do wonder whether Joe Biden really wishes that Merrick Garland had not decided to allow a special counsel to go forward who searched his home.</p><p>So, I think, you know -- I think that's a sort of a given that you can expect that that will be, like, a flat-out litmus test.</p><p>HUNT: Yes. Fair enough.</p><p>All right. Coming up here on CNN THIS MORNING, racking up endorsements. Senator Rick Scott getting support from Trump allies to lead Congress's upper chamber. Why the president-elect still holding out.</p><p>Plus, what do AOC and Donald Trump have in common? Apparently, Instagram has the answer.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[06:26:49]</p><p>HUNT: All right. At this hour, the United States is bookended by wildfires.</p><p>In California, wind advisories in place for parts of Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, raising fears the Mountain Fire will keep spreading.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is, like, surreal. I mean, I know we live in a fire danger area, but this is -- it came out of nowhere. It was so fast.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNT: Hundreds of structures in the area. And agricultural officials estimate more than $6 million in damages to crucial farmland.</p><p>On the East Coast, the Jennings Creek Fire raging across parts of New York and New Jersey. And that's where we find CNN's Leigh Waldman this morning. She joins us live with the latest there -- Leigh.</p><p>LEIGH WALDMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Kasie, good morning.</p><p>So, the high winds that we're experiencing, and dry air, combined with the historic drought, is making this really, really difficult.</p><p>You can see, law enforcement vehicles blocking an area of the roadway where there's active wildfire burning. On the other side of the road, we saw a few trees actually sparking this morning. There's not mandatory evacuations in place, but officials are telling some residents here, it's time to go.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This was not on fire a half hour ago.</p><p>WALDMAN (voice-over): Thousands of acres near the New York and New Jersey border have been burned by the Jennings Creek Wildfire since it sparked last week.</p><p>STEVE NEUHAUS, ORANGE COUNTY EXECUTIVE: We are asking for people that live on Cliff Road in Green Lake to voluntarily evacuate. People in other areas, be prepared to.</p><p>WALDMAN (voice-over): Historic drought conditions are fueling the fire, aided in part by wind and dry air. Chris Franek, with the New Jersey Forest Fire Service says the rugged terrain is also a challenge for the response.</p><p>CHRIS FRANEK, NEW JERSEY FOREST FIRE SERVICE: It's making access to go fight the fire hard. Hard to get equipment in there, because some of the areas, it's too steep for bulldozers to go to.</p><p>WALDMAN (voice-over): Fire crews from New Jersey and New York are working together, attacking the fire from the ground and from the sky, working to contain it and keep it from threatening homes and other structures in the area.</p><p>Some who live there are being encouraged to leave.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Police knocked on our door, like, maybe an hour or two ago and just said, \"If you guys want to get a bag ready and if you have somewhere to go, maybe you should go.\"</p><p>WALDMAN (voice-over): Franek says one volunteer firefighter was treated for smoke inhalation over the weekend.</p><p>And 18-year-old Dariel Vasquez died Saturday while working as a volunteer New York State forest ranger. In a GoFundMe page, his family describes him as, quote, \"a true hero, someone who lived his life with purpose, who put others before himself.\"</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HUNT: All right.

(OTC: DUTV), a leader in sustainable energy and environmental technologies, recently announced its financial results and corporate progress for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024. The company demonstrated significant growth and strategic advancements, emphasizing its commitment to innovation and sustainable environment protecting technologies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Financial Highlights:</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Revenue Growth: The company reported net income for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2024 of $896,869, with much of this net income due to merger activities including extinguishment of debt and return of shares to the treasury. The two-month post-merger sales for the company was $291,730, with an average \u201cpost-merger\u201d per month profit on operations of $94,195. These revenues were generated from the sales of liquid microbial Terreplenish, and our Easy Nano Void System which can be used for lake clean up, oil well production enhancement, and numerous agricultural applications.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Strategic Acquisitions: Digital Utilities Ventures successfully completed pivotal equity exchanges, enhancing its market position and expanding its portfolio. This includes acquiring a majority interest in Easy Energy Systems Technologies, LLC, Feed Earth Now, LLC, and Easy Modular Manufacturing, Inc. while setting a strong foundation for future growth. As future combined merged operations include numerous business activities similar to past operations, it is the intent of the combined DUTV entity to maintain the over $11 million dollars in historical loss carry forward to aid in the reduction of future income liabilities.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>Operational Highlights:</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Digital Utilities Ventures continued to innovate within its core markets, developing technologies that enable more efficient solutions that dramatically reduce environmental pollutants. The company\u2019s licensed and patented Easy Nano Void Technology has shown promising results in cleaning up bodies of water, improving agricultural output, and even dramatically enhancing the production of an existing oil well\u2026all without the need for harmful chemicals.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Regarding Note 8 from the Annual Report: Note 8 \u2013 Subsequent Events: After the reporting period, in July 2024, Digital Utilities Ventures engaged in a significant project with Arrowhead Country Club in Glendale, AZ. By using its proprietary technologies, Easy Nano Void and Terreplenish, Digital Utilities Ventures successfully remediated an algae-infested stenchy pond. This intervention not only resolved a longstanding community issue but also led to a contractual agreement with Arcis Golf, potentially expanding the application of these technologies across many golf courses nationwide. Furthermore, the project demonstrated that not only can Terreplenish replace conventional toxic fertilizers, but it can also be combined with our Easy Nano Void system to quickly clean up lakes, rivers, ponds, and waste lagoons.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>In August 2024, the company further demonstrated the effectiveness of its technologies in California, addressing composting challenges at a large-scale facility. This trial is anticipated to result in significant contracts, reinforcing the company's innovative solutions in waste and compost management.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Lastly, Digital Utilities Ventures is experiencing increasing interest from oil well service companies with the recently manufactured Easy Nano Void 450 oil well enhancement system. This patented technology, which has undergone six months of testing by experienced oil industry partners on five different oil wells, has demonstrated the potential to increase the production of an existing oil well by 150 to 500%. Such enhancements could substantially reduce the need for new oil wells by maximizing the output from existing ones. Theoretically, rapid worldwide adoption of this revolutionary technology could eliminate the need to drill any new oil wells. This could aid in protecting environmentally sensitive regions from needless oil well exploration activities, while still making an abundant source of transitional petroleum available as the world migrates to long-term \u201cclimate friendly\u201d forms of energy.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>These events reflect the company\u2019s ongoing commitment to environmental solutions and represent significant potential for growth and expansion into new markets and industries.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p/><p/><p>Executive Statements: Mark Gaalswyk, CEO of Digital Utilities Ventures, stated, \"This year has been transformative for Digital Utilities Ventures as we continue to execute our mission of pioneering sustainable technologies. With our strategic acquisitions and merger activities behind us, we can now focus on increasing sales and market awareness of our Terreplenish Liquid Microbial and Easy Nano Void System product lines. These two products will be our initial focus to enable our company to achieve a steady level of predictable, recurring monthly profits and cashflow before we then expand further into our more complex patented Solid Waste, Auto Segmentation carbon capture, Bio Energy technologies for the forest fire mediation and municipal solid waste industries. The Terreplenish microbial product line enables the replacement of 1/3 of conventional petroleum-based fertilizers that pollute our lakes and rivers.

According to news reporting out of Beijing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"The Relief Degree of Land Surface (RDLS) is an important index to evaluate regional environment. It has a significant effect on the local climate, geologic hazards, the path and speed of fire spreading, the migrations of wild animals, and the runoff path and speed of precipitation.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include 5\u00b75 Engineering Research &amp; Innovation Team Project of Beijing Forestry University; Natural Science Foundation of Beijing; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Key Research And Development Projects of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. <br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Beijing Forestry University: \"The forest-steppe ecotone in northern China is one of ecological fragile zones. In-depth study of the RDLS of the forest-steppe ecotone in northern China will help to implement ecological projects scientifically and promote the construction of the national ecological security barrier. The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM-GL1 30 m) data were used to determine the optimal analysis window for RDLS based on the mean change-point method, and the elevation difference was extracted based on the window analysis method. The RDLS model was used to extract RDLS of the forest-steppe ecotone and analyzed with the help of a spatial auto-correlation model. The correlation between mean elevation, relative elevation difference, and RDLS was also analyzed. The results show that the optimal analysis window size for RDLS was 29 x 29, corresponding to an area of 0.76 km2. The RDLS under the optimal analysis window extracted from SRTM-GL1 (30 m) ranged from 0.084 to 3.516. The RDLS had significant spatial clustering, with high RDLS mainly distributed in the mountainous areas and low RDLS mainly distributed in mountain-to-plain transition zone; the RDLS between different administrative units and different watersheds had obvious variability. Overall, the RDLS was characterized as decreasing, increasing, and then decreasing from the south to north, while it was high in the west and low in the east. And the RDLS was linearly positively correlated with mean elevation and relative elevation difference.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"In the future, the implementation of major ecological projects in the forest-steppe ecotone in northern China, such as soil and water conservation, afforestation tree species selection, ecological corridor design, ecological management, geological disaster prevention, and forest fire prevention, should fully consider the local topographic conditions. These research results can provide topographic references for the implementation of ecological planning and engineering in this area and similar areas. It contributes to sustainable development and maximization of ecological benefits and promotes the establishment of a national ecological security barrier.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Geospatial Analysis of Relief Degree of Land Surface in the Forest-Steppe Ecotone in Northern China.

According to news reporting originating in Hanoi, Vietnam, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"An assessment index of landscape ecological security (LES), different from other ecological models namely Pressure-State-Response (PSR), will be more accurate to capture temporal and geographic changes in landscape as well as ecosystem resilience and resistance to interference. In the present study, the impact of ecological security and forest fires on the carbon stock of forests in Bo Trach district, Quang Binh province, central Vietnam was evaluated and analyzed based on remote sensing data and a hybrid model of ant colony optimization (ACO) and neuro-fuzzy system (NFS).\" </p><p><br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from the Hanoi National University of Education, \"The present study indicated that forest fires are generally high throughout the study area, concentrating on areas exposed to and affected by human reclamation and production activities. The artificial neural network (ANN) model based on principal component analysis (PCA) combined Sentinel-1A data performed a higher prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.74), being much greater than biomass estimation using optical data. It reveals that there is a reliability in estimating the aboveground carbon stocks (AGCs) from the above-ground biomass (AGB). The calculated data suggest the AGCs in the study area is high, but these parameters will loss severely in the coming years due to the nature and humans impacts. These results show that utilizing remote sensing combined with PCA-ANN model would have increased the accuracy of forest fire susceptibility, and detected assessment of the LES and forest fires on the AGCs.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The above obtainings supply helpful information for managers and forest rangers to guard the forests in the study area better, and to limit human encroachment, thereby offering actions that contribute to sustainable development.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Assessing the Impact of Ecological Security and Forest Fire Susceptibility On Carbon Stocks In Bo Trach District, Quang Binh Province, Vietnam.

Extraordinarily dry conditions - caused by one of the longest droughts in history - have turned much of the sprawling city's parks and the state's forested areas into a huge tinderbox, putting communities, politicians, and fire crews on alert.</p><p>On Wednesday, a two-alarm brush fire in the north Manhattan neighbourhood of Inwood Hill Park caused smoke plumes to envelope the George Washington Bridge. A day earlier, Long Island volunteer firefighter Jonathan Quiles was arrested on arson charges for allegedly intentionally starting a brush fire in Medford, New York. Upstate, along Greenwood Lake, which borders both New York and New Jersey, a 5,000-acre blaze killed a parks worker, threatened the evacuation of multiple homes, displaced wildlife, obliterated air quality, and stirred widespread panic.</p><p>FDNY and law enforcement officials are currently investigating the cause of the Brooklyn Prospect Park brush fire, including whether the now-torched homeless encampment was a possible factor [Dorian Geiger/ Al Jazeera]</p><p>In response to the spate of fires, officials have mandated a statewide burn ban until November 30.</p><p>'Now is not the right time to be burning outdoors, and I urge everyone to heed our warnings as we continue to take the necessary precautions to keep all New Yorkers safe,' Governor Kathy Hochul said of statewide precautions.</p><p>New York City has also banned outdoor grilling across the Big Apple amid the bone-dry conditions.</p><p>'We're praying for rain,' embattled  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/26/new-yorks-mayor-eric-adams-indicted-everything-you-need-to-know\">Mayor Eric Adams told reporters huddled at the site of the brush fire last Friday. 'We really need rain with all of these leaves, and dry ground, and trees.'</url></p><p>'There will never be another you'</p><p>No one was injured in the Brooklyn blaze. Officials, who have been tight-lipped, are still probing the fire's cause.</p><p>More than 100 city firefighters had descended on Prospect Park to combat the fire, which tore through a hectare (two acres) of the park's Nethermead meadow area. Steep terrain and unusually windy conditions initially hampered the 'labour-intensive' efforts of firefighters, officials on-scene said. Viral images of the city park fire shortly after it erupted showed enormous clouds of smoke rising above a tree line illuminated by the orange, eerie glow of the fire's flames. Soon after, smoke could be smelled for miles away.</p><p>'That initial image that was shared when the fire was first reported was horrifying,' Morgan Monaco, the president of the Prospect Park Alliance, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Park officials said plant material covering the forest floor had been torched and multiple trees, which had been burned, would need to be removed in the coming weeks and months. The bare area was now at risk of soil erosion and potential flooding.</p><p>'We've got to really stabilise the area,' explained Monaco, who blamed the fire on the drought, as a result of climate change. 'As early as next spring, we hope to be able to start planting. But it will take several planting seasons to replant a lot of the plant material that was lost.'</p><p>For now, park workers, Monaco said, are keeping a close eye on any activity that could set off new fires. She encouraged New Yorkers to do the same.</p><p>'We are encouraging New Yorkers to remain vigilant and to call 911 if they see anyone smoking in a park or any barbecues,' she said. 'We need people to really understand the dire consequences of any fire, any smoking, any open flames in any park causing a threat like this.'</p><p>Monaco declined to comment on reports that vagrants living in the wooded homeless encampment were possibly to blame for the brush fire.</p><p>The oldest standing forest in Brooklyn, Prospect Park's habitat will take 'several years' to recover after the two-acre fire tore through the green space, which park officials described as 'the lungs of the city'.

[Dorian Geiger/ Al Jazeera]Singed scraps of a bible remain amongst a junkyard of debris left behind at the Prospect Park homeless encampment that was burned in last week's brush fire. [Dorian Geiger/ Al Jazeera]The Brooklyn brush fire prompted an outpouring of support from New Yorkers in the form of love letters praising Prospect Park and the firefighters who defended it. [Dorian Geiger/ Al Jazeera]</p><p>Days later, however, park-goers had returned to Prospect Park. Runners, cyclists, and stroller-pushing dads populated Prospect Park's roads and trails on Thursday. Some new sights and smells greeted them. Barbecues in the park had since been covered with plastic rubbish bags in adherence with the city's grill ban. A campfire odour still lingered.</p><p>Along a fence by the ridge where the fire burned, a number of New Yorkers had attached whimsical notes in solidarity praising both the park and the firefighters who fought the blaze.</p><p>'Prospect Park we will fight for better climate policy so generations ahead can know your beauty!' read one anonymous note.</p><p>'Dear park, who knew such peace and beauty was at such risk. There will never be another you.'</p><p>Fire 'in your back yard'</p><p>For many New Yorkers, who are more accustomed to weathering hurricanes this time of year, the threat of wildfires was something novel.</p><p>'This is the last forest in Brooklyn and it's being threatened by forest fires,' explained Catalanotto, the Brooklyn teacher, after exploring the Prospect Park burn site. 'I didn't expect that one. The climate crisis is nearby.'</p><p>Other Brooklynites echoed the sentiment.</p><p>'It was shocking and surprising,' Flatbush kitchen supervisor, Kat Teague, 43, also told Al Jazeera. 'I never thought there would be a forest fire in Prospect Park - in the concrete jungle, right? It's super crazy.'</p><p>The brush fire, which unfolded in the most populous borough in New York, where roughly 2.7 million people live, has left others feeling understandably 'anxious' about the insidious effect of climate change.</p><p>'It's strange because whenever there's been any kind of smoke or warnings of fires before, it's always been pretty far away from New York or in the metropolises,' said Noah, a 24-year-old student living in Brooklyn. 'It feels like it's getting closer, like climate change is more of a problem. It's literally in your back yard.'</p><p>Brooklyn videographer and teacher Jake Catalanotto was left unnerved after inspecting the burn site in Prospect Park on November 14. For millions of New Yorkers, particularly city dwellers, the spate of wildfires at their backdoor was something they'd never experienced. [Dorian Geiger/ Al Jazeera]</p><p>'Mountains covered with fire'</p><p>Along the border of New York and New Jersey, the huge Jennings Creek wildfire, which has been burning for days, has inflicted a more sinister scar on the surrounding communities and their habitat.</p><p>The blaze has left at least one dead and residents on edge, many keeping go-bags and living under the threat of evacuation. Last Saturday, 18-year-old New York State Parks worker Dariel Velasquez lost his life 'battling' the wildfire when a tree collapsed on him. No other deaths, serious injuries, or structure losses have been reported.</p><p>As of Thursday, the fire was 75 percent contained, according to the New Jersey Forest Service. Blackhawk and Boeing CH-47 Chinook helicopters, which are dumping thousands of litres of water on the smouldering territory, have slowed the fire's spread.</p><p>At night time in recent days - when the sun sinks over Greenwood Lake - residents have been forced to absorb the most dramatic, even terrifying, views of the Jennings Creek wildfire and the true scale of its devastation. At the wildfire's peak over the weekend, miles upon miles of brush and surrounding lake were illuminated by dancing flames.</p><p>'It was so red, the mountains covered with fire,' Randal Rodriguez, 39, the owner of lakeside hotdog diner, Paul's Place, told Al Jazeera. 'I was in shock - in my life I've never seen something like that.'</p><p>The Jennings Creek wildfire, pictured from the New York side of Greenwood Lake, roughly 72km (45 miles) northwest of New York City, rages on November 9 as fire crews in the area struggle to snuff it out. [Dorian Geiger/ Al Jazeera]</p><p>Rodriguez, who said the wildfires had also burned up business at his diner in recent days, admitted that he has had trouble adjusting to the constantly smoky conditions.</p><p>'There's been a lot of smoke for a few days already,' Rodriguez said. 'It's a little hard to breathe. You feel like you can't breathe. Really strong smoke. If you stay for a few minutes it will affect you, your eyes, your nose.'</p><p>Medical experts caution that wildfire smoke, which contains several pollutants, including particulate matter and carbon monoxide, can have a range of both short- and long-term effects on one's health and respiratory system, including nose and throat irritation, wheezing, coughing, and trouble breathing. It can also exacerbate pre-existing medical or respiratory conditions such as asthma and COPD.</p><p>Greenwood Lake resident, Dave Kozuha, 44, who lives a few kilometres from the wildfire, likened it to 'Dante's Inferno'.</p><p>'Greenwood Lake is nestled between mountains on either side of the lake and the one whole ridge was just ablaze, it was literally just fire leaping across the top, the very length of the ridge was all lit,' Kozuha told Al Jazeera. 'It was unreal to see something like that.'</p><p>Kozuha, who operates a local coffee roastery, said he knew multiple people who had voluntarily evacuated their homes. The lake's surrounding communities, he said, were living in constant fear of evacuation or worse, potential displacement, if the fire encroached on their homes.</p><p>'Right now it's just plumes of smoke going up,' Kozuha added.

It's all-hands-on-deck.\"</p><p>Canada experienced its worst wildfire season ever last year. This year's wildfire season follows one of the country's warmest winters, with little to no snow in several locations conditions conducive to creating wildfires and a long, hot Canadian summer.</p><p>The wildfire heading toward Fort Nelson is just about 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) away. However, fire crews and emergency workers are in the town, prepared for a \"last stand,\" Fraser said, if and when the fire does arrive.</p><p>\"The forecast that I hear is that we're going to get a westerly flow, which could bring the fire closer to the community,\" Fraser said. \"Some fields outside the town could slow the fire's approach, but if we get 40 kph (24 mph) gusts, it won't take very long.\"</p><p>About 100 out of the remote town's approximately 3,400 residents have remained behind, but emergency officials are urging them to leave.</p><p>Bowinn Ma, British Columbia's minister of emergency management, said drought conditions have persisted since last year, and rain is not in the forecast.</p><p>\"The wildfire has grown to almost 53 square kilometers,\" said Ben Boghean, a fire behavior specialist at the British Columbia Wildfire Service. He said the fire could threaten the crews already battling a nearby fire.</p><p>Fraser also warned the public that water and electricity may be in short supply or stopped altogether.</p><p>The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center counted about 143 active wildfires across Canada on Sunday, including 39 that are thought to be out of control.</p><p>Canada had a record number of wildfires last year that forced more than 250,000 people to evacuate.</p><p>Canada's wildfires have created a haze over portions of the U.S., including Minnesota, forcing the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency on Sunday to issue its first air quality alert for the season for the entire state.</p><p>Some information for this report came from Reuters.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126545291</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C1K-1H11-DYTH-G008-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"406\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"05\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>May 13, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news originating from Nanjing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"Machine learning-base fire detection methods play a vital role in the current forest fire monitoring systems.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include The Central Public-interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund; The National Key R&amp;D Program of China. <br/> The news editors obtained a quote from the research from Nanjing Forestry University: \"In the literature, fire detection is usually viewed as a two-class (or multi-class) classification task. However, this violates the most foundational hypothesis in machine learning, e.g., independent and identical distribution (i.i.d.), especially for the non-fire samples drawn from a complex forest background. Moreover, for omni-directional video -monitoring, the background is also always changing, which leads this violation to a worse situation. In this work, by relaxing the i.i.d. of non-fire samples, we aim to learn a one-class model that just relies on the fire samples. Considering the requirements of high-precision and real-time detection, training samples are directly constructed on the fire pixels without a complex feature transformation. Additionally, we also provide a batch decision-making strategy to speed up fire detection.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"This work also includes an extensive experimental comparison on the public forest fire videos, obtained by ground- or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-monitoring cameras. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the results show the superiority of our proposal in terms of a high-fire detection rate, low-error warning rate, accurate fire location positioning, and real-time detection.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: High-Precision Real-Time Forest Fire Video Detection Using One-Class Model.

Guided by her pragmatic mother, Virginia, Mem is indelibly shaped by the unique characters who flow in and out of their lives as they seek to expand the definition of family.</p><p>Mem is a worrywart who believes her ears are \u201cset to a different pitch from all the other human ears of the world,\u201d allowing her to communicate with animals. Perhaps the voices are an outlet for her anxiety, or perhaps her anxiety manifests the voices. Either way, Mem is convinced her paw is the source of her \u201cmagical\u201d ability, and she refuses surgery despite the physical and social hardships caused by her twisted hand and missing digits. In a lonely world, her animal relationships provide a camaraderie she isn\u2019t willing to risk.</p><p>Gwin\u2019s melancholic story is narrated by Mem as an adult looking back on her tumultuous adolescence from the safety of maturity. This perspective infuses the retelling of her youth with profound insight, all while capturing the befuddlement of her innocence with impressive clarity.</p><p>When the novel opens, Mem is living with Virginia in an Albuquerque motel room after her military father abandons them. Despite her circumstances, Virginia refuses to return to her affluent family in Belle Cote, Mississippi. She would rather trade housekeeping services for room and board in a seedy motel than live in a town with segregated drinking fountains.</p><p>Feeling neglected and isolated, Mem struggles to understand her mom\u2019s decision. But Virginia is secretive and doesn\u2019t discuss personal things. Instead, she lets Mem discover for herself that the Dear John letter Mem\u2019s father sends severing their marriage doesn\u2019t acknowledge Mem\u2019s existence. They don\u2019t talk about where Virginia goes when she stays out all night wearing stockings and red patent-leather high heels, leaving Mem home alone to wonder and fret.</p><p>Virginia is especially private with the letters she writes to her childhood best friend, Milton \u201cMac\u201d McFadden, who lives in Belle Cote. Mem\u2019s curiosity goes into overdrive as her mom scribbles \u201clike a madwoman, her non-writing hand shielding the pages from my prying eyes.\u201d</p><p>Despite Virginia\u2019s furtiveness, Mem receives her as a loving mother and recognizes her mom is battling challenges as well \u2014 albeit entirely different from her own. In a touching and profoundly accurate observation, Mem describes Virginia\u2019s pain as a wound that \u201cwasn\u2019t visible in a physical deformity like mine. She was like a burned tree after a forest fire, sap-hardened on the outside, the inside hollowed out.\u201d</p><p>When her parents threaten to sue for custody, Virginia is left with no other option but to move back to Belle Cote. Excited for the opportunity to connect with Virginia\u2019s past, Mem is mesmerized by Mac, a polarizing figure with \u201celectric blue eyes and a full mane of hair the color of the sun.\u201d Mac is a physicist who left his job at the Pentagon right before President Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s 1953 executive order was enacted, prohibiting government employees from engaging in \u201csexual perversion,\u201d as homosexuality was categorized at the time.</p><p>But Mac possesses smarts, financial independence and determination to ignore mistreatment that bolsters him enough to live an openly gay lifestyle despite being challenged by the citizens of Belle Cote. He owns an art gallery called Beautiful Dreamer \u2014&amp; named after the nude portrait of a man hanging in the converted French schoolhouse \u2014 and offers Virginia a job.</p><p>Not long after arriving in Belle Cote, Virginia is angered by her parents\u2019 bigotry and moves into Mac\u2019s home with Mem, who starts to view Mac as a father figure. Their relationship fills a critical void in both of their lives but also complicates things for them. Mac is victimized by hate crimes, and Mem is expelled from Catholic school and socially ostracized.</p><p>As the harsh reality of intolerance hits them from a multitude of angles, Mem struggles to discern right from wrong. The social attitudes promoted by her grandparents and the larger community contradict lessons learned at home with her mom and Mac. She longs to ask questions, to be honest and speak her truth. But doing so provokes consequences for those she loves. Thwarted at every turn, Mem relies on her animal voices, specifically her cat Minerva, for solace.</p><p>Then one day the gorgeous naked man in the \u201cBeautiful Dreamer\u201d painting walks through Mac\u2019s front door. It doesn\u2019t take long for the hyper-charming and devilishly handsome Antonio \u201cTony\u201d Amato to brew trouble in all three of their lives.</p><p>Mem\u2019s youthful puzzlement gains a new target as she struggles to understand how Tony plays into their dynamic. As her confusion and anxiety expand into teenage panic attacks and an eating disorder, everyone in her family struggles to overcome the trauma inflicted on them by an angry and merciless world.</p><p>Minrose Gwin has not composed a cozy, romantic glimpse into midcentury queer life; \u201cBeautiful Dreamers\u201d is an honest tale. It explores the long-term effects of bigotry and hatred through the prism of flawed, big-hearted characters who are trying to do the right thing.&amp;</p><p>FICTION</p><p>\u201cBeautiful Dreamers\u201d</p><p>by Minrose Gwin</p><p>Hub City Press,</p><p>304 pages, $28</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLJNL-72367198</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLJNL2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CTR-X121-DYR7-J01D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8379</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-08-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"929\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</copyright><publicationName>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1203\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Main Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"08\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>August 25, 2024 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>pagesuite</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000087</classCode><className>ANIMAL COMMUNICATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DIER</classCode><className>FICTION LITERATURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009UAK</classCode><className>NOVELS &amp; SHORT STORIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DIF5</classCode><className>ADULTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009U58</classCode><className>HISTORY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRN1</classCode><className>NEGATIVE SOCIETAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000022</classCode><className>ADOLESCENTS &amp; TEENS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DQQN</classCode><className>COMMUNISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000777</classCode><className>LGBTQ+ PERSONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001085</classCode><className>MARRIAGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>N721110GM</classCode><className>HOTELS &amp; MOTELS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>GR215</classCode><className>SOUTHEAST USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

At this time, all lines are in listen-only mode. Following the management's remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Please be aware that certain information discussed today may be forward-looking and that actual results could differ materially. Certain non-IFRS financial measures will also be discussed. Please refer to the company's SEDAR filings for additional information on both risk factors and non-IFRS measures. This call is being recorded today on Thursday, November 14, 2024.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Pierre Alexandre, President and CEO of Orbit Garant. Please go ahead, sir.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pierre Alexandre:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Constantine, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. With me on the call is Daniel Maheu, CFO. Following my opening remarks, Daniel will review our financial results in greater detail, and I will conclude with comments on our outlook. We will then welcome questions.</p><p>We generated our strongest quarterly net earning in four years in the fiscal first quarter, and margin improved compared to Q1 last year as operating earnings increased in both our Canadian and international operations. In Canada, our drilling activity increased year-over-year and the proportion of higher margin specialized drilling activity was also higher. Our performance in Canada in Q1 last year was impacted by temporary project suspension due to the forest fire in Quebec as well as our customer decision to temporarily suspend or reduce activity on certain other projects. We had no comparable disruption in Q1 this year.</p><p>In our international operations, we benefit from increased drilling activity in Chile and Guyana in Q1 this year, and the cessation of our operation in West Africa, which were largely unprofitable for us. Our total revenue in the quarter was $48.4 million, an increase of 9.3% compared to Q1 last year. Adjusted gross margin increased to 19.7% from 15.2% last year. Net earnings were $3.2 million or $0.08 per share, the most we have generated in any quarter since Q1 of fiscal 2021. This compared to a net loss of $0.4 million or $0.01 per share in Q1 last year. Customer demand from our senior and well financed intermediate mining customers remained strong, supported by high gold and copper price. We continue to focus on service these customers. Demand from junior mining companies is still constrained due to low levels of financing.</p><p>Our financial performance has been significantly stronger since we complete our exit from West Africa in Q2 of fiscal 2024. However, we do not believe our performance is fully reflected in our share price. Accordingly, we announced a normal course issuer bid last month. It enabled us to buy back and cancel up approximately 5% of our outstanding common shares over a 12-month period. This is an additional tool we can use to build value for our shareholders.</p><p>I will now turn the call over Daniel to review our results for the first quarter. Daniel?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Daniel Maheu:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Pierre, and good morning, everyone. Canada revenue was $35.4 million in the quarter, an increase of $7.4 million from Q1 last year. As Pierre noted, drilling activity in Canada increased year-over-year, including a higher proportion of specialized drilling activity. International revenue totaled $13 million in the quarter, an increase of 14.8% compared to Q1 a year ago, reflecting increased drilling activity in Chile and Guyana, partially offset by the absence of activity in West Africa. Gross profit increased to $7.4 million for the quarter or 15.2% of revenue compared to $4.1 million or 9.4% of revenue in Q1 last year. As Pierre noted earlier, our adjusted gross margin excluding depreciation expenses was 19.7% in the quarter compared to 15.2% in Q1 2024. The increase in gross profit, gross margin and adjusted gross margin reflect increased drilling activity in Canada, Chile and Guyana during the quarter, including a higher proportion of specialized drilling in Canada and the cessation of our drilling activities in West Africa.</p><p>Consolidated earnings from operation for the quarter were $4.4 million compared to $1.2 million in Q1 last year. Drilling Canada's operation earnings totaled $2.3 million compared to $1.4 million in Q1 a year ago, and our international operating earnings totaled $2.1 million compared to an operating loss of $0.2 million a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $6.5 million compared to $3 million in Q1 last year. The increase in our adjusted EBITDA and net earnings were primarily attributable to the stronger operating earnings in both our Canadian and international drilling operations.</p><p>Now, turning to our balance sheet, we repay a net amount of $0.5 million on our credit facility in the quarter compared to a withdrawal of $2.7 million in Q1 last year. Our long-term debt under the credit facility, including US$3 million draw from our revolving facility under current portion, was $21 million at quarter end compared to $21.5 million as at June 30, 2024, our fiscal 2024 year end. Our working capital totaled $50.4 million as at September 30th compared to $48.6 million at the end of fiscal 2024.</p><p>I will now turn the call back to Pierre for closing comment. Pierre?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pierre Alexandre:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Daniel. When we complete our exit from West Africa in Q2 of fiscal 2024, we said the decision would have a positive impact on our future margins. I am pleased to note that we have reported significant year-over-year growth in profitability in each of the three quarters since then. This demonstrates that our operational performance is improving and that our decision to focus primarily on our operation in Canada and Chile is the correct one. That was a key element of the strategic Five-Point Plan for Orbit Garant that we first introduced in May 2023, it was designed to improve our operating performance over the following 15 months and consists of primarily focusing on our Canadian gold drilling operation, prioritizing longer-term specialized drilling contract with major and intermediate customers, opportunistically pursuing international contracts in stable markets that offer attractive returns, while gradually reducing exposure to Burkina Faso. Continued investment in driller training and computerized drilling technology and building a team-oriented leadership structure that fosters collaboration and personal accountability. We made significant progress in each of these areas and the results are reflected in our strengthened financial performance.</p><p>Our efforts are being supported by strong metal prices, gold price have traded at record highs above US$2,700 per ounce in recent weeks and copper price have also continued to trade well above US$4 per pound. So, we expect that customer demand from senior and well financed intermediate mining companies will remain strong. Junior mining continued to face difficult financing condition, which has limited their exploration spending. We cannot predict when junior mining finances will -- financing will recover. But once it does, demand for our services should further strengthen.</p><p>That concludes our formal remarks this morning. We will now welcome any questions. Operator, please begin the question period.</p><h>Questions And Answers</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Terry Bilama, Private Investor. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>Hi. Thank you for taking the call. Congratulations on the good quarter.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pierre Alexandre:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>I would like to know for the trailing 12 months, what was the adjusted EBITDA and what was the adjusted net income? I have here, it's $18 million area for the trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA and roughly $6 million net income for the trailing 12 months. Is that about correct?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Daniel Maheu:</emphasis></p><p>The adjusted EBITDA for the last year, fiscal 12 months is $6.3 million. And this quarter, we do $6.4 million. So, that means it will be $9.5 million on the last four quarters. So, it should be around $9.5 million adjusted EBITDA. So, we do adjusted of $6.4 million this quarter. And for the last year, it's $6.3 million. So, technically, I just have to reduce by $3 million for the EBITDA of Q1 2024. And I had $6.5 million for Q1 2025. So, it should reach $9.3 million, $9.4 million for the 12 last months.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. There are some special items in there, correct, that I think I added. So, I came up with around $18 million. So, I'll have to look at that later. The other question I had was on the seasonality. What is the highest and lowest seasonality for Canada and for South America?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Daniel Maheu:</emphasis></p><p>The seasonality in Canada, for us, it's Q1. So, July to September, it's a good quarter. And the last one, Q4, which is April, May and June, it's good because in Canada, we are in fact, as you know, in the winter. So, in Q2 and Q3 in Canada is more difficult because we have winter and also we have the holiday season in Canada. Most of our revenue came from Canada, but we -- our operation in Chile, as you know, Chile have winter and summer. So, for example, in August this year and in September this year, they have a lot of snow in the mountain in Chile. So, it's harder for the -- let's say, Q1 for the Chilean operation is lower than the other -- three other quarters.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Last question. In the last six months, the company has done around $12 million to $13 million adjusted EBITDA in the last six months. Is it realistic to do about $20 million to $25 million adjusted EBITDA for the 12 months that would be ending in June of 2025?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Daniel Maheu:</emphasis></p><p>We don't provide the guidance on total EBITDA in the future. But you're right, when you said we have adjusted EBITDA in the last six -- you see in Q4 last year, we do $6.3 million adjusted EBITDA. And this quarter in Q1 2025, we have $6.5 million adjusted EBITDA. So, in the last six months, we do roughly $13 million of EBITDA, but we hope that will be stable.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Congratulations again on the turnaround. And those were my questions. Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Daniel Maheu:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you very much.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pierre Alexandre:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you very much. Have a good day.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of David Stelpstra from BMO. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pierre Alexandre:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Stelpstra:</emphasis></p><p>Congratulations, gentlemen. Great quarter.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Daniel Maheu:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pierre Alexandre:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Stelpstra:</emphasis></p><p>So, my question is regarding the revenues and profitability on the international operations relative to Canada. You have significantly more revenue in Canada and yet the profitability between the two, international versus Canada is almost equal. So, I'm just wondering, is that a reflection on the type of drilling and the margins charged or is it old contracts that maybe are going to be renewed that the pricing gets better in Canada? Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Daniel Maheu:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. Thank you for the question. In Canada, we almost have 75%, 74% of revenue coming from Canadian operations. The Canadian operation is very segmented. That means there are a lot of small drilling companies with few drills. This creates a lot of competition and negative pressure on price in Canada on non-specialized project. That's why we tend to be more focused on specialized contract. So, the margins are better for these contracts. In Chile, let's say, international, it's principally Chile, actually. So, there, we have large contract with large customer in the copper industry, which the pressure on price is less than we have here in Canada. And since January 2024, we see more drilling activity in Guyana, which is a small country in the north of South America, but we are there since more than 20 years. So, we saw a bit of drilling contract and the margins are quite good on this contract in Guyana. So, that's why actually the -- with only, let's say, 25% of our revenue, the international do quite well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Stelpstra:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Daniel Maheu:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call over to Pierre Alexandre for closing remarks. Sir, please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pierre Alexandre:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you to everyone for participating today.

Forest Fire Service to Promote Fire Safety and Wildfire Prevention</p><p>CAPE MAY, NJ Today, Delaware River and Bay Authority (DRBA) officials announced a new partnership with the New Jersey Forest Fire Service to temporarily display a collection of Smokey Bear artwork by Rudy Wendelin inside the Cape May terminal. With the goal of heightening public awareness and wildfire prevention messages to Jersey Cape visitors, this collection will be on display inside the passenger terminal skywalk for seven days beginning on July 1, 2023.</p><p>The New Jersey display collection is comprised of some of Wendelin's post-retirement images and features 19 oil, acrylic, and watercolor paintings of various sizes. The Cape May Ferry terminal is one of six tour locations to host the mobile exhibit this summer. Following its appearance at the Cape May Ferry Terminal, the Smokey Bear collection will transfer to the Batsto Village Visitor Center in Wharton State Forest.</p><p>Rudolph Wendelin (1910-2000) was a sculptor, painter, and illustrator who worked for the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) from 1933 until his retirement in 1973. Although Wendelin was not the creator of Smokey Bear, he spent his career making Smokey into the cultural icon he is today by humanizing his design, creating the first animated drawings of Smokey, and continuing to produce images of Smokey following his retirement.</p><p>To date in 2023, the Forest Fire Service has responded to 904 wildfires which have burned 16,448.5 acres across New Jersey. Twelve of these fires were considered to be major wildfires burning in excess of 100 acres. In response to this difficult wildfire season, New Jersey officials are determined to educate people on wildfire prevention because most wildfires in New Jersey are caused by humans. On loan to the State of New Jersey from the National Agricultural Library, the Wendelin collection will be on display throughout NJ from July 1, 2023, through Smokey's Birthday on August 9, 2023.</p><p>About the Cape MayLewes Ferry</p><p>Owned and operated by the Delaware River and Bay Authority, the Cape May Lewes Ferry is open year-round and has carried almost 50 million passengers since its inception on July 1, 1964. As an integral transportation system connecting the communities and economies on both sides of the Delaware Bay, the Ferry service is a significant catalyst for economic growth and regional tourism activity in New Jersey and Delaware. Its operations sustain over 4,000 jobs while generating tens of millions of dollars in local taxes and hundreds of millions in regional economic activity.

The New Jersey Forest Fire Service is a part of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and serves the state through responding to wildfires, conducting prescribed burns, and educating the public.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125998482</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68K6-VBD1-DYTH-G23H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"526\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 29, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Some were brought down via the Brocken railway. <br/>Local media said the terrain made work to put out the fire difficult. <br/>Ariane Hofmann, a spokeswoman for the nearby town of Wernigerode said the blaze had still not been extinguished on Saturday evening, more than six hours after it was first reported. <br/>Hofmann said around 250 firefighters would continue to work through the night. <br/>She added that four helicopters from Saxony-Anhalt would be deployed early Sunday morning and two other helicopters and a circular sprinkler device had been requested from Lower Saxony. <br/>Second fire in weeks <br/>A fire broke out three weeks ago at the foot of Mount Brocken, which took three days to put out. <br/>Some 3.6 hectares of spruce forest were destroyed, the Harz national park administration said. <br/>mm/sms (DPA, MDR) <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DEWL109987166224633887725976100068</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7825</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:669K-39R1-JCMN-Y2RH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"309\"/><timeReceived>11:05 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Deutsche Welle Germany</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"09\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>September 3, 2022 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CEAJ</classCode><className>HIKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DN5Y</classCode><className>FINANCIAL MARKET UPDATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp;

According to news reporting out of Leon, Spain, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"The evaluation at detailed spatial scale of soil status after severe fires may provide useful information on the recovery of burned forest ecosystems. Here, we aimed to assess the potential of combining multispectral imagery at different spectral and spatial resolutions to estimate soil indicators of burn severity.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Spanish Government, European Union (EU), Regional Government of the Principality of Asturias, Regional Government of Castile and Leo, European Social Fund (ESF), Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT), Principality of Asturias, Ramon Areces Foundation. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the University of Leon, \"The study was conducted in a burned area located at the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula (Spain). One month after fire, we measured soil burn severity in the field using an adapted protocol of the Composite Burn Index (CBI). Then, we performed soil sampling to analyze three soil properties potentially indicatives of fire-induced changes: mean weight diameter (MWD), soil moisture content (SMC) and soil organic carbon (SOC). Additionally, we collected post-fire imagery from the Sentinel-2A MSI satellite sensor (10-20 m of spatial resolution), as well as from a Parrot Sequoia camera on board an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV; 0.50 m of spatial resolution). A Gram-Schmidt (GS) image sharpening technique was used to increase the spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 bands and to fuse these data with UAV information. The performance of soil parameters as indicators of soil burn severity was determined trough a machine learning decision tree, and the relationship between soil indicators and reflectance values (UAV, Sentinel-2 and fused UAV-Sentinel-2 images) was analyzed by means of support vector machine (SVM) regression models. All the considered soil parameters decreased their value with burn severity, but soil moisture content, and, to a lesser extent, soil organic carbon discriminated at best among soil burn severity classes (accuracy = 91.18 %; Kappa = 0.82). The performance of reflectance values derived from the fused UAV-Sentinel-2 image to monitor the effects of wildfire on soil characteristics was outstanding, particularly for the case of soil organic carbon content (R2 = 0.52; RPD = 1.47).\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"This study highlights the advantages of combining satellite and UAV images to produce spatially and spectrally enhanced images, which may be relevant for estimating main impacts on soil properties in burned forest areas where emergency actions need to be applied.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Relevance of Uav and Sentinel-2 Data Fusion for Estimating Topsoil Organic Carbon After Forest Fire.

According to news originating from Caparica, Portugal, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"To effectively manage the terrestrial firefighting fleet in a forest fire scenario, namely, to optimize its displacement in the field, it is crucial to have a well-structured and accurate mapping of rural roads.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Fct. <br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from NOVA University Lisbon: \"The landscape's complexity, mainly due to severe shadows cast by the wild vegetation and trees, makes it challenging to extract rural roads based on processing aerial or satellite images, leading to heterogeneous results. This article proposes a method to improve the automatic detection of rural roads and the extraction of their centerlines from aerial images. This method has two main stages: (i) the use of a deep learning model (DeepLabV3+) for predicting rural road segments; (ii) an optimization strategy to improve the connections between predicted rural road segments, followed by a morphological approach to extract the rural road centerlines using thinning algorithms, such as those proposed by Zhang-Suen and Guo-Hall. After completing these two stages, the proposed method automatically detected and extracted rural road centerlines from complex rural environments.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"This is useful for developing real-time mapping applications.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Automatic Rural Road Centerline Detection and Extraction from Aerial Images for a Forest Fire Decision Support System.

According to news reporting from Antalya, Turkey, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of neighborhood relations on existing landscape patches in the assessment of landscape patch quality.The quality of a landscape patch is directly related to the biodiversity and the land uses adjacent to the patch. In other words, the land use of neighboring patch can have a multifaceted effect on that patch.\" </p><p><br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Akdeniz University, \"While these neighborhoods increase the biodiversity of the landscape patch, its connection with other patches, also cause degradation and loss of habitat. Therefore, when evaluating the quality of the landscape patch, neighboring relations should be taken into consideration. In this study, neighboring relationships of forest fire severity patches in existing land cover were analyzed with use of datasets from Google Earth Engine (GEE) which is a cloud computing platform. The data have been selected from Izmir which is the biggest city in Aegean Region of Turkey, and the neighboring relations have been analyzed. As an example, the forest fire occurred in 18th August 2019 case has been selected which is one of the biggest forest fire happened in Izmir from the past. This burned area is neighbor with the center of Menderes town in East, and the other directions are covered by unaffected forests. The relation between burned area and these patches are analyzed with use of Google Earth Engine derived NDVI data-sets from Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 from the dates of pre- and post-forest fire event The burned area has been automatically detected, converted to vector, then the boundary of the patches have been converted to the points.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The ratio of the points which belong to the patch with total number of points along the boundary of burned area gives the relationship ratio which is used to evaluate the effect.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Analyzing Effects of Burned Forest Areas In the Neighboring Patches With Use of Data-sets From Google Earth Engine: Case of Izmir Forest Fire.

Olsen has been president of the Stevenson Society of America, volunteers at the Robert Louis Stevenson Cottage Museum in Saranac Lake, New York and has compiled a book of Stevenson's essays.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After graduating from Utah State University in 2009, he attended and graduated from the University of Minnesota, where he first learned about Stevenson.</p><p>\"I became interested in Stevenson my first semester of graduate school at the University of Minnesota,\" said Olsen. \"I was starting a PhD program in 19th-century British literature, and I knew a little about Stevenson. I'm not sure I knew much more than what most people know. I knew that he wrote 'Treasure Island' and 'Kidnapped' and 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.'\"</p><p>Olsen says that his interest began when he took a seminar on Victorian literature from a professor who was a renowned Stevenson scholar.</p><p>\"I just found his fiction to be much more complex and varied than I would have expected,\" Olsen said. \"I started writing a paper on Stevenson, and in that process, and trying to gather evidence, I came across his essays.\"</p><p>Along with his works of fiction, Stevenson also wrote several nonfiction essays, which became the focus of Olsen's study.</p><p>An original photo of Robert Louis Stevenson. Photo Credit: Trenton Olsen</p><p>\"I'd say Stevenson is my favorite essayist,\" Olsen said. \"I'm interested in all of his work but especially his essays. And I found the essays to be ... really profound. I just found them enjoyable reading. They're playful; they're often funny, quite moving.\"</p><p>While researching Stevenson's essays, Olsen said that he found out that a compilation book did not exist. Olsen took it upon himself to edit and compile \"The Complete Personal Essays of Robert Louis Stevenson.\"</p><p>\"I went to order a book of his essays and found that it didn't exist, not all of them,\" Olsen said. \"And so since then, it was just kind of an interest for me.\"</p><p>An essay, in literary terms, comes from the French Renaissance writer Montaigne, who coined the term meaning \"attempt.\" Olsen says that literary essays are, \"Attempts, trials, it's exploratory, it's kind of an experiment.\"</p><p>\"An essay is much more questioning,\" Olsen said. \"It's a lot more uncertain. One of my favorite definitions of the essay comes from a contemporary writer who defines it as the movement of a free mind at play, and that's a good description of Stevenson's essays.\"</p><p>Olsen said that Stevenson wrote narrative essays about his own experiences, while others are about a topic, such as illness and death, marriage, or a much lighter topic. For example, Stevenson wrote a whole essay just about umbrellas.</p><p>\"It's just sort of him exploring this idea, and in the process, the essayist is revealed,\" Olsen said. \"So you really get to know the writer, how his or her mind works, because it's sort of dramatized thought on the page.\"</p><p>Stevenson died at age 44, after suffering most of his life chronically ill with lung disease. He often had to dictate from bed to a scribe, and when he was too sick to speak, he would have to sign letter by letter to the scribe.</p><p>\"When you consider how sick he was, it's extraordinary the kinds of things he experienced,\" Olsen said. \"He seemed to pack several lifetimes of experience into 44 years.\"</p><p>Stevenson was born in Scotland and lived in England, France, Switzerland, New York, California, Hawaii and Samoa. According to Olsen, he went on adventures that took him all over the world.</p><p>\"He took a 120-mile backpacking trip through the mountains of Southern France,\" Olsen said. \"He canoed through France and Belgium. He crossed the globe to propose to a married woman. He accidentally started a forest fire in California. He tried underwater diving, which is like the Victorian precursor of scuba diving. He just packed a lot of experience in. And so the essays are also about those kinds of experiences, just interesting stories from his extraordinary life.\"</p><p>Olsen said that the life of Stevenson and his views are reflected in his essays.</p><p>\"I began my work on Stevenson kind of initially, purely as an academic researcher, and I certainly retain that interest, but it's gone well beyond that,\" Olsen said. \"Stevenson writes about what he calls the art of living, and I think part of it is that he had to confront his own death from a very early age, and always assumed he would have a short life, and it made him think really hard and be really deliberate.\"</p><p>Olsen says that Stevenson had a knack for turning life experiences into art and that he \"wanted to make living an art form.\"</p><p>\"There's ... this kind of wholehearted sincerity in really trying to live the best way he can, and that's instructive,\" Olsen said. \"In exploring his own life, he's kind of writing about all of our lives. He's writing about what it is to be human, and taking on big questions like, how do we live ethically, and what are our moral responsibilities, and how do we navigate relationships, and how do we confront suffering and death?\"</p><p>In researching Stevenson's life, Olsen followed his trail around the world, from Scotland to California to Samoa.</p><p>\"I've covered a lot of ground on Stevenson's trail,\" Olsen said. \"And one place that I hadn't been was the Adirondack Mountains in upstate New York, where Stevenson lived for six months, 1887 to 1888. While he wasn't there for long, it was a really important period of his life, both personally and professionally.\"</p><p>After writing the international bestseller, \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,\" Stevenson was told by his doctor that he wouldn't survive another winter in Scotland, so he had to leave. He moved to New York and found that he had become a celebrity in America.</p><p>Stevenson spent the winter of 1887 to 1888 in the town of Saranac Lake, New York.</p><p>\"I was especially interested in this place because of his essays because this was the most prolific period of essay writing in his career,\" Olsen said. \"He was there six months, he seemed to respond well to the climate, to spending a winter in the mountains there and then he ... decided to take this rather bold gamble, which was to set sail for the South Pacific islands.\"</p><p>After leaving New York, Stevenson spent about a year cruising the Pacific Island before relocating to Samoa, where he lived the rest of his life before dying in 1894.</p><p>\"Some of those essays he wrote there (in Saranac Lake) are widely considered some of his best essays,\" Olsen said. \"When he died, a lot of the literary critics were debating what we would remember him best for; his fiction or his essays.\"</p><p>Professor Olsen at the Robert Louis Stevenson Cottage Museum. Photo Credit: Trenton Olsen</p><p>The Robert Louis Stevenson Cottage Museum in Saranac Lake, New York, was where Stevenson lived during that winter, and it is run by the Stevenson Society of America.</p><p>\"When I went, I found this unmatched collection of artifacts from Stevenson's life,\" Olsen said. \"I mean, there's just a real treasure trove of a number of his personal possessions, manuscript pages, all the original furniture that he and his family used when they were there. It was the greatest collection of artifacts ...i n one place, anywhere.\"</p><p>The museum's curator is Mike Delahant, who has been a volunteer caretaker for 44 years. When first visiting, Olsen was \"Impressed\" and \"moved\" but also worried about the future of the museum.</p><p>\"I was also a bit concerned because, as I talked with the caretaker and got to understand the institution a little better, it became clear that the museum had basically no money,\" Olsen said. \"They didn't have funding for essential building repairs and didn't have any plan for what would happen when the caretaker could no longer fulfill this responsibility.\"</p><p>Since that first visit to Lake Saranac, Olsen has volunteered to help run the museum.</p><p>\"I volunteered to just help where I could, and naively, I thought that might be sending a few emails to turn things over to the people who manage these kinds of things, and that grew into the Stevenson Society asking me to serve as president,\" Olsen said.</p><p>The Stevenson Society was founded in 1915 and included figures such as Charles Palmer, founder of the Associated Press, and Gutzon Borglum, sculptor of Mt. Rushmore.</p><p>Since joining the society, Olsen has spent time at the museum helping to revitalize it.</p><p>Professor Olsen and his family on their way to New York. Photo Credit: Trenton Olsen</p><p>\"I spent several weeks out there this summer with my family, helping in a kind of public relaunching of the museum,\" Olsen said. \"So we put a website together. We got our first federal grant, which paid for a preservationist architect and a collection conservator to spend two days on-site and (do a) thorough inspection and give us a prioritized list of recommendations.\"</p><p>Olsen says that being a professor at BYUI and also volunteering at the museum in New York does create challenges. At the moment, he tends to work remotely from Idaho.</p><p>\"To be the volunteer director of a museum 2000 miles away comes with some logistical challenges,\" Olsen said. \"On the other hand, it also creates these really valuable opportunities. So like we've had quite a few BYU-Idaho students intern for the museum, and they've been involved in cataloging the collection, in working on the website and publicity materials and helping us plan kind of programming stuff.</p><p>Olsen says that having students volunteer creates a unique experience for both the students and the museum.</p><p>\"Then we hope this summer to have our first on-site BYUI interns out in New York,\" Olsen said. \"And it's a rare combination- a museum with this kind of history and this kind of cultural importance. It's rare to find a museum of this significance with these kinds of needs. It's a win-win because it's an extraordinary experience for our students, and the museum needs the help.\"</p><p>Professor Olsen standing next to the Stevenson relief sculpture carved by Mt Rushmore sculptor Gutzon Borglum. Photo Credit: Trenton Olsen</p><p>Overall, Olsen says that learning about Stevenson has allowed him to rediscover this great writer.</p><p>\"When Stevenson died, the (New York) Times, in his obituary, wrote that the world has lost not only a great writer, but his readers considered him a personal friend,\" Olsen said. \"The essays are the most intimate literary genre, so I feel like both in my role editing these essays and talking about them, and then helping introduce Stevenson to the public ... feels like introducing a very close friend. It's a real honor to be involved.\"</p><p>Visit the Stevenson Museum website for more information.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5970101</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D9M-3HS1-JBSN-33BX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1817\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Scroll: Brigham Young University-Idaho</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"10\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>October 30, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>UTAH STATE UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Rexburg</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>ID</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>Education Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>Museums</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDA2Q0M0NzJERDUwNDE0OEE2QjYzQTc0NUFFRDJFMjg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp;

[Operator Instructions] Following the management's remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be aware that certain information discussed today may be forward-looking and that actual results could differ materially. Certain non-IFRS financial measures will also be discussed. Please refer to the Company's SEDAR filings for additional information on both risk factors and non-IFRS measures. [Operator Instructions]</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Pierre Alexandre, President and CEO of Orbit Garant. Please go ahead, sir.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pierre Alexandre:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Ludy, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen.</p><p>With me on the call today is Daniel Maheu, CFO.</p><p>Following my opening remarks, Daniel will review our financial results in greater detail, and I will conclude with comments on our outlook. We will then welcome the question.</p><p>Our profitability in the fourth quarter improved compared to Q4 last year, with our adjusted gross margin exceeding 20% for the first time since the second quarter of 2021 fiscal year. Our improved profitability in Q4 this year reflects a number of factors. In Q4 last year, we experienced a decline in drilling activity in Canada due to forest fire as we had to suspend our drilling activities on all our surface and underground drilling projects in Quebec as well as one surface project in Ontario for various periods beginning on May 29 and continuing into July. This resulted in a revenue reduction of approximately CAD3 million in the quarter. In addition, certain customers decided to temporarily suspend or reduce drilling activity on other projects in that quarter.</p><p>These decisions were Company-specific and had nothing to do with our performance. However, they impact our performance for the quarter and into the first half of fiscal 2024. Our fourth quarter results last year were also impacted by a one-time noncash restructuring charge of CAD4.2 million related to our decision to wind down our drilling activity in Burkina Faso and exit the country. In Q4 this year, we experienced a decline in demand for junior exploration companies compared to Q4 last year, but demand for our senior and well-financed intermediate mining companies remain strong. Our stronger operating performance primarily reflect increased drilling activity in Chile and our cessation of drilling operation in West Africa.</p><p>During Q4 this year, we entered into an agreement to sell our inventory in West Africa for an amount of CAD1.2 million and our property, plant and equipment in West Africa for an amount of CAD6.3 million, and record a short-term receivable of -- as compensation for an amount of CAD7.5 million. At year-end, we record a derecognition of short-term receivables and a recognition of a new long-term receivable of CAD3.9 million, following a significant change in contractual payment terms of the receivable. The effect of the substantial modification of the receivable is a loss of CAD3.5 million included in the expenses of the Consolidated Statements of Loss. We also recognized an expected credit loss of this receivable for an amount of CAD1.7 million in the Consolidated Statement of Loss. Excluding this one-time event, our net income would have been CAD4 million or CAD0.11 per share for the quarter. We are quite pleased to have now fully complete our exit from West Africa, which was largely unprofitable for us.</p><p>We are now able to heighten our focus on drilling contracts with senior and well-financed intermediate mining companies in Canada and Chile, two markets that have been more stable and predictable for us. We recently secured two large renewal on copper drilling project in Chile with senior mining companies. One of the contract renewal is for a term of three years, with a customer option to extend for two years, and then the other, which represents our largest contract in Chile by revenue is for a term of five years. Senior and intermediate producers are currently benefiting from record high gold prices and strong copper pricing, which provide a strong incentive to continue investing in mine development activity in both Canada and Chile.</p><p>I will now turn the call to -- over to Daniel to review our results for the third [Phonetic] quarter. Daniel?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Daniel Maheu:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Pierre, and good morning, everyone. Revenue for our fiscal fourth quarter totaled CAD45.3 million, a small reduction of 3% compared to Q4 a year ago. Canada revenue was CAD32.8 million in the quarter, a slight increase from CAD32.6 million in Q4 last year. As Pierre previously note, Canada revenue was negatively affected by financing difficulties for junior and intermediate mining company during Q4 this year, resulting in a lower drilling activity than previous year, whereas revenue in Q4 last year was negatively impacted by project suspension due to forest fire. International revenue totaled CAD12.5 million in the quarter compared to CAD14.2 million in Q4 a year ago. The year-over-year decline reflects our decisions to cease drilling activity in West Africa, partially offset by increased drilling activity in Chile. Gross profit was CAD7.3 million for the quarter or 16.1% of revenue compared to CAD0.7 million or 1.4% in revenue in Q4 last year. The increase in gross profit and gross margin reflect the write-down of inventory from restructuring in Q4 last year, as Pierre discussed earlier, and improved profitability of our international operations, resulting from our increased drilling activity in Chile and cessation of drilling activity in West Africa. Depreciation expense totaling CAD2.5 million are included in the cost of the contract of revenue for Q4 2024 compared to a depreciation expenses of CAD2.6 million and CAD4.2 million write-down in Q4 a year ago.</p><p>Adjusted gross margin, excluding depreciation expense, was 21.7% this past quarter compared to an adjusted gross margin, excluding depreciation expense and the write-down of inventory, of 15.9% in Q4 2023. The increase in adjusted gross margin primarily reflects the increased profitability of our international operations. General and administrative expenses in the quarter were CAD4 million or 8.9% of revenue compared to CAD5.1 million or 10.9% of revenue in Q4 last year. Adjusted EBITDA totaled CAD6.4 million compared to CAD1.8 million in Q4 last year. The increase primarily reflects growth in operation [Phonetic] earnings from our international operations. Net loss for the quarter was CAD1.2 million or CAD0.04 per share compared to a net loss of CAD4.1 million or CAD0.11 per share in Q4 last year. Our net loss this past quarter was attributable to CAD5.2 million effect of the substantial modification of a receivable and expected credit loss, as discussed earlier.</p><p>Turning now to our full year-end result for fiscal 2024. Revenue totaled CAD181.2 million, a decrease of 9.8% compared to fiscal 2023. The decline was primarily attributable to customer decision to temporarily suspend or reduce drilling activity on certain projects in Canada throughout the fiscal -- the first half of fiscal 2024. Our international drilling revenue was essentially in line with fiscal 2023. Our adjusted gross margin, excluding depreciation expenses, was 16.7% in fiscal 2024 compared to an adjusted gross margin, excluding depreciation expense and the write-down of inventory, of 16.2% in fiscal 2023. The increase primarily reflects the increased profitability of our international operations, partially offset by the decline in drilling activity on certain projects in Canada during the first half of the year.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA was CAD14.4 million for fiscal 2024, a decrease of CAD4.7 million compared to fiscal 2023. The decrease reflects the reduction of drilling activity in Canada due to project suspension or reduction during the first half of fiscal 2024, and the cost related to retain key personnel on these projects and then ramping them back up. We also had a CAD3 million negative variation in foreign exchange. These negative factors were partially offset by the improved profitability of our international operations. Net loss for fiscal 2024 was CAD1.3 million or CAD0.04 per share compared to a net loss of CAD0.7 million or CAD0.02 per share last year. Again, our net loss reflects the CAD5.2 million negative effect on -- of the substantial modification of a receivable and expected credit loss.</p><p>Now turning to our balance sheet. We repaid a net amount of CAD0.7 million on our credit facility this past [Phonetic] year compared to a year ago. Our long-term debt under the credit facility, including USD3 million drawn from our revolving facility, and the current portion was CAD21.5 million at fiscal year-end compared to CAD22.2 million as at June 30 a year ago. At year-end, our working capital totaled CAD48.9 million compared to CAD50.4 million at fiscal 2023 year-end.</p><p>Now I turn the call back to Pierre for closing comments. Pierre?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pierre Alexandre:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Daniel. In May of 2023, I outlined a strategic Five-Point Plan to improve our operating performance over the following 15 months, which consists of primarily focusing on our Canadian gold drilling operation, prioritizing longer-term specialized drilling contract with major and intermediate customers, opportunistically pursuing international contracts that present a high degree of cost and margin certainty while gradually reducing exposure to Burkina Faso, continued investment in drilling training and computerized drilling technology, and building a team-oriented leadership structure that fosters collaboration and personal accountability. Our goal was increase our gross margin.</p><p>We are now coming up on the end of the 15-month period, and we have made a strong project -- progress, sorry, in executing the plan. Despite the current low level of gold drilling activity for junior exploration companies in Canada, we have maintained strong contracts with senior and intermediate customer. Our drilling contracts with senior and intermediate mining companies represent 87% of our revenue in fiscal 2024. We have significantly grown our business activity in Chile, including two long-term drilling contracts this past quarter. We have exited the West African drilling market, which was unprofitable for us and are now focused on operation in Canada and Chile. We continue to focus on our computerized monitoring and control technology and drilling innovation.</p><p>We are starting to roll out computerized surface rigs, and recently launched a new hands-free rod handler, which enhance efficiency and safety. We have made solid progress on shifting our business culture towards a more team-oriented leadership structure that fosters collaboration and personal accountability. Our business is currently supported by a very strong metal price. Gold price reached record highs above $2,500 [Phonetic] per ounce last month. Copper price have also increased significantly during this calendar year. Accordingly, we expect to see continued strong customer demand from senior mining company and well-financed intermediate. If the juniors are able to accessing capital again, demand for our service will be extremely strong.</p><p>That concludes our formal remarks this morning. We will now welcome any questions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. And ladies...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pierre Alexandre:</emphasis></p><p>Operator, go ahead.</p><h>Questions And Answers</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Gordon Lawson with Paradigm Capital. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gordon Lawson:</emphasis></p><p>Hello. Good morning, and congratulations on a great quarter. On the Chilean...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pierre Alexandre:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gordon Lawson:</emphasis></p><p>On the Chilean front, your growth there has significantly outperformed your peers. Is there anything specific you can attribute this to?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pierre Alexandre:</emphasis></p><p>Would you please repeat the question, Gordon?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gordon Lawson:</emphasis></p><p>Your performance in Chile is significantly outperforming your peers. So I'm just wondering if there's any specific aspect you can attribute this to?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Daniel Maheu:</emphasis></p><p>Let's say, Gordon, since January 2023, so in the last six quarters, Chilean operation made a recovery from the years before, because we focus on large copper producer in Chile, which are the main producer in Chile. So we put 100% of our effort to serve these major clients in Chile. And now since January '23, we keep very good margin in Chile since. And as you know, we renew these two -- most of our contract this year for the next five years. So we are very pleased with our operation in Chile.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gordon Lawson:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. Yeah, sounds great. And on the liquidity front, can you talk about your current total liquidity position and what your plans are in terms of loan repayments for fiscal '25?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Daniel Maheu:</emphasis></p><p>Yes. In fiscal 2024, we are -- we focus on profitability and use the profitability to reduce our debt. Globally in 2024, if we compare at fiscal 2023, we reduced debt by more than CAD4 million. So we will still focus on profitable increased margin. As you see in Q4, margins are over 20%. This margin helped us to reduce our debt. And as you know, we have expense of capital to -- made for the new contract in Chile, which is important for us. We still invest in these computer drill because we have to build three new drill rigs for this contract. So that's our focus, increase the quality of our drill and reduce debt. And actually, the liquidity is going slowly but surely better.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gordon Lawson:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, that's great. Thank you very much.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Daniel Maheu:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Gordon.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pierre Alexandre:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we do have a question from Tim Tsang [Phonetic]. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>Hi, congratulations for the great quarter. I have a question about the adjusted gross margin. This is the highest margin for a long time. I want to know that should we expect this margin to stabilize at this level going forward? And then does the management has any target for the adjusted gross margin? And what will be the steps or plan to achieve that target? Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Daniel Maheu:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you for this question. As you know, the big thing -- we made a great -- an important decision 15 months ago to evaluate the situation in West Africa, and we decided to sell equipment because we don't make good margin there. So since that or as I just mentioned to Gordon a few minutes ago, we -- in Chile, the business is better than ever. So the stabilization of the margin in Chile, and since January of 2024, we don't have any, let's say, negative cash flow coming from West Africa. So the contracts are really actually since January stable. In Chile, we have three years and five years perspective with almost more than 50% of our contracts are renewed in Chile with this level of margin they had since January 2023.</p><p>And here in Canada, our contracts are also with large and intermediate company, and they are renewed for a few years and it's stable. The only thing that could help us to increase significantly our margin could be a junior come back in the market maybe in calendar 2025, but we don't see anything actually of that because no new bids are on the table till. A small bid are on the table, but we still have, unfortunately, a lot of drill available. So I will say, yes, our margin should stay like they are actually.

According to news originating from the Russian Academy of Sciences by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"The article presents the results of thirty years of international cooperation on the problem of forest fires with scientists from Europe and America. During this period, international conferences, meetings, and joint experimental studies were conducted on forest fires modeling and post-fire succession monitoring in the boreal forests of Siberia.\" </p><p><br/> The news editors obtained a quote from the research from Russian Academy of Sciences: \"The Bor Forest Island Fire Experiment was conducted in 1993 in the Krasnoyarsk Region to study the burning of biomass in the Middle Taiga pine forest. The experiment was a simulated controlled high-intensity forest fire. The experimental fire behavior and fire emissions parameters obtained made it possible to conduct post-fire monitoring and assess the effects of fire on forest components. The Bor Forest Island Fire Experiment was unique in its size and long term monitoring of post-fire reforestation. In 1996, joint international studies were launched to conduct controlled burning of logged sites in order to reduce fire danger and stimulate reforestation processes in clear-cuts in lowland and mountain fir forests with ground vegetation as mixed grasses and green mosses. In order to study the impact of fires on ecosystem components, experiments were conducted during the same period to simulate fires of varying intensity in Southern Taiga and Middle Taiga pine forests. In terms of the level of comprehensive research and the depth of their study, the experiments are unique and were conducted for the first time for the boreal forests of Russia.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"After controlled burning and experiments, the process of post-fire reforestation was monitored. Scientific cooperation and exchange of experience with colleagues from other countries have enriched domestic forest fire science with foreign experience and knowledge, and also made the results of research by Russian scientists available to the international scientific community.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Scientific cooperation on the problem of forest fires in Siberia (to the 30th anniversary of the Bor international experiment).

They're putting water down now on a fire that just has -- they've been trying to battle for the last hour or so to try to protect a community nearby from here.</p><p>Over the next hour, we want to tell you the story of these fires. What happened, how the fire moved so fast, what we know about how it started at this point, and the stories of people who had to flee for their lives.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: 18 million people are under a red flag warning.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: The National Weather Service is calling this a destructive and life-threatening windstorm.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: A small spark could turn into an inferno in a matter of minutes.</p><p>COOPER (voice-over): The warnings were ominous, frequent and at times dire.</p><p>CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: We knew that this was going to be an extreme event. They were talking a once-in-a-decade event three days in advance.</p><p>NICK WATT, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We knew the winds were going to be terrible. We knew that we hadn't seen rain for months. I certainly and everybody I know we did not think it was going to be this bad.</p><p>GOV. GAVIN NEWSON (D), CALIFORNIA: We pre-positioned hundreds of assets and personnel on Sunday in anticipation of this wind event.</p><p>COOPER: They talked of a big wind event, but that wasn't their only concern.</p><p>MYERS: Last winter was very wet, so things grew very well. And then the rain shut off. At the end of March, it was over. And so what happens to plants that don't get water for nine months? They die, they dry out, they become tinder.</p><p>BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT: So by the time the Santa Ana's kicked up, there was so much tinder dry fuel in these canyons. And one spark is so hard to contain.</p><p>CHIEF KRISTIN CROWLEY, L.A. FIRE DEPARTMENT: At 10:30 this morning, a brush fire was reported at 1190 North Piedra Miranda Drive.</p><p>COOPER: Satellite images show a plume of smoke around the Santa Monica Mountains. What caused the fire here is still unknown.</p><p>WATT: That morning, I went for a swim in the ocean. I got out about 8:00 in the morning. The wind was beginning to pick up.</p><p>MYERS: I saw a puff of smoke and I said, oh, no, oh, no, please, because I knew Pacific Palisades was in the way.</p><p>COOPER: Pacific Palisades, a picturesque seaside neighborhood perched on the ocean.</p><p>WATT: It's just a really, really nice place to live. And frankly, if you didn't live here, you were a bit jealous of people that did.</p><p>I got here, it was unlike anything I've ever seen. This looked more like a war zone than a fire zone. This was unlike any fire I've seen in the Palisades. This was unlike any fire I have seen anywhere.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's coming over the ridge. It's got a couple houses. If you're up here, get out of here.</p><p>NATASHA CHEN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We've seen palm trees on fire. We saw a structure up on the hill on fire earlier this afternoon. And personally, I heard an explosion when I was standing closer to the street. So it's been very active, very difficult for the people who live in those foothills because they have one way out here.</p><p>COOPER: One way out that was soon filled with traffic. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This could be the difference, you know, in someone's life or death, if we can get people safely evacuated.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When we got in the car to go and then all the cars were abandoned. So I had nowhere to go. So I decided to get out of my car and start walking. The smoke is so bad I don't -- I have no idea where we're going. I'm scared for my life. It was -- it's terrifying.</p><p>RACHEL SILVER, PACIFIC PALISADES RESIDENT: We were running down. You could see palm trees just like random palm trees on fire. So I'm sure leaves are burning and falling down. And it's literally apocalyptic.</p><p>WATT: It was otherworldly. It looked like the end times. I'm not a religious person. It looked like the end times.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The fire came right down to the road.</p><p>[20:05:03]</p><p>COOPER: As fires closed in firefighters and police told people to abandon their vehicles and head toward the ocean. Those abandoned cars, often on winding roads, made it hard for emergency vehicles to get through. Bulldozers were used to create a path.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Got a lot of unchecked fire on the left flank.</p><p>COOPER: By late afternoon, the Pacific Palisades Fire had spread to 1200 acres. More than 250 firefighters were on scene in the Palisades, and the city of L.A. declared a state of emergency. Some residents stayed behind trying to save their homes and help their neighbors.</p><p>GREG YOST, PACIFIC PALISADES RESIDENT: We had a fire pump and, you know, we were able to, I think, probably saved one or two houses working with the firemen. But three houses have gone up right around us.</p><p>COOPER: But the water tanks in the Palisades were running dry, making it difficult to maintain water pressure needed to supply the hydrants.</p><p>JANISSE QUINONES, CHIEF ENGINEER, L.A. DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER: We have three large water tanks, about a million gallons each. We ran out of water and the first tank at about 4:45 p.m. yesterday. We ran out of water on the second tank about 8:30 p.m., and the third tank about 3 a.m. this morning.</p><p>CHEN: We're trying very hard not to breathe in smoke and ash that's billowing everywhere. The wind is strong enough to knock things over easily.</p><p>WATT: The sun has not set here, but you wouldn't know that because you cannot see a thing. But this black, acrid smoke. This house here was fine. About 20 minutes ago I was walking down this road suddenly, bang. It was up.</p><p>COOPER: When the sun did go down, the wind picked up and the flames roared to life.</p><p>WATT: The issue, this wind, Anderson, you can see it whipping that smoke.</p><p>COOPER: All the stuff around you, is that going to erupt in flames? I mean, those flames look very close, Nick.</p><p>WATT: Well, I mean, I mean, it might. Chris, let's come down here. I mean, all of this stuff is green, OK? Which, listen, that's no guarantee. But, you know, we've obviously parked our vehicle just up the road. We're facing the right way. So if we need to get out, we can get out.</p><p>COOPER (voice-over): Streets.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Man, you can feel the (EXPLETIVE DELETED) heat.</p><p>COOPER: Became infernos.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, my God. If we could just get past these. Holy (EXPLETIVE DELETED). Oh, my, God. Oh, my gosh. Shit!</p><p>CHEN: I'm just holding my breath and I can feel the heat from inside the car. And just watching the embers fly across the windshield. So not ideal. In that kind of, you know, we get -- put on a lot of kind of risky assignments and in this situation, we had to make a calculated risk for the best way to leave. And I think, you know, thankfully, we got out of there.</p><p>COOPER: Downtown Palisades was ablaze as well.</p><p>WATT: We've now come down into Palisades Village, the center of this community. That was an apartment building that we have watched. Jesus. Whoa! Sorry. I nearly got hit by something there. Yes. Whoa. We're going to have to get back. And we've just watched this building just disintegrate. And a little part of that building nearly hit me there.</p><p>The fact that the wind can move around adds to the uncertainty and the danger. For sure, when you've got winds that strong, it's different than covering, you know, a fire on a nice, calm day because you don't know where the flames are going to go.</p><p>COOPER: At around 6:18 p.m., a new fire erupted some 40 miles east of the Palisades in the Eden Creek area in the San Gabriel Mountains.</p><p>POLO SANDOVAL, CNN ANCHOR: Breaking news out of Southern California, where dangerous and fast-moving wildfires are raging, the Eaton Fire has now doubled in size, and that is burning at a rate of over one football field a minute since beginning just a few hours ago.</p><p>DANIEL SWAIN, CLIMATE SCIENTIST, UCLA INSTITUTE OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY: Quite frankly, it was exactly the news that I didn't want to hear. It was immediately clear that this fire, too, much like the Palisades Fire was earlier in the day, was in a very bad spot with a high potential to go on to create a great deal of damage and threaten people's lives. COOPER: In just one hour, the Eaton Fire exploded, burning 400 acres. 95 residents of an elderly care home had to be heartily evacuated in wheelchairs and on gurneys, some wearing thin gowns and shawls in the cold.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So we got to get everybody out of here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Yes, everyone got out safely as far as you know?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p>COOPER: But 10:30 p.m., a third blaze, the Hurst Fire, had erupted in a neighborhood between Palisades and Eden.</p><p>MYERS: And then we had two or three more starts that night. And it's kind of like, I've heard it called whack-a-mole. We need to get assets here. Oh, wow. Now we have nothing over here. And then you're trying to move assets one, two, three, four.</p><p>[20:10:05]</p><p>WATT: I mean, once you started seeing other fires popping up, it was like, oh, my goodness, this is Armageddon.</p><p>COOPER: Fierce winds and hurricane force gusts meant choppers and planes couldn't be used to drop water and fire retardant. Containment was impossible.</p><p>WEIR: Once those flames hit 60, 70, 80 mile an hour, there is no fire crew in the world that's going to fly into that. And so then you're completely at the mercy of physics, of wind direction and moving through these canyons with such ferocity that human crews didn't stand a chance.</p><p>COOPER: By midnight, 4,000 acres had burned and some 30,000 people had evacuated.</p><p>MYERS: So as we were all focusing on the Palisades Fire, more fires broke out. We could not fathom what was about to happen.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We begin with breaking news from California. It is shortly before daybreak there and large parts of Los Angeles are on fire.</p><p>SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR: Apocalyptic conditions across Southern California as crews battle a life-threatening firestorm. Three wildfires raging in L.A. County from the hills to the valley, all of them zero percent contained and spreading rapidly.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This Palisades Fire has been burning at five football fields a minute. The worst is definitely not yet here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is a particularly dangerous situation. We're in the midst of a destructive windstorm. Winds now gusting upwards of nearly 100 miles per hour.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We've never seen fire behavior like this. It's moved so fast, and the wind is so powerful.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I really feel like I'm in a hurricane the way the winds are blowing.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: An ember being driven by 100 mile per hour winds will start additional fires. That is why it's so hard to contain what is happening on the ground.</p><p>COOPER: By Wednesday morning, the Eaton Fire had spread to the nearby community of Altadena, north of Pasadena. This was recorded around 11:30 a.m.</p><p>[20:15:08]</p><p>On this street in Altadena, you have this house which is completely engulfed in flames. There's a tree down, blocking part of the street, and then just across the street you have another fire. Another house that is just completely gone. A second house down there is also gone. I mean, there is not a block in this area that you go down. That you do not see some houses just completely engulfed in flames.</p><p>I mean, this house is completely gone. We've watched this entire house burn down.</p><p>(Voice-over): Over the next six hours, at one intersection, my crew and I watched the firestorm spread, destroying dozens of homes and vehicles.</p><p>This is very active. This is recently caught. I mean, this is now completely engulfed. OK. Yes. And now you see it. Now this house, which relatively untouched, now this house is being destroyed.</p><p>(Voice-over): Fire crews did what they could, but water was an issue here, too.</p><p>CAPT. CHRIS DONELLI, L.A. COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT: Our hydrant ran dry about two minutes ago.</p><p>COOPER: And is that the water pressure issue or --</p><p>DONELLI: We are, because there's so many engines tapping the grid and multiple grids were basically just taking all the water out of the grid.</p><p>COOPER: On a scene like this right now, what can you do?</p><p>DONELLI: We can clear brush away from fences, things that we can do with our hands or with tools, and we just help some homeowners get out. So just, I mean, first thing is rescue operations. We want you out. Houses can be replaced. All that lives cannot.</p><p>COOPER (voice-over): This satellite image of Altadena shows just how many buildings were on fire.</p><p>There's a lot of bushes. There's a lot of lawns. Whoa! OK. So there's a lot of explosions also, obviously, as vehicles, as gas tanks, as vehicles ignite gas tanks explode.</p><p>(Voice-over): By 4:00 p.m., most of the houses at this intersection were destroyed.</p><p>You can't even see the sun. There's a surrealness to it. I mean, I was in, you know, I woke up in a hotel in, I don't know, the Hollywood area, and looked out my window and you could see black smoke, but there was a Starbucks open. And, you know, people are going about their business. It's surreal. It's ominous seeing that in the sky.</p><p>You drive 30 minutes and, you know, people aren't allowed in this area thankfully. It's all cordoned off. But 30 minutes away, there is this inferno, and this entire neighborhood is just been devastated. It is -- it's hard to wrap your mind around it.</p><p>They're essentially trying to see if there's some houses they think they can save by clearing brush. But this thing, again, just turn around if you can here, look, they've been watching this house go up in flames. A number of houses here. And now it has spread to this structure. It spread a while ago, but this structure is almost completely gone.</p><p>The question is, will this house survive? There's no brush around it but, now, look it spread down. This is new. Yes, we've been watching. It then spreads from these trees. Look at all these embers. Just -- I don't know if you can pan up, but look at all these embers just flying up. You see them in the smoke. All of that, those -- the winds are a little or have died down here. But those can just get picked up by winds for miles.</p><p>SWAIN: The images coming out of Altadena, frankly, you know, they are horrifying. Just this unceasing sea of windborne embers igniting dozens and hundreds of spot fires downwind. At that point, it was just a matter of fervently hoping that the losses weren't as bad as feared, and that at least the loss of life could be minimized as much as possible.</p><p>COOPER (voice-over): By nightfall, five fires were raging. Eaton, Palisades, Hurst, and two new ones, Lidia and a fire in Runyon Canyon called the Sunset Fire.</p><p>WATT: The heat coming off this thing is intense right now.</p><p>COOPER: CNN reporter Nick Watt had been working around the clock. He lives in Santa Monica far outside of what is normally considered a fire zone.</p><p>WATT: I'm going to go to my house. I'm going to hose the whole thing down. Just hoping that if everything is wet, if an ember lands on it, it won't ignite.</p><p>COOPER: His wife and children had already evacuated. WATT: It's extraordinary to cover something like this in your own community. I've been covering fires for a long time. You have sympathy for people. Now I have empathy.</p><p>COOPER: Thursday morning, the scale of destruction became clear.</p><p>This was the Altadena community church. It was consumed by flames. Will Rogers State Beach Park set ablaze.</p><p>[20:20:03]</p><p>A Starbucks in the Palisades reduced to a charred out frame.</p><p>MAX FOSTER, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: The forecast is calling for more gusty winds again today as firefighters try to bring the blaze under control.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Based on the devastation that is clear it looks like a bomb. An atomic bomb dropped in these areas.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It is safe to say that the Palisades Fire is one of the most destructive natural disasters in the history of Los Angeles.</p><p>COOPER: According to officials Thursday morning, the Palisades Fire was zero percent contained, as were the Eaton and Hurst Fires. The Lidia Fire was at 40 percent containment and firefighters had stopped the Sunset Fire from spreading.</p><p>Crews battling the northern edges of the Palisades Fire were working in and around Topanga Canyon, trying to put out spot fires and save small communities that are hard to reach.</p><p>It's an area around Topanga Canyon, a lot of winding roads here up into the mountains. This fire here is moving up this side of this mountain really quickly. Just it's moved fast just in the last couple of seconds that I've been standing here. There's a number of firefighters up here. They've got bulldozers. They're getting into place. And they are watching this and getting kind of pre-positioned so that they'll be able to deal with this as it gets here.</p><p>Over on this ridge, a large crew of inmates who have volunteered to learn firefighting skills, they are working, clearing. You see the road they're on, that's a road likely created by bulldozers earlier to kind of create a fire line. They are now widening that road, clearing out more underbrush, and then they will move to other locations.</p><p>(Voice-over): They were able to use choppers and fixed wing aircraft because the winds had died down temporarily. But minor wind shifts made a big difference in where the fire spread.</p><p>They've dropped a lot of water from helicopters over the last hour or so. It seems like the wind shifted and suddenly the fire just erupted.</p><p>CHIEF JEFF GILBERT, WILLIAMS FIRE PROTECTION AUTHORITY: Exactly. You know, afternoons they get the wind shifts up here. So that's exactly what's happened. And they had to vacate the line that we thought we're going to put in. So back to a contingency line. Come down around these houses and just try to cut this bowl off.</p><p>COOPER: Coming up, how residents managed to survive and the stories of those who died in the fires.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[20:27:59]</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh. All right, then. Yes. Let's get out of here. We tried, we tried, bro. Sorry.</p><p>MYERS: A forest fire can run through city blocks. Block after block after block. Not just forest. Tree after forest tree.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm sorry, bro. Can I get out of here?</p><p>COOPER: With nothing left to do but run away.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: God protect this house in the name of Jesus.</p><p>COOPER: And pray.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Protect this neighborhood, God.</p><p>COOPER: Tanner Charles and his friend Orly Israel barely made it out of Israel's burning home alive. The two friends tried to save Orly's home, but finally had to flee.</p><p>ORLY ISRAEL, ESCAPED PALISADES FIRE WITH FRIEND: You can see the sparks in the air. It's like a snowstorm, but the snow hurts your skin. Every time I watch this video I got to watch myself running away from the battle of a lifetime. We stayed there way longer than anyone should have and still lost.</p><p>COOPER: Many Los Angeles residents armed with garden hoses, pool pumps and buckets, tried heroically to save their homes. But getting out with the fires close wasn't easy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's time, Mom. Just get out of the house.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Where are the car keys?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mom?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Turn around. Turn around.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, my god.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Turn around, Mom. NIKKI RIFKIN, EVACUATED AND LOST HOME IN PALISADES FIRE: People just abandoned their cars and people running down the streets with their babies and their dogs and running towards the ocean.</p><p>NATALIE MITCHELL, ESCAPED PACIFIC PALISADES HOME: There's only one road to get out. But at the time that we needed to evacuate, there was more fires on that road.</p><p>COOPER: For Natalie Mitchell and her family --</p><p>MITCHELL: We got to get out of here. We got to get out of here.</p><p>COOPER: -- the only way out was to drive down the road surrounded by flames.</p><p>MITCHELL: It was just like Armageddon. I can't even describe.</p><p>[20:30:02]</p><p>Raining fire embers everywhere. The hillside on both sides was completely engulfed in fire.</p><p>COOPER: At least 16 people died as a result of the fires. But the death toll is likely to climb.</p><p>SHERIFF ROBERT LUNA, LOS ANGELES COUNTY: We will be able to bring in K-9s and other things to help us, hopefully not discover too many fatalities. That's our prayer.</p><p>COOPER: Human remains were found amid the rubble of this beachfront home, decimated by the Palisades Fire. Roughly 30 miles inland, a 66- year-old man, Victor Shaw, lived with his sister, Sherry. In an interview with local news channel KTLA, Sherry said she narrowly escaped the Eaton Fire. Victor, her brother, stayed behind.</p><p>SHARI SHAW, BROTHER KILLED IN EATON FIRE: When I went back in and yell out his name, he didn't reply back and I had to get out because the embers were so big and flying like a firestorm.</p><p>COOPER: Victor's body was found by his neighbors. They said he was lying near a garden hose.</p><p>82-year-old Rodney Nickerson lived less than 10 miles away from Victor in Altadena. Nickerson's daughter said all that was left of his remains were his bones.</p><p>KIMIKO NICKERSON, LOST FATHER IN EATON FIRE: He said he'll be fine. I'll be here when you guys come back. He was in his bed when I found him.</p><p>COOPER: In that same community, the family of 67-year-old Anthony Mitchell believes he died trying to save his son's life.</p><p>RITA COOK, COUSIN LOST IN EATON FIRE: He was such a jewel. So this is going to be a great loss.</p><p>COOPER: Rita Cook is Mitchell's cousin.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: What happened to him? He was with his son, who was bedridden?</p><p>COOK: Yes.</p><p>COOPER: Mitchell's son, Justin, had cerebral palsy, and Mitchell was an amputee who used a wheelchair. Another family member told the \"Washington Post\" the two were waiting for an ambulance to rescue them. The family said authorities told them Mitchell was found by the side of his son's bed. They both died in the fire.</p><p>WEIR: You realize covering these stories is that when the smoke clears and the sun comes out, the nightmare is just beginning.</p><p>COOPER: For those who survived, many returned to this.</p><p>WILMER GARCIA, LOST HOME IN EATON FIRE (through text translation): This was my apartment here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through text translation): Who did you live with here?</p><p>GARCIA (through text translation): With my wife and my two children. My 7-year-old baby and my son of 18. We forgot our bird inside. Our parrot, we left him.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through text translation): How long have you lived here?</p><p>GARCIA (through text translation): Five years. Everything is gone now.</p><p>COOPER: Everything is gone.</p><p>Los Angeles County officials estimate at least 12,000 structures have been destroyed.</p><p>N. RIFKIN: We have no home and no clothes or anything.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's my whole life.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Everything was in there. We've lost everything.</p><p>YVETTE ANDERSON, ALTADENA RESIDENT: Oh, my god. Pots and pans and stuff right there. Oh! Oh, my god.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.</p><p>TONY RICH, ALTADENA RESIDENT: 25 years I've been here. Easy 25. Gone. Less than three hours.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When you look out at your neighborhood, what happened here?</p><p>RICH: It just looked like a war zone here. This is a war zone.</p><p>ANDERSON: There's nothing. There's nothing left. I literally just have the clothes on my back.</p><p>JESSICA ROGERS, LOST HOME IN PALISADES FIRE: We lost everything. Everything burned to the ground.</p><p>COOPER: What do you want people to know about what happened here?</p><p>ROGERS: It shouldn't have happened. However, here today, I'm bringing a message of hope. I'd like for everybody to remember that what we need to focus on is that the love in our heart lasts forever. And it is enduring and we have an opportunity to rebuild. And so regardless of what happened, we can move forward.</p><p>COOPER (voice-over): When we return.</p><p>DONELLI: Our hydrant ran dry about two minutes ago.</p><p>COOPER: Why wasn't there enough water to battle the fires?</p><p>What is the situation with the water? Obviously in the Palisades it ran out last night.</p><p>[20:35:00]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[20:40:12]</p><p>N. RIFKIN: In the Palisades, we were at a deadlock and the fire came down on my car on both sides. And the firemen started running in between all of the cars, screaming, get out and run! Get out and run!</p><p>KAI RIFKIN, EVACUATED AND LOST HOME IN PALISADES FIRE: We were just stuck in four hours of traffic, not knowing which way to go. No one knew which way you should go because everyone was just being evacuated different ways. It was just a panic.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. Where's LAPD and where's everybody? There's no one out here directing traffic. This is getting really bad.</p><p>CELINE CORDERO, DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF, CITY OF LOS ANGELES: The mayor will be on the ground shortly, very shortly this morning, and engaged.</p><p>KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: The mayor is facing criticism from people in the city in L.A. that she was out of the country when the fires broke out given that the weather service has been warning for days that this could be coming.</p><p>COOPER (voice-over): Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, who was overseas for the inauguration of Ghana's new president, returned to L.A. on Wednesday afternoon after the fires were already out of control. By that point, more than 100,000 people had to evacuate.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Do you owe citizens an apology for being absent while their homes were burning?</p><p>MAYOR KAREN BASS (D), CITY OF LOS ANGELES: I've been in constant contact with our fire commanders with county, state and federal officials. I took the fastest route back, which included being on a military plane, which facilitated our communications.</p><p>COOPER: She's also had to defend approving a $17 million cut to the fire department's budget for 2025. She insisted the cut did not impede the response to these fires.</p><p>BASS: There were no reductions that were made that would have impacted the situation that we were dealing with over the last couple of days.</p><p>COOPER: But that's not what the fire chief said last month in this memo and again this past week with Jake Tapper.</p><p>CROWLEY: Let me be clear. The $17 million budget cut and the elimination of our civilian positions, like our mechanics did and has and will continue to severely impact our ability to repair our apparatus. So with that, we have over 100 fire apparatus out of service. And having these apparatus and the proper amount of mechanics would have helped. And so it did absolutely negatively impact.</p><p>COOPER: The resource they needed the most was water, and it was unavailable in some hydrants at a critical time.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We've lost most of the hydrant pressure.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Multiple homes threatened. I need about two or three water tenders. And there were some engines that got dry hydrants.</p><p>WEIR: We've been watching as a crew from Kern County in another part of the state has been spraying water on the hotspots around this former mansion. There's obvious water pressure here, but so many questions about water pressure around L.A. County as multiple crews try to tap in.</p><p>CHIEF ANTHONY MARRONE, L.A. COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT: Your viewers must understand the water system really isn't designed for a large scale, ongoing fire fight.</p><p>WEIR: The firefighting hydrant system in Southern California, a lot of it is gravity fed. So you pump water uphill, and when you need it, it flows down. But that is a system designed for one or two house fires at a time, not for multiple wildland fire crews tapping the same grid system and sucking it dry faster than it can be refilled.</p><p>It's hopeless. And can you imagine the frustration and the panic of being a fire crew realizing the pressure in your hose is dying in real time, as entire neighborhoods are going up in front of you? It's the worst.</p><p>DONELLI: We do have water tenders, vehicles that shuttle water to us that carry 2500 gallons of water. But again, they're stretched thin as well. So they have a lot of demand placed on them.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Governor. Governor, I live here, Governor.</p><p>COOPER: And it had one distraught resident demanding answers from California Governor Gavin Newsom.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Just fill the hydrants. I would fill them up personally. You know that. I would fill up the hydrants myself.</p><p>GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D), CALIFORNIA: I would -- I understand.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But would you do that?</p><p>NEWSOM: I would do whatever I can.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why do I have to ask the governor why there's not water in the fire hydrants? I paid for it, didn't I? I paid for it. I paid for this.</p><p>COOPER: On Wednesday, during the fire in Altadena, I asked Governor Newsom about the problem with getting water from the hydrants.</p><p>What is the situation with the water? Obviously in Palisades, it ran out last night and the hydrants. I was talking to the firefighter on this block. They left because there was no water in the hydrant here.</p><p>NEWSOM: The local folks are trying to figure that out.</p><p>COOPER (voice-over): Two days later on Friday, he called for an independent commission to investigate the water problems. One potential issue might have been that a reservoir near the Palisades Fire that could hold millions of gallons of water was shut down. The L.A. Department of Water and Power said it was required to take it out of service to meet safe drinking regulations.</p><p>[20:45:04]</p><p>In a statement, the department said, quote, \"Extreme water demand impacted our ability to refill the three water tanks supplying the Palisades, causing the loss of suction pressure. The department said it meets all federal and state codes, but will review and investigate what happened.</p><p>Experts told CNN steps could have been taken to potentially lessen the devastating impact, which include better planning and management of aging infrastructure and vegetation in the area.</p><p>WATT: One expert in the field told me that there's not a water system in any city on earth that could have handled what happened here.</p><p>SWAIN: And when it comes to the winds themselves, even if you had a functionally infinite supply of water, even that probably wouldn't have resulted in a greatly different outcome once the fire started burning.</p><p>COOPER: Winds that carried fire from tree to tree, house to house, neighborhood to neighborhood, also grounded aircraft that were supposed to drop water on the burning areas for the first few days of the fire.</p><p>The houses and structures in areas like the Pacific Palisades were mandated to have ignition resistant roofs and fire resistant siding, but the majority of homes in the areas where the fires broke out were built before these mandates went into effect in 2008.</p><p>CROWLEY: As for where the start of the fire was in the Palisades Fire again at currently under active investigation. We have our arson investigators that are out right now as we speak.</p><p>COOPER: The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is taking the lead to find out what caused the first fire in the Palisades.</p><p>Next, the firefight continues and what's in store for the future of the region?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[20:51:33]</p><p>COOPER: What's going on now?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We got a set of structures that just got fired. We got air attack. We got structure protection, trying to get everything out. Looks like we got to go.</p><p>COOPER: You can hear the sound, like kind of a siren going. That's the warning that they're about to drop water. They've been hitting this fire here in Topanga with a number of aerial assets. Fixed wing aircraft. That was a large one. There was a smaller fixed wing aircraft.</p><p>They just dropped retardant. Fire retardant. That's what the reddish pink color is. They've also brought in helicopters have been dropping water on this spot as well. They have a lot of assets in this area on the ground. They're also putting water on it from fire trucks down there.</p><p>(Voice-over): On Friday, the winds had died down. But spot fires around the Fernwood community in Topanga Canyon continued to flare up. It looks like from this vantage point that there now may be another issue, another fire over this ridge. You can see the dark smoke rising from there as well. So there's a fire that they believe is a structure down off to the right. And then over that ridge looks like there is now another fire to deal with.</p><p>And obviously on the horizon you can see some other smoke trails as well. They are trying to save this community. That is where the battle has been joined. A lot of air assets, trucks on ground, fixed wing aircraft like that.</p><p>Wow. It is extraordinary to be standing here and feel the power of that aircraft go right over you and watch it just swoop down so low. It is rare in life. You see an aircraft swooping that close to houses, dropping that retardant. You see the fire trucks still pouring, pouring water. The retardant they're putting down is in a different location than it was just several minutes ago, which we believe was that structure fire. (Voice-over): Four days into the blaze and L.A. was still burning. The scale of the destruction still hard to comprehend.</p><p>WEIR: It is unbelievable. It looks like a war zone here in the central village of Pacific Palisades. This reminds me so much of covering the Paradise Fire up in California over five years ago.</p><p>COOPER:: Before this record setting fire ripped through Los Angeles, there was another record setting one further north in 2018, the Camp Fire.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The Camp Fire in northern California is now the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is nothing like what we've had before.</p><p>Heavenly Father, please help us.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When this occurred in 2018, it was widely seen as essentially the benchmark, the worst, most destructive and deadliest modern American wildfire.</p><p>[20:55:12]</p><p>COOPER: 85 people died in the Camp Fire that virtually destroyed the entire town of Paradise. Nearly 19,000 structures burned to the ground.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is absolutely incinerated.</p><p>WATT: That town of 27,000 people virtually burnt off the map.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They're going to need to rebuild this whole city from the ground up.</p><p>SWAIN: Sometimes you'll hear folks say that why does anybody live in a high fire risk zone? Well, that's a pretty tall order because millions of people today live in those places. Cities and towns are where they are. Suburbs have been built where they have been. And so the question is, then, I think a more interesting one, when you do have a devastating event like this, which burns whole neighborhoods and towns to the ground, how do you rebuild or do you rebuild?</p><p>COOPER: Many in Paradise have not returned more than six years after the fire. The population is about a third of what it once was.</p><p>WEIR: These communities know it is part of the bargain. It is table stakes. If you want to live in Paradise that you're going to live with fire. Things are changing. We have to think differently about how we build, about how we prepare, about how we respond to these multiple disasters at the same time.</p><p>REBECCA APPEL, PARADISE RESIDENT: Nobody's here by accident anymore. People who live here are here because they're fighting to be here. They want to be here. And there's this real sense of community that I think is much stronger now than it was before the fire. And I think that that's really hopeful.</p><p>COOPER: Hope is critical, but so is fire insurance, which is essential if you live virtually anywhere in California. But the industry itself is imploding.</p><p>APPEL: I think our premium on our house prior to the fire was, I think it was around $500 a year, and we were on 11 acres of multiple buildings, about $500 a year purchasing this about a year ago. And then we've now had an increase in our policy.</p><p>WEIR: So how much do they want?</p><p>APPEL: Between 20,000 and 30,000 a year additional. Yes. For less coverage.</p><p>WEIR: We're living through sort of real-time forced adaptation, changing building codes, changing property values, to be sure, but certainly changing insurance rates. That's a massive crisis. So many big insurance companies have pulled out of California because they've lost so much money here. This when you consider the billions of dollars of property just in this part of this fire, well, add another layer to that.</p><p>COOPER: It's just incredible. I mean, you get used to it. It's incredible to see this up close, to see what you guys are doing.</p><p>JAMES LARSEN, FIREFIGHTER: It really is.</p><p>COOPER: It's remarkable what you're doing.</p><p>LARSEN: Yes, it makes you proud to be a firefighter.</p><p>COOPER (voice-over): Back in Fernwood in Topanga Canyon, firefighter James Larsen, a 30-year veteran, was watching to see where the flames might spread.</p><p>LARSEN: The ground is still superheated. You have the stuff down on the ground called duff and that could stay heated for weeks and all that. So there's going to be a lot of cleanup ahead.</p><p>COOPER: Yesterday they were putting a lot of water down from the aerial assets on one area, but it kept coming back like, you know, and they must have put at least six while I was there.</p><p>LARSEN: You literally have to get boots on the ground. Love that term. And was scraping tools and scrape it and water and it's very, very --</p><p>So after you put the water down from the air, folks have to -- people have to go in and actually scrape.</p><p>LARSEN: Yes. When it's safe in our fuels, we want to stay in the black. If it's all burned, it's fine. We don't want to get into the green fuels because we have people in there. We can, you know, they could get burned and it could be a real hazard to us. COOPER (voice-over): Battles like this are playing out all over Los Angeles County. Multiple fires are still burning. They're harder to see in the daytime, but at night, from the air, the scale and the horror of what's happening is clear.</p><p>SWAIN: I think events like this have been inevitable in Los Angeles and in some regions at similar risk nationally and globally for some time. And the reality is that there will be more fire on the landscape in a warming world. There's really no way out of that. What does the future hold? What will the extreme risk days in 20, 30, 40 years look like? It's pretty clear that they will be even more extreme than what we're seeing today.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2025011201CNV29</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WHSWAC2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DWF-4FT3-RT4R-J0CV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6498\"/><timeReceived>08:00 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Cable News Network, Inc.

Jackson Road remained closed to through traffic.</p><p>The Fire Service said staff would remain at the scene.</p><p>The fire, the second in South Jersey in as many days, had threatened four homes, officials said.</p><p>While fighting a larger forest fire Friday in Bass River State Forest, officials closed the Garden State Parkway for several hours, but that fire did not threaten houses. The Forest Fire Service's latest update said that 5,000-acre fire was contained.</p><p>That one was the largest wildfire of the year so far. It followed one in April in Ocean County that raced through 3,859 acres in an area of heavily forested South Jersey that was rimmed by homes, businesses and military installations. That \"Jimmy's Waterhole fire,\" so named by the Forest Fire Service, took days to contain.</p><p>The region has been experiencing a historic dry period, The Inquirer reported Thursday. Philly had its driest May on record with just 0.24 inches of rain measured at Philadelphia International Airport - 8% of normal. Across the river in Burlington County, where officials now work to extinguish the Flatiron Wildfire, May rainfall was about 70% below normal at 1.2 inches.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:hbrubaker@inquirer.com\">hbrubaker@inquirer.com</email> and <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:dmastrull@inquirer.com\">dmastrull@inquirer.com</email></p><p>InqBrubaker and dmastrull</p><p>215-854-4651 and 215-854-2466</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHIINQ-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHIINQ2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68CV-KNF1-JC3R-B00M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"324\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Philadelphia Inquirer</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 4, 2023 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N115300CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DN6R</classCode><className>PUBLIC OFFICIALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DM3Y</classCode><className>FORESTRY WORKERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N115300CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DM3Y</classCode><className>FORESTRY WORKERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>STX001794</classCode><className>VEHICLE TRAFFIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>N488100CC</classCode><className>AIRPORTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GX602</classCode><className>PHILADELPHIA, PA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GS146</classCode><className>NEW JERSEY, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

We're getting a read on Senate support for Pete Hegseth after President-elect Trump's choice to leave the Pentagon was grilled about his qualifications, allegations of misconduct and more. I'll talk to a Democrat and war veteran who took part of the confirmation hearing. Senator Tammy Duckworth joins us live.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Also this hour, just weeks before the infernos in Los Angeles, local firefighters publicly warned they were at a breaking point. CNN is looking into concerns that L.A. has one of the most understaffed fire departments in America.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, a new public health alert in the fire zone, urging people to wear masks to protect themselves from ash and smoke. Dr. Sanjay Gupta will show us why the air in parts of Southern California is so very dangerous right now.</p><p>Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room.</p><p>We begin with breaking news, the Trump cabinet confirmation hearings kick off with very high tension and very tough questions. One of Trump's most controversial picks, Pete Hegseth, up first in the hot seat. As CNN's Brian Todd reports, Democrats zeroed in on the former Fox News host and whether he has the experience and the character to lead the Pentagon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEN. ROGER WICKER (R-MS): Good morning. The hearing will come to order.</p><p>BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Tonight, the man who is perhaps Donald Trump's most controversial cabinet pick is likely on track for confirmation after his, at times, contentious hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee. Pete Hegseth, the former Fox News host and Army vet, who the president-elect has tapped to be his defense secretary, faced hours of grilling from lawmakers. SEN. TIM KAINE (D-VA): You have admitted that you had sex while you were married to wife two after you just had fathered a child by wife three. You've admitted that. Now, if it had been a sexual assault, that would be disqualifying to be secretary of defense, wouldn't it?</p><p>PETE HEGSETH, DEFENSE SECRETARY NOMINEE: It was a false claim then and a false claim now.</p><p>KAINE: If it had been a sexual assault, that would be disqualifying to be secretary of defense, wouldn't it?</p><p>HEGSETH: That was a false claim.</p><p>TODD: That exchange relating to a sexual assault investigation of Hegseth stemming from a 2017 incident in a Monterey, California hotel room, Hegseth denies the allegations and says the encounter was consensual. There were no charges brought but Hegseth lawyers have confirmed he entered into a nondisclosure agreement with his accuser as part of a settlement.</p><p>Democratic Senator Tim Kaine came back at Hegseth on allegations of excessive drinking.</p><p>KAINE: Many of your work colleagues have said that you show up for work under the influence of alcohol or drunk. I know you've denied that, but you would agree with me, right, that if that was the case, that would be disqualifying for somebody to be secretary of defense?</p><p>HEGSETH: Senator, those are all anonymous false claims. And the totality --</p><p>KAINE: They're not anonymous.</p><p>HEGSETH: The letters on the record here --</p><p>KAINE: They're not anonymous.</p><p>TODD: The 44-year-old, characterized those allegations as a, quote, coordinated smear campaign orchestrated in the media. Hegseth's past comments that women should not be allowed to serve in combat roles became a contentious subject at the hearing.</p><p>SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (D-NY): What a terrible statement. So, please, do not deny that you've made those statements, you have.</p><p>TODD: Hegseth countered that he would be fine with women in combat if they measured up to the same standards as men.</p><p>GILLIBRAND: You're making these generalized statements.</p><p>HEGSETH: Commanders meet quotas to have a certain number of female infantry officers or infantry enlisted, and that disparages those women who are incredibly capable of meeting that standard.</p><p>GILLIBRAND: Commanders do not have to have a quota for women in the infantry. That does not exist. It does not exist. TODD: Republican Senator Joni Ernst, an Army veteran and sexual assault survivor, had initially been skeptical of Hegseth as a nominee.</p><p>SEN. JONI ERNST (R-IA): We have had very frank conversations.</p><p>TODD: But today, there were no fireworks between the two, as other Republicans sought to portray the president-elect's unorthodox pick as a positive.</p><p>WICKER: The nominee is unconventional. That may be what makes Mr. Hegseth an excellent choice to improve this unacceptable status quo.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TODD (on camera): During the hearing, Pete Hegseth repeatedly sidestepped questions from Democratic Senator Elissa Slotkin on whether he would ever stand up to President-elect Trump if Trump were to ever give any illegal orders.</p><p>[18:05:02]</p><p>Hegseth said he rejects the premise that Trump would ever give any illegal orders.</p><p>Several people close to President-elect Trump told CNN that Trump's team was in good spirits after the hearing, pointing to the warm reception that he got from Republican senators on the Armed Services Committee. Wolf?</p><p>BLITZER: Brian Todd reporting, Brian, thank you very much.</p><p>I want to go to Capitol Hill right now, where CNN's Manu Raju is getting reaction to the Hegseth hearing. Manu, what are you hearing from senators?</p><p>MANU RAJU, CNN ANCHOR AND CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It's very clear, Wolf, that this could go down along party lines. You're hearing Democratic senators sharply critical of this nomination. It's uncertain likely any Democrat will actually vote to confirm Pete Hegseth. But he does not need Democratic support. He needs Republican support. He needs to limit defections in the full Senate to three at most in order to get confirmed along party lines.</p><p>And the Senate Majority leader, John Thune, told me that Hegseth, quote, acquitted himself well over allegations of sexual assault and misconduct, and he wants to move quickly on this nomination. Senator Roger Wicker, who's a chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, indicated that he plans to move as early as Monday, as early as next week, to have a vote in his committee. Wicker, coming out of that hearing, told me that he believes that Hegseth is on his way to confirmation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WICKER: This was a tour de force, a takedown, a triumph. I think it was a magnificent display of his knowledge and his ability to communicate his leadership abilities, and I feel very good about this hearing today.</p><p>SEN. MAZIE HIRONO (D-HI): Nothing he said convinces me that he is up to doing this job. And, in fact, what I'm hearing is him saying all the things he thinks he needs to say in order to get this job.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAJU: Now, Wicker also told me, Wolf, that he expects all Republicans on his committee to vote to advance this nomination. That would include Senator Joni Ernst, who has not yet taken a position on this nomination. I'm waiting outside her office, Wolf, in case she has something to say about her position. So far, she has not commented, but she did have a very friendly exchange with Hegseth, which leads many to believe that ultimately she'll fall in line, Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: If she says something, Manu, let us know. Manu Raju up on Capitol Hill, thank you very much.</p><p>Joining us now, a Democrat who questioned Pete Hegseth today, Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois is a key member of the Armed Services Committee. She's also an Iraq War veteran. Senator, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>Let's listen to this exchange you had with Hegseth about his knowledge of a key alliance in Southeast Asia. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MARKWAYNE MULLIN (R-OK): Senator Kaine, or I guess I better use the senator from Virginia, starts bringing up the fact that what if you showed up drunk to your job? How many senators have showed up drunk to vote at night? Have any of you guys asked them to step down and resign from their job?</p><p>SEN. TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D-IL): How many nations are in ASEAN, by the way?</p><p>HEGSETH: I couldn't tell you the exact amount of nations in that, but I know we have allies in South Korea, in Japan, and in AUKUS, with Australia, and trying to work on submarines with them, and data transfers with them.</p><p>DUCKWORTH: Mr. Hegseth, none of those countries are in ASEAN. None of those three countries that you've mentioned are in ASEAN.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLITZER: All right. So, we just heard that exchange you had, that little exchange you had with Hegseth. Were you surprised he wasn't able to answer your question?</p><p>DUCKWORTH: I'm flabbergasted that he was not able to answer a very simple question as that, especially since he actually mentioned the importance of the Indo-Pacific in his opening statement. But, you know, he also couldn't tell me what are some of the ways that a secretary of defense would lead international negotiations with our allies either, so, I mean, some very basic things that anybody who wants to be secretary of defense should be able to answer. For him to not even know a single nation out of the ten in ASEAN speaks very loudly to his lack of qualifications for the job.</p><p>BLITZER: Hegseth was also repeatedly pressed on his views about whether he thinks women should be allowed to serve in combat. As an Iraq War veteran yourself and a Purple Heart recipient, what did you make of his answers?</p><p>DUCKWORTH: Well, he kept trying to put women on the stand. It was almost like this was a hearing about whether or not women are qualified to serve in combat as opposed to -- this was supposed to be a hearing about whether or not Pete Hegseth is qualified to be secretary of defense.</p><p>So, he did everything that he could to denigrate women when, you know, he wouldn't come out and say that women are equally qualified. He talked a lot about not wanting to lower the standards and he wanted the highest standards, which is ironic since he wants us to lower the standards for what it takes to be secretary of defense so that he can have the job.</p><p>BLITZER: You called Hegseth, Senator, wholly unprepared to become the U.S. defense secretary. He looks to be headed towards confirmation. He just needs the Republicans to support him. Why do you say the country would be at risk with him as defense secretary?</p><p>[18:10:00]</p><p>DUCKWORTH: Well, the secretary of defense leads the greatest nation on the face of the Earth. We are the leader in our alliance all around the world. Our adversaries are watching to see, you know, especially during a time of transition is when we are most vulnerable to attack. And then, frankly, Mr. Hegseth is that very weak incoming leader, should he be confirmed. They can exploit his weaknesses. They can exploit potentially his personal weaknesses.</p><p>The fact of the matter is, we have all of these allegations that have not been completely dealt with of him having, you know, sexually assaulted women. You know, these are the ways that our adversaries could actually blackmail him. He's already had to pay off an accuser in order to keep a previous job that he had. So, to have a secretary of defense who is potentially blackmailable is something that we certainly do not want as the United States of America.</p><p>BLITZER: What do you say, Senator, to your Republican colleagues who appear willing to confirm Hegseth despite serious questions about his qualifications and allegations of drunkenness and sexual assault?</p><p>DUCKWORTH: I am deeply, deeply disappointed should any of my Republican colleagues vote to confirm this man, especially those who are on the Armed Services Committee, because we are a very bipartisan committee. I respect my colleagues, but the fact of the matter is, they can't, on one hand, talk about upholding standards, and then on the other hand, talk about lowering the standards to confirm someone who's not qualified to be secretary of defense.</p><p>Basically, what I would say to my colleagues is stop praying at the altar of MAGA, and let's put the country above self and your personal political ambitions.</p><p>BLITZER: I want to play that clip from Republican Senator Markwayne Mullin during the hearing. We mistakenly played it a little bit earlier, but I want to play it again. Listen and watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MULLIN: Senator Kaine, or I guess I better use the senator from Virginia, starts bringing up the fact that what if you showed up drunk to your job? How many senators have showed up drunk to vote at night? Have any of you guys asked them to step down and resign for their job?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLITZER: Senator, how do you respond to that?</p><p>DUCKWORTH: Well, again, the Republicans kept trying to put other people on the stand to see -- make them say that they're qualified to do their jobs. And Senator Mullin actually said that there were no qualifications necessary to be secretary of defense, and I would disagree with him. Because one of the qualifications to be secretary of defense is actually to be confirmed by the United States Senate and to convince the members of the United States Senate that he's qualified to do the job. And certainly he did not convince me today that he's capable of doing the job.</p><p>And that's just like saying, oh, well, somebody else is drunk at their job. So, it's okay for me to be drunk at my job. I mean, what kind of an -- I mean, I would accept that type of argument from my six-year- old, you know, she says, oh, well, you know, he pushed me, so I pushed him. I certainly don't want that to be the argument for why we confirm somebody to be secretary of defense.</p><p>BLITZER: Senator Tammy Duckworth, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>DUCKWORTH: Thanks for having me on.</p><p>BLITZER: And just ahead, as dangerous fire weather returns to Southern California right now, a new CNN analysis finds major staffing shortfalls inside the Los Angeles City Fire Department.</p><p>Plus, our own Dr. Sanjay Gupta shares tips for protecting yourself from smoke exposure as officials in L.A. are warning of serious health risks.</p><p>Stay with us. You're in The Situation Room.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[18:15:00] BLITZER: Not long before deadly wildfires broke out in Los Angeles, firefighters were sounding the alarm about major staffing shortfalls inside the city's fire department.</p><p>Our Senior Investigative Correspondent Kyung Lah digging into the story for us. Kyung, a new CNN analysis backs up those concerns about staffing. Tell us more.</p><p>KYUNG LAH, CNN SENIOR INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT: You know, we've heard sort of the back and forth about fire budgets involving the current mayor. But this is an issue that precedes this mayor. This is years in the making. The fire department has warned of dire consequences, saying that they need more money. They need more firefighters. And they warned of this as recently as last month.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAH: At that commission meeting, you said it's dire, someone will die.</p><p>FREDDY ESCOBAR, PRESIDENT, UNITED FIREFIGHTERS OF LOS ANGELES CITY: It's eerie listening to your words because that's what occurred.</p><p>So, it's -- let me just take a minute. Sorry.</p><p>LAH (voice over): Fire Captain Freddy Escobar.</p><p>ESCOBAR: You're not supposed to make me cry.</p><p>LAH: 35-year veteran of the Los Angeles Fire Department wishes he'd been wrong and this had not happened. For years, the LAFD union president warned that a disaster like the Palisades fire could happen.</p><p>And while the cataclysmic weather conditions were historic, Escobar also blamed something predictable that hurt the firefight, money.</p><p>ESCOBAR: This is a woefully understaffed fire department. We're either going to have a fire department that's going to reflect 2025 or we're going to have a fire department that's going to reflect the 1960s.</p><p>LAH: A CNN analysis shows out of the ten biggest cities in the nation, Los Angeles ranks ninth when it comes to the number of firefighters per resident. And it shows. Millions of dollars in rescue equipment is just sitting in a lot unused because the fire department can't afford to hire the mechanics to repair it.</p><p>L.A.'s fire chief said in a recent memo, the fire department staffing levels were half the size of what they should be.</p><p>[18:20:02]</p><p>ESCOBAR: If we cut one position, if we close one station, if we close one resource, the residents of Los Angeles are going to pay the ultimate sacrifice and someone will die.</p><p>LAH: Just last month, fire personnel packed an L.A. fire commission meeting begging the city to rethink the budget. CHUONG HO, UNITED FIREFIGHTERS OF LOS ANGELES CITY, LOCAL 112: These cuts came in exactly the wrong time with calls for services at an all- time high and our firefighters at their breaking point.</p><p>TRACI PARK, LOS ANGELES CITY COUNCIL MEMBER: We are straining our department's resources beyond the brink and we cannot continue on this path.</p><p>LAH: City Councilwoman Traci Park was there too.</p><p>PARK: There are large swaths of the city with no emergency response resources available.</p><p>LAH: Are we going to be having the same conversation next year and the year after?</p><p>PARK: We can't. We can't. I think that people are rightly upset. Not only that this happened, but there is a sense that we as local leaders needed to do more for them. I feel like I let them down. And I've been screaming about it from the day I came in.</p><p>And so I think there is an obligation of us to not let this be for nothing. I think this has to be the wakeup call.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAH (on camera): Now, Los Angeles' Mayor Karen Bass said at a recent press conference that the budget didn't have a major impact in battling these fires, mainly because of the unprecedented nature of these fires, the wind and the dry conditions. The union, though, says that there was a city council meeting today. They do detect some strong support now from the mayor, as well as other members of the council. And they do believe now that these fires and all of this surrounding Los Angeles, that things may change. Wolf?</p><p>BLITZER: All right. Kyung Lah reporting, excellent work, thank you very much.</p><p>Let's go to CNN's Erin Burnett right now. She's out in Altadena. Erin, right now, you're in the center of that very high wind warning in Los Angeles. Give us the latest.</p><p>ERIN BURNETT, CNN ANCHOR: Yes. So, Wolf, it's what they call the PDS, the particularly dangerous winds situation, as they call it. Obviously, not feeling it at this moment, at this location, but this is the area that they have that warning out for that they're very concerned about. And, you know, through the day here, the mountains behind me, they've actually in some areas, you can actually see the red line of fire retardant where they're trying to establish a defensive line of where they anticipate some of these winds funneling through.</p><p>The time that they're most concerned about is about 3:00 to 3:30 in the morning. I was just with firefighters who are prepared for that. That's what they're being told and warned about in these mountains, that it could come down through obviously parts of Altadena, not destroyed behind the Rose Bowl, other areas. So much uncertainty about what will happen, Wolf, but that's the fear that they have.</p><p>And I did spend a part of the day with some firefighters who were there during the fire working these 16, 18-hour shifts and are now on call ready to go. They believe tonight for that next round of Santa Ana winds. But one of them, Engineer Chien Yu (ph), he was out on that night went to work because there was soft fire in the distance from Altadena, went to work, Wolf, 16-hour shift trying to save people's homes, those firefighters and with young's reporting, it is interesting their view. They said that there is nothing in the world that they would have been able to do that would have been able to save what they saw, that it was the most overwhelming thing that they experienced in 2.5 decades of being firefighters.</p><p>But Engineer Yu, he lost his home. So, when all of that finished, he finds out after 16 hours, his home's gone, completely gone to rubble. He had driven by it one time, but he actually went into it for the first time with us today and talked about what it's like as a firefighter when every day you see destruction and loss and trauma to actually have it happen to you. Today was his first day back at the firehouse, getting ready for that battle tonight. Here he is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURNETT: I mean, you see fire every day, right? You see destroy destruction every day, but how is it different now that it's your own life?</p><p>CHIEN YU, PASADENA FIRE DEPARTMENT, LOST HOME IN FIRE: Yes, it's -- I don't know. It's just indescribable. I mean, you know, when we go to a house fire, you kind of detach, you know, and you just try to do what's best for the homeowner and you put their fire out and we kind of salvage what we can, we pull what we can from them. And, hopefully, some of their stuff make it, but this is just gone.</p><p>BURNETT: You can't attach?</p><p>YU: Yes, you know?</p><p>BURNETT: It's your life.</p><p>YU: Yes, it's not going away. And, I mean, I've noticed myself not wanting to do anything, but I also know I have a lot of things to do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[18:25:00]</p><p>BURNETT: And yet, Wolf, he's back on the job today for the first time with that trauma.</p><p>And I will tell you, Wolf, we're going to show you something on the show tonight. One of the most small moments of joy I've seen in a long time happened at that house with Engineer Chien Yu. And we'll share it coming up.</p><p>Wolf, back to you. BLITZER: I will be watching, Erin, thank you very much, Erin Burnett, on the scene for us.</p><p>Coming up, much more on the fires ravaging Southern California as a new blaze breaks out and strong winds return to the region, and Dr. Sanjay Gupta reporting tonight on the urgent new health warnings.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[18:30:00]</p><p>BLITZER: More now on the wildfire disaster in Southern California, firefighters battling a new blaze tonight, as officials warn more than 2 million residents, the hours ahead pose an extremely critical fire threat.</p><p>CNN's Veronica Miracle has the latest.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VERONICA MIRACLE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Seven days into the fight and concerns along the fire lines remain high.</p><p>CHIEF KRISTIN CROWLEY, LOS ANGELES CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT: Life threatening and destructive and widespread winds are already here.</p><p>MIRACLE: Another round of Santa Ana winds and red flag warnings across already fire weary areas. The extremely critical fire warning affecting more than 2 million people.</p><p>CHIEF ANTHONY MARRONE, LOS ANGELES COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT: Severe fire weather conditions will continue through tomorrow. The worst winds are predicted today for the late afternoon and into Wednesday.</p><p>MIRACLE: This is their concern, another wildfire sparking overnight Monday and burning more than 55 acres by dawn, this time to the west of L.A. in Ventura County. Firefighters pushing back the flames and stopping forward progress.</p><p>CAPT. TONY MCHALE, VENTURA COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT: The concern we have now though is that we are in a red flag situation right now.</p><p>DAVID ACUNA, BATTALION CHIEF, CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION: Imagine if you're driving down the freeway at 70 miles an hour, you stick your hand out flat and have the wind pressed against that is the wind that's happening from Ventura to Northern L.A.</p><p>MIRACLE: The wind not only fanning the flames but potentially grounding the fight from the air.</p><p>ACUNA: Over 30 miles per hour, it is unsafe to fly. It's unsafe for the aircraft, for the personnel, and, of course, for the people on the ground.</p><p>MIRACLE: Fire teams across the region in a ready stance to respond to any new flare ups.</p><p>CROWLEY: We are carefully managing our operations to ensure that we can quickly respond to any new fires.</p><p>MIRACLE: Residents in the Palisades fire area and across the fire zone told to be ready at a moment's notice to flee again as more than 5,000 fire personnel work to bring that blaze now only 17 percent contained under control.</p><p>LINDSEY P. HORVATH, LOS ANGELES COUNTY SUPERVISOR: We are giving this fire everything we've got.</p><p>MIRACLE: And as work continues on the frontlines tonight, new videos from residents near the Eaton fire in Altadena appeared to show the moments just after it sparked up. Pedro Rojas captured this showing the huge flames engulfing the base of an electrical tower. Just a few minutes earlier, Jeffrey and Cheryll Ku recorded this</p><p>JEFFREY KU, ALTADENA RESIDENT: As she got closer to the house, sure enough, it was burning bright and it was the base of the tower on fire.</p><p>MIRACLE: As residents across L.A. wait to learn when they may return to what's left of their homes --</p><p>KANDA SAMY, PACIFIC PALISADES RESIDENT: I cry and get up and keep crying. No more tears left for crying.</p><p>MIRACLE: Those who have lost everything seek the barest essentials and supplies and empathy as shelters set up across the county fill up.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIRACLE (on camera): And, Wolf, the outpouring of support here has been so great. In fact, from as far away as Indiana, they're actually no longer taking any more clothing donations. They just have too many. And this is just one of actually four along this street, one on every block. You will see all of these piles of donations for people who have lost everything.</p><p>Now, this is just right across the street from a National Guard checkpoint. We've seen people coming here trying to get back in, checking to see if it's open. It is not, this as firefighters are still on high alert because of this wind event. Wolf?</p><p>BLITZER: What a horrible situation. Veronica Miracle, thank you very much for that report.</p><p>Meanwhile, with many people still missing, search crews are combing the fire wreckage for human remains.</p><p>CNN's Anderson Cooper joined a team in hard hit Altadena, California. Anderson?</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: Wolf, I'm in the Altadena neighborhood of Los Angeles, and this is a regional task force of search and rescue personnel from a number of different departments, but they are all working together. And they are going block-by-block, street-by-street, house-by-house, and literally sifting through the rubble of every destroyed structure, residential and commercial, to try to see if there are any human remains. That's the priority right now for them. In some cases they are -- you can see there's a firefighter over there who's literally using his hand to just push through debris. They want to be very sensitive on the areas that they're working, but they do cover every inch. There's an abandoned -- there's a car over there that's completely burned out. They look in the car.</p><p>If they do, Wolf, detect the smell of anything that may be human, then they bring in some cadaver dogs, which are nearby. There are two Belgian Malinois that we saw just a few blocks from here a short time ago looking at another structure, and that structure turned out not to be human remains.</p><p>[18:35:07]</p><p>It was some rotted food, some rotted meats and chicken.</p><p>But these crews have been working this house just for several minutes. They'll take as much time as they need and then they will move down the block to the next house and then the next one, and the next one. And this work will go on for days until all of these neighborhoods, Wolf, have been gone through.</p><p>BLITZER: All right. Anderson Cooper on the scene for us, thank you very much, Anderson.</p><p>Officials in Los Angeles are also urging residents right now to wear proper respiratory masks to reduce exposure to both ash and smoke. Our Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta is taking a closer look at the health risks and how you can protect yourself.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Wildfire smoke, it's impacting the air all over Southern California.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We had to evacuate. We couldn't breathe anymore. And we had all the filters going in the house.</p><p>GUPTA: It's different than a standard forest fire. It's what firefighters call the wildland urban interface.</p><p>PARKER WILBOURN, SACRAMENTO METRO FIRE: We're not just fighting grass fires. These fires are moving from the grasses and the terrains into homes.</p><p>GUPTA: Everything is burning, plastics, metals, cars, electronics, carpets, drapes, even certain metals in the soil are becoming unearthed. Just about anything you might imagine is going to be inside the smoke.</p><p>Aldehyde acid, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and then various volatile organic compounds as well. These are chemicals that are found in paints and plastics and cleaning supplies. They are dangerous to breathe in by themselves. People who do breathe it in may not have the classic symptoms of smoke inhalation injury. It may be more burning eyes and scratchy throat, even more vague symptoms, like headaches. But eventually they could develop breathing difficulties and even chest pain.</p><p>That's in part because some of the particles in this smoke are as small as 1/20 the width of a human hair. They get into your bloodstream and can eventually affect just about every organ in the body.</p><p>WILBOURN: Absorbing all of those toxins through your skin, through your respiratory drive and realizing that potentially has a long-term effect when it comes to cardiac, stroke, dementia.</p><p>GUPTA: And keep in mind, these toxins can also travel.</p><p>HORVATH: Fine particulates are airborne even in areas not impacted by the fires. Especially children and older adults, especially those with serious health complications, are particularly at risk.</p><p>GUPTA: A windblown dust and ash advisory has now been extended until Wednesday evening for parts of Southern California. That's due to the strong Santa Ana winds near recently burned areas. And there are things residents should be doing to protect themselves.</p><p>Obviously, stay inside as much as possible, but when you are outside, think about wearing a high quality N95 mask. Use portable air cleaners to keep your indoor environment as clean as possible. Make sure the filters on your HVAC system are up-to-date. And if you're driving around, hit that button to recirculate the air inside your car rather than drawing air in from the outside. And, finally, remember, this is a dangerous, evolving situation.</p><p>KATHY ELDON, LOS ANGELES RESIDENT: There's no Palisades. I couldn't breathe the air. I went back for, for a couple of hours and I came back coughing and my eyes were burning.</p><p>It's heartbreaking.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BLITZER: Our thanks to Dr. Sanjay Gupta for that report, very important information. And for more information about how you can help the wildfire victims, go to cnn.com/impact or text wildfires to 707070, 7-0-7-0-7-0, to donate. Very important.</p><p>Just ahead, the powerful conclusion in the special counsel's final report on Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[18:40:00]</p><p>BLITZER: Tonight, the final report on the special counsel's 2020 presidential election subversion case against Donald Trump is public and Jack Smith makes it clear he believes there was enough evidence to win a criminal conviction if his prosecution hadn't been derailed by Trump's reelection.</p><p>CNN's Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid is here with me in The Situation Room. What are the key takeaways from this report?</p><p>PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Smith was required by regulation to write this report, and the fact that it was even released over objections from the Trump team, I mean, that is one final victory Smith was able to eke out over this very successful campaign by the Trump lawyers to delay pretty much every aspect of this case.</p><p>So, in this report, Smith lays out the allegations and the evidence against Trump, much of which we already know because there have been multiple indictments, court filings, a committee investigation on the Hill and a report, but this was also an opportunity for Smith to defend his team and defend their work.</p><p>He also noted that, of course, he had to dismiss this case because Trump was reelected and you can't prosecute a sitting president. But he was careful to point out that even though the Constitution prohibits Mr. Trump's indictment and prosecution while he is in office, that does not turn on the gravity of the crimes charged, the strength of the government's proof, or the merits of the prosecution, all of which the office stands fully behind.</p><p>So, he's saying that the evidence was there. He just never had the opportunity to bring his case to trial. And he talked a little in this report about the roadblocks that he faced. The biggest one before the election was the Supreme Court. It took seven months to answer a critical question about whether Trump had immunity to shield him from this case.</p><p>[18:45:05]</p><p>And he also talked about how, once he was reelected, once Trump was reelected, that was the ballgame. He knew his case was over.</p><p>Well, this is something we also heard a judge talk about in New York last week. Both of these officials talked about the fact that voters saw the allegations in New York. They saw a conviction, and they still sent Trump back to the White House. And the reelection is something both of these men considered in terms of how they handled these cases. After Trump was elected, and this was really Smith's last opportunity to make his case in the court of public opinion.</p><p>BLITZER: Paula Reid, thank you very much. Excellent analysis. Appreciate it very much.</p><p>Coming up, the former White House occupant who says that they will not attend Donald Trump's inauguration.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BLITZER: We're learning there will be a very prominent no show at President-elect Trump's inauguration next week.</p><p>[18:50:06]</p><p>The former first lady, Michelle Obama, revealing her plan to skip the event in a break with tradition.</p><p>I want to bring in CNN's senior White House reporter Kevin Liptak and CNN's political commentator Karen Finney.</p><p>Kevin, a lot of us remember that Trump didn't attend Biden's inauguration four years ago. But what are you learning about the former first lady and her decision to skip the event on Monday?</p><p>KEVIN LIPTAK, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Yeah, and it wasn't just Donald Trump who skipped that inauguration. Melania Trump skipped it as well, Michelle Obama's counterpart.</p><p>So when you talk about inauguration tradition, kind of has to start there. But, you know, I think a lot of people were wondering last week when we didn't see Michelle Obama sitting in the pews at the funeral for Jimmy Carter, whether she would actually attend the inauguration this week, both of those events would have brought her face to face with Donald Trump. They said last week that scheduling conflicts prevented her from attending that event. They're not actually elaborating on why she won't be attending next weeks inauguration, which I think probably tells you everything you need to know.</p><p>You know, Michelle Obama has made no secret about her feelings towards Donald Trump. She has actually said that she believes that Trump could have put her family's safety at risk with some of his rhetoric, including the birther lies that he was spewing about a decade ago. She also has talked about how difficult it was for her to sit through Trumps first inauguration in 2017.</p><p>You know, we all saw her with kind of a strange look on her face, and she actually said in a podcast a couple of years ago that once she got on the aircraft and was flying out of Washington, she just broke down in tears from the weight of it all.</p><p>So I think all of that combined probably makes it not something of a surprise that she won't be at the inauguration next week. But I should mention we did hear from the other former first lady, Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton. They will both be at next week's event with their husband.</p><p>BLITZER: Interesting, indeed. Speaking of that, what she said about that first Trump inauguration -- Karen, I want you to listen to how she reacted to all of that. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MICHELLE OBAMA, FORMER U.S. FIRST LADY: There were tears. There was that emotion, but then to sit on that stage and watch the -- the opposite of what we represented on display, there was no diversity. There was no color on that stage. There was no reflection of the broader sense of America. (END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>BLITZER: So what does that tell you, Karen, about why she decided to skip the upcoming inauguration?</p><p>KAREN FINNEY, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, you know, let me just say good for her, because she kind of made clear at the DNC, she was -- she's doing what she wants to do, right? It was a big deal that she, you know, put her time in on the campaign trail.</p><p>And I think the most important thing to remember, she, along with President Obama immediately after the election, put forward a statement saying, look, this may not have been the outcome we want, but in support of the peaceful transfer of power.</p><p>So, in terms of tradition, unlike Melania Trump -- so in terms of tradition, she is honoring that transition. I think so -- look, I think she -- I obviously haven't talked to her. I don't speak for her.</p><p>But what Kevin said, I mean, he put her children's lives at -- lives in danger. And as she talked about again at the DNC, he also used them in a way, a very bigoted with racist comments and fear-mongering, right? And made them the targets.</p><p>And I can understand feeling like that's not somebody I want to sit next to.</p><p>BLITZER: That's interesting that sources are telling CNN, Karen, that the vice president, Kamala Harris, has not invited the incoming Vance family for a tour of the vice presidential residence here in Washington. Do you think that's a bad look for the vice president?</p><p>FINNEY: You know, look, there is a whole staff in the vice president's residence, just like in the White House that I'm sure is working with. You know, they work with the team going out and the team coming in. So it's not like they're not having access to all the things they need in order to be prepared to move in on inauguration day. I think that's the important thing.</p><p>BLITZER: All right. Karen Finney and Kevin Liptak to both of you -- thank you very much.</p><p>Coming up, discussions over a ceasefire and hostage deal in the Middle East, now said to be in the final stages.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[18:58:32]</p><p>BLITZER: Officials here in the U.S. and in the Middle East say Israel and Hamas are getting very close to a Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal.</p><p>CNN's MJ Lee is over at the White House with an update for us.</p><p>MJ, what are you hearing from the Biden administration about this potential deal? MJ LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CO: Well, as you said, Wolf, every sign that we are getting is that a deal is on the cusp of being reached. We've heard Israeli officials saying that they are ready for a ceasefire. Hamas has indicated that the talks are in the final stages.</p><p>Qatari officials have said that the talks have been at the closest that they have been in a number of months, and here in the U.S., too, officials have been expressing a level of optimism.</p><p>And I actually just asked President Biden here at the White House whether he believes that Hamas is about to agree to a ceasefire. He wouldn't verbally comment, but he did flash a fingers crossed sign. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEE: President, is Hamas about to say yes to the ceasefire?</p><p>Mr. President, what do you think? Is it going to happen?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEE: And one thing that is clear, Wolf, right now, is that all of the parties do appear to be in agreement that this deal is for Hamas to say yes to that, that final yes. And green light has to come from Hamas.</p><p>And as we have been reporting over the last 24 to 48 hours, we know that the Biden team and the Trump team have actually been working quite closely together to try to get this deal across the finish line, including, of course, the current and the incoming Middle East coordinators at the White House working together to hammer out details and even having joint conversations and joint calls.</p><p>That level of engagement from the incoming Trump team really is yet another reminder of how much the incoming president does not want to inherit this conflict when he is sworn in next week -- Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: Let's hope there is a deal in those hostages can come back to Israel.</p><p>MJ Lee at the White House, thank you very, very much.</p><p>And to our viewers, thanks very much for watching. I'm Wolf Blitzer in THE SITUATION ROOM.</p><p>\"ERIN BURNETT OUTFRONT\" starts right now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

According to news reporting out of Guangzhou, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"In this work, an improved dynamic convolutional neural network (DCNN) model to accurately identify the risk of a forest fire was established based on the traditional DCNN model. First, the DCNN network model was trained in combination with transfer learning, and multiple pre-trained DCNN models were used to extract features from forest fire images.\"</p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Key Field R&amp;D Program Project of Guangdong Province.<br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from South China Agricultural University: \"Second, principal component analysis (PCA) reconstruction technology was used in the appropriate subspace. The constructed 15-layer forest fire risk identification DCNN model named 'DCN_Fire' could accurately identify core fire insurance areas. Moreover, the original and enhanced image data sets were used to evaluate the impact of data enhancement on the model's accuracy. The traditional DCNN model was improved and the recognition speed and accuracy were compared and analyzed with the other three DCNN model algorithms with different architectures. The difficulty of using DCNN to monitor forest fire risk was solved, and the model's detection accuracy was further improved. The true positive rate was 7.41% and the false positive rate was 4.8%.\"<br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"When verifying the impact of different batch sizes and loss rates on verification accuracy, the loss rate of the DCN_Fire model of 0.5 and the batch size of 50 provided the optimal value for verification accuracy (0.983). The analysis results showed that the improved DCNN model had excellent recognition speed and accuracy and could accurately recognize and classify the risk of a forest fire under natural light conditions, thereby providing a technical reference for preventing and tackling forest fires.\"<br/> For more information on this research see: A Highly Accurate Forest Fire Prediction Model Based on an Improved Dynamic Convolutional Neural Network. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Applied Sciences</emphasis>, 2022,12(6721):6721.

According to news originating from the University of Halabja by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Mapping fire risk accurately is essential for the planning and protection of forests.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include National Key Research And Development Program of China, Key Projects For Strategic International Innovative Cooperation in Science And Technology. <br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from University of Halabja: \"This study aims to map fire risk (probability of ignition) in Marivan County of Kurdistan province, Iran, using the data mining approaches of the evidential belief function (EBF) and weight of evidence (WOE) models, with an emphasis placed on climatic variables. Firstly, 284 fire incidents in the region were randomly divided into two groups, including the training group (70%, 199 points) and the validation group (30%, 85 points). Given the previous studies and conditions of the region, the variables of slope percentage, slope direction, altitude, distance from rivers, distance from roads, distance from settlements, land use, slope curvature, rainfall, and maximum annual temperature were considered for zoning fire risk. Then, forest fire risk maps were prepared using the EBF and WOE models. The performance of each model was examined using the Relative Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The results showed that WOE and EBF are effective tools for mapping forest fire risks in the study area.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"However, the WOE model shows a slightly higher Area Under the Curve value (0.896) compared to that of the EBF model (0.886), indicating a slightly better performance. The results of this study can provide valuable information for preventing forest fires in the study area.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: A Comparative Study of Forest Fire Mapping Using GIS-Based Data Mining Approaches in Western Iran.

That could open the door for a new wave of partnerships between public land managers, private landowners and the local timber industry, which is a quiet economic driver in rural communities, especially.</p><p>\"If we don't work toward some species like oak or hickory - which are shade intolerant - then once those up in the overstory age out and die, if they're not recruiting underneath their shade or the shade of the other trees that have come in, then we lose all those acres,\" said Alex Hoffman, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources forester developing a management plan for Mines of Spain State Recreation Area near Dubuque. \"That means some aggressive harvesting, in targeted areas, where we need to increase those younger generations' chances and to increase a variety of species.\"</p><p>While there is both an aging tree stock in need of harvest and a demand for timber locally, most wood used by area companies comes from elsewhere, and the area's timber industry sends much of its wood away.</p><p>Landowners also have a role to play if the region's forests are to meet experts' standards, as most are still on private property.</p><p>Many area landowners are doing their own planning for their forests, including selling the logs produced when clearing some trees to manage their property. Iowa State University Extension and Outreach recently held a field day for woodland management in Delaware County to share options for landowners.</p><p>\"We're always looking</p><p>10 years down the road,\" Jody Kerns, who helps manage woods on her family's farm near Edgewood, said during the field day. \"Forestry is really futuristic.\"</p><p>THE CANOPY</p><p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture monitors land use and land coverage, by year, via satellite imagery. According to those surveys, the area has lost tree cover slowly but steadily from 1993 to 2023.</p><p>Still, eastern Iowa has more trees per acre than most of the state, as does northwest Illinois. And southwest Wisconsin has more trees per acre than most of the southern two-thirds of that state.</p><p>\"When we look at tree cover, northeast Iowa is our most abundant,\" said Iowa DNR forester Aron Flickinger. \"And for black walnut (for instance), northeast Iowa is the prime, premium stuff. ... That area is fairly rich with state forests. Most of our state lands have a forest management plan.\"</p><p>While objectives in those plans guide state actions, 85% of Iowa's forest is privately owned.</p><p>\"So it's mostly the private landowners who are going to decide what we do with our forest resource,\" Flickinger said. \"... We want to get people to think about trees long term, to get back to that old farmer saying of, 'Leave your land better than how you got it.'\"</p><p>According to the U.S. Forest Service's tree inventory for the larger Driftless region of the upper Midwest, the area's trees are predominated by American elm, black walnut, box elder, three species of oak, American basswood, black cherry, sugar maple and both shagbark and bitternut hickory. These are all deciduous hardwoods.</p><p>Much of the region once was home to oak savannas - characterized by large oak trees distanced by native prairie and younger oaks, dotted by smaller and faster-growing trees such as hickories and walnuts. But centuries of settlement, the removal of native peoples' management techniques and the depletion of wild grazing animals have led to those oak savannas being crowded by maples, other shade-tolerant trees and invasive understory species, which make growing younger oaks to replace the aging ones increasingly difficult.</p><p>\"That's a common theme across the state - our forests are aging and, as a result of that, they're changing,\" Hoffman said. \"So not always the most desirable species are growing underneath.\"</p><p>On her family's farm south of Edgewood, Iowa State Extension forestry specialist Emma Kerns guided a group of 30 people through the various types of forest her family manages. Kerns said her family wants different types of trees and woods on different areas of the property. That means different management in each of those areas. It also means different opportunities for what to do with each type of tree.</p><p>\"(Identifying) the trees is probably your most important first step,\" she told the group. \"(Shagbark hickory) is a great species for bats, which we want. ... Box elders will never get big enough to be a valuable, harvestable log. They don't do much for wildlife. They're basically like a weed you'd pull out of your garden.\"</p><p>CHANGING LANDSCAPE</p><p>The biggest losses of woodland in rural areas in the past 30 years have come since an early 2000s boom in commercial commodity agriculture committing most production to ethanol. Since that time, the city of Dubuque and nearby smaller towns have seen a sharp increase in development for residential and industrial purposes and the construction of major road projects such as the Northwest and Southwest arterials.</p><p>Both the growth of commodity agriculture - which led to the removal of wooded land in conservation easements - and urban development resulted in the clearing of many area trees. Time lapses available on the U.S. Forest Service's website show wooded lands melting away from both more rural areas and population centers.</p><p>Dubuque County Watersheds Agronomist Scott Hendricks said federal subsidies for corn grown for ethanol, in particular, dissuaded landowners from participating in the federal Conservation Reserve Program. That meant farmers increasingly culled trees from field breaks and other parts of their farms.</p><p>That practice of prioritizing commodity row crops over trees had numerous impacts - including reducing the streambank stabilization and water quality protections that trees along waterways provide and increasing wind erosion of topsoil.</p><p>But the decrease in tree cover over the past 30 years is not the whole story. Kirby Kendrick - who runs Kendrick Forest Products in Edgewood, a company his grandfather started in the 1950s - said that where there are woodlands, as in northeast Iowa, the number of trees is still historically high.</p><p>\"We have more trees than we did 100 years ago because of our land management practices,\" he said.</p><p>While state officials note that most woodland remains on private property, the reduction in trees for agriculture and for development means a greater portion of woodland is now on public agencies' land.</p><p>According to Hoffman, because different state properties are managed for different objectives - such as for wildlife habitat or outdoor recreation such as hiking - public forests have morphed accordingly.</p><p>Visitors to public areas are often leery of cutting trees, and natural resources managers tend to want to leave trees in place and undisturbed. Meanwhile, government land managers have historically put out any forest fires they encounter, which would not have happened naturally or when native peoples used fire as a management tool.</p><p>All of that has meant an aging of the stock, meaning public land managers now must assess where to steer management next. State agencies also have received status quo budgets over the past decade, which means there are fewer resources available for advancing goals when accounting for rising operational and material costs.</p><p>\"We're trying to come up with these forest management plans for all of our properties - whether they're owned by the Parks Bureau or the Forest Bureau,\" Hoffman said. \"Some have multiple-use plans. ... We'll try to keep on schedule, but it's hard. These plans get revisited, hopefully, every</p><p>10 years, so as forests change, we're adapting with that.\"</p><p>TREE HEALTH</p><p>Decades of relatively hands-off management approaches by landowners, public and private, also have allowed more invasive species or otherwise undesirable understory plants to choke much of the forest floor.</p><p>Hoffman said that is particularly true around the city of Dubuque and other cities in the Driftless region.</p><p>\"That's a challenge any time you get near the larger population centers,\" he said. \"What people plant ornamentally in their yards gets loose and causes issues. Like, (oriental) bittersweet grows up so much it tears down trees.\"</p><p>During her tour of her parents' farm, ISU Extension's Emma Kerns said attacking invasive species was the first step toward her family's goal of clearing such species from a grove of hickory on a hilltop near their home.</p><p>\"Even a few years ago, you couldn't even see through here it was so choked with honeysuckle,\" she told the field day group of the now open grove.</p><p>The Kernses removed the brush, and up from the leaf litter, a young oak sapling now stands, protected from predation by a metal cage.</p><p>Some invasive species are more harmful than others, however.</p><p>Oriental bittersweet vines, brought to the region as an ornamental plant, can tear even mature trees to the ground.</p><p>The emerald ash borer has destroyed many ash trees across the country and continues to be a problem without a ready solution. It followed Dutch elm disease's ravaging of elm trees. And oak wilt now is spreading through the area.</p><p>The upper Midwest has also had more storms with high winds in recent decades. Those have proven particularly hard on the region's old oaks, which have softer cores.</p><p>\"Older forests are more susceptible to disease and insect damage and storms,\" Hoffman said.</p><p>And yet, according to Flickinger, some landowners also have been resistant to part with their large trees, even when they are vulnerable.</p><p>\"We do a lot of educating landowners, making recommendations,\" he said. \"But people like those big, beautiful trees, so they don't want to take them down and get that next generation started. So what we get is the trees that won't probably last all that much longer.\"</p><p>MANAGEMENT PRACTICES</p><p>Recent blights that have hit forests, along with assessments as part of the DNR's planning process, have been educational for managers.</p><p>\"We planted a bunch of elm trees, and when Dutch elm disease came through, to replace those, we planted a lot of ash trees,\" Hoffman said. \"What came through next? The emerald ash borer. Since, we've planted a bunch of maples. You can see that the writing's on the wall. ... So one of our main charters of this (Mines of Spain management plan) is to encourage diversity in the forest. That's not just in species, but in age classes as well. Younger oaks are more resilient to certain diseases like oak wilt, for example.\"</p><p>Ongoing blights and other recent science also inform managers of how to time certain management techniques.</p><p>\"Any time we cut trees on the property, we wait for winter,\" Emma Kerns told her tour group. \"A lot of these shagbark hickory are habitat for bats in the spring through the fall. By winter, most of the bats are gone. We have a lot of species like oaks that are really vulnerable to disease when cut in the summer.\"</p><p>The Iowa DNR also aims to reverse course on many public land managers' aversion to using prescribed fire in woodlands, as Hoffman highlighted in the Mines of Spain plan.</p><p>\"That's a tool we've removed from the landscape,\" he said. \"So we have some prescribed fire management in the plan to promote that oak (which is fire tolerant).\"</p><p>But, Emma Kerns said fire - while gaining public awareness as a beneficial tool - is not a cure-all and is not always appropriate for forest health.</p><p>\"All of the other work on the property is introducing young saplings which you don't want to burn,\" she said. \"Also, there's no oak in that stand. Oak leaves help fires burn hotter. So it could be hard to get the fire hot enough to kill the root stock of the honeysuckle.\"</p><p>Sometimes, whole stands of trees may need to be cut down to promote the woodland's long-term health.</p><p>\"We hear 'clear cut,' and it sounds scary,\" Emma Kerns said. \"But for our goals, it is necessary. Part of that is because oaks are shade intolerant.\"</p><p>TIMBER!</p><p>While many landowners are trying to improve their woodlands, many also have trees cut down as a source of income.</p><p>Some of the area's most common trees, especially oak and walnut, also make high-dollar logs for lumber. And according to Flickinger, area conditions make certain trees prized even among their species.</p><p>\"Iowa's black walnut is known for being the right kind of color people are looking for. Iowa, Illinois and Indiana are renowned,\" he said. \"Within Iowa, northeast Iowa is the prime, premium stuff. The best walnut gets marketed on a global basis.\"</p><p>Nationally, a decreasing number of sawmills - largely driven by mergers and consolidation of ownership by the biggest companies - has stressed the timber industry, slowed the supply chain and driven up wood prices, according to a recent report by the U.S. Forest Service.</p><p>\"Like every industry, it's consolidating,\" Flickinger said. \"We have 10 or 12 what I would call those traditional, large sawmills left (in Iowa).\"</p><p>Around 30 years ago, he said, Iowa had several times that number.</p><p>But eastern Iowa has several sawmills.</p><p>Kendrick Forest Products, headquartered in Edgewood, has grown to employ around 170 people and diversified into many aspects of the lumber sector - forestry, logging, sawmilling, mulch production and exports. The business even prints images on shims to order and to supply national retailers.</p><p>According to Kendrick, the mill works 500 to 600 logs per eight-hour shift from trees sourced within 150 miles of its mills.</p><p>\"We're utilizing every aspect of the log available,\" he said. \"We take a byproduct and turn it into mulch, for instance. We get the value added and use all of the material. ... We do all hardwood, with our three main species being walnut, white oak and red oak. But we'll also do ash, hard maple, hickory, basswood.\"</p><p>Emma Kerns said that if landowners are interested in selling some of their trees, they should be sure to get their woodlands assessed by a forester.</p><p>\"Often as landowners, we underestimate the value of our 'bad' trees and overestimate the value of our 'good' trees,\" she said. \"What makes a good tree or a bad tree are up to the markets and your goals. You don't know how valuable (a forester assessment) is compared to just letting some stranger who comes to your door tell you what this tree or that tree is worth.\"</p><p>Each area state's DNR publishes annual lists of bonded timber buyers and their locations.</p><p>As public lands are traditionally managed for the health of the trees themselves, for wildlife habitat or for outdoor recreation, county and state managers of public woodlands leave many logs - felled intentionally or by aging stock meeting storms - to decompose naturally. These can become \"nurse logs\" from which other plants, mosses or fungi can grow. They also feed decomposer insects and other organisms and provide shelter for small mammals and amphibians.</p><p>But too much debris can pose safety hazards for hikers and could increase forest fire risk and intensity. So public agencies do targeted logging and, occasionally, tree sales. Yellow River State Forest in northeast Iowa held a tree sale last year that generated $500,000 in revenue.</p><p>An ongoing need for new housing means a great deal of new construction is planned in the tri-state area and nationally in coming years. Tim Noonan, president of Cascade Lumber Co., said the lumber his company sells for home construction is mostly from either Canadian forests or from yellow pine groves in the South that are succession-planted for harvest.</p><p>The tri-state area's different tree varieties are predominantly sold for veneer and aesthetic products and so are mostly sold elsewhere, including exports to Europe and Asia.</p><p>\"A lot of our material is going to flooring manufacturers, cabinet manufacturers,\" Kendrick said. \"We sell the wood by the truckload, whereas a lot of contractors around here get theirs from distributors.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELHLD-7847218</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELHLD2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DK3-6T41-JCDM-J02Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">156396</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2801\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Woodward Communications, Inc.

Miller Airpark, which includes the Ocean County Airport, was first reported around 11:40 p.m. Saturday, a spokesman for the New Jersey Forest Fire Service said during a news conference late Sunday afternoon.</p><p>By 4 p.m. Sunday, the fire had not been contained and was threatening 25 structures, a spokesman for the Forest Fire Service said, noting \"abnormally dry\" conditions in the area due to low rain amounts.</p><p>Emergency responders had closed portions of several major regional roads, including Dover and Mule Roads in Lacey Township. Residents were told they did not need to evacuate their homes, but officials urged everyone to avoid the area of the fire. Volunteer fire companies were assisting the Forest Fire Service in protecting buildings threatened by the growing blaze, officials said.</p><p>A spokesperson from the National Transportation Safety Board said in a statement Sunday that the plane, a Cirrus SR20, crashed at 10:18 p.m. Saturday about half a mile southwest of the Ocean County Airport, which consists of 822 acres in both Lacey and Berkeley Townships, according to its website. The plane had taken off from Monmouth Executive Airport in Farmingdale, N.J., about 30 miles north of the crash site, according to the statement.</p><p>At the news conference later Sunday afternoon, Brian Rayner, a senior safety investigator at the NTSB, said a positive identity of the pilot was not yet available and that NTSB investigators, local police, and the medical examiner had not yet been able to get to the crash site because of the fire. Rayner said he had only seen aerial video of the site provided by Forest Service helicopters.</p><p>Rayner said he did not believe weather was a factor in the crash, noting winds were calm and conditions clear Saturday night.</p><p>Rayner said he anticipated being able to access the crash scene Monday and possibly have the remains of the plane removed to an off-site facility for examination.</p><p>Lacey Township is a municipality of about 29,000 located 60 miles east of Philadelphia. The Ocean County Airport is five miles southwest of Toms River Township, providing quick access to the Jersey Shore, according to its website. It provides two runways and a heliport, and accommodates private planes, corporate jets, and emergency services aircraft.</p><p>Dry conditions have kept the Forest Fire Service busy over the last several months. Two weeks ago, fire crews battled a 1,500-acre wildfire in Camden and Burlington Counties in Wharton State Forest, near the former Atco Dragway. Its cause remains under investigation.</p><p>Last summer, a wildfire in Wharton State Forest was the largest in New Jersey in 15 years.

According to news originating from Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"As global climate change and human activities increasingly influence our world, forest fires have become more frequent, inflicting significant damage to ecosystems. This study conducted measurements of combustible materials (moisture content ratio, ignition point, and calorific value) across 14 representative sites.\" </p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power: \"We employed Pearson correlation analysis to ascertain the significant differences in combustible properties and utilized entropy methods to evaluate the fire resistance of materials at these sites. Cluster analysis led to the development of four combustible models. Using BehavePlus software, we simulated their fire behaviors and investigated the effects of wind speed and slope on these behaviors through sensitivity analysis. The results revealed notable differences in the moisture content ratios among different types of combustibles, especially in sites 2, 3, 8, 9, and 13, indicating higher fire risks. It was also found that while humus has a higher ignition point and lower calorific value, making it less prone to ignite, the resultant fires could be highly damaging. The Pearson analysis underscored significant variations in the moisture content ratios among different combustibles, while the differences in ignition points and calorific values were not significant. Sites 5 and 6 demonstrated stronger fire resistance. The simulations indicated that fire-spread speed, fireline intensity, and flame length correlate with, and increase with, wind speed and slope.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Sensitivity analysis confirmed the significant influence of these two environmental factors on fire behavior. This study provides critical insights into forest fire behavior, enhancing the capability to predict and manage forest fires. Our findings offer theoretical support for forest fire prediction and a scientific basis for fire management decision-making.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Characterizing Forest Fuel Properties and Potential Wildfire Dynamics in Xiuwu, Henan, China.

Attributable royalty revenue(1) of $16.6 million ($0.36 per share(1)) compares to $21.8 million in Q2 2024 and to $17.8 million ($0.38 per share) reported in Q3 2023.</p><p>Brian Dalton, CEO commented, \"Revenue in the current quarter reflects lower potash prices and seasonal mine maintenance activities, lower dividends from Labrador Iron Ore Royalty Corp. (\"LIORC\") on forest fire related disruptions and slightly weaker pricing, and the closure of the Genesee Mine. This was partially offset by higher base metal prices and continuing ramp up of the renewable royalty portfolio. The potash market has returned to its long-term demand growth trendline following a period of price shocks and affordability challenges for farmers. There is continued growth in the renewables segment as new royalty projects commission and incremental investments are completed.

This strategy further provides shareholders with exposures that are well aligned with sustainability-related global growth trends including the electricity generation transition from fossil fuel to renewables, transportation electrification, reduced emissions from steelmaking and increasing agricultural yield requirements. These macro-trends each hold the potential to cause increased demand for many of Altius's commodity exposures including copper, renewable based electricity, several key battery metals (lithium, nickel and cobalt), clean iron ore, and potash. In addition, Altius runs a successful Project Generation business that originates mineral projects for sale to developers in exchange for equity positions and royalties. Altius has 46,479,865 common shares issued and outstanding that are listed on Canada's Toronto Stock Exchange.

According to news originating from Barcelona, Spain, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"Wildfires pose one of the greatest threats to the world's forests soils.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Framework Programme; Agencia De Gestio D'ajuts Universitaris I De Recerca. <br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from University of Barcelona: \"After exposure to fire, forests lose many of their ecological functions; moreover, the repercussions can extend well beyond the forest itself, as the erosive processes attributable to the combustion of vegetation and the soil's lack of protection against rainfall are likely to impact any areas of a catchment, contaminating reservoirs, estuaries and aquifers. A forest fire is not solely, therefore, an environmental issue, but also a social and economic problem. The recovery of a forest is heavily dependent on just how the soil has been affected and how rapidly the latter can be restored. Fire intensity is critical in understanding the temporal evolution of the forest, while its location-a clear determinant of its climate and the ecosystem it occupies-can undermine the functionality of the forest system and is critical in determining the duration of the effects of the fire episode. This paper undertakes a review of the literature with the aim of understanding what might be understood when studies speak of the long-term effects of fire on the soil and when a soil might be considered to have recovered from these effects.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"What is evident is that many variables have a role to play and that not all soil properties recover at the same rate; indeed, some may never be restored to pre-fire levels.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: How Long Is Long?

Forest Service has issued a ban on all open burning and has canceled all burning permits for Alexander, Alleghany, Ashe, Avery, Buncombe, Caldwell, Catawba, Haywood, Iredell, Lincoln, Madison, Mecklenburg, Mitchell, Watauga, Wilkes and Yancey counties effective 5 p.m., Wednesday, Nov. 8, until further notice.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With the long-range forecast and conditions on the ground showing no improvement, expanding the ban on open burning to additional counties is a necessary precaution, said Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler. We keep a close eye on weather, fire danger and fuel conditions, especially this time of year. Were making daily assessments, and the burn ban will be expanded into Piedmont counties and further east if needed. If youre in a county that does not fall under the ban, think twice about any outdoor burning until we see significant, soaking rain across the state.</p><p>Under North Carolina law, the ban prohibits all open burning in the affected counties, regardless of whether a permit was previously issued. The issuance of any new permits has also been suspended until the ban is lifted. Anyone violating the burn ban faces a $100 fine plus $183 court costs. Any person responsible for setting a fire may be liable for any expenses related to extinguishing the fire.</p><p>Local fire departments and law enforcement officers are assisting the N.C. Forest Service in enforcing the burn ban.</p><p>The N.C. Forest Service will continue to monitor conditions. Residents with questions regarding a specific county can contact their N.C. Forest Service county ranger or their county fire marshals office.</p><p>Answers to FAQ</p><p>Q: What is open burning?</p><p>A: Open burning includes burning leaves, branches or other plant material. In all cases, burning trash, lumber, tires, newspapers, plastics or other nonvegetative material is illegal.</p><p>Q: May I still use my grill or barbecue?</p><p>A: Yes, if no other local ordinances prohibit their use.</p><p>Q: How should I report a wildfire?</p><p>A: Call 911 to report a wildfire.</p><p>Q: How should I report a person who intentionally starts a wildfire?</p><p>A: Call 911 to report a wildfire.</p><p>Q: My local fire marshal has also issued a burn ban for my county. What does this mean?</p><p>A: The burn ban issued by the N.C. Forest service does not apply to a fire within 100 feet of an occupied dwelling. Local government agencies have jurisdiction over open burning within 100 feet of an occupied dwelling. The N.C. Forest Service has advised county fire marshals of the burning ban and has asked for their consideration of also implementing a burning ban. If a fire within a 100-foot area of a dwelling escapes containment, a North Carolina forest ranger may take reasonable steps to extinguish or control it. The person responsible for setting the fire may be liable for any expenses related to extinguishing the fire.</p><p>Q: Are there other instances which impact open burning?</p><p>A: Local ordinances and air quality regulations may impact open burning. For instance, outdoor burning is prohibited in areas covered by Code Orange or Code Red air quality forecasts. Learn more about air quality forecasts at <url normalizedValue=\"https://deq.nc.gov/about/divisions/air-quality/air-quality-outreach-education/air-quality-forecasts\">https://deq.nc.gov/about/divisions/air-quality/air-quality-outreach-education/air-quality-forecasts</url>.</p><p>Q: Can I have a campfire when I go camping?</p><p>A: Campfires would be considered open burning and are not exempt from the burn ban. During a burn ban, portable gas stoves or grills are alternate methods for cooking food while camping.</p><p>Q: What can I do to protect my house against the risk of wildfire?</p><p>A: Learn about wildfire risk assessments and preparedness and prevention plans on the N.C.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126235346</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69KK-4GX1-JCBF-S0YK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"619\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 8, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news originating from Harbin, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"In recent years, frequent forest fires have plagued countries all over the world, causing serious economic damage and human casualties.\" </p><p><br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Northeast Forestry University: \"Faster and more accurate detection of forest fires and timely interventions have become a research priority. With the advancement in deep learning, fully convolutional network architectures have achieved excellent results in the field of image segmentation. More researchers adopt these models to segment flames for fire monitoring, but most of the works are aimed at fires in buildings and industrial scenarios. However, there are few studies on the application of various fully convolutional models to forest fire scenarios, and comparative experiments are inadequate. In view of the above problems, on the basis of constructing the dataset with remote-sensing images of forest fires captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and the targeted optimization of the data enhancement process, four classical semantic segmentation models and two backbone networks are selected for modeling and testing analysis. By comparing inference results and the evaluation indicators of models such as mPA and mIoU, we can find out the models that are more suitable for forest fire segmentation scenarios.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The results show that the U-Net model with Resnet50 as a backbone network has the highest segmentation accuracy of forest fires with the best comprehensive performance, and is more suitable for scenarios with high-accuracy requirements; the DeepLabV3+ model with Resnet50 is slightly less accurate than U-Net, but it can still ensure a satisfying segmentation performance with a faster running speed, which is suitable for scenarios with high real-time requirements. In contrast, FCN and PSPNet have poorer segmentation performance and, hence, are not suitable for forest fire detection scenarios.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Comparative Research on Forest Fire Image Segmentation Algorithms Based on Fully Convolutional Neural Networks.

By late Friday afternoon, it was 1,193 acres with 0% containment \u2014 showing how quickly it spread upslope in the current drought conditions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The fire was sparked by a tractor-trailer wreck on I-40 in the remote Pigeon River Gorge on Thursday morning three miles from the Tennessee state line, and the resulting forest fire spread quickly through the steep, rugged terrain.</p><p>As the fire spread Thursday, the safety of hikers along the Appalachian Trail \u2014 which passes through the area \u2014 became a concern.</p><p>Haywood County Emergency Service began working to alert hikers of the fire danger, Haywood County Emergency Services Public Information Officer Allison Richmond said. The Appalachian Trail between I-40 and Max Patch has been closed, and hikers already in the area were instructed to leave immediately.</p><p>The N.C. Forest Service and U.S. Forest Service led the assault on the fire when it first broke out Thursday. Resources from the Southern Area Blue Team \u2014 which had been fighting the massive forest fire in Cherokee County \u2014 were mobilized to the Black Bear Fire and assumed command of the fight against the blaze.</p><p>Personnel and equipment on scene included air attack, air tankers, helicopters, hand crews, and dozers. Aircraft dropped water and retardant to slow the fire progression. By Friday morning, 30 firefighters were on scene fighting the blaze.</p><p>On Friday, crews worked to assess the area for the construction of primary, alternate and contingency hand and dozer lines from I-40 up to the Tennessee state line, as well as looking for structures and other properties that may be at risk.</p><p>Motorists are being cautioned about the potential for reduced visibility due to smoke when traveling the section of I-40.</p><p>State troopers have closed Cold Springs Creek Road and Brown Mountain Road near I-40 exit 7 to keep people away from the fire.</p><p>The fire is far from the only one going on at the moment. According to press releases from the NC Forest Service, there have been 737 fires on public and private land across the state in the first 16 days of November.</p><p>One of the largest is in Cherokee County. That fire, dubbed the Collett Ridge Fire, has burned 5,505 acres and was 80% contained as of Friday morning.</p><p>The fire grew from just 110 acres as of Nov. 3, to 2,100 acres by Nov. 6, to 4,372 acres by Nov. 8 \u2014 showing the exponential growth these wildfires are capable of.</p><p>As of Friday morning, Haywood County was sitting in the moderate drought category, allowing the fire to spread more quickly with dry environments.</p><p>Tuesday appears to be the best chance of rain, with an 85% chance to see precipitation that day, according to The Weather Channel. That will help, but it is not expected to be a heavy rain, with just a half inch expected to fall.</p><p>Haywood County is also under a code red air quality for \"fine particulates\" that \"may approach or exceed unhealthy standards,\" according to the NC Department of Environmental Quality.</p><p>___ (c)2023 The Mountaineer (Waynesville, N.C.)

According to news reporting originating from Andhra Pradesh, India, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Over the last few decades, forest fires are increased due to deforestation and global warming. Many trees and animals in the forest are affected by forest fires.\"</p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from VIT-AP University: \"Technology can be efficiently utilized to solve this problem. Forest fire detection is inevitable for forest fire management. The purpose of this work is to propose deep learning techniques to predict forest fires, which would be cost-effective. The mixed learning technique is composed of YOLOv4 tiny and LiDAR techniques. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are promising options to patrol the forest by making them fly over the region. The proposed model deployed on an onboard UAV has achieved 1.24 seconds of classification time with an accuracy of 91% and an F1 score of 0.91.\"<br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The onboard CPU is able to make a 3D model of the forest fire region and can transmit the data in real time to the ground station. The proposed model is trained on both dense and rainforests in detecting and predicting the chances of fire. The proposed model outperforms the traditional methods such as Bayesian classifiers, random forest, and support vector machines.\"<br/> For more information on this research see: Early Detection of Forest Fire Using Mixed Learning Techniques and UAV. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience</emphasis>, 2022,2022.

Byrne State Forest are asked to stay vigilant when driving in smoke conditions.\"</p><p>No injuries had been reported, per 6ABC, and a cause had yet to be determined.</p><p>Crews on the ground were using a \"backfiring operation\" to fight the fire, per the Forest Fire Service. That means firefighters are intentionally setting a fire on the edge of the blaze in an effort to control its direction.</p><p>New Jersey has had a busy wildfire season thus far: It started earlier than usual this year with the Jimmy's Waterhole fire, which burned 3,800 acres of land in Ocean County, about 50 miles east of Philadelphia. Since then, other massive blazes have cropped up across the central and southern portions of the state, including a four-day-long fire in Bass River State Forest that temporarily closed the Garden State Parkway, and another in Burlington County that grew to overtake 850 acres.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:bforman@inquirer.com\">bforman@inquirer.com</email></p><p>beaformanwrites</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHIINQ-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHIINQ2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68H7-YM71-JC3R-B0N4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"291\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Philadelphia Inquirer</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 20, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>META PLATFORMS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS516210 MEDIA STREAMING DIST SVCS, SOCIAL NETWORKS, AND OTHER MEDIA NETWORKS AND CONTENT PROVIDERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>SIC7374 COMPUTER PROCESSING &amp; DATA PREPARATION &amp; PROCESSING SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>META (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000454</classCode><className>DEATH NOTICES &amp; OBITUARIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N115300CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DD39</classCode><className>BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000113</classCode><className>ARSON</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009L2V</classCode><className>LISTINGS &amp; NOTICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N115300CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GX602</classCode><className>PHILADELPHIA, PA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS146</classCode><className>NEW JERSEY, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

According to news originating from Tribhuvan University by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"The research work was focused on the study of forest fire and its impact assessment on plant biodiversity by vegetation assessment in the fire-affected and adjoining non-affected areas to identify the signals of severity and probable causes of fire. Data were collected by quadrate method, site survey, consultation and group discussion, mapping of the studied area, and questionnaire survey.\" </p><p><br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Tribhuvan University: \"The results show that there was a notable difference in tree and shrub diversity. The Shannon Wienner index (H) = 0.70 and 0.49, and Simpson's Divesity (D) = 0.64 and 0.51, for trees in adjoining and fire-affected areas respectively. Similarly, Shannon Wienner index (H) = 0.91 and 0.72, and Simpson's Divesity (D) = 0.84 and 0.68 for shrubs in adjoining and fire-affected areas respectively. Likewise, herb diversity did not differ significantly (H = 1.02 and 0.97; D = 0.87 and 0.88 in the adjacent to burned area and fire-affected area). Gleichenia gigantea, Artemisia dubia, Rubus spp., Oxalis chodata, and some medicinal plants such as Butea minor were found to be most affected by the fire. Mainly dried thickets of Drepanostachyum intermedium and Saccharum spontaneum act as fuel for the fire, which easily ignites and regenerates soon after a fire.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Drought before monsoon was found to be the leading cause of forest fires, followed by electricity shooting (17%), ignorance and carelessness (38%), slash and burn practice (15%), other (7%), and unknown causes (23%). Hence the need to better address the drivers of resource extraction from the national park to mitigate this degradation.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Assessment of Forest Fire and Its Impact on Plant Biodiversity of Buffer Zone, Langtang National Park, Nepal.

Our drilling activity increased year over year and the proportion of higher margin, specialized drilling activity was also higher.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Our performance in Canada in Q1 last year was impacted by temporary project suspension due to the forest fire in Quebec as well as our customer decision to temporarily suspend or reduce activity on certain other projects. We had no comparable disruption in Q1 this year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In our international operations, we benefit from increased activity in Chile and Guyana in Q1 this year and the cessation of our operations in West Africa which were largely unprofitable for us.</p><p>Our total revenue in the quarter was $48.4 million.

We announced a normal course issuer bid last month.</p><p>It enabled us to buy back and cancel up approximately 5% of our outstanding common shares over a 12 month period. This is an additional tool we can use to build value for our shareholders.</p><p>I will now turn the call over Daniel to review our results for the first quarter. Daniel.</p><p>DANIEL MAHEU FORAGE ORBIT GARANT INC, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER: Thank you, Pierre and Good morning everyone. Canada revenue was $35.4 million in the quarter. An increase of $7.4 million from Q1 last year as Kle noted drilling activity in Canada increased year over year including a higher proportion of specialized drilling activity.</p><p>International revenue totaled $13 million in the quarter. An increase of 14.8% compared to Q1 a year ago, reflecting increased activity in Chile and Guyana partially offset by the absence of activity in West Africa.</p><p>Gross profit increased to $7.4 million for the quarter or 15.2% of revenue compared to $4.1 million or 9.4% of revenue in Q1 last year.</p><p>As we noted earlier, our adjusted growth margin excluding depreciation expenses was 19.7% in the quarter compared to 15.2% in Q1 2024.</p><p>The increase in gross profit growth margin and adjusted growth margin reflects increased drilling activity in Canada, Chile and Guyana during the quarrel, including a higher proportion of specialized rain in Canada and the cessation of our drilling activities in West Africa consolidated earnings from operations for the quarter were $4.4 million compared to $1.2 million in Q1 last year.</p><p>Canada's operation earnings totaled $2.3 million compared to $1.4 million in Q1 a year ago. And our international operating earnings totaled $2.1 million compared to an operating loss of $0.2 million a year ago.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA increased to $6.5 million compared to $3 million in Q1 last year.</p><p>The increase is in or adjusted and net earnings were primarily attributable to the stronger earnings in both our canadian and international drilling operations.</p><p>Now turning to our balance sheet, we repay a net amount of $0.5 million on our credit facility in the quarter compared to a withdrawal of $2.7 million in Q1 last year, our long term debt under the credit facility including $3 million. Us draw from our revolving facility and the current person who has $21 million at quarter end compared to $21.5 million. As of June 30th 2024 our fiscal 2024 year, our working capital total $50.4 million as at September 30th compared to $48.6 million at the end of fiscal 2024.</p><p>I will now turn the call back to Ken for closing comment.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE FORAGE ORBIT GARANT INC: Thanks Daniel.</p><p>When we complete our exit from West Africa in Q2 of fiscal 2024 we said that decision would have a positive impact on our future margins.</p><p>I am pleased to note that we have reported significant year over year growth in profitability in each of the three quarters since then.</p><p>This demonstrates that our operational performance is improving and that our decision to focus primarily on our operations in Canada and Chile is the correct one.</p><p>That was a key element of the strategic five point plan for orbit that we first introduced in May 2023. It was designed to improve our operating performance over the following 15 months and consist of primarily focusing on our canadian gold winning operation, prioritizing longer term specialized during contract with major and intermediate customers opportunistically pursuing international contracts in stable markets that offer attractive returns while gradually reducing exposure to Burkina faso continued investment in driller training and computerized drilling technology and building a team oriented leadership structure that fosters collaboration and personal accountability.</p><p>We made significant progress in each of these areas and the results are reflecting our strengthened financial performance.</p><p>Our efforts are being supported by strong metal prices. Gold prices have trade at record highs above $2700 per ounce in recent weeks. And copper price have also continued to trade well above $4 per ounce. So we expect that customer demand from senior and well financed intermediate mining companies will remain strong.</p><p>Junior mining continued to face difficult financing conditions which has limited their exploration spending.</p><p>We cannot predict when junior mining finances with financing will recover, but once it does demand for our services should further strengthen.</p><p>That concludes our formal remarks this morning. We will now welcome any questions.</p><p>Operator. Please begin the question for you.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Should you have a question? Please? Press star followed by the number one on your touchtone phone. If you will hear a prompt that your hand has been raised. Should you wish to decline from the polling process? Please press star followed by the number two.</p><p>If you are using a speaker phone, please make sure you lift your handset before pressing any case.</p><p>One moment while we prepare the Q&amp;A roster.</p><p>Your first question comes from the line of Terry Balama private investor. Please go ahead.</p><p>TERRY BALAMA: Hi, thank you for taking the call. Congratulations on the good quarter.</p><p>Thank you. I would like to know for the trailing 12 months.</p><p>What was the adjusted EBITDA?</p><p>And what was the adjusted net income I have here? It's $18 million area for the trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA and roughly $6 million net income for the trailing 12 months. Is that about correct?</p><p>DANIEL MAHEU FORAGE ORBIT GARANT INC: The adjusted a bit for the last year, 12 months at $6.3 million. And this quarter we do 6.4. So that means it will be 9.5 on the last four quarter. So it should be around $9.5million adjusted EBITDA.</p><p>So we do adjusted of $6.4million this quarter and for the last year, it's $6.3million. So technically I just have to reduce by $3 million for the Ebitda of Q1 2024 and I have $6.5million for Q1 2025. So it should, it should reach 9.3-$9.4 million for the 12 last month.</p><p>TERRY BALAMA: Okay. There are some special items in there. Correct that, I think I added, so I came up with around 18, so I'll have to look at that later. The other question I had was on the seasonality. What is the highest and lowest seasonality for Canada and for South America.</p><p>DANIEL MAHEU FORAGE ORBIT GARANT INC: The seasonality in Canada for us, it's Q1. So July to September, it's a good quarter and the last one, Q4 which is April May and June, it's good because in Canada, we are in fact as you know, in the winter. So in Q2 and Q3 in Canada is more difficult because we have winter and also we have the holiday season in Canada, most of our revenue came from Canada. But we or our operation in Chile as you know, Chile have winter and summer. So for example, in August this year and in September this year, they have a lot of snow in the, in the mountain in Chile. So it's harder for the, the, let's say Q1 for the Chilean operation is lower than the, the other three other core.</p><p>TERRY BALAMA: Okay. Last question in the last six months, the company has done around $12 to $13 million adjusted EBITDA in the last six months. Is it realistic to do about $20 to $25 million adjusted EBITDA?</p><p>For the 12 months that would be ending in June of 2025.</p><p>DANIEL MAHEU FORAGE ORBIT GARANT INC: We don't provide the guidance on total a bit in the future, but you're right when you said we have adjusted a bit in the last six, you see in Q4 last year, we do $6.3 million adjusted a bit in this quarter. In Q1 2025 we have $6.5million adjusted EBITDA. So in the last six months, we do roughly $13 million of it, but we hope that will be stable.</p><p>TERRY BALAMA: Okay Congratulations again on the turnaround. And those are my questions. Thank you.</p><p>PIERRE ALEXANDRE FORAGE ORBIT GARANT INC: Thank you very, very much. Have a good day.</p><p>OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, as a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. And if you would like to withdraw your question, please press star two.</p><p>Your next question comes from the line of David Selstro from BMO. Please go ahead.</p><p>DAVID SELSTRO BMO, ANALYST: Congratulations, gentlemen, great quarter.</p><p>PIERRE ALEXANDRE FORAGE ORBIT GARANT INC: Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>DAVID SELSTRO BMO: So my question is regarding the revenues and profitability on the international operations relative to Canada, you have significantly more revenue in Canada and yet the profitability between the two international versus Canada is almost equal. So I'm just wondering, is that a reflection on the type of drilling and the margins charged or is it old contracts that maybe are going to be renewed that the pricing gets better in Canada? Thank you.</p><p>DANIEL MAHEU FORAGE ORBIT GARANT INC: Thank you. Thank you for the question. You know, in Canada, we we almost have a 75 74% of revenue coming from canadian operation. The Canadian operation is very segmented. That means that there are a lot of small drilling company with few drills. This create a lot of competition and negative pressure on price in Canada on nonspecialized project. That's why we, we tend to be more focused on specialized contract. So the margins are better for these contracts in Chile, let's say international, it's principally Chile actually. So there we have large contract with the large customer and the copper industry which the pressure on price is is less than we have here in Canada. And since January 2024 we see more drilling activity in Guyana, which is a small country in the north of South America, but we are there since more than 20 years. So we saw a bit of drilling contract and the margins are quite good on this contract in Guyana. So that's why actually the with the only, let's say 25% of our revenue, the international do quite well.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call over to Pierre Alexander for closing remarks, sir. Please go ahead.</p><p>PIERRE ALEXANDRE FORAGE ORBIT GARANT INC: Thank you to everyone for participating today.

According to news reporting from Merced, California, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Wildfires are increasing in duration and intensity across the United States' Pacific West region, resulting in heightened particulate matter from smoke in the atmosphere. Levels of peak particulate matter are concurrent to peak visitor attendance at National Parks, given seasonal alignment with summer vacation travel and heightened forest fire conditions.\" </p><p><br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from the University of California, \"Particulate matter threatens visitor health and safety and contributes to poor visibility and a deteriorated visitor experience. To assess visitation response to diminished air quality, we utilized wildfiregenerated particulate matter (PM2.5) data in conjunction with monthly attendance records for three ecoregions containing eight national parks in Washington, Oregon, and California from 2009 to 2019. We analyzed daily PM2.5 levels from data gridded at the 10 km scale for National Park Service units by Level III forest ecoregions within the National Park Service's Pacific West Unit. Data were then compared to normalized monthly visitation trends for each of the ecoregions using two statistical methods Kendall's Tau and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc Tukey tests. Results demonstrate that attendance at these national parks does not decrease in response to increased PM2.5 levels. Instead, we see several statistically significant increases in attendance across these ecoregions during periods of reduced air quality. Of 115 shifts between air quality categories during the busy season of July to September, there are no significant decreases in attendance as air quality worsens. These findings suggest that visitors are willing to tolerate reduced air quality compared to other factors such as temperature or precipitation. Given that park units within each ecoregion feature diverse historical contexts, varied built environments, and unique ecological systems, our discussion specifically addresses managerial concerns associated with maintained high levels of visitation during suboptimal, and potentially dangerous, conditions.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"There is substantial need for specific, scalable approaches to mitigate adverse health and experiential impacts as visitors are exposed to increased risks during a range of exertional activities associated with diverse settings.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Decreased Air Quality Shows Minimal Influence On Peak Summer Attendance At Forested Pacific West National Parks.

Forest fire danger levels are issued for the state by DEEPs Division of Forestry. Red flag warnings are issued by the National Weather Service. A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions are either occurring now, or will shortly. Any fires that start may spread rapidly and become difficult to extinguish.</p><p>With very high forest fire danger today, DEEP encourages residents to be aware of how to prevent forest fires, and to familiarize yourself with the tips available here: Forest Fire Prevention Tips (ct.gov)</p><p>DEEP reminds all state residents that if they have a permit from their local Open Burning Official allowing them to burn brush on their property, the permit is not valid if the Forest Fire Danger is rated High, Very High, or Extreme and you are burning within 100 feet of a grassland or woodland.</p><p>Information About Spring Fire Season: Normally Mid-March to Mid-May</p><p>After the snow melts in the northeastern part of the U.S., we enter into a traditional spring fire season. This is the time of year when deciduous trees are bare and the warm spring sun heats up the forest fuels. Forest fuels are made up of anything that burns; typically grasses, leaves, twigs, branches, and decaying material in the soil. As the days grow longer and the sun gets hotter, the fuels that are most exposed dry out very fast. Grasses, twigs, and very small branches are called \"1-hour fuels\". That is, they can take on atmospheric conditions within an hour. Consequently, we can receive precipitation and, if the sun comes out and a breeze picks up, the fine fuels can be available for burning within an hour. Larger fuels take longer to dry out. Typically, fires that start this time of year burn just the surface leaves and can spread very fast. Generally, they cause little, long-term damage to the forest.</p><p>During the spring, the Spread Index usually drives the fire danger. Wind is most critical.</p><p>To view the daily Forest Fire Danger level, go here: Forest Fire Danger Report (ct.gov)</p><p>If you would like to receive notification regarding Connecticut's wildfire danger by e-mail, please subscribe to the Forest Fire Danger listserv.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125833292</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67YR-77K1-JCBF-S1KX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"435\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"04\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>April 8, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008ZAI</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N926130GQ</classCode><className>ENERGY DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp; NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120QC</classCode><className>OCEANOGRAPHIC &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008ZAI</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001900</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp; UTILITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N926130GQ</classCode><className>ENERGY DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX546</classCode><className>HARTFORD, CT, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GS122</classCode><className>CONNECTICUT, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GR214</classCode><className>NORTHEAST USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

They will apply this information to forest management planning through a collaborative process that balances the habitat needs of birds with the objectives of local human communities. The research and process will ultimately transform our ability to sustain healthy bird populations throughout the Appalachian region.</p><p>\"Conservation planning to restore and sustain migratory bird populations has been occurring for many years,\" said Emily Cohen, an associate professor at UMCES. \"But these efforts have been singularly focused on increasing habitats for birds during the breeding season, while habitat needs during migration have been largely overlooked. The focus of this project is to provide the information necessary to include migratory habitat needs, along with breeding, into planning efforts and then to develop those plans together with the communities living in those areas.\"</p><p>This research is one of 10 projects receiving funding under the Partnership to Advance Conservation Science and Practice (PACSP) program, a first-of-its-kind collaboration between NSF and the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation. Now in its second year, the program is designed to catalyze deep collaboration between researchers advancing basic science and conservation partners engaging in on-the-ground conservation.</p><p>The projects focus on a range of species--from migrating songbirds and grizzly bears to Venus flytraps and the Hawaiian honeycreeper--and the outcomes will have far-reaching implications for biodiversity and conservation, policy and the economy.</p><p>\"The fundamental knowledge these projects create, even though related to specific species, will unlock innovative conservation efforts across a broader range of threatened species and ecosystems,\" said Lara Littlefield, executive director for programs and partnerships at the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation. \"For instance, studying whether some microorganisms in mosquitoes can help limit the spread of malaria among birds in Hawaii could ultimately limit disease spread among other animals more broadly.\"</p><p>Each project extends basic science into on-the-ground conservation to address critical knowledge and data gaps, enabling greater real-world impact to benefit species and ecosystems.</p><p>\"The unique partnerships this program creates forge a roadmap to broader conservation action by uniting the skills, expertise and tools needed to address the most urgent threats to our natural world,\" said Susan Marqusee, NSF Assistant Director for Biological Sciences. \"These projects also will engage the public, policymakers, law enforcement and others in conservation through education, outreach and other broader impacts.\"</p><p>The awarded project focus areas include:</p><p>* Improving mosquito breeding to create non-viable offspring and thus reduce transmission of avian malaria to Hawaiian honeycreepers</p><p>* Improving forest fire management through study of Venus Flytrap as indicator species</p><p>* Creating a model to monitor long-term impacts of conservation actions on the genetic diversity of grizzly bear populations</p><p>* Disrupting illegal wildlife trade by enabling molecular identification of sharks, rays and turtles</p><p>* Modeling ghost genes (genetic material historically transferred from extinct or nearly extinct species to living ones) of Gulf Coast canids</p><p>* Restoring habitat of grassland birds through development of Integrated Population Model using data from breeding and non-breeding grounds of three declining species</p><p>* Converting urban turf lawns to native plants to bolster ecosystem services and understand conservation potential</p><p>* Conserving stream biodiversity by studying the impact of climate and land use changes on the imperiled eastern hellbender, an Appalachian salamander species sensitive to low dissolved oxygen levels</p><p>* Developing AI for cost-effective wildlife identification, tracking and behavior analysis for marine animals through study on manatees</p><p>* Using big data about the ecology of the Appalachian Mountains to co-develop migratory bird conservation efforts with landowners and land managers to balance habitat needs with community objectives</p><p>* * *</p><p>UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND CENTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE</p><p>The University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science leads the way toward better management of Maryland's natural resources and the protection and restoration of the Chesapeake Bay.

You are looking live right now at just one of five fires that are burning through Los Angeles County.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[00:00:48]</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And the newest one, the Kenneth Fire, could grow very quickly. This as the winds are set to pick up overnight into tomorrow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Palisades, the Eaton Fires, they have been the most destructive, and neither of them are contained at all.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This drone video from the Pacific Palisades shows just how widespread the devastation is. Countless homes are gone. Overall, 10,000 structures destroyed across the entire L.A. County region.</p><p>At least two people have been killed in the Palisades Fire alone, while five are dead from the Eaton Fire. Authorities say the actual death toll could be much higher.</p><p>CNN's Bill Weir is in Big Rock, a neighborhood just East of Malibu.</p><p>Bill, an L.A. Fire Department official said last hour that there are reports of another fire breaking out in the valley. What have you seen from your vantage point?</p><p>BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's interesting, Laura. We spent a lot of time here on Pacific Coast Highway, watching a crew from Kern County. That's a different part of the state.</p><p>They were just spending a long time dousing the hotspots of these, what were oceanfront properties. Big mansions here on the coast. They're still smoldering.</p><p>Now, whether the fear is that these would kick up overnight and blow embers and cause more havoc, we can't be sure how those were deployed.</p><p>But what we're seeing now is a pitch-black Pacific Coast Highway. The power is out. So, other than the occasional first responders, a truck that goes by with their flashers on, it's -- it's a dark and dreary place tonight, especially when light of day brings so much devastation. This five-mile stretch, I would guess 75 percent of the homes along this coastline, this iconic stretch of real estate, are turned to ash. And so many questions about what comes next for those folks, as well.</p><p>But as you've been talking about, there's still active -- as you can see, all this flashing lights going by. There are still active flames in the Palisades Fire and still active worries about what the winds will do overnight.</p><p>COATES: You know, in the midst of so much loss, there must be extraordinary desperation. Bill, I wonder what have those who've been most affected, what are they telling you about the state's response?</p><p>WEIR: It's interesting. I was up in Topanga Canyon, where there is a tight village of folks who love this part of the world. They love canyon life. They love the ocean. These are water people as well, but a pretty tight community.</p><p>I've found, in these disasters that test the fabric of community, those that trust each other fare the best. And they have these plans on, you know, how to protect them -- themselves.</p><p>But I was talking to a guy named Tyler Stock (ph) who said, the last thing we want to do is blame the firefighters. These people are heroes.</p><p>They just had another major fire a month ago in this part of Malibu that they had to deal with. And he refused to -- to get political. He said, we've got to save that. Right now, let's rally around each other. I heard that from a couple different residents in that particular neighborhood.</p><p>It's counter to what the folks in the Palisades have been saying and the frustration there. You can understand that they, when they see that no fire crews showed up while those winds were howling, and couldn't have something been done? Those are very valid questions.</p><p>So, really, you get a difference in response as where you are right now, Laura. But I've seen, again, from Lahaina to Paradise to all of these disasters, people cycle sort of through the five stages of grief.</p><p>Because what you know, your community is gone. And so, the five stages. Initially, it's denial. Like, I can't believe this is happening. And then there's anger and bargaining and depression, before you get to acceptance, which may not be surrender, but accepting that this is the hand that you've been dealt. The sooner you get there, the sooner you can rally and rebuild and recover.</p><p>So, it's understandable that there's all this sort of pent-up emotion right now. That is so natural, given the stakes, given the fear, given the loss. People have to process this in their own way.</p><p>[00:05:06]</p><p>COATES: I mean, Bill, just watching these vehicles flying by, trying to get to the next blaze, just tells you how this is still ongoing. The urgency, the devastation.</p><p>Bill Weir, thank you so much for being there.</p><p>WEIR: You bet.</p><p>COATES: I want to bring in the captain of the Los Angeles County Fire Department, Sheila Kelliher. It's good to see you again, Captain. I know that you have been informing the public about all that's happening, and we appreciate that so much.</p><p>And we're learning that, I mean, really, these -- these fires are nowhere near contained. What is your top concern at this very hour?</p><p>CAPT. SHEILA KELLIHER, LOS ANGELES COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT: Yes. Thank you for having me again, Laura.</p><p>And yes, I think our top concern is going into the next two days, we have more high-wind warnings coming. Our red flag conditions kick in through tomorrow, and maybe a little bit beyond.</p><p>So, it's that constant battle of the winds flaring up that make this incredibly challenging, especially in the Palisades and the Eaton Canyon Fire.</p><p>COATES: You know, the National Weather Service is warning that the winds, the dry conditions could complicate further the efforts into even next week.</p><p>I mean, fighting against these wildfires has been your mission for, what, 25 years? Do you think it's possible to have a more effective firefighting system when these winds continue to happen and they're still on the horizon?</p><p>KELLIHER: I think because -- that's a -- that's a challenging question, because when Mother Nature kicks up, and you have 70-mile- an-hour to 100-mile-an-hour gusts, remember that's hurricane-strength- force winds. It just so happens instead of water pushing alongside it, we have fire pushing alongside it.</p><p>So, there is, you know, only so much we can do when it comes to that combination. And then when you put the topography in that we have, with those steep hillsides and the densely populated areas, it makes for a very hard combination to fight fire.</p><p>COATES: Unbelievable. I mean, those hurricane winds bringing fire with them, it's unbelievable.</p><p>And understandably, residents are very anxious to know about the condition of their home. I can't imagine the anxiety that they're feeling. Some are trying to go back to survey their neighborhoods to see if they can salvage anything, to find loved ones.</p><p>Pasadena's mayor is asking people to stay out of those areas until all these evacuation orders have been lifted. Do you have a message to residents tonight about the safety, or lack thereof, of going back? KELLIHER: Yes. I think it's critical that they heed the warnings of their officials. There's a reason why those evacuation orders have not been lifted.</p><p>There are all kinds of incredibly dangerous situations that reside out there, whether it's gas leaks, whether it's downed power lines, whether it's still smoldering embers that are still being cast and causing spot fires down the road.</p><p>So, we could have an incident with an incident and it flare back up, and then someone's picking through the rubble. I understand why they would want to, but it puts them in harm's way.</p><p>So really pay attention to what your local officials are saying. We don't want any more life tragedy. That's our No. 1 priority when we fight fire, is life safety.</p><p>So, remember that nobody else is -- you know, we're not -- we're not doing anything with anybody's stuff. It's just like, wait until it's truly safe where you can come back in and do it so safely and you're protected.</p><p>COATES: Captain, how do you coordinate with all the different entities that are coming in, whether it's out of state, upstate? You've got, I know, there are inmates who are also -- who have volunteered to be helpful, as well, in the process of it. How do you coordinate all of this, knowing the scope of the problem?</p><p>KELLIHER: It's incredible, the mutual aid system we have all through the state and CAL FIRE and all the assisting agencies.</p><p>They have put together this incredible matrix where the call goes out, and everybody really answers the call and comes together, especially the Western states in that region.</p><p>We have an incredible resource of how that is -- amazing how it all comes together.</p><p>COATES: Captain Sheila Kelliher, please stay safe and thank you for all you're doing.</p><p>KELLIHER: I appreciate you. Thank you.</p><p>COATES: Countless people -- I mean, countless people in the L.A. area -- are forced to say goodbye to their homes, not knowing if they can ever return to them or what they will find when they do. Like my next guest, who captured a heartbreaking farewell to his house of more than 40 years before escaping to safety.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, I'm going to have to --we're going to have to evacuate our house. OK, everyone.</p><p>I see this beautiful area go up in flames. Unbelievable. All right. God bless you all. Be cool. (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COATES: Actor and author Eric Braeden joins me now.</p><p>I've watched you my whole life. And to hear your voice narrating that moment is truly devastating for so many people. Can you -- can you take us back to that moment when you saw that blaze approach your home and realized you had to leave?</p><p>[00:10:13]</p><p>ERIC BRAEDEN, ACTOR AND AUTHOR: First of all, Laura, I would be remiss if I didn't tell you that I watch you lot. OK? And I watch CNN a lot. Let's get that out of the way.</p><p>COATES: Thank you. Well, thank you so much.</p><p>BRAEDEN: What did I feel when I saw those flames? Well, it scares the living -- living daylights out of you. And you hope that the flames don't cross.</p><p>There's a canyon below me. And about many years ago, they had a big fire in that area. And it actually destroyed Will Rogers Park. It's a state park. But it never came across the canyon to our side.</p><p>And a few nights ago, we were told by some emergency person not to worry, that the wind was drifting out towards the ocean. And however, they were wrong. I don't blame them. You can't predict the wind patterns really. And it came back.</p><p>And I began to see some flames licking at Will Rogers Park. I thought, boy, that could really get bad. And it got bad. And you saw that clip now. And we decided it was time to go.</p><p>Others on the street had already evacuated, and I thought perhaps one could wait it out. But you can't.</p><p>So, you grab, in that last minute, anything you can: passports, et cetera. But never enough.</p><p>And so, then you wait anxiously to actually see the result of the fire. Has it destroyed your home? Has it not? And the neighbors on my street, the Bernsteins, and the Newmans, and the Grays and all those people, and Dave Lawrence (ph), we communicated with each other. It's a small cul de sac.</p><p>And they had left, and no one really had a video of what had happened. And bits and pieces. And today I found out.</p><p>COATES: Do you know what happened to your home?</p><p>BRAEDEN: Joshua Morrow, who plays my son on \"The Young and the Restless,\" actually broke through some barriers, went there and sent me the -- yes. Tough to see. Lived there for 45 years, and to see your home.</p><p>And do you think you're tough? And then you see that, and -- yes. Haven't shown my wife yet.</p><p>COATES: Aww.</p><p>BRAEDEN: Don't know whether I'm going to or not. It's tough.</p><p>COATES: Do you think it would be too much to think about the memories, to show her?</p><p>BRAEDEN: Yes. A house can be rebuilt, but everything that you have gathered over the years, you know, a lifetime, actually, in America. I've come here in 1960 and lived in that whole area of L.A. for the last 60 years, nearly, and have seen all kinds of wildfires, all kinds of disasters and slides.</p><p>It's the price we pay for living in this beautiful area. California is a fantastic state. It's one of the most productive states in the nation, not according to the orange idiot who will take over on 25th of January or whatever. But it is truly one of the most productive states ever in the United States, produces more agricultural products than any other state in America. OK?</p><p>So, all this nonsense you hear about liberal California, there are just as many conservatives here as anywhere else. OK, that is all mis- and disinformation. Anyway, let's -- let's not get on that -- on that bandwagon.</p><p>COATES: But I understand the frustration of -- of how the state is being described in the wake of -- and the ongoing devastation that's happening right now.</p><p>I mean, you -- you've been in that area for so long, but you grew up in war-torn Germany. And I -- I wonder if you ever imagined that you would live through this extraordinary loss that you've experienced in California.</p><p>BRAEDEN: No. But to be frank with you, the difference simply is -- what simply -- the difference is I was born in 1941, at the beginning of the Second World War, more or less, the beginning of the bombing. And I was born in Kiel on the Baltic Sea, and it was a huge area for building warships, et cetera. So, it was a target by the allies, by the Brits, in my case.</p><p>And they bombed the smithereens out of my town. Five hundred thousand bombs over Kiel alone. And the town was 96 percent destroyed.</p><p>[00:15:06]</p><p>So, for the first years, four years of my life, I experienced sirens and then bombs, anti-aircraft. So, we were taken down to the basement of the house every -- every night, every day. And so, I'm kind of used to it. It brings back some memories. Obviously, not pleasant ones.</p><p>But this is nature. This is not manmade. The Second World War was caused by an Austrian private who had delusions of grandeur. And this is nature talking to us. And I certainly am not blaming anyone, most certainly not the fire department. They're wonderful people and always have been; have had nothing but great experiences with them. They are simply outmanned right now. It's extraordinary. It's a devastation unlike any I've ever seen here. It's biblical.</p><p>COATES: When you look at -- when you look at -- and I know you say, certainly, politics can always wait, especially in devastation of here. I wonder what you make of the path forward and the response from government; what it ought to be, in the conversations you're having with your neighbors, with your community.</p><p>BRAEDEN: To be very frank with you, I think everyone is really trying to do their damn best. OK? And some idiot, the orange idiot, went on television, some -- your fellow network, and claimed all kinds of things about Newsom, and California, and the water distribution. All nonsense, disinformation, period.</p><p>There's a guy on your show that does fact checking. I like him a lot.</p><p>COATES: Daniel.</p><p>BRAEDEN: It's a breath of fresh air. Say hello to him. He's very, very good.</p><p>And what some of these characters are now disseminating on one particular network, and on some podcasts, is outrageous and very damaging to our nation.</p><p>This is a great nation. Trust me. I know whereof I speak. I come from a nation that believed in fascist ideology for a while, OK? And we certainly will not want to go into that again. But we are close to it, because people want to simplify complex problems.</p><p>The essence of fascism is to simplify complex problems and feed people who don't have time to read some bullshit. OK? Wrap.</p><p>COATES: Eric Braeden, I'm so glad that I got a chance to speak with you. I'm sorry it's under these circumstances. I truly am. And I'm just praying for your community.</p><p>It's hard for me to call you \"Eric.\" I would love to call you \"Victor Newman,\" but I know --</p><p>BRAEDEN: Please do.</p><p>COATES: -- you have a real -- you have a real name, sir.</p><p>BRAEDEN: I love that. I love that role. That's been very good for me for the last, what, 45 years now. And I'm very grateful to it. I'm one of the few actors who's still working with wonderful colleagues and a great network.</p><p>And here we go, hopefully, for another ten years at least.</p><p>COATES: At least. BRAEDEN: But I watch your program. I watch your program. I want you to know that, OK?</p><p>COATES: I very much appreciate it. I -- the cameras are catching me blush, so I better go right now. Thank you so much.</p><p>BRAEDEN: And -- and Stephen A. Smith says hello.</p><p>COATES: Well, hello. Tell him hello. And thank you so much for joining.</p><p>BRAEDEN: Yes.</p><p>COATES: And I'm really glad that you were here, but I'm so sorry for the loss. And we are going to continue to follow to make sure that so many communities --</p><p>BRAEDEN: We will survive this.</p><p>COATES: Yes.</p><p>BRAEDEN: We shall survive this.</p><p>COATES: Indeed.</p><p>BRAEDEN: I'm going to rebuild.</p><p>COATES: I hope, soon. Thank you so much.</p><p>BRAEDEN: Yes. Thank you.</p><p>COATES: Up next, speaking of California Governor Gavin Newsom, he's under a lot of pressure as residents and the president-elect are blasting him and Democrats over the wildfires.</p><p>Fellow Governor Jared Polis is standing by to respond, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[00:23:22]</p><p>COATES: Governor Gavin Newsom facing a major leadership test as frustration over the response to the fires begins to boil over. Newsom was confronted by a woman in Pacific Palisades earlier today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Please tell me what you're going to do. I'm not going to hurt him, I promise.</p><p>GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA): I'm literally talking to the president right now to specifically answer the question of what we can do for you and your daughter.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Can I hear it? Can I hear your call? Because I don't believe it. Why was there no water in the hydrants, Governor? NEWSOM: It's all literally --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is it going to be different next time?</p><p>NEWSOM: It has to be.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COATES: That woman's frustration was palpable and has been fueled nationally by President-elect Donald Trump, as well, who has been relentless in blaming the governor, accusing him of mismanagement.</p><p>Trump today labeling Newsom as an incompetent governor and even called for his resignation.</p><p>Joining me now, a fellow governor who has dealt with his fair share of wildfires, Colorado Democrat, Governor Jared Polis.</p><p>Governor, thank you so much. As I've just stated, you have dealt with some very tough fires in your own state. The Marshall Fire in 2021 is an example: 100-mile-per-hour winds. We're seeing something similar in California. One thousand homes in your area destroyed.</p><p>What is your assessment of how Governor Gavin Newsom is handling this moment?</p><p>GOV. JARED POLIS (D-CO): Well, look, Colorado and many other states are sending help. We sent a multi-mission aircraft, five fire engines and crews.</p><p>This is not the time for politics. It's not the time for blame. In the middle of a crisis, we all work together. That's what this country is all about.</p><p>I'm glad Gavin Newsom is on the scene. I'm glad he's in touch with President Biden. I'm sure the federal forces, as well as, again, many states sending help.</p><p>[00:25:08]</p><p>There'll be plenty of time to talk about what we can do better next time after. But when you have active fires going and evacuations, everybody should be working together.</p><p>COATES: They are certainly in the thick of it. But you heard that woman confronting the governor: impassioned, frustrated, desperate, as well. What can be the response?</p><p>POLIS: Look, when -- when people lose everything they have, or they've evacuated and they don't know if they have a home left, emotions are going to be raw.</p><p>And all you can do as a leader, as a governor, as well as working to address the crisis, is just to -- to be somebody there to listen. And after our fire, Marshall Fire, 1000 homes lost, President Biden came out a few days later. He met with families that lost their homes around tables in a -- in a big, empty gym. Just hearing their stories and showing that while, look, nobody can bring back your home, but we can do whatever we can to help you rebuild your life. And we're here to understand that you're going through a very tough time.</p><p>COATES: They will want tangible results, as you can imagine, in California and beyond.</p><p>And speaking of days, we're days away from when President-elect Trump will become President Trump once again. He'll have to work with the likes of Governor Newsom to help California, to help the rebuilding process.</p><p>Do you have any concerns about his ability to do that, given the way many believe he's been piling onto this moment and adding politics to really fuel this proverbial fire?</p><p>POLIS: Well, I found that the FEMA, the federal emergency workers, to be very professional. They should not be political. They do their work.</p><p>The main job of the president is say, get to work and send them. I sure hope that President Trump continues that tradition that all presidents have done before. When we need help, that's what the federal government is there for, and it shouldn't be politicized at all.</p><p>They're there to help people with shelter, to get on their lives, to access their insurance, and programs. We set up emergency shops for -- one-stop shops where people could get what they needed that were open for weeks. And I'm sure they'll do the same in -- in California.</p><p>And that partnership and trust with the federal government is very important in dealing with disasters and the aftermath, and I hope it's something we can maintain in the Trump administration.</p><p>COATES: You mentioned that you have given some assistance to California, as well. Can you tell me the scope and the kind of assistance you've given? And has it been at the request of Governor Gavin Newsom or independently proactive by you?</p><p>POLIS: And I texted him earlier today. We have a pool through emergency management where California needs resources. We sent one multi-mission fixed-wing aircraft, five fire engines and crews.</p><p>I fully expect that us and many other states will be involved with the aftermath and some of the cleanup.</p><p>The states work very well together, along with our federal partners. There's no room for politics in this. We sent people to help with Florida during the hurricane. Again, this is how we work together as a nation.</p><p>And it's not about being Republicans or Democrats. A fire burns down your home, no matter what your politics are, no matter what your ideology are. And that's exactly what we're here to help with, however we can. COATES: And of course, you are offering this aid in addition to your work as the governor of your own state. You delivered your State of the State address today.</p><p>You mentioned an issue that is very top of mind politically and across a variety of states 00 frankly, all of the states -- immigration. I want to play a little bit of that for the audience.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>POLIS: And I truly hope that President-elect Trump and Congress can work together quickly to secure the border, stop human trafficking, and stop the illegal flow of guns and drugs.</p><p>As a state, we welcome more federal help to detain and deport dangerous criminals.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COATES: So, on the one hand, of course, deporting dangerous criminals, certainly, is one aspect of this. But then there's the concern that many share, Governor, that these deportations could also target, specifically, undocumented migrants who have not been violent or broken the law in == in a way similar to the dangerous criminals.</p><p>How will you make sure that federal agents that you cooperate with are prioritizing the distinction?</p><p>POLIS: Well, and moments later in the speech, I called for Congress, in addition to securing the border, to create a pathway for people who are here contributing to our society.</p><p>That's exactly what we need to do. We need to make sure we can fix our broken immigration system. Of course, help in apprehending criminals always appreciated to make our communities safer.</p><p>At the same time, hardworking people in our communities that have been here for years or decades need to have a way that they can come out of the shadows, get their paperwork right, and continue to contribute to our country.</p><p>In states like Colorado, it's important for our hospitality and tourism sector, our agriculture sector, our construction sector.</p><p>If the Trump administration moves ahead with mass deportations of people who have not committed any crimes, it would increase grocery prices, increase housing prices, and force much of our tourism economy to close.</p><p>[00:30:08]</p><p>COATES: Governor Polis, we're 11 days away from a new administration. We'll see how they implement what they've stated on the campaign trail.</p><p>Governor Polis, thank you so much. POLIS: Thank you.</p><p>COATES: Communities decimated by the fires. CNN's Natasha Chen has been out among the wreckage today, and she joins us with a live report, as the winds pick up tonight, making the fight against the fires even harder. That's all next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>COATES: We're now following the ongoing fury and destruction of the wildfires that are ravaging the Los Angeles area.</p><p>[00:35:02]</p><p>Let's go straight to CNN's Natasha Chen, who's in Altadena.</p><p>Natasha, I understand you have a devastating update for us.</p><p>NATASHA CHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Laura, we're learning from the L.A. County medical examiner that there are at least ten fire-related deaths they're reporting tonight.</p><p>Now, that number may climb as we see more people, more authorities being able to comb through the wreckage of these multiple fires.</p><p>And they did not give names for these ten people just yet. Of course, they're wanting to notify next of kin.</p><p>We know at least five people have died from the Eaton Fire in Altadena here, where we're standing.</p><p>You know, yesterday when we spoke with you, this area was on fire. One side of the street, then another side of the street. That went on for hours and hours.</p><p>Tonight, that fire has moved on beyond the hills. We can see some glow beyond the ridge there. But the neighborhoods are completely burned out.</p><p>And it's just really devastating to hear families' stories of finding out that their loved ones did not make it, including one woman who told \"The Washington Post\" that her father was trying to evacuate. He was an amputee who used a wheelchair. And she said he was found next to the bed of his son, who had cerebral palsy, and she said that he would have never left his side -- Laura.</p><p>COATES: Unbelievable. Just breaks your heart to think about what happens when the smoke clears, and the choices people have made. And what is left behind is unimaginable.</p><p>And earlier today, you visited an evacuation center in Pasadena. What did you hear there?</p><p>CHEN: Yes. So that Pasadena shelter mainly took in a lot of people who had evacuated from this fire, from the Eaton Fire. They have about 1,200 people staying there tonight, plus hundreds more who had come during the day just to find resources, to get a toothbrush, to get some clothes.</p><p>And that's where we met a couple of people who told us that they lost their homes, including one woman who said that she actually stayed to try and protect her house, because she said it was 100 years old. She was trying to fight the fire for hours until the firefighters had to remove her from the premises.</p><p>Here's what she said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAYA REYNAGA, EVACUATED FROM FIRE: I can't even teach, and I'm a first responder. I teach people to save lives, and I couldn't even save my house. And I'm just shattered.</p><p>VERONICA OSBORN, EVACUATED FROM FIRE: Apparently, I have a decent policy, so maybe I'm going to be OK. So, I'll rebuild. But I'm thinking, am I going to be anxious every time the wind blows, even after I rebuild? And you know, am I going to sit here and go, Oh, is it going to burn down my house again? And I have to start over?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHEN: That last woman that I spoke to, that -- that comment really hit me because that is the question. If you do rebuild, if you decide that this is the place you really want to continue to live, you know, how are you going to react the next time there are high-wind warnings and fire dangers?</p><p>That woman also lived in a house that was nearly 100 years old, and she said she was going to throw a party there when it hit the 100 years. And that house did not make it for that date -- Laura.</p><p>COATES: I mean, this is trauma. I mean, we're seeing trauma in action. The questions being asked and where things will go.</p><p>Natasha Chen, thank you so much.</p><p>Experts are warning with the flames comes another hazard: talking about air quality.</p><p>The fire is releasing towering plumes of smoke and soot, leading dark clouds of unhealthy pollution to spread throughout the region.</p><p>And these fires have more dangers when it comes to air quality than the typical wildfires. Dr. Sanjay Gupta is here to explain -- Sanjay.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Just about anything you might imagine is going to be inside that smoke.</p><p>But it is important to draw a little bit of a distinction between standard forest fire and what they call the wildland urban interface. GUPTA (voice-over): Think about that urban setting that you're looking at there. You're burning everything: plastics and metals. You're unearthing certain metals that are even in the soil. Cars and electronics and carpets and drapes.</p><p>All of that gets into the atmosphere. These volatile organic compounds: benzene and formaldehyde and toluene. All these types of things are in the air and people are breathing them in.</p><p>GUPTA: Now, initially, you may not have sort of classic symptoms of smoke inhalation injury.</p><p>GUPTA (voice-over): It may be more sort of burning eyes and scratchy throat. Even vaguer symptoms like headaches, for example.</p><p>But eventually, people may develop breathing difficulties and even chest pain. That's because of the toxicity of the smoke.</p><p>GUPTA: But it's also really small particle sizes, as well, something known as particulate matter 2.5. And what that means is, basically. particles as small as 1/20 the width of a human hair. You breathe that in, that goes into your bronchioles, it goes into your lungs, it gets into your bloodstream and can eventually affect just about every organ in the body.</p><p>[00:40:10]</p><p>So, that's -- that's why there's so much concern there. That can cause sort of this systemic inflammation.</p><p>GUPTA (voice-over): There are things you should do to protect yourself. And keep in mind that this -- these toxins in the smoke can travel. They can get miles into the air, and they can travel miles with all the wind.</p><p>So, even if you're not directly in the path of the smoke or the fires, you need to be careful here. Stay inside as much as possible.</p><p>If you do need to go outside, think about wearing an N-95 mask, a high-quality mask.</p><p>Inside, portable indoor air cleaners. That can be really helpful to keep that indoor environment as clean as possible. Now is a good time to look at the filters on your HVAC system, make sure they're up to date.</p><p>And also, if you're driving around, turn on the recirculation button on your car. You want to keep the air circulating inside without bringing outside air in.</p><p>GUPTA: It's a dangerous situation. Obviously, there's a lot of toxins in the air, but there are also ways to try and protect yourself.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COATES: Dr. Sanjay Gupta, that was so helpful. Thank you so much. You know, some 10,000 structures have been destroyed in the fires across L.A. And all of those structures mean something to someone.</p><p>Next, a family who lost their home in the Eaton Fire joins me to tell their story.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[00:45;49]</p><p>COATES: Welcome back to our live breaking coverage of the wildfires raging in Los Angeles. The stories of loss, they just keep pouring in.</p><p>Take a look at this. This was the Storc family home before the Eaton Fire. Friends described it as a place of warmth and creativity and community. Family would often host for holidays and other celebrations.</p><p>But now, the home has been burnt to the ground. There is nothing left except for a few burnt-through walls that are just barely standing.</p><p>Michael and Ruth Storc join me now.</p><p>I'm just so sorry to see, especially that before and after, and just get a sense of the community and home that that memory -- that those memories must provide. I'm so sorry you're dealing with this.</p><p>And, Michael, I'll begin with you. Can you tell us how long you had to even evacuate? And were you able to rescue anything before you left?</p><p>MICHAEL STORC, LOST HOME IN FIRE: We -- we didn't think it was going to be this. We -- we were at dinner. The fire started.</p><p>We ran home with the kids and said, you know, grab a few things. We're going to get the pets, and we're going to just spend the night somewhere else. And we'll come back in the morning and, you know, it'll be fine. And --</p><p>RUTH STORC, LOST HOME IN FIRE: We hadn't even been evacuated, truly. We just were -- in an abundance of caution, leaving.</p><p>COATES: Wow.</p><p>M. STORC: Yes. And so, we -- we grabbed a couple things, but not nearly -- not nearly enough. Like, not nearly enough.</p><p>R. STORC: We grabbed just some documents and clothes for the next day. So, everything else -- everything else is gone.</p><p>COATES: And -- and now, we see what has happened. And I know that you both are, I've heard, eternally optimistic people and grateful for your health and the safety of your loved ones. But, Ruth, can you -- can you describe what you feel like you've lost?</p><p>R. STORC: It's really hard to quantify, because my kids lost their home. We lost our home. But besides that, we lost our town, all the people we know from that town, and we lost our sense of security. We have no idea what's going to happen next.</p><p>But we lost Altadena. And Altadena -- I don't know -- when people hear fires in California, you know, or in Los Angeles, they think of Hollywood or glamor. Altadena was a really unique and special place.</p><p>It was a place where there were people who came to homestead and people who came to ride horses, creative people of all kinds, every very diverse community and all sorts of economic levels. It was really a one-of-a-kind place.</p><p>And once we moved there, we knew that was the only place in Los Angeles we would live. It's not just a neighborhood. It's a very specific kind of place.</p><p>COATES: I mean, just thinking about that loss, to those who didn't know the community, to hear you describe it, Ruth, is just heartbreaking.</p><p>And of course, I'm sure, as anyone would, you think about what's next and -- and what you can try to salvage. Michael, do you know if insurance is going to help in any way or -- or cover any of your at least tangible losses?</p><p>M. STORC: Yes, some of it, but it's so hard to know what to do with that. You know, if -- we don't know if everybody's going to come back. We don't know. I mean, the whole place is gone, like, so much of it is just gone.</p><p>[00:50:00]</p><p>And it's -- is it -- is it going to happen again? Is, you know, L.A. is dry. And there's not a lot of water. And the -- the weather's just become more and more volatile. Like it's just -- in my lifetime, has become more and more volatile.</p><p>I'm from there. I'm from L.A. It's different now, you know. It's -- it's -- the winds were really violent. It was just fast and cataclysmic.</p><p>COATES: Michael --</p><p>M. STORC: So, I don't think, you know.</p><p>COATES: I hear the pain.</p><p>M. STORC: I don't know at this time. I don't know.</p><p>COATES: I really do hear it in your voice. Michael and -- and Ruth, I can't imagine. I mean, just mother to mother, parent to parent. What you tell your kids and - and just hold each other a little bit tighter and -- and move forward as a family.</p><p>But I can't imagine what it's like to have those little eyes looking up at me in that moment.</p><p>R. STORC: They've been amazing, actually. COATES: Yes.</p><p>R. STORC: Yes. Thank you.</p><p>COATES: Thank you both. Michael and Ruth Storc, we're thinking about you both.</p><p>Up next, a photographer who's on the front lines of fire lines, who's capturing the bravery of firefighters who are battling the inferno.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[00:56:01]</p><p>COATES: News of the wildfires have been nothing short of devastating to see, but sometimes It's the still pictures that tell the story.</p><p>My next guest is a photographer who has been covering the fires, capturing unbelievable scenes of heroism. Firefighters just feet from the flames, risking their lives to protect these communities. My guest himself getting up close to the -- to get these images of completely out-of-control fires.</p><p>And then there are, of course, the horrible images of destruction stretching as far as the eye can see.</p><p>I want to bring in photographer David Swanson.</p><p>David, what has it been like capturing these images? Being up close to the story? What are the things you've seen, the smells, the sounds you've heard?</p><p>DAVID SWANSON, PHOTOGRAPHER: You mentioned sounds. Well, first of all, thanks for having me on.</p><p>What's stood out to me is how quiet it's been. You know, you have the smells, but there's a distinct lack of noise. There are no fire engine sirens, no police cars wailing. It's just people milling about, people -- amazed at the devastation.</p><p>It's -- and forgive me, I'm slightly exhausted, but it is the worst I've ever seen.</p><p>COATES: That's really saying something, that you've been all over the world. You've reported on disasters. You've covered war zones, 9/11, Katrina, earthquakes. And I wonder how these fires have compared to -- to that.</p><p>SWANSON: Well, in all of these situations, you see good people doing good things in the aftermath.</p><p>I saw a lot of rescues. I saw a lot of bravery from the first responders. My colleagues and I would stick together. We'd pair off in twos, and we would just look at each other and be astounded.</p><p>I'm just shaking my head at what we saw. Just to the horizon. Neighborhoods gone.</p><p>COATES: I mean, we know the -- the importance of bearing witness and -- and recording what has been seen, and the pure observation that you have. It must take an emotional toll to see this and capture it.</p><p>SWANSON: Well, I'm running on fumes right now, and this is -- fumes and adrenaline. And it won't hit me for a while. It won't hit me.</p><p>And I have a good support system from my wife and from my daughter and family and friends. But it never -- it never happens the day of or the or the week of.</p><p>But later on, later on, it's going to sink in. I just still can't seem to put a grasp on the size of this: 10,000 homes now.</p><p>COATES: And you live in Los Angeles. And is -- is your home safe? And what's it like to cover it in your own hometown?</p><p>SWANSON: Well, that's what -- that's what's getting to me is going out into the canyons and on the mountains and coming home to our neighborhood and looking at the trees and looking at the palm trees. And I've just seen it in other places burned.</p><p>And how -- how it could just as easily be in our neighborhood. And I'm selfishly concerned about the wind and the weather and the lack of water and the lack of resources.</p><p>COATES: Yes.</p><p>SWANSON: So, you know, it's -- it's a genuine concern.</p><p>COATES: Dave, just thinking about what you've seen and what you have allowed the world to see through these images. I mean, just the -- this moment in time. This is just since Tuesday, practically. And here we are with the scope, as you've described.</p><p>Is there one image that is haunting you?</p><p>SWANSON: It's not haunting me. But I couldn't believe that gentleman came out of his burning house or his cousin's burning house.
