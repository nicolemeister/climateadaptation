That's the purpose of the news media, after all. Keep the balloons and streamers under wraps, though, because Pew found the news elicits far more negative emotions than positive across all news consumers: </p><p>-- 42% said the news makes them feel angry \"extremely often\" or \"often\"</p><p>-- 38% said it made them feel sad </p><p>-- 27% said scared</p><p>-- 25% said confused</p><p>Positive emotions brought up the rear, with 10% saying the news made them feel hopeful and 7% saying it made them feel happy or empowered. </p><p>The largest number in the survey (across all news consumers) was the 63% of respondents who said consuming news rarely or never made them feel \"empowered.\" </p><p>\"Confused\" was an interesting category. Just 19% of people who said they consume news all or most of the time reported that emotion. The number crept up to 27% for those who said they followed current events \"some of the time.\" And then to 30% for less often than that. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Not Contradictory</emphasis></p><p>\"Informed\" and \"angry\" are not opposites. It's perfectly possible to be \"informed\" and feel any one of the negative emotions listed above (other than \"confused,\" I suppose). You could be \"informed\" about the biggest measles outbreak in America in more than three decades without also being \"happy\" about it. </p><p>I used to have a neighbor who wore a \"if you're not outraged, you're not paying attention\" shirt when he walked his dog. (The dog, as the internet says, had done nothing wrong.) </p><p>Where there is something of a contradiction is between these Pew numbers for \"informed\" and Gallup's findings that just 31% of Americans trust us a great deal or a fair amount to report fully, accurately and fairly. </p><p>But as I pointed out in February, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/u-s-news-decision-points/articles/2025-02-11/actually-america-you-do-trust-the-mainstream-media\">everyone actually trusts the mainstream media</url>. I won't reproduce that whole column here, but my argument is that Americans -- including this White House and Republicans in Congress -- will happily cite mainstream news coverage that they feel reinforces their prior beliefs or serves their ideological purposes. </p><p>[<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DECISION POINTS:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/u-s-news-decision-points/articles/2025-10-14/farmers-call-for-federal-lifeline-amid-four-alarm-fire\">'Four-Alarm Fire': Farmers Plead for Aid</url>]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Negative Nellies?</emphasis></p><p>There are some structural reasons I could point to for why so many people told Pew the news makes them angry or sad. </p><p>One of the first aphorisms I learned when I became a reporter was the tabloid credo, \"If it bleeds, it leads.\" That may be a sound way to rope in readers, but it's not very ... happy-making? </p><p>Politicians in power are forever carping that we (the national media) only report bad news or conflict. There's an element of fairness to that critique -- we report on the forest fire, not the forest fires that didn't happen. </p><p>But what about medical breakthroughs?

Lakshmikanth Reddy who extolled the contributions of the Forest Department personnel in conservation of forests and wildlife.<br/><br/>Deputy Conservator of Forests (DCF) Paramesh read out the names of 62 personnel who have died in Karnataka since the last 58 years and recalled the challenges and trying conditions under which the forest personnel function. <br/><br/>The forest personnel were urged to draw inspiration from their sacrifices and remain steadfast and committed in conservation efforts. The authorities recalled the sacrifices of a few including DCF P. Srinivas who was beheaded by forest brigand Veerappan in the 1990s, and DCF Manikandan who was trampled by a wild elephant while inspecting damage caused by forest fire in Nagarahole, on March 3rd, 2018.<br/><br/>Three rounds were fired in air as a mark of respect for the forest martyrs and silence observed to commemorate their memory. <br/><br/>The Government of India, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, in 2013, declared September 11 as National Forest Martyrs Day the objective of which is to pay homage to those who laid down their lives while protecting forests and wildlife, and to commemorate their sacrifices across the country.<br/><br/>The date - September 11\u2013 is also significant as it was on this day in 1730 that soldiers of maharaja Abhay Singh of Jodhpur massacred 363 men, women, and children of the Bishnoi community when they protested the felling of Kejri trees and tried to save them in the Kejarali province. Hence, the Indian government zeroed in on this date to pay homage to forest martyrs.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THINDU-A15839242</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THINDU2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GPV-R3V3-RSM5-T4MG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">423535</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"319\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Hindu All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Hindu</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"44778\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 11, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00097C9</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS &amp;

The fire was concentrated in the living room on the second floor of the house located on block 11 of Jr. Ancash in the district of Chilca. The flames devoured everything in their path, while two families cried. A short circuit would be the cause of the fire.</p><p><br/>A little after 8 o'clock in the morning the fire started. The three-story house was consumed, generating panic among the neighbors of the district of Chilca According to the brigadier Alberto Ortega of the Fire Company, the fire would have been originated by a short circuit in the second floor.<br/>\"We have to check the wiring in our homes, some of them are very old. Two rooms and a storeroom where wood and cardboard were stored have been consumed,\" commented the man in red. The flames reached the electric power and telephone cables, which began to burn, scaring the residents.<br/>Policemen, serenos, neighbors gathered the little water that there was until the arrival of the firemen. Alberto Ortega, in charge of the group of firemen who arrived to quench the flames, regretted that many of the carriers prevented the firemen from passing, making their arrival difficult.<br/>\"Despite the circulina, they closed the way, it took us 15 minutes to arrive, bad drivers did not give us a pass,\" explained the firefighter.<br/>Shortly after, those affected received support from the Municipality of Chilca. Civil Defense personnel delivered tarpaulins, mattresses, blankets, a folding bed and kitchen utensils, such as pots and pans, so that the family could begin to recover their basic living conditions. Also, on Tuesday night, firefighters from Huancayo put out a forest fire in Yauris.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-73004713</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GR1-WSH3-RRKC-X3FS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"291\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 11, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DE1A</classCode><className>LIVING CONDITIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp;

The Mississippi River Basin Ag and Water Desk's Hctor Alejandro Arzate reports.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After months of uncertainty over its future, an online resource for tracking the financial cost of weather and climate disasters throughout the United States has been revived.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The U.S. Billion Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-services/billion-dollar-disasters\">database was previously managed by a team at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA. Since 1980, the program has been responsible for analyzing wildfires, tornadoes, winter storms, and other disasters that cause at least $1 billion in damage. But it was retired in May, one among several NOAA products and services to get shuttered by President Donald Trump's administration this year.</url></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, a nonprofit called Climate Central, which communicates climate change science and solutions, has hired the scientist who led the project at NOAA, Adam Smith, and has taken on the responsibility of compiling and releasing the latest data.</p><p>In the first six months of 2025, there were 14 disasters with damages costing just over $101 billion in total. Many of them occurred throughout the Mississippi River Basin - states like <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kcur.org/news/2025-07-01/tornado-season-active-destructive-central-midwest-this-year\">Illinois,</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.stlpr.org/economy-business/2025-08-25/st-louis-tornado-100-days-later-walking\">Missouri,</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2025/mar/15/multiple-tornadoes-reported-in-northeast-arkansas/\">Arkansas and</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://tennesseelookout.com/2025/04/03/at-least-5-killed-in-severe-storms-in-west-tennessee-tornado-assessments-begin/\">Tennessee were among the hardest hit by severe storms and tornadoes, which caused just over $40 billion in damage.</url></p><p>Wisconsin saw $1.1 billion in severe storm damage in early 2025 - part of the more than $5 billion in such damage since 2021.</p><p>The January wildfires in Los Angeles resulted in approximately $60 billion in damages, making it the most expensive wildfire on record.</p><p>California's January wildfires - the most expensive on record - are estimated to have done about $60 billion in damage. But many other states also saw damages from natural disasters in the billions of dollars. (Mississippi River Basin Ag &amp; Water Desk)</p><p>Zachary Labe, a climate scientist at Climate Central, said the Climate Central staff brought back the database because they 'were hearing from every single sector how important this data is for decision-making and understanding areas that are increasingly at risk for billion-dollar disasters.'</p><p>Among those who have typically relied on the database are policymakers, researchers and local communities. It's especially important for planning disaster relief and emergency management efforts 'because they can focus resources on areas that are seeing big trends in the number of billion-dollars disasters,' Labe said.</p><p>Bryan Koon, the president and chief executive officer of the consulting firm Innovative Emergency Management, said the analysis is helpful. His company works with government agencies and other organizations to help with disaster preparedness, response and recovery.</p><p>'These kinds of data sets are very important in the broad scope, at least from my perspective, for trend analysis,' Koon said.</p><p>In states like Missouri, for example, he said his company and other interest groups can analyze previous billion-dollar disaster data on tornadoes and their frequency over the past decade or two. That information can be used to inform how insurance companies write their policy, how buildings are designed and how notification systems are structured.</p><p>'I want to make sure that we, as a nation, wrap our arms around as much information about these things as we can so that we communicate the threat of future disasters for Americans,' Koon said.</p><p>The Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative - a cooperative of more than 100 communities between Minnesota and Louisiana - pushed the Trump administration to keep the database open, according to the cooperative's executive director, Colin Wellenkamp.</p><p>'It was a critical database that showed us where costs associated with disasters were most impactful. What sectors of the economy were hit the hardest by a disaster? Whether it be intense heat, flooding, drought, forest fire, named storm event, or otherwise,' Wellenkamp said.</p><p>From a cost-benefit analysis standpoint, said Wellenkamp, the database can tell cities, counties and states how to spend resources on mitigation to avoid incurring similar costs from future disasters. But industries like manufacturing, construction and agriculture also want to see the data, he said. That's because the database's financial impact analysis includes physical damage to commercial and residential property, losses associated with business interruption and crop destruction, damage to electrical infrastructure, and more.</p><p>Other stakeholders that see the value of the database are both the insurance and re-insurance industries.</p><p>Franklin Nutter is the president of the Reinsurance Association of America, one of the largest trade groups in the country. The goal of reinsurance is to provide insurance for the insurance companies, stabilizing the industry and playing a role in 'the financial management of natural disaster losses,' according to the RAA's website.</p><p>'It's like an iceberg: the public is made aware of the impact of extreme weather by seeing the graphics (the tip of the iceberg) but most commercial users value the underlying data (the body of the iceberg),' said Nutter by email.</p><p>While the billion-dollar disaster data is valuable to various financial stakeholders, Nutter said he believes its greatest value comes from providing 'public awareness of the increasing extreme weather risk.'</p><p>There are many factors that come together to make a billion-dollar disaster - such as weather, infrastructure, population, and location. Labe said that the number of events has been increasing since 1980.</p><p>'It's very likely that 2025 will not be the costliest year on record when we look at the statistics, but it definitely falls into this long-term increasing trend,' he said.</p><p>Climate Central is not the only organization trying to pick up the pieces of a resource that was shut down by the federal government or is at risk.</p><p>Last month, amid growing concerns over the future of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA,  <url normalizedValue=\"https://wisconsinwatch.org/2025/09/mississippi-river-basin-disaster-relief-fema-cities-towns-trump-federal-emergency/\">the MRCTI announced that it would be partnering with a nonprofit called Convoy of Hope to provide aid within 72 hours of disasters for communities along the Mississippi River.</url></p><p>But Wellenkamp said that there aren't many states that can afford the response and recovery efforts from a billion-dollar disaster.</p><p>'These (initiatives) are not meant to be permanent solutions,' Wellenkamp said. 'These are not meant to replace federal capacity. They are meant to put our cities in a relatively secure position until the federal questions are answered. And the sooner that those answers come, the better.'</p><p>For many, the answers will require data.</p><p>'Just because the federal government decided they're not going to do it anymore doesn't mean it's not worth doing,' Koon said.</p><p>This story is a product of the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.agwaterdesk.org/\">Mississippi River Basin Ag &amp; Water Desk, an independent reporting network based at the</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://journalism.missouri.edu/2023/07/mississippi-river-basin-ag-water-desk-expands-coverage-of-local-environment-and-agriculture-news-with-new-grant/\">University of Missouri in partnership with</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.reportforamerica.org/\">Report for America, with major funding from the Walton Family Foundation.

According to news reporting originating in Chennai, India, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Energy-efficient routing is a fundamental challenge in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) due to constrained node energy. Traditional optimization techniques such as Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) struggle to adapt to dynamic energy variations and network topology changes, leading to suboptimal energy utilization and premature node depletion.\" </p><p><br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from the Jerusalem College of Engineering, \"To address these limitations, this paper introduces the Forest Fire Optimization for Energy-Aware Routing (FFO-WSN), a novel routing algorithm inspired by fire propagation dynamics. The FFO-WSN model dynamically adjusts routing paths based on real-time energy levels, prioritizing high-energy nodes while avoiding energy-depleted ones, thereby enhancing network longevity and data transmission efficiency. Extensive simulations demonstrate that FFO-WSN outperforms ACO, PSO, and other hybrid nature-inspired methods, achieving 21.8% lower energy consumption, a 26.2% increase in network lifetime, 98.1% packet delivery ratio, and 1.02 Mbps throughput while maintaining low end-to-end delay.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"These results confirm the scalability and resilience of FFO-WSN, making it a promising solution for IoT-based health monitoring and smart city applications.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Adaptive Forest Fire Optimization Algorithm for Enhanced Energy Efficiency and Scalability In Wireless Sensor Networks.

Forecasters now say mild temperatures are expected to continue this month with a forecast of mostly dry weather.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the entire state is listed as \u201cabnormally dry\u201d conditions. The southeast part of the state along the shoreline in New London County is listed as being in moderate drought.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"If you end the summer on a dry note and start losing leaves in the fall, that is fuel for fire,\" Accuweather senior meteorologist Paul Pastelok said.</p><p>\"The thing that we should be thankful for is that there hasn't been a lot of wind. So any wildfires we might have had already didn't have a chance to really kick up. We did have a few days of rain last week that actually reduced our level from a drought to just abnormally dry conditions. That rain really helped us out.\"</p><p>Pastelok said that dry conditions will continue for most of the week until next Wednesday, with more warmer conditions setting in. Much of the Northeast is experiencing dry or drought conditions. Northern New England, including parts of Maine and New Hampshire, are currently listed as extreme drought conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.</p><p>\"Getting rain for a day and then drying out for five or six days afterwards is not good,\" Pastelok said. \"That's going to be the patten through at least mid to late October. Because after the rain event next week, another big high pressure system builds right behind it. So it will most likely dry out again for several days afterwards.\"</p><p>So far this year, 29.62 inches of rainfall has been recorded in Connecticut, well below the 37.34 inch average for this time of year, according to RainDrop.com. September saw just 2.59 inches of accumulated rainfall, and August saw just 1.60 inches.</p><p>\"The state is averaging about 60 to 65 percent of average rainfall, which is below average,\" Pastelok said.</p><p>\"Without the tropics or anything coming out of the Gulf of Mexico, it doesn't change our weather pattern. If it doesn't get wet in Tennessee and down to the Mississippi Valley, then it stays mostly dry in the Northeast as well, because that's often where our air is coming from,\" he said. \"So since it's been dry down there with no tropical moisture coming up and affecting our pattern, I think that's why we've had a below average year for rainfall.\"</p><p>As dry conditions persist, the risk of devastating wildfires increases. The dry weather stretch comes as the state still reels from a series of devastating wildfires last year that led to the death of a Wethersfield firefighter. The Hawthorne fire in Berlin, which consumed more than 100 acres at its peak, was one of the largest in the state in decades. Through September, there have been six brush fires reported in the state, according to the Wildland Fire Reporting System through the state\u2019s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.</p><p>Connecticut has two forest fire seasons: spring fire season, normally mid-March to mid-May, and fall fire season, according to Accuweather.</p><p>Fall wildfire season varies by region but is generally considered the period from mid-September or October until the first snowfall, characterized by dry, windy conditions that increase fire risk. In Connecticut, it runs from October to the first snowfall, with dry, windy conditions and fallen leaves act as fuel for fires.</p><p>Over the next few weeks, dry and potentially windy weather conditions, combined with fallen leaves and increased sunlight reaching and warming the forest floor, can elevate the likelihood of wildfires, according to state officials.</p><p>Water use</p><p>Connecticut Water, which serves 60 towns in Connecticut has issued a notice to its customers that, \"due to abnormally dry conditions and low rain forecast levels, Connecticut Water has issued conservation requests for customers in the following towns: Clinton, Madison, Guilford, Old Saybrook, Westbrook and Plymouth.\"</p><p>\"Using water wisely will ensure available supply for public health and fire protection. This request is until further notice. We will continue to update customers on drought status,\" the company notice says.</p><p>The Metropolitan District, a non-profit municipal corporation, reports in its most recent data that it reservoir levels as of August 31 are at 94.7% of capacity. The MDC notes that its surface water supply system of reservoirs includes: 30.3 billion gallon Barkhamsted Reservoir and 9.5 billion gallon Nepaug Reservoir.</p><p>\"Because of the large size of its reservoirs relative to the amount of water typically used, the MDC is better able to meet water use demands during drought conditions,\" according to the MDC.</p><p>The MDC supplies water to eight member towns, Bloomfield, East Hartford, Hartford, Newington, Rocky Hill, West Hartford, Wethersfield and Windsor, but also to portions of Farmington, Glastonbury, East Granby and South Windsor, which the agency\u2019s non-member towns.</p><p>While the South Central Regional Water Authority, which serves 15 towns in Greater New Haven, says \"the level of water in reservoirs rises and falls throughout the year,\" it list its reservoirs at \u00a072% of capacity.as of Sept. 15. The usual capacity at this time of year is 71 percent, according to the agency. Further, according to the RWA, it on average, supplies 42.3 million gallons of water a day to nearly 432,000 people.</p><p>Pastelok said that October and November tend to be more dry months due to persistent high-pressure systems that block moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and create dry, westerly wind flows, leading to less precipitation and increased drought conditions.</p><p>Connecticut experienced record wildfires last fall, with 605 fires burning more than 500 acres, destroying eight structures and disrupting communities across the state, a spokesperson with DEEP said. Last year, Gov. Ned Lamont declared a state of emergency, issued a statewide burn ban and activated the Northeast Forest Fire Protection Compact, bringing in support from other states and the National Guard. During the last wildlife season, eight firefighters were injured.</p><p>As wildfires continue to be a major risk, Lamont and Connecticut Insurance Department commissioner Andrew Mais announced the launch of a free online risk mapping tool that allows Connecticut homeowners and businesses to assess their property\u2019s risk from flooding, wildfires and other perils to better understand their insurance needs.</p><p>Provided through a public-partnership between CID and First Street, a global provider of physical climate risk data and analytics, the mapping tool gives residents access to property-level data through interactive maps and risk-rating reports. By entering an address, homeowners and businesses can immediately see their property\u2019s exposure to a range of climate-related risks such as flooding, wildfire, hurricane winds, extreme heat and air quality.</p><p>State officials say the majority of wildfires in Connecticut are caused by improper burning of debris, arson, campfires and discarded wood ashes and equipment.</p><p>Fire prevention tips from DEEP include:</p><p>Always obeying local laws regarding open fires (apply for open burning permits).</p><p>Using caution when having a campfire.</p><p>Keeping all flammable objects away from fire.</p><p>Having a water source and tools readily available to extinguish a fire.</p><p>Never leaving a fire unattended.</p><p>Carefully disposing of hot ashes.</p><p>Extinguishing and disposing of smoking materials appropriately.</p><p>Stephen Underwood can be reached at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:sunderwood@courant.com\">sunderwood@courant.com</email></p><p>\u00a92025 Hartford Courant.

The Department   is in the process of shortlisting   and finalising agencies   that will not only harvest Senna spectabilis from these forests, but will also buy these woody harvests, leading to fund generation. The proceeds raised from this activity will then be used for regeneration activities in these areas. </p><p>Prabhash Chandra Ray, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) and Chief Wildlife Warden, KFD, said that two agencies have been finalised   and shortlisted for Senna removal in Bandipur and Nagarhole   Tiger reserves. \ufffd\u20ac\u0153The step is being taken to scale up the removal of exotic invasive plant species from our forests. Senna can be used in various industries,   and we are looking for players from these industries so that the uprooted material can be utilised, leading to fund generation.   It will also reduce forest fire hazard,\ufffd\u20ac he said. Following the uprooting of Senna from these forests, all financial   costs of eco-restoration will be managed by the funds generated in the process. An estimate made by the Karnataka Forest Department a few months ago showed that the two flowering invasive species - Lantana camara and Senna spectabilis - have covered   nearly 60 per cent of the forests in Bandipur and Nagarhole   tiger reserves, and this was also speculated to have led to a surge in human-wildlife conflict cases. Last year, the Department handed over nearly 100 acres of forest area in Nagarhole Tiger Reserve to Forest First Samithi on a pilot basis to remove Lantana.   Experts say that although the process of clearing a parcel of forest land of these invasive plants is a long-term process that takes at least five to six years, the on-ground work is far from substantial. A wildlife conservationist said that not only do these invasive   species need continuous removal and uprooting year on year to arrest their growth and spread, but it is equally important   to bring back native vegetation   to reclaim the land. \ufffd\u20ac\u0153Thus, the native plants underneath the invasive species must not be disturbed during the process. However, the Forest Department   is far from getting the desired result,\ufffd\u20ac said the wildlife conservationist.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MIRORP-0_13_17092025002007</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MIRORP2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GS3-0KN3-RSN7-842C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382868</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"384\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

Spain lost 400,000 hectares (988,400 acres), six times more than its average, while Portugal saw 270,000 hectares (667,700 acres) burned. At least 11 people were killed across both countries.</p><p>The destruction was not only physical. The season exposed deep weaknesses in Europe's fire management, with experts warning that extreme wildfires are no longer the exception but the new reality. </p><p>'Fires that cannot be put out'</p><p>Victor Resco de Dios, a forestry engineering professor at the University of Lleida in Spain, said the fires were fueled by forests overloaded with combustible organic material.</p><p>'These are fires that cannot be put out. It's not a matter of technology, it's not a matter of power. It's a matter of fuel, energy and physics,' he told Anadolu.</p><p>Once flames rise above 5 meters (16 feet), he explained, firefighting becomes nearly impossible. This summer, some blazes in Spain reached 25 meters (82 feet) and emitted more than 15 times the energy that qualifies a blaze as extreme.</p><p>In August, several megafires erupted simultaneously across the Iberian Peninsula, overwhelming emergency systems.</p><p>'They do a triage, so they go to the places they consider most important, and the other ones, they leave abandoned. This creates a lot of discontent,' Resco de Dios said, explaining that many residents were left to fend for themselves.</p><p>In Spain, anger boiled over in regions such as Leon and Galicia, where thousands protested what they saw as failures by both regional and national governments in handling the fires.</p><p>Domingos Xavier Viegas, director of Portugal's Forest Fire Research Center (CEIF) at the University of Coimbra, also pointed to the difficulties in controlling this year's fires.</p><p>'This is a situation that is completely out of the ordinary,' Viegas told Anadolu, stressing that fires were spreading in areas where they would not normally be expected.</p><p>'These fires spread in such conditions, in such intensity, that it is not possible to suppress them. And this is new,' he said, noting that fire behavior has changed dramatically in recent decades under the pressures of climate change.</p><p>The World Weather Attribution network found that the hot, dry and windy conditions behind the fires are now 40 times more likely due to global warming.</p><p>Both Viegas and Resco de Dios also cited rural exodus, poor landscape management, and declining local agriculture as structural factors making Europe's forests more vulnerable.</p><p>'These are fires that cannot be put out, but they can be prevented,' Resco de Dios said. 'What we are witnessing these days is just a preview of what's going to happen ... In 10 or 20 years, seasons like the one we had this year will be viewed as very benign.' </p><p>Prevention gap and what needs to change</p><p>Resco de Dios argued that prevention systems are still 'nowhere near enough' and that public awareness of fire risk remains low, stressing that both administrations and the population should take the risks more seriously.</p><p>'We cannot fight these fires the way we were fighting them 30 years ago. They're very different. They require intelligence. They require analysis. And this is something that some regions in Spain still need to improve,' he explained.</p><p>'If we don't take care of nature, then we're going to have to pay a big bill.'</p><p>Viegas agreed, pointing to gaps in funding, strategy and citizen participation.</p><p>'There are always things that should and could be done, but they are not done for many reasons: lack of perception, lack of money, lack of power or willingness,' he said.</p><p>Experts stress that firefighting alone is not enough - Europe must rethink how its landscapes are managed.</p><p>'We need to have a mosaic of vegetation, like a patchwork with different land uses. We need to have some more forests, some growth forests, some olive orchards, some vineyards,' Resco de Dios said.</p><p>Properly managed areas like tilled olive orchards can act as 'fire bricks' that slow or stop flames, he explained, while reiterating the need for more fire prevention in strategic points of a landscape where fires can grow rapidly.</p><p>He also urged wider use of prescribed burns and grazing to reduce dangerous fuel build-ups.</p><p>'(A controlled burn) is going to eat this excess fuel in a low-intensity fire. That will, in turn, prevent a high-intensity fire,' Resco de Dios explained.</p><p>He further urged city halls to approve fire prevention plans and criticized governments for failing to inform citizens about the fire risk. However, he also stressed the importance of individual responsibility.</p><p>'People need to establish this culture of risk, this risk awareness, because otherwise, we're just going to be living clueless,' he said.</p><p>Viegas emphasized gradual, consistent reform instead of reactionary resets after each crisis. 'We need to have a line of direction. We need to have a strategy and follow that,' he stressed, noting that the tendency to start from scratch after a disaster can undermine progress.</p><p>Authorities, he added, cannot carry the responsibility alone. He urged more citizen awareness in managing the vegetation and fuels around their homes.</p><p>'Everyone should be counted on, including and mainly the citizens,' he said. 'They should also be part of the system and of the process - from my point of view, this is very important.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HUNWSD-HUNGNWSDGT1709202500010104</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HUNWSD2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GSB-7113-RTCR-F1S3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410311</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"946\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Hungarian State All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Hungarian News Digest</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"24124\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 17, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

With more than 70 per cent of new ATMs being installed in rural areas, he said satcom would be vital for ensuring financial inclusion and expanding digital services.</p><p>The Minister highlighted that Indias space economy, valued at $8.4 billion in 2022, is on track to expand nearly fivefold over the next decade. He credited reforms such as the creation of New Space India Limited (NSIL) and the establishment of IN-SPACe for dismantling decades of state monopoly and enabling private innovation. As a result, more than 300 space startups have emerged in just five years, making India the worlds fifth-largest space startup ecosystem.</p><p>Indias achievements have also been marked by cost-effective innovation. Chandrayaan-3s historic soft landing near the Moons south pole in 2023 earned India global recognition, including the World Space Award, at roughly half the cost of comparable international missions. Commercially, India has launched 433 foreign satellites, generating over $190 million and 270 million in revenue.</p><p>Looking ahead, Dr. Jitendra Singh highlighted Indias long-term space roadmap. By 2035, India plans to set up its own Bharatiya Antariksh Station, while by 2040, an Indian astronaut is expected to land on the Moon and announce the vision of Viksit Bharat 2047. The roadmap also envisages launching more than 100 satellites over the next 15 years, most of them small satellites developed through government-private partnerships.</p><p>The Minister also spoke of how space technology is shaping governance. Programs like SVAMITVA have already provided land ownership rights to more than 2.4 crore rural property owners across 1.61 lakh villages through satellite mapping. Satellites are now integral to disaster management, daily forest fire monitoring, and agricultural yield assessments, in addition to powering flagship schemes like Gati Shakti for infrastructure planning and NavIC for navigation.</p><p>Dr. Jitendra Singh said Indias space diplomacy was strengthening through missions such as the upcoming Chandrayaan-5 in collaboration with Japan and the NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) mission. Neighbouring countries, too, are increasingly dependent on Indian satellites for disaster management and communication support.</p><p>Seventy per cent of our space technology is dedicated to development and ease of living, not just rocket launches, Dr. Jitendra Singh said, adding that the convergence of space technology, digital infrastructure, and governance would serve as the digital nervous system of Viksit Bharat 2047.</p><p>Concluding his address, the minister said Indias cost-effective missions, expanding private partnerships, and ambitious space roadmap are positioning the country as a global leader. Indias space sector has earned for the country an enduring space in the world arena, he remarked.</p><p>The event featured keynote addresses by Dr. Pawan Goenka, Chairman of IN-SPACe, and Dr. V. Narayanan, Chairman of ISRO and Secretary, Department of Space, who highlighted Indias expanding role in the global space sector. The session concluded with a vote of thanks, marking a collaborative beginning to discussions on advancing universal connectivity through satellite networks.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1127381849</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GXM-KDP3-RWWK-K1K6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"734\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"10\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>October 8, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

If it comes to the crunch, we will see them in court.\u201d</p><p>The group surveyed inside the area earmarked for the firebreak in July and discovered more than 40 of the plants growing.

According to news originating from Malaga, Spain, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"In the context of global climate change, the virulence of forest fires is expected to increase based on the estimated projections of global warming in the Mediterranean arc. In this context, an analysis of the perception of natural risks is proposed, paying special attention to forest fires and how their effect on the landscape can affect satisfaction with housing or the choice of a property.\" </p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the University of Malaga, \"The methodology proposes a qualitative analysis, through surveys, to find out the perception of forest fire risk of residents in the municipalities of Benahavis, Ist &amp; aacute;n and Oj &amp; eacute;n, located in the transition between the Western Costa del Sol and the Sierra de las Nieves, in the province of M &amp; aacute;laga. It is concluded that the perception of risk is generally high and increasing, although its influence turns out to be of a lesser degree than that of considering the natural environment as an environmental amenity.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Wildfires and their impact on the landscape have a negative effect on the valuation of the place of residence, but this unfavourable consequence is reduced when the landscape recovers, although the risk of a new episode is perceived to be high.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Perception of Forest Fire Risk and Its Impact On Housing Valuation: the Transition Between the Sierra De Las Nieves and the Costa Del Sol (Malaga, Spain).

fanned the flames in Castilla y Le\u00f3n on Monday have added eight new evacuations caused by the fires in La Ba\u00f1a, Gara\u00f1o and Fasgar-Ig\u00fce\u00f1a, reaching 18 towns.<br/>The delegate of the Junta in Le\u00f3n, Eduardo Diego, has highlighted, after the meeting of the Integrated Operational Coordination Center (CECOPI), that Le\u00f3n maintains only three fires with danger level 2 for threatening populations, after the good evolution of the fire of Molinaseca, which is already without flame and has been downgraded to level 0.</p><p><br/>This improvement has allowed the residents of Molinaseca and Lombillos to return to their homes.<br/>Good news that does not hide that the de-escalation in the eviction of localities for being threatened by the flames has been broken, due to the fires of La Ba\u00f1a, where the virulence of the flames has made it impossible to control the perimeter and has caused the eviction of the localities of Losadilla, Forna, Santa Eulalia de Cabrera, Trabazos, Encinedo and Castrohinojo.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related to this topic</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">High temperatures rekindle fires in Zamora and Le\u00f3n, and force new evacuations</emphasis><br/>In this fire the attempts of the extinguishing operation to prevent the advance of the front advancing towards Losadilla through technical fires has failed due to the strong and changing gusts of winds so it has been decided to evacuate the localities mentioned, explained the delegate of the Board.<br/>On the other hand, the Gara\u00f1o fire that started last Sunday has evacuated two new towns: Mora de Luna and Vega de Caballeros, with a total of 90 people evacuated.<br/>This fire, whose probable cause under investigation is that it has been intentionally provoked, already kept evicted since yesterday the towns of Vi\u00f1ayo, Piedrasecha, Portilla de Luna and Seg\u00fcera de Lunas with a total of more than 180 people evacuated.<br/>The fire currently has two fronts, the first between the towns of Gara\u00f1o and Portilla de Luna, and about four kilometers of perimeter, where he has worked throughout the day with ground and air resources.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related to this subject</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Council of Ministers approves this Tuesday the emergency zone for the territories affected by the fires</emphasis><br/>\"In this case the flames have behaved in a convective way by the action of the wind, so its control has been very complicated, the forecast is that at night when weather conditions improve can attack the flames,\" said Diego.<br/>The last fire of level 2 of danger is that of Fasgar-Igue\u00f1a, two fires that started independently and that have been united having the same technical direction and where evacuated populations are also maintained.  <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related to this topic</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Firefighters continue to fight

Colinas de Mart\u00edn Moro.<br/>There is still a lot of flames in a fire that has a large perimeter, to which is added the steep terrain so that throughout the day has been trying to contain the flames with aerial means.<br/>The third active front is the one located in the south and is directed to Tremor, where also the complexity of the terrain, very rocky, makes it difficult to extinguish the fire, so it is being left to evolve the flames towards an old mining open pit to try to extinguish the fire there directly.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related to this topic</emphasis><emphasis

forest fire that comes from one that has been reactivated in the Palencia town of Bra\u00f1osera, in whose extinction are working forest firefighters from Cantabria and Castilla y Le\u00f3n.<br/>This

fire originated on August 14 by lightning in Porto has advanced in recent hours by the Sierra de la Cabrera, on the border between the provinces of Zamora and Leon, fanned by the wind that has made it has jumped the established defenses, as reported by the Fire Fighting Service of the Junta de Castilla y Le\u00f3n.<br/>Winds with constant gusts of 40 kilometers per hour have conditioned the advance of the fire this Monday afternoon that, after overcoming the defenses, the front has reached the summit that separates the two provinces and has forced to evacuate five Zamoran populations, four of them already evacuated last week.<br/>The work in the afternoon hours more complicated by the wind, with gusts of up to 60 kilometers per hour, has consisted of containing the fire with the intention of waiting for an opportunity during the night.<br/>The area of La Cabrera in Le\u00f3n and Zamora, where the fire is advancing, is formed by a series of north-facing valleys.south where, aided by the westerly winds, the fire can advance with speed, explained sources of the firefighting operation.<br/>It is also a very rocky area where the bulldozers can not work easily, so the strategy tonight is focused on making small backfires that help to gradually close small parts of the fire, according to these sources.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mobilization of troops</emphasis><br/>A dozen ground crews, along with eight fire engines and two machinery retentions have worked last night with backfires and perimetration of the terrain in the forest fire of Porto (Zamora), which has been complicated by the wind on Monday afternoon and that keeps six evicted populations.<br/>In the work of extinction at night, to which from 8.30 in the morning aerial means are added, have also worked five technicians and ten environmental agents, in addition to five external teams of urban firefighters, as reported by sources of operational extinction.<br/>The work is focused on the environment of the Sierra de la Cabrera, which marks the boundary between the provinces of Zamora and Le\u00f3n, where on Monday the fire, fanned by the wind, jumped the established defenses.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Roads cut off</emphasis><br/>Likewise, the fires have cut a total of nine road sections: the LE-5330 between Ig\u00fce\u00f1a and Colinas; LE-7311, between Nogar and Castrillo de Cabrera; LE-4212, between Cariseda and Chano; LE-5228, between the towns of Bouzas and Corporales; LE-126, between La Ba\u00f1a, Mora de Luna and Sag\u00fcera de Luna (in crescent direction) and the LE-4523, between Otero de las Due\u00f1as and Piedrasecha.<br/>These are joined by the LE-4503, between Vega de Caballeros and Portilla de Luna, and the CL-626, in a stretch of 11 kilometers between Los Barrios de Luna and Otero de las Due\u00f1as, and the ascent to the Morredero pass.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

According to news originating from Seoul, South Korea, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Climate change-induced heat waves and densely forested areas near urban centers in South Korea create complex challenges for wildfire response systems. Various forest fire models have been developed to address this, each with unique strengths and weaknesses.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Core Research Institute Basic Science Research Program; National Research Foundation of Korea; Ministry of Education; Forest Science Technology; Korea Forest Service; Korea Forestry Promotion Institute. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Korea University: \"Process-based models offer high interpretability through human domain knowledge but require extensive optimization, while machine learning models automatically identify important features but have limited interpretability. To leverage the strengths of both models, this study aimed to integrate human domain knowledge into a machine learning framework. IIASA's wildfire cLimate impacts and Adaptation Model (FLAM)-a process-based model incorporating biophysical and human impacts-was developed as a neural network called FLAM-Net. Enhancements included improving backpropagation for optimization and introducing algorithms for national-specific fire ignition dynamics. FLAM-Net was applied at multiple scales and integrated through U-Net-based architecture, named deep neural FLAM (DN-FLAM), to produce downscaled predictions. The optimization revealed spatial concentration of fires near metropolitan areas and the east coast, with temporal concentration in spring due to agricultural burning. Integration of multiscale features through DN-FLAM achieved optimal performance with Pearson's r values of 0.943, 0.840, and 0.641 for temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal validations. Future projections based on shared socioeconomic pathways indicated increasing fire frequencies until 2050, followed by a decrease due to increased precipitation.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"This study demonstrates the benefits of the hybrid approach, providing interpretability, accuracy, and efficient optimization. These hybrid models offer scientific evidence to guide locally tailored decision-making for climate change-induced forest fires and lay the groundwork for global application through their optimization capabilities.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Projecting Forest Fire Probability in South Korea Under Climate Change, Population, and Forest Management Scenarios Using AI &amp; Process-Based Hybrid Model (FLAM-Net).

They started working on it in June 2025 and have now completed phases one and two.</p><p>The plan, developed in four phases, aims to align with existing policies and set new goals.</p><p>Houston's GHG emissions increased by 29 per cent from 2007 to 2022, with transportation and buildings being major contributors.</p><p>Key climate hazards identified include wildfire, smoke, drought, and extreme heat. The plan includes strategies for active transportation, electric vehicles, and emergency response for vulnerable populations.</p><p>\"The next steps currently for phase 3 and 4 are to start to develop emission reduction targets as outlined with the BC government as well as engage with various groups to start to develop goals and actionable lists of project which can support the mitigation and adaptation plans through the climate action plan,\" said the District's project manager Scott Sanders.</p><p>\"We hope to have a reasonable list of short-, medium- and long-term project opportunities identified around the District which will support these efforts in climate action. These can be forest fire prevention, flood mitigation, GHG reduction through district-owned properties, as examples.\"</p><p>The next steps also involve further public engagement and finalizing the plan by January 2026.</p><p>Copyright 2025 Houston Today</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HOUTOD-news20250905PHT4758912</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HOUTOD2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GNM-G123-RT03-P27W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438225</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"294\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

The remaining 10,000 hectares are distributed in the rest of the communities with some fire episode during August. <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Very high risk of fires</emphasis><br/>On the other hand, Aagesen has launched a message of caution by warning that \"the emergency with respect to forest fires has not passed\", despite the fact that the last episode of large fires has come to an end.<br/>As indicated by the minister with sources from the Meteorological Agency (AEMET), the risk of fire is still \"very high or extreme\" in large areas of the country. In particular, the danger persists in areas of Castilla-La Mancha, Andalusia, Murcia, Alicante, in mountain areas of Cantabria and in the central Iberian system.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

In his speech at the Convention for a State Pact on the Climate Emergency, which is being held in Ponferrada, Snchez called for \"making this State Pact a new example of unity, as we did with terrorism, pensions and gender violence\".</p><p>\"Spain is today at the forefront in the fight against climate change\", he said, because \"we chose to face this challenge head on, out of responsibility\", but also \"because we were able to see the ecological transition as an opportunity\". The head of the Executive, who was accompanied by the Third Vice-President of the Government of Spain and Minister for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge, Sara Aagesen Muoz, and the government delegate in Castilla y Len, Nicanor Sen, pointed out that the priority is to tackle the climate emergency with a state vision and a long-term perspective.</p><p>\"Tackling the climate emergency is about survival\", because \"climate change kills\", as happened a year ago in the DANA in Valencia, but \"it also impoverishes\" because it increases inequality.</p><p>Appeal to administrations</p><p>The President of the Government of Spain addressed all the public administrations of our country, autonomous communities, provincial councils, town councils and municipalities, as well as all the political forces, \"especially the PP\", with an \"outstretched hand\" to regional presidents, mayors and public officials.</p><p>The President of the Government of Spain, Pedro Snchez, along with Third Vice-President and Minister for Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge, Sara Aagensen, at the Convention for a State Pact to Address the Climate Emergency | Pool Moncloa/Fernando Calvo</p><p>\"The verdict of science is resounding, it is not possible to turn a blind eye and look the other way\", demanded Snchez, who recalled that \"the Government of Spain has not done so and never will\".</p><p>He reaffirmed that \"in the face of the effects of climate change, anticipation is essential, because not only mitigation, but also early adaptation is less costly and more effective than doing so reactively when impacts occur.\"</p><p>A government that acts</p><p>\"That is why we declared a climate emergency in 2020, promoted the National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan or the National Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change, and also the first Climate Change and Energy Transition Law\", the President of the Government of Spain explained. \"And that is why we are allocating four out of every ten euros of the Recovery Plan to ecological transition and climate change mitigation,\" he added.</p><p>In addition, since 2017, the government has increased public investment in ecological transition, exceeding 30 billion. Today Spain is a world power in renewables, the fourth most sustainable large economy on the planet.</p><p>Citizen support for the State Pact</p><p>The President of the Government of Spain, Pedro Snchez, and the Third Vice-President and Minister for Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge, Sara Aagensen, with members of the Forest Fire Reinforcement Brigades | Pool Moncloa/Fernando Calvo</p><p>\"To those who ignore the mandate out of pure sectarianism, I ask them to listen to the clamour of the Spanish people\", said the President of the Government of Spain, referring to the public's support for the State Pact as reflected in the opinion polls.</p><p>Almost 90% of citizens consider climate change to be a serious problem and three out of four Spaniards are calling for a State Pact on the climate emergency. Nine out of ten also believe that we need to strengthen human and material resources to deal with fires and disasters.</p><p>Spain is the driving force of economic growth and job creation throughout Europe</p><p>Snchez used his speech to highlight that the IMF joins other organisations that \"applaud the economic strength of Spain\", which \"has become the driving force of economic growth and job creation throughout Europe\". In this regard, he stressed that the most important thing is that \"we do it not by exploiting workers, nor by burning fossil fuels, but by creating more and better jobs, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and reducing the price of electricity by 50% thanks to the promotion of renewable energies\".</p><p>\"We are growing three times faster than the European average, we are breaking employment records, real wages have risen 6% above inflation in the last five years, and poverty and inequality are at historic lows. This time there is no trap and no bubble: what we have are good policies and that is a success for the country,\" he concluded.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1127392259</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6H04-CSB3-RWN5-C1VB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"827\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"10\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>October 14, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

More than 20 vehicles were deployed to help fight an ongoing blaze in Jarilla in the Extremadura region that borders Portugal, the ministry said.</p><p>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez visited the area Tuesday, where he spoke of the recent heat that has fueled the fires. Temperatures across the Iberian Peninsula dropped by about 7 degrees on Tuesday after a 16-day heat wave with several days above 104 degrees, Spain's weather agency reported.</p><p>\"Science tells us, common sense tells us too, especially that of farmers and ranchers, of those who live in rural areas, that the climate is changing, that the climate emergency is becoming more and more recurrent, more frequent and has an ever greater impact,\" Sanchez said.</p><p>In Galicia, land management has also played a role; large stretches of unmanaged vegetation and depopulated villages in forested land have led to the build-up of wildfire fuel, said Adrian Regos, an ecologist at the Biological Mission of Galicia, a research institute.</p><p>The fires in Spain have killed four people this year and burned about 1,475 square miles, according to the European Union's European Forest Fire Information System. That surface area is more than twice the size of metropolitan London, more than six times the 2006-2024 average for land burned during the same period, according to EFFIS.</p><p>Air quality deteriorated across large parts of Spain over the last week as a result of the wildfires, data from the EU's Copernicus climate monitoring agency showed. Smoke from the Iberian Peninsula fires reached France, the United Kingdom and Scandinavia, it said.</p><p>Several fires have been triggered by human activity. Police have detained 23 people for suspected arson and are investigating 89 more, Spain's Civil Guard said Tuesday.</p><p>In Portugal, more than 3,700 firefighters were tackling blazes.</p><p>Wildfires there have burned about 907 square miles, according to EFFIS -- nearly five times more than the 2006-2024 average for this period. Two people there have died.</p><p>Europe has been warming twice as fast as the global average since the 1980s, according to Copernicus. Scientists say that climate change is exacerbating the frequency and intensity of heat and dryness in parts of Europe, making the region more vulnerable to wildfires.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: A MEMBER of the Forest Fire Reinforcement Brigades battles a blaze in Castrelo do Val, Spain, on Tuesday.

The concentration goes up, so they go in the direction of the higher concentration,\" explained Arindam Phani, research associate at the University of Calgary.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's the same principle that inspired him and his team to create a sensor that detects airborne molecules down to just 100 parts per billion - a thousand times more sensitive than a human nose.</p><p>In a <url normalizedValue=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.nanolett.5c01404\">recent study</url> published in the journal <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nano Letters</emphasis>, Phani and his team tested the sensor with various gases to see how it would react. The sensor was able to successfully detect organic compounds in the air at very low concentrations.</p><p>Sam Kim, an author on the study and professor in the Schulich School of Engineering, said the challenge of creating a novel sensor like this is making it both \"sensitive\" and \"selective\" to molecules.</p><p>The small sensor, made of a vibrating quartz crystal coated in a thin layer of porous material called a metal-organic framework, is an example of nanoscale technology.\u00a0</p><p/><p>It's an innovative approach to a chemical sensor that Kim says \"doesn't follow our conventional intuition.\"\u00a0</p><p>While traditional sensors struggle to differentiate molecules that have similar properties, Phani and his team's sensor was able to recognize each gas individually in the study.</p><p>One of the first applications of this technology, Phani imagines, would be in health care to improve breath analysis and possibly help detect diseases like cancers or diabetes with more precision.</p><p>\"Our breath has a lot of information,\" he said, with hundreds of low concentration molecules present. \"A mixture of all these different kinds of molecules gives you an idea about your health.</p><p>\"If we can go down to [the] level of parts per billion to less than parts per trillion... that gives us a way to go into [a] new generation of breath analysis,\" far more advanced than a breathalyzer test one would take for alcohol detection, for example.</p><p>With the technology proving to work, the next step, Phani said, is for professionals like biologists and doctors to research how they can apply this sensor nanotechnology and put it to use.\u00a0</p><p>\"If you can give us a very clear biomarker from our breath, definitely, we can develop a sensor for that and we can target it,\" Phani said.</p><p/><p>Detecting forest fires is another application Phani suggests, as early indicators like nitrogen oxides are present in the air in low concentrations at the start of a fire.</p><p>\"There is a possibility we can design sensors specifically catered for forest fire detection. And if you can do it quickly when the forest fire starts... it will be much easier to, maybe, control.\"</p><p>Committing to the insect inspiration, Phani also suggested the sensor could\u00a0be attached onto a drone, allowing someone to fly it around and gather data for a 3D-concentration map. This concept could be used to identify where a gas leakage is along a pipeline, for example.</p><p>Once these kinds of applications are further researched and planned, the sensor itself can be manufactured at scale, keeping costs relatively low, Phani said.</p><p>At the moment, a basic sensor costs $25 to produce, he said, and the price tag goes up from there depending on its exact function and sophistication.</p><p>But Phani is hopeful that once these sensors move to a production stage, costs can be brought down further.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewscanadacalgaryscentsensors17618478</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GKN-6P73-RS19-N08T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"589\"/><timeReceived>1:27 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 CBC/Radio-Canada.

Many beneficiaries were disappointed that, after the four-year legal fight, they will receive just 22,000 Kenyan shillings ($170) and now plan to protest, according to a local lawmaker.</p><p>\"It's a success story because it's the first time we've ever won a case against the British Army in Kenya but it's so little it's almost nothing,\" Laikipia County MP Cate Waruguru told CNN. \"They feel that their sweat and their struggle have not borne any fruit.  We need to see our courts stand up to protect the rights of Kenyans,\" she added.</p><p>Kelvin Kubai, a 27-year-old lawyer who grew up in the area, initiated the class-action lawsuit that culminated in the settlement, although he said his clients had hoped for a payout some 20 times larger.</p><p>\"Military training and conservation are incompatible. There is a need to separate them,\" Kubai told CNN on Thursday. \"This payment is nowhere close to give (my clients)...  the financial assistance to enable them to move far away from this training. So the only thing now is to move the training away from them.\" He says the \"ex gratia\" payout - a voluntary payment made outside of any legal obligation -  was the fastest way to compensate the affected community instead of pushing for a full trial that could have lasted years.</p><p>The British army pays Kenya about $400,000 a year to allow BATUK to train in the country. The UK troops operate mostly in large wildlife conservancies in Laikipia and the neighboring Samburu County. But allegations of human rights abuses including rape and murder have dogged BATUK for decades, leading to an ongoing Kenyan parliamentary investigation. Military officials say they investigate all reported claims of misconduct against officers in Kenya, but they do not comment on individual cases.</p><p>The British High Commission in Nairobi, which represents BATUK in country, said it was \"pleased that a global settlement has been agreed with the claimants' appointed legal representatives\" and called the fire \"extremely regrettable\" but declined to say if any officers had faced disciplinary action for it.</p><p>\"The UK has devoted considerable time, effort and resource to resolving these claims for the people affected,\" a spokesperson told CNN in a statement.</p><p>CNN has also contacted the British Ministry of Defence for comment.</p><p>'If we get this money, we will leave'</p><p>Community members have previously demonstrated against BATUK and the British government. When CNN met a group of area residents outside the fence of the Lolldaiga conservancy in June last year, many hoped for a substantial payout so that they could move away from the area.</p><p>One woman raised her inhaler above her head as she explained that she and most of her neighbors had developed breathing difficulties requiring medication and frequent hospital visits following the fire.</p><p>Nearby, Hannah Wanjiku fought back tears as she spoke of the British troops who train near her home. She said that her grandchildren are sick and that she has developed chest problems.  \"We live a difficult life. If we get this money, we will leave,\" Wanjiku added.</p><p>The community meeting in June 2024 was convened by activist James Mwangi who has campaigned for the residents since the blaze. \"In March 2021, this area was a furnace for seven days. Over 10,000 people were choked by smoke, toxic smoke,\" he told CNN at the time.</p><p>In environmental terms, one <url normalizedValue=\"https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.declassifieduk.org%2Fcarbon-footprint-of-army-forest-fire-revealed%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7Csana.noor.haq%40cnn.com%7C954bede76ce34696dedf08dde0dcc153%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638913960934755258%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=IYQTj3KDSHb6MKtDFAsVuDK8KpBFXQF4sjn7Pt5jNnc%3D&amp;reserved=0\">report</url>, by consultancy firm Howard Humphreys - commissioned by Lolldaiga Hills Limited - found it would take until at least 2060 for the land to fully recover from the effects of the fire.</p><p>Previously a private livestock ranch, Lolldaiga became a conservancy in 2021 and is home to the endangered Grevy's zebra, elephants, buffaloes, lions, hyenas, jackals, vervet monkeys and baboons.         </p><p>             By Larry Madowo, CNN</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska said at a press conference broadcast by national television channel RTVE that the measure applies to all regions affected by the 113 wildfires recorded between June 23 and Aug. 25. \"We are facing one of the worst environmental crises in recent years,\" said Grande-Marlaska, adding that affected residents can apply for compensation. The aid also covers areas hit by severe flooding at the end of June. Government aid will include support for households, businesses and local authorities, as well as compensation for farmers whose crops, woodland and livestock were damaged. Additional measures include grants for infrastructure repairs and preferential credit lines. According to the European Forest Fire Information Service, wildfires in Spain have burned an estimated 418,000 hectares this summer, an area larger than the island of Mallorca. However, Grande-Marlaska said it is too early to give a final assessment of the damage. Fifteen wildfires remain active in northwestern Spain, mainly in the provinces of Zamora and Ourense. Despite lower temperatures in recent days, firefighting efforts continue to be hampered by strong winds.

This patrol has been making daily patrols throughout the park. In the first two days of operation, 4 fires were identified, which, according to the report, had been set by unscrupulous people. As of today, there are no active fires in the area.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Positive control results</emphasis><br/>The authorities have described the results of the control as \"highly positive\". This evaluation has led the Minister of Defense, Edmundo Novillo, together with the Vice-Minister of Civil Defense, Juan Carlos Calvimontes, and the military high command, to decide to extend the scope of the operation.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Joint and sustained operation</emphasis><br/>Based on these results, it has been decided that the patrolling will not only be carried out by the Air Force.

They all saw smoke coming out of a mountainous area and rushed to the place because of the risk of a forest fire.<br/>It was unfortunate for the firefighters to find a colleague resting in the lake of fire and outrageous for the owner of the neighboring field. For the police, there was no contemplation: the two offenders were detained and are now at the disposal of the courts to resolve their situation.<br/>The fire was surrounded by a stone fence. In the middle, there was the bonfire. However, nothing saves the firefighter involved from doing something that is forbidden by law, aggravated negligence due to his condition of firefighter.<br/>The two detainees reportedly indicated that they lit a fire to heat the kettle for drinking mate.<br/>The fire did not cause a fire. But the smoke caused an alert in a high-risk area.<br/>Clarification from the firehouse<br/>The Embalse Volunteer Fire Department informed that its personnel is now suspended.<br/>The local Volunteer Firefighters Association issued a communiqu\u00e9 in which it expresses:<br/>\"The Volunteer Fire Department of Embalse wishes to inform the community of an event that occurred in the morning of today, involving a member of our institution.<br/>In personal circumstances and out of service, the firefighter was on a fishing trip on the shore of the river with a friend, who lit a small fire on the shore.<br/>It is essential to clarify to the community that at no time was there any intention to start a forest fire, nor to deliberately violate current regulations. It was a reckless behavior, originated in a recreational context, which nevertheless falls under the provisions of Article 91 of the Code of Citizen Coexistence of the Provincial Law in force 10.326, in the Province of Cordoba, which is why police personnel intervened and the corresponding proceedings were carried out, leaving it at the disposal of the corresponding administrative authority.<br/>As an institution, we understand the seriousness of the legal and environmental framework in which we find ourselves, and therefore we have ordered the preventive suspension of the officer involved, in compliance with the provisions of the regulations of the Volunteer Firefighters of the Province of C\u00f3rdoba, until the summary is substantiated and his administrative and/or judicial situation is defined as appropriate.<br/>We reaffirm to society that the Embalse Volunteer Fire Department maintains an absolute commitment to fire prevention, unrestricted respect for the law and the protection of the environment. Likewise, we remind the importance of avoiding any kind of ignition, even with apparently harmless purposes, since every bonfire entails potential risks for our natural environment.<br/>Our institution will continue to work with transparency, responsibility and adherence to regulations, as it has historically done, in order to care for the community and the natural resources that surround us\".<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-72429595</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GKM-BP03-RSJC-S4B4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"595\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 26, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>main_url</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001614</classCode><className>SPORT FISHING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001811</classCode><className>VOLUNTEERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001932</classCode><className>CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp;

That is the proposal being considered for the Army's giant Chinooks, an idea that would represent <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a giant leap forward</emphasis> compared to current means. The difference is abysmal when compared to the Cougar helicopters currently used by the Air Mobile Forces (Famet), whose load capacity is limited to 1,800 liters.</p><p><br/>In fact, this initiative would completely transform the work of the Transport Helicopter Battalion V (Bheltra V), based in Colmenar Viejo (Madrid). These aircraft, the backbone of the Armed Forces' heavy transport, have never participated in firefighting missions. Their conversion would imply <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a change in their main mission</emphasis>, from transporting troops and material to becoming a shock force against the flames, an unprecedented role for them. This idea of adapting transport aircraft for new roles is a growing trend in the defense field, similar to that of multipurpose capabilities.<br/>However, the project runs up against an obstacle that is neither technical nor economic, but purely organizational. The real wall to overcome, according to , is the enormous logistical challenge that deployment would entail. Feasibility depends on a major restructuring that would require expanding the workforce with specialized personnel, intensifying training and adapting the entire support chain.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The hidden costs of new capacity</emphasis><br/>In addition to the organizational complexity, there is also the investment required. Although not the main constraint, the acquisition of helibuckets, popularly known as \"Bambi Buckets\", represents <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a considerable financial outlay</emphasis>. The price of each of these unloading devices ranges from 50,000 to 70,000 euros, a figure that must be taken into account in any budget planning. This outlay is in addition to other budgetary requirements for the modernization of the Armed Forces, as, for example, the to avoid becoming obsolete.<br/>Likewise, while this ambitious transformation is being studied, the Army is not standing still and is already working on <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">reinforcing existing resources</emphasis>. Regardless of the final decision on the Chinooks, short-term plans include increasing the fleet of Cougar helicopters dedicated to firefighting from the current three aircraft to a total of five in order to strengthen their support to civil society.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-73085990</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GRG-9T13-S0GH-P2JD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"400\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 13, 2025 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Defensa</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Espa\u00f1a</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Home La Raz\u00f3n</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N928110MM</classCode><className>ARMED FORCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST00097CN</classCode><className>ARMIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001965</classCode><className>SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp;
