Centuries of plowing, cutting, and overgrazing has made land less fertile. This has also released billions of tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HeavyFinance pays farmers to put some of this carbon back into the ground.</p><p>Specifically, the company issues loans to encourage the switch to regenerative farming practices. This includes rotating crops, growing cover crops during the off season, or plowing less often. These processes can remove carbon from the atmosphere and store it in the soil to arrive at a number.</p><p>TNW Conference - Are you an investor?

Price increase May 17.</p><p>Once farmers have transitioned to this new way of agriculture, HeavyFinance measures how much carbon they have stored. The company does this using satellite data and soil samples. It measures carbon levels in the soil before and after the changes.</p><p>In the case of Ukraine, local company Agsolco, will verify and issue the soil carbon credits. Companies or countries will buy these tokens as a way to offset their emissions.</p><p>The more carbon farmers pull from the atmosphere, the more money they can make. In war-torn Ukraine, this could provide a valuable income stream.</p><p>\"Switching to regenerative agriculture gives farmers the opportunity to improve their soil and store more carbon at the same time,\" said Laimonas Noreika, CEO and co-founder of HeavyFinance.</p><p>A growing market for soil carbon credits </p><p>In March, HeavyFinance secured \u20ac50mn in debt financing, with \u20ac20mn coming from the European Investment Fund (EIF). It has already added 250,000 hectares of land to its carbon farming programme, including countries such as Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Portugal.</p><p>The Lithuanian company is far from the only one betting big on soil carbon credits. Agreena, a soil carbon credit provider from Denmark, now has two million hectares of farmland under its management. Across the Atlantic, US-based Indigo has secured hundreds of millions of dollars for its own soil carbon marketplace.</p><p>Proponents say soil carbon credits offer a way to draw down CO2 and improve cash flow for struggling farmers. But some critics question the science behind it.</p><p>Issuing soil carbon credits relies on broad estimates of how much carbon has been stored. While technologies like satellites and drones are improving coverage, it's still unfeasible to take measurements of every single field or patch of soil. What's more, researchers still don't fully understand the science of how soils store and release carbon.</p><p>Nevertheless, buyers of soil carbon credits see them as a safer bet compared to forest offset credits, issued in exchange for protecting forests at risk of destruction. Issuers have come under mounting scrutiny for overinflating the value of these credits, causing many companies to stop purchasing them.</p><p>HeavyFinance estimates that applying regenerative practices across Ukraine's entire agricultural estate can reduce 757.7 million tonnes of CO2 emissions. This is equivalent to the total annual carbon output of Germany.</p><p>One of the themes of this year's TNW Conference is Sustainable Futures.

It means users will be able to search and book train journeys through Ecosia's website, powered by an API-integration with Omio's travel platform.</p><p>The booking platform will automatically pop up via a simple query search for trains, or for destinations where train travel is possible, say London to Paris. It will be available in 15 countries: the UK, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Nordics, North America and Canada, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and Ukraine.</p><p>The intention behind the new tool being rolled out this month is two-fold. Firstly, to make sustainable rail options more visible as an alternative to air travel. Secondly, all the commission Ecosia receives from successful bookings will go directly toward the search engine's green initiatives.</p><p>Note that this is not a form of offsetting, meaning that it is not intended to \"cancel out\" any carbon emissions produced by your journey (a popular but, let's face it, greenwashing tool employed by airlines during the booking process).</p><p>Catch up on our conference talks</p><p>Watch videos of our past talks for free with TNW All Access \u2192</p><p>Providers accessible through the new tool include Amtrak in the United States, LNER, GWR, Avanti in the UK, SNCF in France, OBB in Austria and Eurostar.</p><p>Born from the Berlin startup scene</p><p>In the land of internet searches, where one company is so synonymous with the activity that it has become a verb, you'd be forgiven for not having heard of Ecosia.
