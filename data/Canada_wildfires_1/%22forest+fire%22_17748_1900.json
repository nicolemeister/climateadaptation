ADDED May 2, 2024</p><p>TIMELINE</p><p>Mississauga council approved the city's automated speed enforcement (ASE) program as part of the 2020 budget, with the original launch date planned for September of that year.</p><p>City staff said delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the rollout of the program.</p><p>In May 2021, now former Ward 9 Coun. Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.</p><p>TICKETS</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.</p><p>As of Sept. 30, 2023, the city reported more than 58,000 tickets issued through the city's first two years of the ASE program.</p><p>PAST LOCATIONS</p><p>\\x95 (NEW: JULY 29, 2024) Alexandra Avenue, between Atwater Avenue and 4th Street in Ward 1</p><p>\\x95

Pat Saito successfully moved a motion to accelerate plans for more speed cameras in the city, boosting the program from two cameras to 22 by the end of the year.</p><p>The City of Mississauga's first two photo radar cameras became active July 5, 2021, with units in Malton and Erin Mills neighbourhoods.</p><p>City officials said they planned to activate the remaining 20 speed cameras by the end of 2021. According to a report from the city, all 22 were operational by April 2022.</p><p>TICKETS</p><p>City staff estimated in 2020 that 22 photo radar units would generate 160,000 charges annually.</p><p>According to a City of Mississauga news release, 495 speeding tickets came from the first two speed camera locations, Morning Star Drive and Sawmill Valley Drive, which were in place from July 5 to the first week of August 2021.</p><p>In an emailed statement, the city's road safety supervisor, Colin Patterson, wrote that Mississauga's photo-radar cameras issued another 4,827 speeding tickets between August and December of 2021.</p><p>As of June 3, 2022, the city reported 8,258 tickets had been issued in total for the program, but only around 25 per cent of the associated fines had been paid.</p><p>During that time, approximately 1,600 additional vehicles were caught speeding by the city's photo-radar units but were not ticketed due in part to a provincial requirement to issue fines within 30 days of the offence.</p><p>At least 23,000 tickets were issued through the photo-radar program in 2022.</p><p>As of Sept. 30, 2023, the city reported more than 58,000 tickets issued through the city's first two years of the ASE program.</p><p>PAST LOCATIONS</p><p>\\x95 (NEW: JULY 29, 2024) Alexandra Avenue, between Atwater Avenue and 4th Street in Ward 1</p><p>\\x95

Thousands of wildfires tore across enough land to cover Nova Scotia three times, or the city of Toronto 280 times, choking skies with smoke and prompting evacuations of communities.</p><p>Now, as focus shifts to next season, some have questioned whether Canada has the fleet of aerial water bombers it needs to keep up with longer, more intense wildfire seasons fuelled by climate change.</p><p>\"If we're not going to have supports for our crews for retention and recruitment issues, and we're not going to have the aircraft and equipment \u2026 then I think we're in a lot of trouble,\" said Davidson, a Red Lake, Ont.-based fire management technician who has been fighting wildfires out of Ontario for 10 years.</p><p>John Gradek, a lecturer in aviation management at McGill University, estimates almost half of the larger water bombers used to fight Canadian forest fires are nearing the end of their service life.</p><p>\"The time has come for us to look at how we fleeted our firefighting equipment for forest fires and rebuild a robust fleet,\" he said.</p><p>While certain provinces have expressed interest in replacing some of their more than 50-year-old models, one Canadian company making a large skimmer-style water bomber is reported to be backed up with orders from European countries until at least the end of the decade.</p><p>Fixed-wing water bombers \u2013 also known as air tankers \u2013 are often divided into two types: land-based tankers loaded up with water or fire retardant before takeoff or skimmer-style planes capable of scooping up thousands of litres from a body of water mid-flight.</p><p>Each province is responsible for its own wildland firefighting, creating a patchwork of approaches.</p><p>Ontario and Quebec have their own fleets, for example, while British Columbia contracts out aircraft. The Northwest Territories, which had to evacuate the capital city of Yellowknife and several other communities due to wildfires this year, have a mix of government-owned and long-term contracted aircraft.</p><p>British Columbia's Ministry of Forest said it's been renewing its fleet of 19 long-term contracted air tankers since 2020.</p><p>Ontario's Ministry of Natural Resources and Forests said the province has 20 fixed-wing aircraft to help fight wildfires, including nine large water bombers that are 24 years old on average. The other 11 smaller aircraft are an average of 53 and 55 years old.</p><p>\"The fleet is well-equipped for combating wildfires and supporting transportation in Ontario,\" said Melissa Candelaria, a spokesperson for Minister Graydon Smith.</p><p>A spokesperson for the Northwest Territories' department of Environment and Climate Change, meanwhile, said it would be assessing the need for additional local firefighting capacity given climate-driven changes to wildfire seasons.</p><p>The territory's typical fleet of 12 air tankers includes two large air tankers made in 1959, and two large skimmer-style aircraft in 1968 and 1970.</p><p>\"While it's tempting to focus on aircraft as it is the most visual and dramatic aspect of wildfire suppression, it is important to note this is only one part of a comprehensive suite of tools we use to manage wildfires,\" said Mike Westwick.</p><p>\"It's boots on the ground, assisted by heavy equipment, that play a key role in bringing wildfires under control or putting them out.\"</p><p>While Canada has a system in place to get aircraft and other firefighting resources to areas in need, the centre tasked with co-ordinating those requests said it faced pressures this year.</p><p>Too many provinces and territories were seeing heightened fire activity at the same time and there were \"very few aircraft\" available to lend to other agencies, said Jennifer Kamau, communications manager for the Canada Interagency Forest Fire Centre.</p><p>Mike Flannigan, a professor of wildland fire at Thompson Rivers University, said the unprecedented wildfire season highlighted the challenges that lie ahead.</p><p>\"It's only going to get more challenging with time as fires get more and more intense as our climate warms and more fuel vegetation is available to burn and it burns more intensely,\" said Flannigan.</p><p>\"Demand is only going to increase for firefighters, helicopters and water bomber skimmers \u2026 we will need to increase our resources strategically.\"</p><p>Quebec's forest fire protection agency said its fleet of 14 water bombers is enough to protect the southern parts of the province in most fire seasons. But agency director general \u00c9ric Rousseau said last month the fleet can get spread too thin when fires simultaneously threaten communities and hydroelectric infrastructure in more remote northern regions.</p><p>A breakdown of Quebec's fleet indicated four of those planes were more than 50 years old, while the others had been flying for between 25 and 30 years. Eight of the newer models were having their electronics upgraded at a cost of $50 million and Rousseau said he was in discussions with the province about eventually replacing the older planes.</p><p>That could pose an issue, however, with some new water bomber production reportedly spoken for by European countries through the end of the decade.</p><p>De Havilland Canada announced this year it would revive the Canadair water bomber program after production of the last CL-415 stopped in 2015. The company already signed letters of intent from European countries to purchase the first 22 of the new DHC-515.</p><p>The company has said it is running behind schedule and the first orders aren't expected before the 2027 wildfire season. The initial production run of 22 planes is expected to last into 2029 or 2030, the company had said in June.</p><p>The federal government has set aside $256 million over five years for a cost-sharing fund to help provinces and territories improve their firefighting capacity, including for aircraft.</p><p>Davidson, the Ontario fire management technician, said waiting years for new planes could test the limits of an aging fleet. And given the planes reportedly cost upwards of $30 million, he questioned whether provinces could keep up with the costs.</p><p>\"I think it's almost time to nationalize fire in this country,\" he said, an idea Gradek, the aviation management lecturer, and Flannigan, the wildland fire professor, also raised, though all acknowledged there would be hurdles.</p><p>Fire management is a provincial responsibility, raising jurisdictional questions, along with logistical issues such as where the planes would come from and how they would be paid for.</p><p>But a national fleet operating out of existing military bases and deployed to areas where extreme fires are forecast could make a difference, said Flannigan. He also pointed to examples of passenger jets being converted into water bombers as one way to bolster a fleet.</p><p>\"This is all stuff that would have to be sorted out,\" he said. \"It doesn't mean we shouldn't explore.\"</p><p>READ ALSO: Experts worry about Canadian water bomber expertise with rising demand, aging fleets</p><p>READ ALSO: In praise of the Martin Mars water bomber</p><p>Copyright 2023 Abbotsford News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABONWS-news20231222PAB4552709</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABONWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69XV-V2N1-JD2C-J30X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438205</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1342\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Group Ltd.

This district is about 30 km southwest of the community of Salluit, Quebec.</p><p>Notably, a statement said, these claims now 100% owned by MAX Power were staked in early February 2023 by a Shawn Ryan-led syndicate immediately after Orford Mining kicked off a staking rush with its 'Radiant Property' claims (126 sq. km) featuring \"abundant\" pegmatite dykes and \"unusually high\" lithium and cesium values in lake sediments in the 99th percentile for Quebec according to the Quebec government database.</p><p>Tuesday's statement added Nunavik, where exploration including MAX's just-launched field program are not affected by the forest fire situation impacting the James Bay district, covers the top third of Quebec and is drawing increasing interest for its high-grade lithium potential outside of the Cape Smith Belt prospective for nickel, gold and copper. Within this belt, underscoring Nunavik's geological potential, Glencore operates one of the world's premier nickel mines (Raglan) while privately-owned KoBold Metals, which recently raised US$195 million, is currently very active searching for battery metals.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MIDTCA-A2938105</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MIDTCA2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68NS-W251-F08T-K19W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">377441</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"231\"/><timeReceived>4:14 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 MT Newswires All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>MT Newswires Live Briefs INVESTOR Canada</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20458\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 11, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009SQW</classCode><className>PRIVATELY HELD COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0008YYT</classCode><className>GEOLOGY &amp; GEOPHYSICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X7V</classCode><className>MINES &amp; MINING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N210000CC</classCode><className>MINING &amp; EXTRACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N212234OM</classCode><className>NICKEL MINING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GS176</classCode><className>QUEBEC, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>ST000A2KN</classCode><className>ARCTIC OCEAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The Municipality of Red Lake has asked members of the community to evacuate the municipality as a precaution. At this point in time, all Battle North Gold Red Lake employees and contractors are safe and the Bateman Gold Project site is secured. The Company is monitoring the situation closely and will provide timely updates on any material developments to the situation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Exploration activities at the Project have been paused. Feasibility study work on the Project is conducted remotely, continues to advance unfettered and remains on track for completion in the second half of 2020.</p><p>About Battle North Gold Minerals Corporation</p><p>Battle North Gold is a Canadian gold mine developer led by an accomplished management team with successful underground gold mine operations, finance, and capital markets experience.

Wildfire mitigation can include\u00a0prescribed burning, forest\u00a0thinning, pruning and mechanical removal of vegetation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a statement on Tuesday, PAGC Grand Chief Brian Hardlotte called for increased vigilance and proactive strategies to protect First Nations in\u00a0northern parts of the province. He said these communities\u00a0not only face evacuation threats, but also rely heavily on the land for their way of life.</p><p>\"The prospect of a warmer wildfire season coupled with diminished snowfall underscores the necessity for preventive action to ensure the well-being of our communities. The protection of our territories and our people is paramount, and we cannot afford to be reactive,\" said Hardlotte, who\u00a0also\u00a0chairs the PAGC\u00a0wildfire task force.\u00a0</p><p/><p>The task force recently met\u00a0to deliberate on the wildfire threats that are anticipated for the upcoming season. It said there is critical risk posed by this year's reduced snowfall. The\u00a0Canadian\u00a0Forest Service also warns that\u00a0there is a high wildfire alert for 2024.</p><p>Cliff Buettner, director of forestry for the PAGC, said the council is prepared to take wildfire mitigation action earlier than usual this year, if necessary.\u00a0</p><p>\"The intent is to limit the amount of evacuations that we have. If we have people that are willing and able and capable and qualified in those communities, why would we not utilize that resource to protect the community?\" Buettner said.</p><p>The council has a First Nation forest fire protection services contract with the provincial government\u00a0that runs from\u00a02022 to 2027. It funds\u00a023 five-person wildfire crews across the PAGC area. PAGC protection services\u00a0also receives fire suppressing equipment and resources from Indigenous Services Canada.\u00a0</p><p>Buettner said Saskatchewan's wildfire season typically begins on April 1, but adds there is a possibility that it could get an early start\u00a0this year due to dry conditions.\u00a0</p><p>\"If the Saskatchewan Public Safety Agency chooses to start earlier and reflect that on any agreements that we have, we would definitely support it ... we would be fire ready,\" Buettner said.</p><p>The agency said in a statement that it has pledged to work closely with the PAGC.</p><p>\"We're aiming to reinforce our defences and encourage community-led initiatives in wildfire management and prevention. Working with PAGC is crucial. Together, we will strengthen our defences against the wildfire threat,\" said Steve Roberts, vice president of operations for the Saskatchewan Public Safety Agency.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Drought and soil conditions</emphasis></p><p>Next door, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-water-sharing-negotiations-rebecca-schulz-old-man-river-1.7100450\">Alberta has hinted </url>that it may have to declare an emergency\u00a0due to severe drought. John Pomeroy, Canada Research chair in water resources and climate change, said that while the majority of Saskatchewan has drought conditions, the situation isn't as worrisome as Alberta's - at least not yet.</p><p>\"Saskatchewan has Lake Diefenbaker, which is a much larger reservoir than anything Alberta has. And so Lake Diefenbaker can manage through more than one year [of] drought. Of course, how long depends on the severity of the drought,\" Pomeroy said.</p><p>It has been an incredibly\u00a0dry winter, with less snowfall than\u00a0usual, according to Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.\u00a0Pomeroy\u00a0said\u00a0some soil\u00a0has been capped with ice layers, which will\u00a0restrict further entry of snow, melt water or rainwater. This is a problem because the soil needs as much moisture as possible leading up\u00a0to wildfire season.</p><p/><p>But the mild winter has also meant that not all the soil is capped with ice.</p><p>\"[That soil] can still benefit from further snow, which is certain to occur this winter. And the stubble is now empty and\u00a0can trap more snow on the ground,\" said Pomeroy.</p><p>\"So, strangely, there's a bit of an advantage when the snow melts in midwinter in that we can now trap more snow with the stubble exposed above the ground and that could be beneficial to improving moisture status in the fields.\"</p><p>Pomeroy said Saskatchewan's drought is a wake-up call for those in agriculture.\u00a0</p><p>\"We need to make sure when we irrigate\u00a0-\u00a0particularly if we look at expanding irrigation\u00a0-\u00a0that we're doing so with the most up-to-date machinery so that it's efficient.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATCH / Fire mitigation efforts could start earlier this year:</emphasis></emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewscanadasaskatchewanprincealbertgrandcouncilsoundsalarmonwildfireseasonurgesearlymitigationmeasures17102176</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B7X-BJX1-F03F-K4C0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"753\"/><timeReceived>11:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 CBC/Radio-Canada.

Of those 53, there were 34 fires before May 1, compared to only two in the same time period in 2022.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, it doesn't mean this summer's forest fire probability will continue on this trajectory, says Jeff Motty, supervisor of forest insect disease and fire control for Newfoundland and Labrador.</p><p>\"Our snow pack disappeared really quickly, and when that water is melted and gone through the system, gone out to the ocean, that really increases the the risk of wildfire within the forested areas,\" he said.</p><p>\"It's hard to say what that will mean for the summer. It could mean we have more fire activity, but we could be in a position where, you know, we get a really wet June, which is what I'm hoping for.\"</p><p>Motty and his team are always assessing the risk of wildfires throughout the province. They meet daily to address conditions, and position firefighting resources in the area where probability is high.\u00a0</p><p>\"We're constantly making sure that we're doing everything in our power to be ready in case the call comes.\"</p><p>In 2022, the island portion of the province experienced the worst forest fires in decades as three separate fires burned in central Newfoundland during a dry, hot period.</p><p>Triggered by lightning strikes, the fires started July 24 and led to temporary closure of the highway connecting towns along the Connaigre Peninsula to the rest of the province. Some communities were left in a state of emergency, and food and supplies had to be flown in by helicopter.</p><p>Looking back, Motty says the incident could have been a lot worse.</p><p>\"We had an incident management team on that fire within 24 hours and we found that to be a truly effective way to move forward,\" he said. \"A quick engagement of that incident management team right off the bat really helped us as a province.\"</p><p>He said the dry weather following the lightning had a profound effect on how quickly and fast those fires moved toward\u00a0communities.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shared resources</emphasis></p><p>In Alberta this week, the dry weather is helping fuel the 94 wildfires already burning across the province.</p><p>A temperamental forecast in the days ahead is expected to escalate the risk of extreme fire behaviour and make conditions even more dangerous. About 20,000 people have been forced from their homes, and at least 36 communities were under threat from the flames.\u00a0</p><p>Warmer weather year-round is not helping, says Motty.\u00a0</p><p>WATCH\u00a0| The CBC's Troy Turner describes a busy start to fire season in Newfoundland and Labrador: </p><p>\"Climate change from one year to the next, the biggest impact I'm seeing is that the starting of the wildfire seasons [is] earlier and extension into the fall seems to be more of a thing you can bank on year to year,\" he said.</p><p>As members of the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, each province shares resources when needed in another jurisdiction. Motty says personnel have been moving in and out of the province each summer as a result. Since no two forest fire seasons are the same, he says it wouldn't be possible to hire the exact staff needed to fight fires in each individual province, and the program of sharing firefighting resources works well.</p><p>\"No one agency can have enough wildfire fighting resources to combat really bad fire seasons like we had last year,\" he said. \"So all of Canada is now mobilizing resources to Alberta and we're looking to see how we can help out as well. We will help out whenever we can, and when required ... we know when we have our bad day, we can count on our neighbouring provinces.\"</p><p>The province has also stepped up its efforts to help prevent wildfires, says Motty, focusing on educating the public.\u00a0It's also working with FireSmart Canada, a national program aimed to help people \"increase neighbourhood resilience\" to fires.</p><p>Some tips include removing dead leaves, barbecues and firewood from areas around people's homes, to cleaning out gutters and keeping vents screened to prevent embers from entering the home.</p><p>\"When a wildfire happens and\u00a0we're actively fighting the wildfires, we don't need to switch the homes at the same time. So anything that you can do in advance as a homeowner also helps us in the situation as a whole.</p><p>\"We always want homeowners and the general public to be educated about the risk of wildfire and all of them to really know that there's a shared responsibility. And everyone has a responsibility to protect themselves, their homes, their communities, their structures, their cabins in advance of wildfires.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/nl\">Read more articles from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBCNES-httpswwwcbccanewscanadanewfoundlandlabradorwildfiresnl16846769</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBCNES2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69S1-5R51-JCMC-W3F1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"807\"/><timeReceived>8:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 CBC/Radio-Canada.

More than 15 million hectares have been burned so far this year by almost 5,800 fires, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre Inc.</p><p>Nadja Dreff and Marcos Alvarez at DBRS Morningstar estimated in a reportthis week that total wildfire-related insured losses in Canada for the third quarter of 2023 will be between $700 million and $1.5 billion, which they called \u201cmanageable\u201d for insurers.</p><p>\u201cHowever, the wildfire season is not yet over and there is the potential for any of the fires to intensify and further pressure Q3 2023 results, especially if the fires affect densely populated regions, economic hubs, or key infrastructure. Larger and more frequent weather-related losses will continue to pressure property insurance prices higher in the near term,\u201d they said.</p><p>Historically, wildfire damage has been a lot less common than flooding, said Kathryn Bakos, director of climate finance and science at the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation.</p><p>But when it does happen, it tends to be significantly worse on average in terms of damage, she said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re seeing this right now in Kelowna, with the fires in Northwest Territories. When you have a wildfire event, you have catastrophic loss of the home,\u201d she said.</p><p>The 2016 Fort McMurray fire is perhaps the best example of this.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDAVCT-news20230826RDA0003822444</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RDAVCT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:691H-S3G1-JD2C-J519-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464632</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"314\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

(the Company or Patriot) provides this update on its work programs and the impact of the current forest fire situation in Quebec the Companys operations. The Company commenced the 2023 summer-fall drill and surface exploration programs in late May at its wholly owned Corvette Property (the Property or Project), located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of Quebec.</p><p>The 2023 summer-fall exploration includes both a drill and surface exploration program which commenced at the Property in late May. The multi-rig drill program is targeting further delineation of the CV5 and CV13 pegmatites, as well as drill testing of other previously identified spodumene pegmatite clusters (i.e., CV4, CV8-12, CV9, and CV10). The surface program comprises mapping of the known spodumene pegmatite clusters and local trends as well as prospecting and rock sampling across a large portion of the remaining 20+ km of prospective lithium pegmatite trend.</p><p>The recent restrictions imposed by the Quebec government, as a result of the regional forest fire situation, is directly impacting our exploration operations and, therefore, the Company has temporarily ceased drilling and surface exploration field activities until the situation improves. The Company continues to process drill core from holes completed at the Property in May 2023 as well as advance the exploration camp construction activities. The Company is actively monitoring the situation to ensure all Company activities are compliant with respective governmental decrees and to ensure the safety of personnel associated with the Property. The Company will provide further updates as information becomes available.</p><p>About Patriot Battery Metals Inc.</p><p>Patriot Battery Metals Inc. is a hard-rock lithium exploration company focused on advancing its district-scale 100% owned Corvette Property located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of Quebec, Canada. The Corvette Property is one of the largest and highest-grade hard rock lithium projects being explored, with over 50 kilometres of strike length over a 214 square kilometre land package and over 70 lithium bearing pegmatite outcrops identified to date.</p><p>The Corvette Property is situated proximal to the all-weather Trans Taiga Road and Hydro-Qubec power line infrastructure in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of Quebec. The Property hosts significant lithium potential highlighted by the CV5 Pegmatite, which has been traced by drilling over a strike length of at least 3.7 km with spodumene pegmatite encountered as deep as 425 m vertical depth.</p><p>For further information, please contact us at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:info@patriotbatterymetals.com\">info@patriotbatterymetals.com</email> or by calling +1 (604) 279-8709,or visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.patriotbatterymetals.com\">www.patriotbatterymetals.com</url>.

The RCMP and Coroner\u2019s Office have been contacted, the territory noted.</p><p>Fort Liard Mayor Genevieve McLeod said word started circulating in the community late Saturday afternoon that there had been an accident.

A lot of them are actually fighting fires outside their own communities,\" Davey-Quantick said, noting the territory provides a lot of training.</p><p>\"There's a huge amount of respect for firefighters because we know they're protecting our communities, and they're protecting and keeping us safe.\"</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 16, 2023.</p><p>-- By Rob Drinkwater in Edmonton</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-4c5c220bbba842d486f9bfe68f29fdfc</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68R1-B8D1-JBVR-3042-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"670\"/><timeReceived>06:51 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 16, 2023 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It has said this year's wildfire season is the worst on record. </p><p>Meanwhile, the province's natural resources minister said Tuesday that many Quebecers may have to celebrate the province's F\u00eate nationale holiday this weekend without fireworks. </p><p>Ma\u00eft\u00e9 Blanchette V\u00e9zina said that a ban on outdoor fires \u2014 in effect across most of the province north of the St. Lawrence River \u2014 includes fireworks.</p><p>\"It's important to understand that it would be sad and harmful if fireworks set off other fires that could get out of control,\" she told reporters in Quebec City. </p><p>The province's national holiday, also known as St-Jean-Baptiste Day, is on June 24 and often celebrated with fireworks and bonfires.</p><p>Blanchette V\u00e9zina asked the public \u2014 as well as municipalities organizing F\u00eate nationale or Canada Day celebrations \u2014 to be prudent. </p><p>\"The last thing we want is for the celebrations to contribute to worsening the forest fire situation in Quebec,\" she said. </p><p>In Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon, Mayor Guy Lafreni\u00e8re described smoky conditions as \"intense\" and said people should protect themselves with N95 masks.</p><p>\"For citizens who have health conditions that could be aggravated by the presence of smoke, it is strongly recommended to wear an N95 mask and, if it's possible for you, to go somewhere where there may be less smoke,\" he said Tuesday in a video posted on the town's Facebook page. </p><p>Residents of the town should be prepared to leave again if the wildfire situation worsens, Lafreni\u00e8re said. </p><p>A large fire near the community was moving toward the main road that connects the city to southern Quebec, Lafreni\u00e8re said, adding that firefighters hoped a river would act as a natural firebreak and prevent the blaze from reaching the road. But he said the situation was concerning because no rain was expected before the weekend. </p><p>\"It will absolutely take rain to help the forest firefighters,\" he said. \"It's the only way, it's really the rain that will make a difference in our case.\"</p><p>Environment Canada has issued a smog warning for the city and for the neighbouring Abitibi-T\u00e9miscamingue region, which includes Val-d'Or.</p><p>Peter Kimbell, a warning preparedness meteorologist at Environment Canada, said the smog in northwestern Quebec is being caused by wildfires. The area has received significantly less precipitation this month than have other parts of the province, he added. </p><p>For comparison, he said, Sherbrooke, Que., in the Eastern Townships, has received close to 100 millimetres of rain this month, while Val-d'Or has received four millimetres. </p><p>\"It's very dry up there and, therefore, any lightning activity could definitely trigger more fires,\" he said. </p><p>Significant rain may come next week, Kimbell said, though scattered thunderstorms were in the forecast for the weekend in parts of the region.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 20, 2023.</p><p>\u2014 With files from Marie-\u00c8ve Martel in Montreal. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-1ac3e1f6d7dc4c338663c8c1d4887be0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68HG-3WY1-DY9S-T3X0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"604\"/><timeReceived>06:10 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 20, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In July, a fire north of the Ingraham Trail threatened to burn down the lodge on Duncan Lake,\u00a0which is about 50 kilometres northeast of Yellowknife.\u00a0</p><p>Fortunately the lodge was saved, following a successful backburn operation\u00a0to protect the property. Fire crews then turned it into a base of operations.\u00a0</p><p>That's actually when the most damage happened - Gin said one of the N.W.T. firefighters accidentally set his fish smoker on fire.\u00a0</p><p>\"That almost took out the lodge,\" he said. \"I was pissed and the incident commander flew out to talk to me about the incident, and we sat down and had a discussion about training and respect.\"\u00a0</p><p>Gin said it was one of a handful of incidents where local fire crews \"were not very respectful.\"\u00a0</p><p>He ultimately requested they be removed.\u00a0</p><p>\"After that, they put in some pretty good folks from other parts of Canada and we had no problems,\" said Gin.</p><p/><p>Mike Westwick, an N.W.T. fire information officer, said his agency\u00a0was aware of \"an incident involving a cooking device which was accidentally damaged\" and that it agreed to replace it.</p><p>\"First and foremost, we deeply appreciate the support Yellow Dog Lodge provided to firefighting operations in the area,\" said Westwick.\u00a0</p><p>He said no other issues were raised about crew behaviour.\u00a0</p><p>\"The highest level of conduct is expected of our teams and when concerns arise, we use the appropriate tools within the employment contract to correct behaviour,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p>Crews were set up at the lodge until Sept. 1.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Backburn saves property\u00a0</emphasis></p><p>Other than the fish smoker scare, Gin says there's been minimal damage to the property.\u00a0</p><p>He attributes that to the backburn - though it was a little too close for comfort.\u00a0</p><p>With fire retardant in place and sprinkler systems set up, Gin said crews \"set the whole hillside on fire, which is only about 30 metres from the lodge.\"\u00a0</p><p>He added that it was a \"very scary and very sad\" experience, but the team doing the backburn was \"excellent\" and he appreciates the efforts to save the property.</p><p>That includes a memorial for his nephew who died\u00a0when he was 14.\u00a0</p><p>\"That really made my heart feel good when they did everything in their power to save what was valuable to us,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p>Westwick said four structures burned as a result of fires ZF 011 and ZF 012, north of the Ingraham Trail.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Insurance struggles</emphasis></p><p>Now, Gin says that lack of physical damage to the property is actually working against him.\u00a0</p><p>Overall, he estimates\u00a0the lodge has lost about $180,000 in revenue this summer due to the wildfires and evacuations.\u00a0</p><p>Despite having business interruption insurance, Gin said the response from his insurer has been \"disheartening.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"They told me ... that I would have had to lose some property and some assets here before the insurance would kick in, which to me was ludicrous because of the disruption of the smoke and the transportation, as well as the forest fire being 30 metres away,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p/><p>\"There's nobody in their right mind that would have hosted any guest, just because of safety -\u00a0and the insurance company has balked a little bit.\"</p><p>The fire has left scars on the landscape; Gin says it burned a picnic area and a number of trails need to be cleared again.\u00a0</p><p>\"So there is a loss, maybe not a physical loss to the property as such, but there is a loss because we can't do a lot of the activities that we used to do,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'A season like this really has to weigh on my mind'</emphasis></p><p>Gin and his wife, Kathy, have owned the lodge since 2005.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's been one of the toughest seasons I've ever been part of,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p>Constantly knowing there's a fire at your doorstep\u00a0led to high staff turnover.

He said people wound up hiding in their attics to get away from the water.</p><p>\u201cWe made our case, we told people what they needed to do and they chose otherwise,\u201d Gualtieri said. He added that his deputies tried overnight to reach those who had been trapped, but it just wasn\u2019t safe.</p><p>\u201cI was out there personally. We tried to launch boats, we tried to use high-water vehicles and we just met with too many obstacles,\u201d Gualtieri said. He said the death toll could rise as emergency crews go door-to-door in the flooded areas to see if anyone remains.</p><p>Multiple people are trapped in 115 heavily damaged buildings in Valdosta</p><p>ATLANTA \u2014 Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp gave staggering numbers to describe the early damage from Helene Friday morning: 1 million meters without power, 1,300 traffic signals out of commission, 1,100 people in shelters across the state, 152 road closures and 2 interstate closures.

It hit further east on the coast Monday as a Category 3 hurricane.</p><p>The flooding is so bad in Acapulco \u2014 which still hasn\u2019t recovered from Hurricane Otis last October \u2014 that the head of the municipal civil defense agency said authorities were starting to use boats inside the city to rescue people from low-lying neighborhoods. Residents posted videos and photos of cars floating away in floodwaters, and people rescued from raging waters using lifelines.</p><p>\u201cWe are getting boats to start carrying out more effective evacuations,\u201d Efr\u00e9n Valdez, civil protection coordinator for Acapulco, told the Milenio Television station. \u201cThe situation is very complicated.\u201d</p><p>Several Ballad Health facilities closed across multiple states</p><p>NASHVILLE \u2014 In northeast Tennessee, Unicoi County Hospital was closed Friday due to the weather and its 11 patients were being moved to other hospitals, according to parent company Ballad Health.

Bricks, plywood and twisted metal covered the grass outside, exposing old lamps, cabinets and other knickknacks in the store\u2019s inventory.</p><p>Many shops and businesses along the tree limb-covered sidewalks of the downtown area appeared unscathed. But a few had shattered storefront windows and mangled awnings.</p><p>Electricity was out across the city and traffic moved slowly on many roads, with stoplights blacked out and trees blocking several streets.</p><p>\u2018My neighbors across the street got the full brunt of all of it\u2019</p><p>ATLANTA \u2014 Stacy Quiros noticed early indications of flooding at her home in Hanover West, a neighborhood in north Atlanta, when she woke up Friday morning. She and her husband went to their basement to move important items to higher ground before it took on four inches of water.</p><p>Across the street, on lower ground, she pointed out underwater mailboxes and cars with just their roofs peeking out to an Associated Press journalist.

What started as a \u201clittle puddle\u201d swelled to ankle-high flooding at his ankles within 30 minutes, so he gathered some of his valuables to bring to his neighbor\u2019s upstairs.</p><p>At its peak, the water rose to his calves, the 25-year-old painter said, meaning he has furniture that\u2019s damaged, unfinished art submerged underwater and paint bubbling formed on his walls.</p><p>\u201cIt could\u2019ve been a lot worse,\u201d he said. Still, \u201cI was so sad, it\u2019s my first apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhysical stuff can be replaced but just to see the state of my first home, submerged in water,\u201d he said, looking back as brown water rushed downstream. \u201cThis is my baby.\u201d</p><p>Iconic lake from \u201cDirty Dancing\u201d overtops the North Carolina dam holding it back</p><p>RUTHERFORDTON, N.C. \u2014 Waters in the iconic lake used to film scenes from the movie \u201cDirty Dancing\u201d are overtopping the dam holding them back in North Carolina.</p><p>Emergency officials in Rutherford County have started evacuating people downstream from Lake Lure and are sounding emergency sirens.</p><p>Water has been periodically released from the dam this week, but there has been too much rain to keep up, officials said.</p><p>Authorities did not indicate if the dam itself was in danger.</p><p>Lake Lure was transformed into upstate New York\u2019s Catskill Mountains for several of the scenes in the 1987 film, including the dance scene where actor Patrick Swayze lifts Jennifer Grey out of the water.</p><p>Florida airports will reopen as state inspectors work to clear roadways</p><p>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 Airports in Florida that closed due to Hurricane Helene will be reopened on Friday, and inspectors were out examining bridges and causeways along the Gulf Coast to get them back open to traffic quickly, the state\u2019s transportation secretary said.</p><p>Airports in Tampa, St. Pete, Lakeland and Tallahassee planned to reopen for flights, and 2,000 miles of roadway have been cleared of debris so far, Jared Perdue, secretary of the Florida Department of Transportation, said Friday morning at a Tallahassee news conference.</p><p>\u201cSome of the causeways were underwater, so we have to inspect them and make sure they are safe to pass,\u201d Perdue said. \u201cWe had a lot of storm surge up and down the west coast. We had a lot of roads underwater.\u201d</p><p>A late-night evacuation in Atlanta with a newborn</p><p>ATLANTA \u2014 A neighbor knocking woke Marcus Benson on Thursday night after the rain outside \u2014 and exhaustion from a newborn baby \u2014 had lulled him to sleep. The water level was inching closer to the front door of their apartment, about eight steps up from ground level and high enough that he decided it was time to evacuate.</p><p>Benson said it took focus to get himself, his wife and his three-month-old baby through a flooded parking lot to get to the other side of their Atlanta apartment complex.</p><p>\u201cYou have your son in your arms above water trying to keep him up and you just push and try to get to safety,\u201d Benson said.</p><p>Benson doesn\u2019t know the status of his family\u2019s home but is glad they are safe.</p><p>Now they just have to \u201clet Mother Nature take its course,\u201d the Atlanta native said, adding that his hometown\u2019s \u201creally changed as far as weather\u2019s concerned.\u201d</p><p>Georgia Power expects outages to rise</p><p>ATLANTA \u2014 Kim Greene, the CEO of Georgia Power Co. told reporters Friday she feared outages would continue to rise for the 2.6 million customers of Georgia\u2019s only private electrical utility.</p><p>\u201cAll of that rain is leading to very saturated ground, and trees, unfortunately, will continue to fall,\u201d Greene told reporters during a news conference in Atlanta. \u201cSo we do expect the number of outages to continue to rise. I assure you that we want to get your power back on just as safely and as quickly as possible.\u201d</p><p>A Florida congregation must rebuild again after Helene</p><p>PERRY, Fla. \u2014 The congregation at Potter\u2019s House Ministries church in Perry, Florida, was just weeks away from moving back into their newly renovated sanctuary after rebuilding in the wake of last year\u2019s Hurricane Idalia. Then Hurricane Helene peeled back the brand-new roof, scattering sheets of aluminum across the church grounds.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really heartbreaking,\u201d said parishioner Stephen Tucker, moved to tears as he surveyed the damage the morning after Helene made landfall. \u201cI know it\u2019s in God\u2019s will for this to happen. And it\u2019s by the grace of God that we\u2019re still here.\u201d</p><p>Tucker said it\u2019s been one blow after another for the community he\u2019s lived in all of his 51 years \u2014 a one, two, three punch from Idalia last August, then Debby a year later and now Helene, all making landfall within about 30 miles (48 kilometers) of each other in one county in this rural stretch of Florida\u2019s Big Bend.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like it never stops,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy Taylor County?\u201d</p><p>Multiple hospitals without power in south Georgia</p><p>ATLANTA \u2014 Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said multiple hospitals in south Georgia are without power after Helene knocked out both their primary power and their generators.</p><p>Kemp said trees had fallen densely in the eastern part of the state.</p><p>\u201cWe know we still have people trapped in homes that we\u2019re trying to cut our way into right now,\u201d Kemp told Fox News.</p><p>\u201cWe have a lot of resources that we have on the ground already,\u201d Kemp added. \u201cWe\u2019re calling up additional National Guard, and we\u2019re going to throw everything we got at it.\u201d</p><p>Kemp said wind damage is less severe in metro Atlanta.</p><p>\u201cThe storm really stayed straight or either moved to the east a little bit, which spared some of our state from being on the dirty side of the storm. So if there\u2019s any blessing in disguise, that\u2019s probably it.\u201d</p><p>\u2018We\u2019re blessed it's still standing'</p><p>VALDOSTA, Ga. \u2014 The hurricane\u2019s winds stripped away the siding from the steeple in front of Union Cathedral in Valdosta, Georgia, exposing its metal frame and littering the parking lot with shredded foam and plaster.</p><p>The storm also smashed plate glass windows by the front doors. Inside the entryway, the floor was strewn with thick glass shards, religious booklets and offering envelopes.</p><p>Pastor Wade McCrae, who preaches to 250 congregants in person most Sundays with hundreds more watching online, said the sanctuary was undamaged. Deacons were running errands to bring plywood and tools to cover the broken window. McCrae hoped to be able to hold services this Sunday.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re blessed it\u2019s still standing,\u201d he said.</p><p>20 people in Atlanta rescued overnight by firefighters</p><p>ATLANTA \u2014 Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens tells reporters that firefighters rescued about 20 people overnight from cars or apartments imperiled by swiftly rising floodwaters.</p><p>Residents in Florida\u2019s Big Bend region wake up to widespread power outages</p><p>PERRY, Fla. \u2014 Residents of Florida\u2019s Big Bend region woke up to widespread power outages Friday morning after Hurricane Helene made landfall overnight near the mouth of the Aucilla River.</p><p>Helene slammed ashore in the largely rural stretch of Florida as a Category 4 hurricane, becoming the third hurricane to batter that swath of the state in a little over a year.</p><p>As the sun rose over U.S. Highway 27 outside of Perry, cars dodged and weaved among downed pine trees that blocked portions of the road, some ensnarled in power lines. Emergency workers were already on hand clearing debris before 8 am. The air smelled of pine needles and fresh wood \u2014 from the staggering trees shattered by the storm, some snapped in half like toothpicks.</p><p>Here\u2019s the latest on Hurricane Helene</p><p>Authorities rescued people trapped by floodwaters and more than 3 million customers were in the dark across much of the southeastern U.S. as Hurricane Helene weakened to a tropical storm over Georgia early Friday after making landfall overnight in northwestern Florida as a Category 4 storm.</p><p>Helene came ashore amid warnings from the National Hurricane Center that the enormous system could create a \u201cnightmare\u201d storm surge. There were at least four storm-related deaths.</p><p>Video on social media sites showed sheets of rain coming down in Perry, Florida, near where Helene made landfall, and siding being torn off buildings. One local news station showed a home that had flipped over. The community and much of surrounding Taylor County were without power.</p><p>\u25b6 Catch up on what happened overnight with Hurricane Helene</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-da2a21fffc82a31305cc436cf07f6739</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D2M-JCK1-JBVR-34GG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8257\"/><timeReceived>08:46 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"09\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>September 27, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It enumerates actions seen in key areas of the TSS Climate Action Plan 2.0, which came out in 2021, noting some areas of tangible progress and others where \"the student\"needs to make more effort. TSS notes that while impactful work has been done in a number of areas, \"like transportation electrification, forest stewardship, and food and agriculture, it is clear that we are not ready for the multiplying threats that come with the accelerating impacts of climate change.\"</p><p>Every needed change costs money, of course. While most people don't like the thought of taxes going up for just about any purpose, transitioning a fleet used by a local government service to electric power is a worthwhile use of taxpayers'funds. Any government body that uses vehicles to function should be purchasing ones powered by electricity rather than gasoline or diesel fuels. In the case of the CRD, and our local school board when it comes to buying electric buses, decision-makers have rightly chosen electric, despite the higher cost to us.</p><p>TSS also handles rebate programs to encourage people to add a water storage system to their property and to install a heat pump or an ultra-efficient wood stove. Making those kinds of changes are just one of the things the TSS report card touts as possible for individuals to do in order to combat and adapt to climate change.</p><p>But some areas require much more than individual or local government action. It's clear from the TSS-led Climate Adaptation Research Lab project in the Maxwell Lake watershed and the recently released CRD Electoral Area Wildfire Exposure Maps that some parts of the island are at high risk of devastation by wildfire. TSS frequently mentions how human resources are needed to remove fallen trees and branches that create forest fire fuel, and take other alteration measures, but who would fund those actions \u2014 which need to be undertaken on private property in many cases to be fully effective \u2014 is a huge question to be answered. That kind of change requires far more commitment and resources than the purchase of an electric truck for park maintenance activities, but that higher level is what we must support in order to minimize and adapt to the inevitable onslaught of climate change.</p><p>THE ISSUE: TSS climate action report card WE SAY: More work to do at all levels</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUDFWD-news20231011PGWA0003934244</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUDFWD2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69CJ-CYX1-JD2C-J00J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484148</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"398\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Our analysis shows that without a rapid phase out of fossil fuels, the risks to global health will be exacerbated further, as thousands of hospitals become unable to deliver services during crises,\" said Dr Karl Mallon, Director of Science and Technology, XDI (Cross Dependency Initiative).</p><p>The 2023 XDI Global Hospital Infrastructure Physical Climate Risk Report analyses the physical risk to over 200,000 hospitals around the world to six climate change hazards: coastal inundation, riverine flooding, surface water flooding, forest fire, extreme wind and cyclone wind. The analysis focuses on physical damage to building structures, and calculates how different emission scenarios can reduce risk.</p><p>As part of the report, XDI is releasing the names, location and level of risk (high, medium, low) for each individual hospital in the analysis (200,216 hospitals). XDI is urging all governments to check for high risk hospitals in their region and conduct further analysis to understand and reduce this risk.</p><p>Key findings </p><p> Without a rapid phase out of fossil fuels, up to 1 in 12 hospitals worldwide will be at high risk of total or partial shutdown from extreme weather events by the end of the century - a total of 16,245 hospitals. A residential or commercial building with this level of risk would be considered uninsurable.71% (11,512) of high risk hospitals by 2100 will be in low and middle income countries.Limiting global warming to 1.8 degreescelsius with a rapid phase out of fossil fuels would halve the damage risk to hospital infrastructure compared to a high emissions scenario.South East Asia has the highest percentage of hospitals at high risk of damage from extreme weather events in the world. With high emissions, almost 1 in 5 hospitals (18.4%) in South East Asia will be at high risk of total or partial shutdown by the end of the century.South Asia has the highest number of hospitals at risk.Hospitals located on coastlines and near rivers are most at risk.</p><p>\"Governments have a duty to populations to ensure the ongoing delivery of critical services. We urge all governments and health administrators to review this report and identify high risk hospitals in their jurisdiction so that they can take appropriate action,\" said Dr Mallon.</p><p>About XDIThe data behind XDI (Cross Dependency Initiative) has been helping global leaders price physical climate risk since 2007, making the group the world's longest standing independent specialist in physical climate risk and adaptation analytics.

I don\u2019t take orders from them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I\u2019m speaking in the collective \u201cme\u201d and \u201cI\u201d during this discussion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Before going on, let me sincerely and strenuously praise our heroic, well-trained and deeply dedicated forest fire fighters (structure, airport, all firefighters). You are genuine heroes. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is about the BC Wildfire Service\u2019s leaders, and, more precisely, the leaders of those leaders (and probably a few paper-whipped lawyers).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The message is blunt. If I want to go fight a forest fire on my land, or Crown land (which, it bears reminding, I/we own), or if I\u2019m invited by my neighbour to their land, or I want to bring a sandwich and jug of fuel to those who are in the fight, then the job of the BC Wildfire Service (BCWS) is to clap their hands and roll out the welcome mat.</p><p>Until the day the BCWS is so rich in personnel that no wildfire grows bigger than a ball diamond, anyone who wants to help out ought to be gratefully applauded by our under-resourced government crews.</p><p>Obviously, misuse of equipment or disruption of a scene by a non-professional (or professional) is not acceptable. But disallowing volunteers or paid amateurs to step in is worse by far.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that long ago that a forest fire could trigger conscription:random people ordered off the street by law to come help. Trained leaders were in place to instruct these rookies on how to handle an axe, hose, pulaski, etc.on the fire line. If things were too dangerous in one spot, they were moved to other support duties.</p><p>Loggers and farmers were also hired en masse, because it was their livelihood going up in smoke. They had heavy equipment, hand tools, a knowledge of the forest, and motivation.</p><p>Perhaps conscription is too far the other way, but what\u2019s not acceptable is this true story from this year\u2019s fire season:A hardworking B.C. farmer, doing nothing wrong and everything normally, accidentally caught some crops on fire due to an equipment malfunction. The fire quickly got into the adjacent forest. A few phone calls later, a small army of neighbours arrived and they went to work putting it out. They were succeeding.</p><p>To their surprise, a crew arrived from the BCWS. There was rejoicing that skilled helpers were joining them. But no. That small band of entitled stumpheads ordered, on threat of arrest, all the neighbours to back off as they imposed themselves alone. The neighbours, aghast and agog, felt bullied into compliance, but stayed on. Good thing they did. Once the BCWS crew pronounced the scene secure and rolled away, the fire sprang up again. The neighbours completed the job properly. (I still don\u2019t blame the firefighters, who were only acting on orders with the scant resources afforded by government, including that key tool called time.)</p><p>Another farmer in another B.C. location dealing with a different fire was driving up to her house not far from the flames. She was well into her elder years and lived alone. She came upon a fire crew blocked by a tree that had fallen across the road. Why, she asked them, were they not dispatching the obstruction and getting on with the firefight? She was told they were not authorized to operate a chainsaw in this situation. (Whomever crafted such a policy ought to be flown out of the province on the next water bomber.) The old woman huffed, went to the woodshed, grabbed her own chainsaw, and cut the tree off the road herself as the \u201ccertified\u201d athletic 20-somethings all watched. The public took it as yet another sign that of course they had to stay and defend their property, in the face of such bad leadership (written and field) of perfectly capable professionals.</p><p>It also signalled that trivial policies were now overwhelming obviously greater imparatives.</p><p>Similar examples are what created confrontational scenarios like this week\u2019s supply convoy in the Shuswap threatening to plow through the BCWS roadblocks to bring needed aid to residents inside the wildfire zone in that part of the province. It was terrible behaviour meeting with terrible behaviour.</p><p>It\u2019s what prompted near vi-olence in 2018 at the Francois Lake ferry terminal when authorities were blocking diesel destined for heavy equipment, and cattle liners destined for livestock rescue, from going into that active fire zone, as friends and neighbours on the north side tried to save the day for defiant residents on the south side from fires the government had unequivocally failed at handling. A snack truck was even refused entry to resupply the Takysie Lake convenience store because, the driver was told, \u201cwe don\u2019t want (people defying evacuation orders) to be too comfortable.\u201d</p><p>These people knew what they were doing, where they were going, and how to be safe in the process. How do we know? Because they circumnavigated the ferry checkpoint and safely accomplished their many missions of mercy despite the uniforms working against them.</p><p>Incidentally, the RCMP are being unjustly thrust into the middle of these confrontations, forced to do the dirty work of government officials lost in their own woods. Did you know Mounties were dispatched to the neighbours in that Francois Lake southcountry, that year, demanding dental records from the residents who defied evacuation orders so they could be identified after their burned bodies were found? What ghastly scare tactics to use on people doing everything within their rights. No one suffered a scratch, incidentally, and the only homes that burned in that area that year were unattended.</p><p>It\u2019s what backed Cariboo-Chilcotin First Nations community leaders into positions of anger against any government actors coming into their territory in 2017 thinking they would expel them from wildfire lines as they protected their territories.</p><p>The B.C. government pronouncing themselves the supreme and exclusive authorities to fight forest fires ignores the fact that many people have their own firefighting expertise, and what that might be is none of your damn business. It\u2019s ok to use whatever you\u2019ve got, from certification to enthusiasm, and that\u2019s especially true in rural areas where people are more prone to such complementary experiences, and where there is more real estate space to put up an effective fire fight.</p><p>It\u2019s not about \u201ccivilians\u201d pretending to be equal to a professional firefighter, it\u2019s about doing something, anything, to help, and how helpfullness is well within the regular person\u2019s capabilities. On every fire, there is room for support at or near the front lines.</p><p>For anyone who thinks the stakes are too high, sorry, there are search and rescue efforts, flooding and storm responses, and even military defence exercises on land, water and air populated by untrained, semitrained and/or inexperienced people, and that\u2019s about life and death as well.</p><p>The assumption of supreme and exclusive authority also ignores the moral foundation of a democracy and flouts the Charter of Rights &amp; Freedoms. This is not an anti-government rant. On the contrary, this is about specific failings that stand out because government usually gets it mostly right, in our local-provincial-federal context. Recognition of citizens\u2019 autonomy and civil liberties is only uneven, not absent.</p><p>The Good Samaritan Act protects from legal liability those individuals who do their best to help at the scene of an emergency. So, clearly, laws can be made to cover regular people who step up when others are in need.</p><p>Our justice laws stipulate anyone can make a citizen\u2019s arrest, and the federal government maps out how to do it. It is recommended that you call the folks with badges \u201cwhenever possible\u201d not because they are empowered differently but because \u201cpolice officers are equipped with the proper intervention tools and trained to deal with incidents which may escalate to become violent.\u201d They\u2019re the pros, the federal government stipulates, but certainly you may do it, if you accept the risks. It\u2019s not instead of, it is in addition to.</p><p>You can\u2019t sue WorkSafe-BC, under Section 127 of the Workers Compensation Act. Notwithstanding the grotesque injustice of that (Are you telling me WorkSafeBC doesn\u2019t botch a file and shouldn\u2019t be accountable for it? The presence of such a law is proof that obviously they do, which obviously means the grassroots public good is being stymied in the name of the bureaucratic public good\u2026a nasty paradox), it\u2019s still proof that legislation is written expressly to cover the Crown\u2019s butt.</p><p>So, clearly, certifications and professional titles are just an excuse. Put the right legislation in place that befits the natural facts, and then get on with enabling residents to be as prepared and equipped as possible to do their own work in conjunction with government professionals. Together.</p><p>Look to the Australian government-also a nation governed by the British parliamentary system-that actually provides homeowners with information and optional training to give residents a better chance to defend their properties when bush fires sweep through. And all due respect to the heroes of our forests, Australia\u2019s wildfires are, pound for pound, spectacularly more dangerous. B.C. \u2019s forest fire scale goes to \u201cextreme\u201d but theirs goes all the way up to \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d That\u2019s a fact, not hyperbole. Homeowners there are told of the risks, but empowered to stay and defend their own property should they wish to, and many do.</p><p>Read the Government of South Australia\u2019s \u201cDuring A Bush Fire\u201d checklist on the online version of this editorial.</p><p>Will people be hurt or killed defending their property, if left to their own devices? Possibly.</p><p>Do rescuers have to endanger themselves by going in after those free-will people? No. (If someone wants to try, again, that\u2019s their free will.)</p><p>The legal and moral fact is, we have autonomy over our bodies even in death. Take, for example, organ donation. Unless we\u2019ve signed up through a specific process, our organs cannot be taken from our dead bodies to help those in need of a transplant, even if they are on the cusp of agonizing death themselves. My body\u2026my choice.</p><p>(But for goodness sake, please choose to sign up as an organ donor!) Likewise, if I am dying and need only a blood transfusion to save me, but I refuse it, that cannot be overridden by medical professionals who have many certifications that I do not have. My body\u2026my choice.</p><p>If we can legally climb mountains in any weather, sail private vessels into stormy seas, become stunt pilots as a hobby, own lethal snakes as pets, can smoke and eat candy until we rot from the inside out, then the cement is set on our abilities to stay and defend our properties from fire, flood, killer bees, zombie hordes, whatever.</p><p>Should people have to register themselves if staying to defend, despite an evacuation order? Yes.</p><p>Should anyone under 18 have to leave? Yes.</p><p>Other than that, it\u2019s my land, it\u2019s my liberty, it\u2019s my liability. Help me, get out of my way, or ideally both.</p><p>Staff writer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QUESNL-news20230830PSCA0003831081</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QUESNL2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:692F-YM81-JD2C-J0HK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438208</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1835\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

Canadian wildfires \u2014 which consumed an area roughly one-quarter the land mass of Manitoba \u2014 were by far the first choice for The Canadian Press news story of the year, as voted by editors in newsrooms across the country.</p><p>An unusually warm and dry winter in much of Canada set the stage for a wildfire season that led to 200,000 people fleeing their homes.</p><p>One of the first communities evacuated was Evansburg, a hamlet west of Edmonton, on April 29. Evacuation orders for other communities were issued in the following days.</p><p>On May 29, Nova Scotia\u2019s fires spun out of control, in a fashion that experts said was an ominous signal for the rest of Canada. \u201cIf Halifax can burn, any place can burn, and that blows all our minds,\u201d said John Vaillant, author of the award-winning \u201cFire Weather:The Making of a Beast.\u201d</p><p>A heat dome and tinder-dry forests fed the blaze on the outskirts of the Nova Scotia capital. Homeowners, startled by the rapidity of the spread, encountered traffic jams attempting to flee their neighbourhoods.</p><p>On June 8, during debate in the House of Commons, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said, \u201cCanada is burning.\u201d</p><p>And the impact was not confined within our borders. Quebec\u2019s lightning-sparked wildfires made international news as the smoke travelled south, giving Toronto among the worst air quality in the world and forcing the cancellation of Major League Baseball games as far away as Washington, D.C.Quebec\u2019s forest fire prevention agency estimated that more than 700 fires burned about 51,000 square kilometres of land, more than the province had ever recorded in a single season.</p><p>Fires also ravaged the North. About 70 per cent of the population of the Northwest Territories were at some point displaced during the wildfire season. When flames threatened Yellowknife, the capital\u2019s 20,000 residents were ordered out on Aug. 16. People waited in line at the airport for flights while others set off on marathon road trips to Alberta and other regions.</p><p>Flames came close but did not enter the city, and after three weeks, residents were allowed to return. The territorial election, less than a month away, was pushed to November.</p><p>Meanwhile, British Columbia also suffered its worst wildfire season on record, with about 400 homes destroyed and more than 2.8 million hectares burned.</p><p>Fires stoked by drought conditions and howling winds swept down late at night on West Kelowna on the shores of Okanagan Lake in mid-August, making it the centre of the unfolding emergency.</p><p>The fires caused tragic loss:six firefighters in B.C. died, including four killed in a road crash as they returned home from a two-week deployment.</p><p>And there were also stories of selflessness, including the efforts of volunteer firefighters such as Mark Zawidzki. He helped extinguish the flames approaching neighbours\u2019 houses in a Halifax suburb as his own burned a few kilometres away. \u201cI just wanted to save somebody else\u2019s house while I could,\u201d Zawidzki told The Canadian Press.</p><p>Thousands of Canadians suffered long-term economic loss, and began an exhausting odyssey of rebuilding their lives after everything from wedding photos to cars went up in flames.</p><p>\u201cTypically, wildfire season has been isolated as a British Columbia problem with spillover into Alberta. But 2023 proved wildfires are now a national problem and a harbinger of Canada\u2019s new normal,\u201d said Dawn Walton, managing editor of CTV Calgary.</p><p>\u201cWildfires will intensify as climate change increases.
